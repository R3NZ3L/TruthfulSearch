So these findings are not really at all\\r\\nsurprising. We have known about these side effects\\r\\nreally since the vaccines began rolling out at the end of 2020, early 2021.\\r\\nWe've seen this myocarditis inflammation of the heart muscle pericarditis,\\r\\ninflammation of the sac around the heart, as well as this unusual blood\\r\\nclot that forms in the brain from the virus vector vaccine.\\r\\nSo none of these findings are new, but they are actually fairly reassuring\\r\\nbecause they didn't find anything else that was that was at all alarming,\\r\\nHeidi. And it did look at a few different\\r\\nvaccine types as well. Was there any difference across them?\\r\\nThere was indeed. Yes.\\r\\nThey did see this increased risk for for the brain blood clots in in relation to\\r\\nthe AstraZeneca viral virus vector vaccine.\\r\\nAnd and also we did see the increased risk of of myocarditis and pericarditis\\r\\nwith the mRNA vaccines that are the ones made by Pfizer, Biontech and Moderna.\\r\\nThere were some other interesting findings as well.\\r\\nGuillain-Barré syndrome was shown to be a an event of concern linked to mostly\\r\\nto the Oxford AstraZeneca virus vector vaccine.\\r\\nOtherwise, everything else was pretty much as we\\r\\nhad already expected. Thinks\\r\\nso. And we've talked about some of those\\r\\npre-established conditions of interest. Did they find anything that was\\r\\npertinent across that subsection of the study?\\r\\nBeyond those 13 events that they were looking for that they didn't see, they\\r\\nweren't looking specifically for other aspects of vaccine injury.\\r\\nThat has been noted in the past. Postural orthostatic tachycardia\\r\\nsyndrome that is increase heart rate that has been noted in relation to\\r\\nvaccines. The researchers have also seen in a\\r\\nhigher frequency associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\\r\\nSo while the vaccines were known to be associated with this problem, they were\\r\\nactually occurring more frequently from an infection.\": 0.4479338842975206,\n",

But that's, you know, if you really want\\xa0\\r\\nto get cruel, that's Darwinism. Do you not know\\xa0\\xa0 they lie by now do you not. Are you not aware of\\xa0\\r\\nthe opioid crisis? You're not aware of vioxx? Not\\xa0\\xa0 aware of the very like to 25% of all FDA approved\\xa0\\r\\ndrugs that get pulled? It's one out of four and\\xa0\\xa0 you're like, really? You're an anti-vax really\\xa0\\r\\nreality. What are you, a conspiracy theorist? You\\xa0\\xa0 fool. Darwin's going to do its work with you.\\xa0\\r\\nYou're modifying your genes, you idiot. Like,\\xa0\\xa0 what are you doing? What are you doing? You're\\xa0\\r\\njust going to trust Pfizer. Well, they do support\\xa0\\xa0 Anderson Cooper. Brought to you by Pfizer.\\r\\nSpeaker 1: Oh boy. Oh my goodness. Where do\\xa0\\xa0 you even start with this? Where do you even start?\\xa0\\r\\nWith the amount of damage that is being done here?\\xa0\\xa0 You know, every single one of these claims is\\xa0\\r\\nwrong. First of all, the idea that the vaccine\\xa0\\xa0 modifies your genes. It's not true. It's been said\\xa0\\r\\nso many times. It's been explained no matter what\\xa0\\xa0 sort of medical expert you have, explain it. Some\\xa0\\r\\nof these folks just don't want to accept it or\\xa0\\xa0 believe it. He talks about the movie died suddenly\\xa0\\r\\nand the Facebook page died suddenly. That is a\\xa0\\xa0 propaganda film, widely debunked and completely\\xa0\\r\\nnon empirically based. Which features a bunch of\\xa0\\xa0 headlines that you can find on Google about people\\xa0\\r\\nthat died and then suggests this never used to\\xa0\\xa0 happen. Healthy young adults never used to die.\\xa0\\r\\nAnd it's happening now at a greater rate than it\\xa0\\xa0 used to. And it's because of the vaccine and the\\xa0\\r\\nfilm has gotten. At one point it was more than 20\\xa0\\xa0 million views. It's so hard to know because it's\\xa0\\r\\non different platforms. And yeah, tens of millions\\xa0\\xa0 of views is fair to say. And, when you look into\\xa0\\r\\nthe film, you find that, number one, the rate of\\xa0\\xa0 these, deaths hasn't increased other than by\\xa0\\r\\nthe degree to which we know people have died\\xa0\\xa0 from Covid. We also have investigated some of the\\xa0\\r\\nspecific people that died suddenly. They weren't\\xa0\\xa0 even vaccinated. So some of the people featured\\xa0\\r\\nin the film were not actually vaccinated with\\xa0\\xa0 the Covid vaccine. So total propaganda film that\\xa0\\r\\nis leading people dangerously astray. And then,\\xa0\\xa0 you know, there's always some, as Sam Harris\\xa0\\r\\nsaid to me last week in our interview or the\\xa0\\xa0 week last week, you. Sometimes these conspiracy\\xa0\\r\\ntheories have some grain of truth. And the grain\\xa0\\xa0 of truth here is pharmaceutical companies\\xa0\\r\\nhave lied and pharmaceutical companies have\\xa0\\xa0 done bad things. Joe Rogan mentions vioxx and\\xa0\\r\\nhe mentions opioids. It's really important to\\xa0\\xa0 understand that these are dramatically different\\xa0\\r\\nsorts of medications. Vioxx was an Nsaid designed\\xa0\\xa0 to treat pain and inflammation, marketed for\\xa0\\r\\nosteoarthritis and for some acute pain conditions,\\xa0\\xa0 and it was withdrawn from the market because there\\xa0\\r\\nwere concerns it would increase heart attack and\\xa0\\xa0 stroke if you used it for a long period of time.\\xa0\\r\\nOkay. The opioid crisis. Opioids are an entire\\xa0\\xa0 class of prescription pain relievers. You've got\\xa0\\r\\nyour oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine and others.\\xa0\\xa0 The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. They\\xa0\\r\\nare known for pain relieving effects, but huge\\xa0\\xa0 addiction, potential overdose. We, know about the\\xa0\\r\\nSackler family and their, deliberate, deception\\xa0\\xa0 when it comes to clinical trials, side effects\\xa0\\r\\nand risk for addiction, etc.. Vaccines are meant\\xa0\\xa0 to help the body generate immunity without getting\\xa0\\r\\nthe disease. That's the idea. And vaccines are one\\xa0\\xa0 of the most effective ways to prevent diseases,\\xa0\\r\\nincluding diseases that can cause death, as well\\xa0\\xa0 as diseases that are that are less likely to cause\\xa0\\r\\ndeath. So when you look at the risk profiles with\\xa0\\xa0 vioxx, the risk was related to cardiovascular\\xa0\\r\\nevents, and it was significant enough to say,\\xa0\\xa0 we've got to withdraw this from the market. With\\xa0\\r\\nopioids, you've got addiction risk, dependency,\\xa0\\xa0 overdose, death risk. These are significant, and\\xa0\\r\\nit has generated a public health crisis. Vaccines\\xa0\\xa0 are low risk. Most side effects are extremely\\xa0\\r\\nmild and temporary. Even the more rare serious\\xa0\\xa0 side effects almost always resolve on their\\xa0\\r\\nown. When we've talked about the myocarditis,\\xa0\\xa0 pericarditis, and do you sometimes get a serious\\xa0\\r\\nadverse event? Are there a few people that have\\xa0\\xa0 died from serious vaccine side effects? From\\xa0\\r\\njust about any vaccine? Yes. But the point is,\\xa0\\xa0 you don't suspend an incredibly successful\\xa0\\r\\nand effective public health campaign because\\xa0\\xa0 any intervention can have these extremely rare\\xa0\\r\\nside effects. You look at opioids and vioxx,\\xa0\\xa0 it's a completely different, situation. So anyway,\\xa0\\r\\nthe vioxx opioid comparisons are just absurd. It's\\xa0\\xa0 really sad to see Rogan go in this direction.\\xa0\\r\\nAnd, you know, I don't know who people write to\\xa0\\xa0 me. They go, David, you know, if only he would\\xa0\\r\\nallow you back on, you could set them straight.\\xa0\\xa0 First of all, it's not about setting people\\xa0\\r\\nstraight.

       " \" [Music] have we learned nothing from the Corona virus pandemic new reporting suggests Chinese Laboratories just can't help themselves according to Daily Mail Chinese scientists have reportedly developed a mutant coronavirus strain that attacks the brain and has a 100% kill rate in mice worse they admit there's a risk it could spill over to humans the virus is a modified version of a Str found in Pengalin and was tested on mice expressing a protein found in humans to test that the disease might impact people reportedly all mice infected with the virus died between 7 and 8 days after being infected with symptoms including their eyes turning completely white rapid weight loss and fatigue researchers additionally found significant viral load in the mice's brains lungs noses eyes and wind pipes while the potential for a new pandemic could be rising here at home pandemic prev measures have done a full 180 Oakland's new covid policy is allowing even students who test positive for the Corona virus to attend classes as long as a child is asymptomatic they can go to school though they are encouraged to wear a mask here to discuss cor the Corona virus and this potential new mystery disease out of China is Alina Chan scientific adviser at the broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and co-author of viral to search for the origins of covid-19 welcome back to Rising Alina thank for having me so if it is possible to uh to calm us down to make our us less fearful please do so but I I know you'll be as honest and blunt as necessary what is this is this study not somehow not as bad as it seems what's going on yes the the wording in this study is a bit unfortunate because the pandemic virus SAS Co 2 also causes 100% of humaniz mice to to die so it it's not clear based on this new letter whether or not the the Pengalin virus is is more concerning than the pandemic virus but it is yet another example where the public is only learning about risky virus research once it once it is done once it is done and published that's when the public finds out so people don't don't get to find out before the work is done that is apparently no consultation and what this means is that if these viruses had not been published and if they unfortunately leaked from a lab there would be no way for the public to tell if this was from nature or if it came from a lab if it had been Genetically Enhanced so this is a real concern for for the world what do we know about the safety protocol in effect at the lab where this study was done as I understand it a big part of the negligence with respect to covid-19 was that the kind of equipment being used at the lab was insufficient for the uh virality of the um the virus that was being created so just to clarify this this wasn't the uhan lab this was a separate lamp in the different part of China uh but typically these types of viruses had been handled at pretty low bios safety at bsl2 so at this level there's almost no tracking of lab escapes so if you had been infected by a virus like SAS k 2 that has only mouth symptoms there's no way you would have caught that and traced it back to the lab and had an investigation so uh this this letter that came out about the pangalan virus actually did not state at what level bio safety the experiments were done so it could have been low it could have been high there's no way to tell so I think this is yet another reminder that we can't let scientists self-regulate on these sort of experiments you know because the the benefits are unclear of the study but the risk are real so the risk could impact billions of people around the world so a scientist might act on a dangerous idea at inappropriate bios safety and unfortunately billions of people pay the price so this is yet another reminder that we can't just let scientists do whatever they want and uh as a reminder for viewers uh the difference uh in the kind of lab safety protocols between the US and some labs in China what has actually been revealed to be uh a a selling has been a selling point for doing the research um you we we've covered on the show from us right to know doing this reporting showing that some of the one of the grants um that uh that Eco Health Alliance was trying to get you know specifically was was persuading the the oversight officials that it would be done the research would be done in the US but there's that note where they're saying but once we get it approved we can actually do it in China where there's less to worry about in terms of oversight yes so the the jump in cost is is is very dramatic between a low bios safety level to a higher bios safety level it can mean millions of dollars of difference and and also in Personnel training so for unfortunately a lot of research programs nowadays uh trying to do as much as possible with as little money as possible so some sometimes this means that bios safety costs are cut so people make estimates of how risky is this work can I get away with doing at the bio lower bios safety level and I think that after the pandemic happen clearly this is no longer acceptable I think most biologists even would look at this and think no we we can't be cutting cost on biosafety yeah most most virologists and probably like I I haven't taken a poll but I bet 80 90% of people read a headline like this uh that this experiment was done is say what we're still doing this kind of thing and and we're not doing it under the you know the be one thing to do it in Antarctica or on the moon or something but we're just we're doing this in the the same kind of potentially at least the same kind of circumstances yes that's right so these Lads no matter what the BIOS safety level is they tend to be located right smack in the middle of a city so if a scientist unfortunately gets exposed to a virus gets infected he doesn't even know that they've been infected they walk out to like the nearest Starbucks or something and boom like the whole city is infected within like a month or two right so this this could have been what happened in uhan in 2019 unfortunately is that working with these viruses with unknown pandemic potential you don't know what symptoms they cause you don't work with them at the highest bios safety level and there's no way to track incidents of exposure and someone just walks out in the middle of the city and boom you know all the hospitals the local market the train stations that just covered in virus so I I think that we we can't keep having coming back to this ation every time there's a new concerning paper there should be more proactive action being taken to to increase oversight globally on this type of research can you speak to what kind of oversight mechanisms are possible here the article references Chinese scientists are they Chinese scientists under the opes of the Chinese government are they American Affiliated scientists in a lab uh the way we had with the last pandemic and what are the implications with respect to oversight if it's one or the other So currently I think I think that the norm is that each institute decides for themselves really what what is what is appropriate or not and they also self-govern their own bios safety levels so there there's some responsibility to tell the funders so people who give them money to do this work what the safety level is but at the end of the day there's no mechanism to enforce like handing over all your lab records and biosafety incident records should an accident happened so I to say that unfortunately it it is kind of like the Wild West so this is what some of the top research funding agency leaders in the UK and US said that it it is like the wild west you don't know what's happening you don't know what biosafety level at V this work is happening you only find out later when there might have been a potential mishap Lena Chan thank you so much for joining us I remain very

John as always now Robert Clans is well known to the the channel he's a consultant physician a professor of immunology and holds qualifications in Medicine Science and pathology and is a holder of the Australia medal so great to great to have him back now you've been doing quite a lot of work recent L Robert on uh long Co and I think we should say that one of the big advantages of being shall we say at our stages in later stages in our careers is you don't have to worry about publication so much so quite a lot of what we're going to talk about now is fairly original work so thank you for sharing that with us so we want to talk about um post vaccine and post infection long covid um now both of these syndromes you you you've been seeing you've been seeing patients with these can you just tell us roughly roughly roughly what you see patients with long covid patients with long covid vaccine injury what are what are you seeing well I think the first point uh John is that uh there's no great mystery to to these conditions uh what happened was with the infection uh initially people were seeing ongoing symptoms and came up with a diagnosis that was vague and confusing and it was called long coov now long coov was anybody who had symptoms following Co infection that persisted for more than 3 months and the confusion for this is that it it included a number of different problems and every patient had a different mix of these problems and so uh for people who uh were working outside of say Immunology and related um related disciplines it it was incredibly difficult but to simplify there there are basically two different components uh it's been known really since the late 1800s that people who get particular infections uh have a chance of getting a persistent fatigue illness that follows it and that's quite it's nothing different about Co and so the essential component of long Co is what is essentially post viral infection fatigue and it has two Central components the first is what I call Energy activated fatigue which means that if you do something uh then you pay for it you get more fatigue and the way I discuss that with patients is I talk about a ceiling I say we've all got a ceiling and uh in people with post viral fatigue syndrome long Co that ceiling comes down and if you try to push yourself with energy then you hit that ceiling that ceiling pays you back and you suffer for hours or days with of increased fatigue uh and um Associated characteristics the the second character the second feature of this uh chronic inflammatory state is cognitive defects and most people don't say I've got a cognitive defect they say I've got brain fog and uh it comes in many different forms I always have I had a I worked at McMaster University in Canada for some years and set up the Immunology Department there and I I remember I had this wonderful patient uh who was always late for appointments and um I once said why is it that you're always late you know I'm seeing you at the end of the clinic when you're actually supposed to be here 2 hours ago she said well it's it's part of my my problem I stand at the bus stop and I see the bus coming along and it says mcmas University and by the time it's sort of registered the bus is gone and I've got to wait for the next one and so there are all sorts of variations I had other patients who were Math teachers who had to give up because they they couldn't sit and look at the board and do simple mathematics so brain fog is a terribly a terribly incapacitating problem but when we came to Long co uh patients had these symptoms but they had other sets of symptoms which were more structural damage and so while in classic chronic fatigue illnesses you don't have so much in the way of structural damage to tissues the brain the heart in Long Co you did and that's because uh if you look at the underpinning cause of all of these it's the antigen is persistent uh in classic chronic fatigue it's commonly not always but commonly the epstar bar virus which is the virus in my country we call glandular fever I'm not sure what you call in in England is it glandular fever or infe nucleo well the Americans like yeah we would say glandular fever or if you're feeling a bit more correct infectious mononucleosis yeah there's a lot of confusion of but there's no question that a number of patients will have that incarcerated into their cells and under various stresses uh the virus escapes and you get fatigue illness maybe a sore throat big lymph nodes uh things like that and so we've known a lot about that but long um long Co and the patients had damage to their peripheral nerves often uh small fiber neuropathy with burning feet burning legs uh major problems in the brain uh cardiac issues a whole range of structural abnormalities and they got all thrown in together and you can understand the the confusion of people saying well how do I sort this out you know there's no obvious treatment um what's going on here and that's the way I know it's interesting I knowing that we were going to talk today I I just printed out uh the latest paper that I found on cause of um long Co which came out just last month and um it's a very interesting paper because it's full of detail but not full of message and it's whole list of different things that people see without saying wait a second what's the big picture here what's really going on and unless you approach it in that way you can't really really help the patient because the patient wants to understand what's going on and wants to have some logic in terms of what they can do about it uh and I I think that's where an immunologist basically looks after these patients I mean people with chronic fatigue illness have usually fallen into the basket of clinical Immunology because um most people who work in vertical systems like chest or heart or lung or brain um look at a particular disease in that system whereas immunologists look at a mechanism across the different systems and so we try to understand a process that's going on in a a person with autoimmune disease chronic fatigue illness various conditions like that and then address the diagnosis uh in that form uh look at tests that might help understand that process and medications or processes that can help uh the patient with those issues so I I think that's the broad sort of difference that underpins this now so that was chronic that was chronic fatigue in the context of um of U the covid infection and then more recently people are saying wait a second I'm seeing people uh who have had vaccination who have never had uh uh uh Co and these people are developing very similar symptoms uh and I I see in I don't see a lot of patients these days but I certainly see a number and I I have a number of patients who have uh had vaccines never had Co um but they've got essentially long Co syndromes and again it's a mixture of classic um energy activated fatigue brain fog together with certain structural problems uh so and the reason that it's very similar is that the persistent antigen is the same antigen it's Spike protein so you're getting Spike protein from the infection Co and that can persist at least 12 months maybe a lot longer in some of these patients whereas uh with vaccine we know that the spike protein the messenger RNA vaccine that is given uh disseminates through the body uh it provides expression of the spike protein on potentially any cell in the body and that can go on for months or year at least a year and remember the these are new syndromes we we didn't know about them until the the last couple of years so we don't know how long these conditions go but the bottom line is that there's the same cause for the Post vaccine long Co if you like and the post infection long Co and this is incredibly important to understand and sadly it is not understood very widely because if you go and have I've got a patient at the moment who had uh postvaccine uh long Co and then got Co infection and of course um people said who dear me all those terrible symptoms you've got of long they've got worse um we thought if you'd had a vaccine you'd get um much less problem with with with Co but of course uh it's a totally different situation when you're looking at a small proportion of people who get postvaccine long Co to the average person who might get uh a a vaccine which reduces the intensity of covid and therefore is linked to a degree of less chance of getting severe long Co disease and so there's this commonality of persistent antigen that underpins both those conditions and we need to understand that if we're going to apply effective management strategies it's it's really quite hard to understand this so when someone's vaccinated if they get this long vaccine covid situation instead of producing the antigen for a few hours they're producing the antigen chronically over o over a year or or more um what what is what is happening there how can the vaccine which is a single dose go on and produce Spike protein for a year or more well I think that's that's the big question isn't it and the answer is fairly straightforward that if you have a messenger RNA vaccine that messenger RNA we know um in the way in which it's packaged and presented will go throughout the body and can uh be taken up into essentially any cell in the body now when it does that it the messenger RNA uh expresses through the ribosomal system in the cell the factory for proteins it it it expresses Spike protein which is represented on the surface of the cell and can be detected in blood uh for a length of time now when it's expressed on the uh length of um uh on on the cell surface uh in most people it's probably only a relatively short period of time but in some people in fact a significant number of people they'll express it for a long period of time and they get an immune response because that remember that's what you're trying to to do with messenger RNA vaccine you're trying to stimulate an immune response but what uh was not understood and and sadly had not been properly tested right at the beginning uh was that this antigen um Can persist for a long period of time and be the focus of a self-destructive immune response very similar to autoimmune disease and that's exactly what's causing one of the two main causes of the structural damage I'm talking about remember I I said you get a chronic inflammatory situation due to the Persistence of the antigen and an ineffective immune response that's not clearing it which leads to lowlevel inflammation which leads to the exercise induced fatigue and the brain fog but now you can also Express this antigen uh as a foreign antigen on the cell surface and that's destroyed by t-lymphocytes as that's the job of the T it's not supposed to do that because it's someone's injected messenger RNA into you uh and so you get structural damage uh one of the commonest ones I see are people with um small fiber neuropathy um which is terribly disconcerting uh Burning uh feet uh disbalance um neurological issues flare up of demyelinating diseases uh cardiac issues uh all of these structural damages and they're different in every person which makes understanding and analyzing postco either postco syndrome extremely complicated and extremely difficult I mean it's it's probably getting into the pathophysiology a bit but if you're going to go on produce producing Spike protein for a year after vaccine do you think that means that the RNA has somehow gone into the DNA and there's an ongoing process of transcription here I think there are probably two ways of answering that firstly I don't think there's any doubt that you can reverse transcribe into DNA that's been shown in human cells uh at least to my knowledge on three occasions um and and that is a worry in its own and quite different to the problems we're talking about here uh that's looking at how I can change DNA expression in the individual uh it ra it raises all the questions of um um Progressive and expanded cancer uh it looks at transgenerational defects if it gets into the germline cells uh so that's that's a different issue here we're talking about messenger RNA without necessarily going to DNA just working doing what messenger RNA does and that's code for the amino acid sequence in a protein on the ribosomal Factory in the cell and so you're making all a spike protein don't need the DNA for that uh you've got the the DNA normally makes messenger RNA but we're actually giving messenger RNA so we're we're we're adding to to to the pool and so you've got all these cells making Spike protein for God only knows how long uh we don't know how long a long time and um that's creating uh and one of the factors that conditions a very important factor because not everyone gets postco not everyone gets fatigued uh it would seem that there is a subset of people who are more prone to develop um persistent nonresolved antigen in other words the messenger RNA keeps producing antigen and the body's immune response doesn't effectively clear it um if we had a lot of time I could run through the the the background information for this but let me just summarize and say in my view about 20% of people are fatigue prone uh there's a phenotype um you know you look at kids who go to university and say how many of you you uh have ever had fatigue at the time of exams and whatever bit of a sore throat about 20% will say that about 20% of athletes um get uh um essentially overtraining syndrome which is a a form of chronic fatigue it's a form that most people with chronic fatigue would love to have means they just drop their their time for 100 yards by 0. one of a second but it gets them out of the final um but but it is a very good model system that we we looked at very closely some years back the uh so you've got this situation where is a a group of people who appear to be prone and they're the ones who will get postvaccine fatigue and probably the the ones who have got the persistent formation of um the spike protein and get um long coed with both the fatigue and the structural uh defect problem using different mechanisms totally different mechanisms for the two so it sounds like we've got two mechanisms going on well the main mechanism whether it's long Co or postvaccine long Co is Persistence of the spike protein the spike protein is still produced for whatever reason whether it's long covid or postvaccine injury chronically being produced sometimes the features are as as a result of specific tissue damage because the tea cells are beaten up these cells would You're expect ing the spike protein wherever that is and of course we know that can be anywhere in the body now because the vaccine is systemically distributed so we've got the tissue damage but we've also got the ongoing inflammatory effects the the effects of the chronic inflammation that we're seeing as long covid or long postvaccine long covid that's are they the two sort of main causes of the clinical features exactly but keep in mind there is one underpinning common denominator and that is persistent antigen production which is a feature of all the chronic fatigue illnesses going back to influenza and all the other issues that that we um and this may this is just my view might I often turn out to be wrong but it's my view is that there's a phenotypic um uh uh proness if you like to developing uh fatigue illness when they're stressed with and they're more likely for some reason to get a persistent antigen because they have uh a less effective immune response than other people so most chronic fatigue syndromes can be explained in terms of the ongoing Persistence of some virus presumably mostly a virus causing these these chronic features so in theory if you could like wave of magic wand and eradicate all the virus from the body the patient would get better apart from the pathology that's caused by the tissue damage the irreversible tissue damage that's absolutely right and in fact um um when we were dealing with the uh Institute of sport in Australia with the elite swimmers uh you might remember they they win gold medals uh but some of them didn't and um uh we found that what was happening uh at the time the stress of international competition is in a number of these people start excreting epara virus in their throat so normally it's contained by a wall of tea cells and under the stress in the people who have got a partial immune deficiency so they've got a predisposition of not having a really effective immune response when they're expressed and people with long Co will say the same where under psychological or physical stress um I get worse and um we looked at this very carefully with the elite swimmers and we were able to uh completely obliterate that expression of epstar bar virus coming out in a condition which used to be called overtraining syndrome by doing one of two things uh the first is we we actually treated them with highly potent antivirals and prevented this and maintained their swimming capacity uh or we identified that the main precipitating factor was a particular type of physical stress which was um high high energy training and so we changed their training program and the Olympics uh in 2000 uh every Australian Elite swimmer swam to their predicted best which had never been before and it gave our physiology colleagues a very good jobs for the English Olympics which came next because the English wanted to know why our swimmers were doing so well uh and partly was because they didn't get subjected to uh fatigue induced impaired performance um by changing their training program so all of these issues um come together with this Persistence of of antigen and control of that antigen uh epstar virus as you know gets integrated into the DNA of cells uh and it should stay there and the tea cells are critical for that uh with Spike protein uh they should never it should never uh be expressed systemically and should never um have a persistence uh of expression but in some people of course it is and they're the ones prone to developing these fatigue illnesses so you're going to be getting in and dat with the emails from Olympic committees from around the world now Robert asking for your assistance I'm sure I'm sure about that all that work's been published a couple of years back and and sadly our competitors know about it so um so this means that basically everyone has been exposed to Epstein bar virus just that some people managed to eliminate it and some people don't exactly uh 80% of people um with the the athletes uh was pretty much 95% of the athletes uh had been exposed had Mar a IG antibody and this is the interesting thing that the the people who um have glandula have the epstar bar virus uh and who are prone to getting fatigue never quite make the right sort of te- cell response and I I'll give you two quick examples and these relate exactly to the situation in uh that I'm certainly seeing and has recently been published to some extent uh with long Co um if you look at antibody production the antibodies are made by a cell given the very imaginative title of a a b cell a b lymphocyte requires T lymphocytes to help them so we have these helper tea cells now it appears that there's a defect in the tea helper cells in people with long Co and this has been identified in different studies and certainly exact L the same in people with other chronic fatigue illnesses and the way the te cell deficiency expresses itself is that the B cell has markers of not working as well as it should now if you get a virus infection you make what's called an IGM antibody the IGM antibody is the first antibody but it's not a particularly High Affinity good effective antibody and so what the body does it replaces it with an IGG antibody so you go from IGM to ig now uh which is a much higher Affinity antibody and you make different subclasses of IGG and there's four sub IGG 1 2 3 and four now two things I noticed over the years looking after literally hundreds of people with chronic fatigue illnesses is that number one many of these patients never switch from the IGM to the IG anybody and so when you do a routine epstar bar virus in antibody and every Doctor Who who's watching this will know you look for IGM antibody because that tells you you've got a current infection you've just got the infection and suddenly and I I used to get a phone call every couple of weeks from General Practitioners that I work with saying hey this is confusing I got a patient who's got IGM and IG antibodies and they've had them for weeks and months and of course these are the people who have got ongoing chronic fatigue and they're not actually eliminating or controlling their epstar bar virus by virtue of the fact they're not making a particularly effective immune response and the response defect goes back to the te- cell because it's not helping the B efficient effective IGG response and so when you do a routine test the IGM which should tell you it's a recent infection but it's not it's been there for weeks or years and an IG and and the second and this is really interesting because only just a month or so ago uh this was found for long Co that in people with chronic fatigue syndrome one of the things that uh we noticed uh in our Clinic was that a number of these patients have IGG subclass deficiency particularly an igg2 subclass and it didn't initially it didn't make much sense and I started seeing both the IGM IGG confusion plus the IGG subclass deficiency both of which depend on good te cells working um now different subclasses have different jobs and so ig2 has a particular job and if it's very low then you've got a defective antibody response by virtual of this so what a wonderful study I saw I think it was about a month ago John um where they looked at IGG subclasses in Long Co and lo and behold there's a highly significant reduction across the long Co something that's never really been done for chronic fatigue syndrome uh the classics um significantly lower igg2 so exactly the same things is occurring in Long Co which brings all of these chronic fatigue illnesses collect ly together so moving on to the sort of um management strategies that we going to use Robert I mean I mean the question is of course what the heck do we do we do about this so um do we need to promote a more effective immunity within the respiratory tract and how would we do that well uh I don't have all the answers no one has all the answers but I I think that if you understand the process that's going on you can see some sense in going forward now I can run through there there are five things that that uh I do with with my my patients uh or I I'm thinking about uh the first is that we we we've developed the idea and I I've talked briefly about this with you before of what I call immune resilience and that is um and I think in the context we discussed it before I said why is it 99% of people who get long co uh inconvenience for a few days they feel a little sick a fever sore throat and then they get better whether you treat them or not but 1 or 2% get very sick H and some may die and yet you look at that Collective group and of course there are predisposing factors for getting very sick but many of them are just like you and me uh that we all look the same we think we're the same and yet we handle the virus differently and this has been an area that my group's been interested in for a long period of time and um we developed the idea that there's a thing called immune resilience and that there are ways of Shifting that immune resilience so that that 1% behaves like the 99% now that that's something that that that my own we've been certainly working on and uh not available yet but but I I think is the way one of the ways to go in the future so in other words people who uh get uh Airway infections uh handle it more effectively and don't run into the complications which obviously include long Co because of a defective immune response so I I think that's uh for the soon future not not a long term uh the second is to understand the process as being persistent antigen uh now the spike protein um is I think without our question the persistent antig both these cases uh and this is a practical area uh and there are two approaches currently uh being used um uh our friends and colleagues in America uh have developed various enzyme packages uh based on ninas which is a long St very interesting um uh orally uh an ingested enzyme that has specificity for Spike protein and I know studies are being done uh in uh in America uh using these um substances uh and we're really looking for forward to seeing uh how how they come out uh the second thing you can do about the expression of Spike protein is blocking its effect um really really exciting work has come out in the last few months about how icton works and there's a complete relook now at iaon uh about time I may add but um and I think I think one of the things that's bridged from the The Narrative that that was very unkind to iaon and the reality of science is the demonstration by uh a combination French and American groups showing that ican blocks the uh blocks Spike protein so it blocks the spike protein getting into the cell and it blocks it aggregating red cells which is the reason that you get low oxygen tension uh low oxygen saturation in patients who get significant co uh and I I was on one of the three papers that that showed that it was amazing within 24 hours of taking icton oxygen desaturation reversed now that's not suppressing inflammation and now by virtue of these studies it's shown that uh you disaggregate the cells and so the oxygen can return very quickly now I've been treating some of my own patients with moderately high dose of ivaan for a month I think I've treated five or six and every one of those has improved now that doesn't mean a thing it's not a randomized control trial uh it's it's it's what I call clinical medicine you you look uh at at a problem you say this is a process uh what logically can be done now it's not necessarily going to change all the structural damage that's been done but certainly there's been some improvement not not necessarily dramatic Improvement some improvement uh in a month or so of taking icton I I think what really is needed is people who um have access to um academic uh um academic situations where they can study and do these a randomized control of icton in Long Co properly done uh would be the most important thing that can happen uh in in Long Co um the third thing that um that I think is really really interesting in Long Co is that uh and particularly a couple Chinese groups have been promoting this and that is that people who get long Co get a disturbance of the microbiome in the bow now you might say how on Earth can that relate to something that's going on in the airway well um I was lucky enough years ago to work with John benstock in Canada uh who came up with the idea of the common mucosal system which has been underpinning my work over many years uh in humans and uh it it's just suddenly I realized that all our focus on this common mucosal system was the immune expression not the microbial drive and when you think that the the architecture of this common system that expresses control over all the different mucosal surfaces of the body the architecture involves sensor systems all the way down the gut not just the small bow with pair patches but all sorts of little patches with specialized M cells they're called over them that allows bacteria to come in and so I I think the important thing to understand here is that the commonality of mucosal immunology and expression involves the microbiomes at the different sites and so uh what happens uh in the airway by swallowing and affecting P patches can distort the microbiome in the gut and the microbiome in the gut can equally influence what's going on in the airway and I'll just give you one exciting um observation and that is a group was looking at uh in mice they were looking at csel pneumoni which is a nasty bacteria that causes pneumonia and they couldn't understand why on Earth when they gave pneumonia to the mouse by putting the the bug in the airway their microbiome changed uh this is in the gut and of course um the reason is this commonality this communication system that's so effective so what they found was and this is exactly what was found in the patients with long Co a particular type of bacteria was depressed and these bacteria well bacteria that produce short chain fatty acids butyric acid um acetic acid propionic acid those three main one two and three um carbon short chain fatty acids um now the people working with the mice and ciella said well what happens if we um reduce these bacteria uh in the gut then the the main product from the bacteria uh is things like butc acid and so they measured butc acid and found it was very low so very sens they just started feeding butc acid to these these mice and the eclips and pneumoni became much much uh improved uh didn't completely cure them but it certainly improved showing there was this connection between the two so you have two ways in which the microbiome can change the expression of any form of chronic fatigue one is by metabolic transfer of of receptors of um molecules that can move around through the blood seam and secondly by changing the cell Delivery Systems through the aggregated infid issue of P patches um sequel patches and the various ones in the column so that to me is very exciting and again if you can bear with me for 20 seconds I I'll I'll give you a very very important example many years ago Tom Baro who was the guy who discovered the uh the treatment for peptic ERS to which eradicated them uh he also was the person who um really developed the idea of feal microbiome transplants by changing the microbiome by washing you out and giving you some healthy ones um Tom Tom is uh quite extraordinary um he Tom treated patients who came to him with fatigue and non-specific gut symptoms and was surprised to find not only did the gut symptoms improve with this fmt but so did the fatigue now uh no one quite believed it so he went back 10 years later 10 years later and found something like 60% of the patients and most of those patients still had a resolution of their symptoms including their fatigue now you don't see that in chronic fatigue illnesses in other words by having a specific intervention there was some resetting of the system which we don't understand very well and so um I'm I I do a clinic in in in Tom's practice uh and uh he was is my PhD student and um he Tom uh I'm I'm actually if he's watching this or I'm going to send him an email Tom uh you've got to go back and start looking at uh how we can manipulate the microbiome and have outcomes in Long Co um so um I I think the the next thing that I think is really important so we there are the three things that I think are really important the next thing is don't feed the syndrome don't keep giving people vac who have got long Co syndrome because um you look at the literature and I I just did a review for a journal last week on a metaanalysis of all the studies done on vaccination and and long Co and it blew me away I mean it was a very well done study and and 20 there was a 20% reduction of long covid in people who have been vaccinated but I looked at the number of people was 1 million if you're looking at probably a 100,000 or a couple hundred, thousand people they get lost in they're very different they're the people who have got a fatigue illness maybe phenotype that have develop this uh in the context of the vaccine and you give them more vaccine or they get Co and they get worse this is a concept that I find nobody really or or most people have great trouble grasping I just noticed this morning while I was waiting to hear from you John that Peter McCulla wrote one of his um uh reviews and it was making exactly the same point you know you don't vaccinate people with chronic fatigue syndrome you're just putting petrol on the fire and of course yeah the final thing is you address the issues the person has um uh I noticed that some of my colleagues say a lot of these people have got in the morning uh you can't work you lose your job you're broke um you're going to have a touch of reactive depression and anxiety and um it's not that they have a primary mental health problem they've got serious responses mental health responses of a normal type to a uh to a very uh incapacitating problem so that's that's our approach anyway to uh to chronic fatigue illnesses excellent updates and uh we'll um certainly keep an eye on this one but I I think gives us real cause for for Hope here Robert that there is potential ways ahead for people that are suffering in this way yeah but for now thank you very much as always okay\": 0.4445080683951658,\n",
       " \" but we are actually going to dive straight in with our main story tonight which concerns the covid vaccines the end result of the world's greatest scientists working around the clock to save countless lives immortalized in a card we'll all definitely lose in a month vitally important but also too big to fit in any standard wallet way to fumble at the one yard line science and look not that we needed it but this week saw yet another reminder of just how dangerous kovid is with cases in india in particular surging at a truly terrifying rate india set a world record for daily covert cases of over 400 000 and that is probably an undercount and obviously the world should be doing everything it can to help india right now but our best way out of this mess long term is clearly vaccines and it's worth remembering we in the us are incredibly fortunate we currently have access to a lot of vaccines and more than half of u.s adults have now gotten at least one dose which is great the bad news is some vaccination locations have already gone from having not enough supply to not enough demand according to the cdc the daily average for vaccinations has dropped 20 percent since the start of the month a worrying trend vaccine demand declining in south carolina some providers left with extra doses and appointments for wide open palm beach county health care district says it is now facing 10 000 appointments for the county's vaccine sites remain unfilled since they opened this week appointments are going unfilled we've got thousands of appointments available over the next few weeks and no takers at this point it's true a worrying amount of people are holding off on getting the free covered vaccine and i'm not saying that you should immediately get something just because it's free i wouldn't recommend getting these old dolls on craigslist just because they're free they're weird broken and they will kill you in your sleep but these vaccines could save not just your life but the lives of people around you and it's genuinely dispiriting that just a few months into the vaccine rollout we are already at this point and the problem is for the coronavirus the herd immunity threshold is thought to be between 70 and 90 of the population but a survey found that while 60 of american adults have got or want to get the vaccine another 18 say maybe and 22 say no and if you're thinking well hold on if every maybe gets the vaccine that still puts us at 78 unfortunately that poll doesn't take into account children who were not vaccinating right now and who make up around 22 of the population so we need to get the vaccine into as many adults as possible as soon as possible and that means you really need to get vaccinated and obviously i mean the collective you but also you mike mike in baltimore i know you've got this on in the background at work on monday so listen to me schedule your vaccine mike don't say you're gonna look into it later just google vaccine finder baltimore it takes seconds here are a list of vaccine sites in your area and if you're thinking yeah i'm not sure i need it joe rogan says i'm probably fine look it is true you might not get seriously sick from covid or indeed sick at all but you could still inadvertently pass it to someone who could then die and before you say well vulnerable people should just get vaccinated then the vaccines are only 95 effective mike so they'll probably be okay but maybe not also the more the virus circulates the likely we'll see mutations that make it more dangerous possibly helping it to evade the vaccine completely putting us all the way back to square one so get the vaccine mike the point is there is a problematic amount of vaccine hesitancy right now even among people who you would really like to think would not need convincing we met robert gannon before he went in to visit his 77 year old mother kia who was on a ventilator right now in the icu due to coven had she been vaccinated she was not vaccinated i think she was being hesitant just wanting to see how things played out have you been vaccinated i have not what would it take for you to get vaccinated um i'd want to make sure that it's safe wow there is perhaps no clearer sign of just how deep vaccine hesitancy runs than someone in that guy's position still questioning whether to get it instead of asking is there such a thing as too much vaccine because if not i'm going to keep going back for injections until i'm around 80 percent pfizer so given all of that tonight let's talk about the covid vaccines why people are hesitant what their worries are and how they might be reassured and let's start with the fact you can't characterize any one group as uniformly vaccine hesitant no demographic is a monolith every group will have some who are excited and others who are anxious and different groups will be anxious for different reasons for instance early on you probably heard a lot about hesitancy among some black americans which can be a real thing even this pediatrician had reservations when the vaccine was first made available to both of you did you both jump at the chance to get it no no i mean not me anyway i am black first in this country and that has with it a lot of baggage to tell you the truth and so then my public health degree the culminating experience that i did was related to the the relationship between black people and physicians and that relationship has been a cantankerous one and so those are the kinds of things that are deeply embedded and challenging to overcome even within someone who's a scientist honestly i do understand that we've talked before on this show about the fraught relationship black americans have with healthcare based on both current bad experiences and the history of incidents like the tuskegee experiment where doctors lied to black men allowing them to suffer from untreated syphilis over decades or as most u.s history students would describe it something i have not heard of although it does feel important to mention that that doctor did wind up getting the vaccine and in general black vaccine hesitancy has dropped fast another group you might have heard have high hesitancy rates are republicans and that is also true around 30 percent of republicans say they won't get it and it's not hard to see why because fears and doubts about the vaccine have flown around conservative media with one of the most prominent super spreaders being this guy what about this vaccine why are americans being discouraged from asking simple straightforward questions about it questions like how effective are these drugs are they safe do you need a reason to turn on the vaccine and what happens if you do turn it down would you be allowed to fly on airplanes or go to work or enter the front doors of madison square garden oh now they're telling us the vaccine has a delayed response okay delayed by how long they don't say if vaccines work why are vaccinated people still banned from living normal lives honestly what's the answer to that so maybe it doesn't work and they're simply not telling you that well you hate to think that especially if you've gotten two shots but what's the other potential explanation okay it is genuinely weird to see someone hosting a show on a supposed news network and ending every sentence with a question mark especially when answers to most of those questions are out there for anyone who cares to know so for instance that last complaint that the cdc still recommends wearing masks indoors when around vulnerable unvaccinated people does not mean the vaccine doesn't work clinical trials found that the vaccines are spectacularly successful at preventing people from getting serious disease as for whether they protect you from spreading the virus the trials weren't designed to assess that but evidence so far indicates that they drastically reduce transmission the reason we still see mask and distancing recommendations is that the cdc is being cautious and wants to be sure that it is not spreading around during a global pandemic like a frozen dinner duke with a tv show anyway i hope that answers at least one of your gaped mouthed bad faith wonderings tucker you scrunch-faced fear baboon and the problem is when people like tucker raise questions without bothering to answer them there is a lot of misinformation out there for people to then stumble on anti-vaccine groups have been waiting for a moment like this to spread doubt and the scary thing is they don't actually need to convince people they're right they just need to convince people that no one is and that tracks with recent polling while few believe specific myths about the vaccine larger numbers say that they didn't know whether particular myths were true or false for instance only four percent of people believe the covet vaccine is more deadly than the disease but 25 percent say they don't know and that is not good because if anti-vaxxers can simply spread enough misinformation to cause people to throw up their hands and say i just don't know enough to get the shot they have already seriously things up for all of us and to be clear most people who are hesitant are not fanatics or conspiracy theorists many are just trying to make the best decision for themselves and their family like that pediatrician that we saw earlier you definitely know people like that in your life so i'm actually going to spend the rest of this piece trying to clear up some of the biggest myths flying around and some are pretty easy to debunk quickly like the claims that bill gates is using the vaccine to put a microchip in all of us something his wife had this response to i know my husband is not vaccinating people and putting a microchip in her arm because that technology doesn't even exist and he's never uttered the words out of his mouth so okay that wasn't the reassuring push back to a batshit conspiracy theory that i had hoped for to be honest we're not microchipping people because the technology doesn't exist yet and my husband hasn't said it out loud to me why would you put it like that there are lots of things a husband won't say out loud to his wife not dark things just things quiet thoughts a partner might not be ready to hear like how sometimes late at night i think wouldn't it be nice to live in an egg an egg to be in not just an oval-shaped sleeping pot i can get an oval-shaped sleeping pod nobody wants one of those i mean an egg a big egg with me in it or maybe a normal egg and i'm small it doesn't matter what matters is i'm in an egg not alone i'm with the gloop too it's just me and the glue no opening no windows no way to ever know if it's morning or night so do you know what time it is all the time egg time just egg time for me and the glute sometimes it's warm and that's when i feel safest sometimes i can tell i'm being carried or moved about and it's jarring enough that i'm nervous but not so rough that i'm panicking and you can shake me but do make sure not to do it hard because remember i'm fragile i am egg the point is you can't say any of that to melinda gates she'd never understand what wife could anyway for the record there are no microchips in the covid vaccine that rumor is based on the fact that the gates foundation funded research years ago which is frequently taken out of context in that study researchers looked into creating an invisible ink that could potentially be injected along with a vaccine in order for populations like refugee kids to be able to retain vaccine records without paperwork over time the original context was lost contorted and kind of telephoned its way into becoming something something bill gates microchips on facebook a claim which if you think about it for just a second doesn't make sense because if your main concern is that bill gates could use microchips to track you he can already do that that's what your phone is now another more reasonable sounding concern has to do with just how fast the vaccine came together wouldn't want to get it um i felt like i was too rushed i think the whole thing has been rushed through too fast it kind of came really fast like the vaccine they made up one really fast it was done way too quick i just i don't feel comfortable with taking it not anytime soon i think that they're using the public as guinea pigs right and that doesn't sound good nobody wants to be a guinea pig although i don't really know why being a guinea pig seems great you can eat a pepper while wearing the stem as a little hat run around a tiny city made of cardboard and best of all you get to use the guinea pig bridge [Music] yeah being a guinea pig has its upsides that's all i'm saying the infrastructure alone is incredible but that is clearly not the concern that those people have their worry is that we are being used as guinea pigs for a rushed untested vaccine it is an understandable thing to worry about even if some express it in less than ideal ways tell me why you're concerned six words testing testing testing testing and more testing it's important if you're going to put something into your body that it's absolutely and totally tested i tell you what i admire about that guy his confidence because i don't think i've seen anyone more self-assured than the man who just promised six words said seven and counted five all without even flinching that guy is so secure in his thinking he could be wrong about numbers on camera twice and do it with an unbreaking smile but it is worth understanding exactly how the vaccine was able to come to market so fast because researchers had been working on vaccines against other coronaviruses for years so when covid19 hit they had a significant head start operation warp speed as it was famously called wasn't about rushing the science it was about significantly cutting through bureaucracy that could have otherwise slowed it down as this vaccine researcher explains did you ever imagine that we'd be able to develop a vaccine in 12 to 18 months the short answer is no we're able to compress the timeline so that things that we would normally do in a linear fashion a to b we actually start the f and the a at the same time as a and b exactly they took steps that usually happen sequentially and save time by running them simultaneously and to be honest i am envious of that level of efficiency i would save so much time every morning if i could shower shave eat breakfast kiss my family and brush my teeth all at the same time unfortunately i've only ever managed to do three of them at once but i am so close to that fourth one now another concern that you may have heard or seen online is that the pfizer and moderna vaccines are the first authorized to use messenger rna which is true but that has given rise to speculation about what mrna is capable of doing basically anyone taking these vaccines they're all designed to the same thing is going to have neurological disorders within one year most of the people taking the vaccine will be dead within 10. let me tell you something you take the mrna it creates plaque in your brain it gives you alzheimer's and i got the studies too so hey you think they just put flora in the water to dumb you down man alex jones is having a blast isn't he no one else has as much fun while making the world a worse place to live in it's like he invented a jet pack that sprays everyone beneath him with human  but the thing is there is absolutely no evidence or credible studies supporting any of what he just said as for the claim that mrna vaccines modify your dna it is very important to know that the vaccines mrna does not enter our genome it does its work far from the cell's nucleus which is where your dna is but the fear of what the vaccine contains or what it could do to you seems to be common some evangelicals are concerned that it contains cells from aborted fetuses which it does not others worry that it could change the body's inner workings you might have had a friend tell you that they are worried that the vaccines cause infertility those rumors were fueled by a blog post which falsely claimed that pfizer's vaccine contained ingredients capable of training the female body to attack a protein that plays a crucial role in the development of the placenta but a few things there first experts say of that claim it's a myth it's inaccurate there is no evidence to support it and there is already pretty good proof that pfizer's vaccine doesn't cause infertility because during the trials last year multiple women became pregnant and the only one who suffered a pregnancy loss was given the placebo so it is just not true and look the final myth you may have heard is that the risks from the vaccine are somehow greater than the risks of covid that is a perception fed by the constant circulation of misleading headlines about people falling ill or dying after getting their shot for instance you may have seen this story that was widely shared about 23 people in norway dying within a week of getting the shot which does sound scary but that headline is missing some pretty major context while those people did die at that point in norway the vaccine was being administered to the oldest or sickest people and a certain percentage of them were statistically going to die that week vaccine or no vaccine on average 400 people died every week in nursing homes in norway and when the world health organization reviewed those incidents they didn't find any unexpected or untoward increase in fatalities which does make sense correlation isn't causation the vaccine protects against covid not the concept of mortality it is weird that i have to clarify this but you are in fact going to die one day mike yeah mike stop listening to what joe rogan tells you he's a and those are his words not mine that also goes for stories that you might see hyping up scary sounding data from veyers the vaccine adverse event reporting system it's a database that collects stories of medical events following vaccinations but any lay person has to treat data coming out of it with extreme caution because reports can be entered by anyone and are not routinely verified one doctor once claimed that the flu vaccine turned him into the hulk and that report was accepted and entered into the database which is completely absurd a drug cannot turn you into the hulk although admittedly it can turn you into captain america the only superhero whose origin story is a metric ton of experimental nazi steroids and look if we're just gonna share random unverified side effects i might as well show you this truly shocking video about what might happen to your mom so my mom got the vaccine because she's a healthcare worker and she told me she's experiencing some side effects mom what's that side effect you said you're experiencing being a boss ass very good and look i'm not saying veyers is useless it very much isn't the reason the cdc collects this data is so if a pattern does emerge actions can be taken that is exactly what happened with the johnson and johnson shot the cdc found a potential pattern of rare blood clots and paused the rollout under an abundance of caution and while some vaccine skeptics pointed to that as evidence that they were right about vaccines being dangerous in reality it kind of proves the opposite that the safety risk of vaccines is rigorously and publicly analyzed not secretly buried and somehow leaked to the human football's neon scream hour and none of this is to say that there are no side effects to the vaccines there can be it is just that serious ones like anaphylaxis are incredibly rare 4.7 cases per million for pfizer two and a half cases per million for moderna and you should know those also occur mostly in individuals with a history of severe allergies the fact is the vast majority of people can expect at most typical colds or flu symptoms in the first few days after they're shot or maybe just a sore arm or maybe nothing at all for what it's worth i actually got my second shot this thursday my arm hurt a little bit for a day but that's basically it i will admit the following afternoon for a couple of hours i did feel a little bit like a boss ass but that passed quickly and anyway the key thing to remember is that no side effect of the vaccine is worse than the alternative covid a disease that has killed over 500 000 people in the u.s alone while once again to date the vaccine has been proven to kill exactly zero so it is more than natural to have questions but there are reassuring answers out there and anyone just throwing out questions without acknowledging that probably has another agenda entirely but the problem is to get anywhere close to herd immunity we badly need to convince anyone who can be convinced so the question is how do we do that while some republican lawmakers to their credit have tried to reassure their voters although occasionally those attempts have looked like this live free and beauty surrounds you the world still astounds you each time you look at a star i'm senator john kennedy i can't sing very well but i'm free be free be cool get the vaccine i did it works okay i don't love that and not just because it is the worst thing to come out of a kennedy's mouth since the back of a kennedy's head but also because the truth is that probably didn't convince anyone in researching this piece experts repeatedly told us that the vaccine hesitant generally don't respond well to hearing from politicians celebrities or athletes telling them to get the vaccine and i get that i would love to think that i could end this piece having carefully laid out some data with a triumphant call for people to get vaccinated featuring a mascot of some incongruous animal know a vaccine cicada you don't think that that's something that i would be interested in doing the truth is we actually did that we had a vaccine cicada costume made but after being advised that this technique would not be remotely effective in convincing people who were hesitant we scrapped the idea completely we emailed our mascot guy and we told him not to come in because it was an absolutely stupid idea a vaccine cicada can you imagine how dumb that would look it probably wouldn't even look like a cicada more like some kind of unhinged cockroach it was a terrible concept that could have fundamentally undermined the very important message that we were trying to send and i am so so glad that we avoided making that mistake because the truth is i'm not going to be able to convince the people in your life who are hesitant the person with the best chance of doing that is you so if you know someone who is worried for whatever reason and you want to convince them otherwise don't show them this video but maybe do try and use some of the information inside it to tell them yourself and when you are trying to do that don't dismiss or judge them for having doubts and i know that that is not always easy i could have given that guy a pass for holding up the wrong number of fingers but i couldn't do it i don't have that level of restraint i'm a small petty man and that guy is a idiot but if you think you can do better it is incredibly important that you try or to put in the terms that that guy could understand i've got two words for you please just try as hard as you can you\": 0.5333995718728544,\n",

       " \" a warm welcome to today's Talk Saturday the 17th of December now I'd been reading about this article in the popular press and on various social media places about a study which purported to show that people that were unvaccinated against covid-19 were 72 percent more likely to be involved in a traffic accident now I just assumed that this was a joke um but it actually turns out it's not when I actually looked into it it turns out this is actually based on something that's purported to be a scientific paper and here it is it comes largely from workers in Toronto and it's published in the American Journal of Medicine and it's a full scientific paper absolutely quite uh incredible and uh for example here here there pointing out that uh people that are of uh no vaccine get more accidents than people that have had the uh the vaccine over a period of a month um this is not a joke this is actually purported to be a genuine scientific paper and I really feel that these authors and the American Journal of Medicine have done themselves no favor at all with with this now they do claim of course that the uh the study is is a correlation they're not saying it's causal but there is there is a but here because they actually put forward this diagram as well here uh where they actually point out potential causal mechanism and I'm not going through this at all it's quite weak but while they actually say um that this is a correlation study they actually do try and give some potential causal mechanisms now it's a population study over 11 million people quite how they got the data I don't know you and I can't get access to the data of course it's not public domain data but they give these reasons why it's good data and that they attest to the validity of this data so I think we can accept that but um pity that was not open to a public access there for peer review um talking about peer review it really makes me wonder what the peer reviewers were thinking when they looked at this article but there's a few factors so 72 percent more likely to have an accident if you are unvaccinated in other words vaccination against covert is protecting against uh against uh accidents according to this this line of thinking but there's a few things to look at and I'm going to look at this in quite a lot of detail but not in this short video this is just a bit of an introduction so in Canada in 2021 when this data is referring to uh people that were unvaccinated weren't allowed to use public transport a lot of public transport in Canada anyway Planes Trains buses so they were forced to rely on cars so they were going to be traveling more and the unvaccinated it turns out in onto Ontario were more likely to work sorry the vaccinated in Ontario were more likely to work remotely so people that were unvaccinated were more likely to have to travel in to work and again I've got evidence for this that's in the description so for example over 65s had a very low accident rate but of course they don't uh commute that they don't commute to work now it turns out that this data and they look at over 6 000 accidents includes drivers passengers and pedestrians so are they seriously trying to make the point that covered vaccination protects protest pedestrians against road traffic accidents it really is a bitter is a bit bizarre and there was nearly as many pedestrians involved in the study as there were drivers as well as passengers um now they they classed people unvaccinated for 14 days after the vaccination but the study only lasted for one month so so if people if people had been vaccinated uh there were classed as unvaccinated for 14 days after after the vaccination now um this this could completely all you would need is about six like most 700 people to have been misclassified out of this over six thousand and that were completely invalidate this data utterly completely invalidate the results another thing that's slightly more disturbing really deaths at seen when people died at the scene were excluded and this actually works out that it excludes 84 percent of the deaths in the study now it some people might think it's a bit convenient that they uh excluded deaths at the scene because sometimes the road traffic accident is caused by a medical emergency so for example just say for example if someone a driver had myocarditis for example and that caused a spontaneous ventricular fibrillation a cardiac arrest and that will cause the accident and the person would be dead at scene that their body May well be traumatized but the cause of death would actually have occurred before the accident because of the cardiac arrest they were excluded from the study completely excluded from the study I'll leave you to draw your own conclusions from that now under vaccinated percentage in populations is usually uh underestimated so unvaccinated is usually underestimated or people vaccinated normally overestimated and now that means that the rate of anything will appear higher or overestimated in people that are unvaccinated so it doesn't matter what it is if you're comparing vaccinated unvaccinated so you could have um you could say that people um people who are unvaccinated have a greater liking for porridge in the morning or whatever so because the unvaccinated percentage is usually underestimated in the vaccinated percentage is usually overestimated the rate of anything will appear higher or overestimated in the unvaccinated in this case road traffic accidents and the rate of anything will appear underestimated in the vaccinated so really uh quite a um an amusing study if it wasn't so if it wasn't so serious that this actually gets into the medical literature really is uh quite bemusing and that's just a very quick romp through that um I'll just point out some of the factors that the the authors suggested they suggested a distrusting government it might be a factor in other words people that distrusted government were more likely to be involved in road traffic accidents as well as more less likely to be vaccinated um some people might think that's offensive belief in Freedom might be a factor this awful thing this belief in Freedom Dearing me imagine believing in freedom but that might be a factor that makes people less likely to be vaccinated and more likely so people that believe in Freedom are more likely to be involved in road traffic accidents okay misconceptions of everyday risk that they are uh purporting as an idea they don't talk about vaccine risk they're talking about covert risks of course uh people that have faith in natural protection are less likely to be vaccinated according to their thinking and more likely to be involved in a traffic accident faith in natural protection antipathy towards regulation chronic poverty is another Factor they uh propose again saying this makes people less likely to be vaccinated more likely to be involved in an accident exposure to misinformation political identity so are they really saying that your political identity influences your likelihood of being involved in a road traffic accident is that really what they're purporting here and this is this is in the published medical literature it really is quite incredible negative past experienced limited health literacy so all you stupid people out there who have got low uh uh health literacy it appears that you're more likely to be involved in road traffic accidents because you don't realize that when a ton and a half of metal hits your body it can do some damage it's just incredible that this has made the literature social networks misgiving around Public Health guidelines so people that have misgivings amongst Public Health guidelines really don't seem to think it's a problem to walk out in front of a car dear me primary care physicians who wish to help patients to avoid traffic accident statistics could take this opportunity they say to stress standard reminders such as wearing seat belts obeying speakers and for drinking alcohol so if you're going to drive let me give you some advice wear a seat belt don't exceed the speed limit oh and don't drink and drive groundbreaking stuff paramedics should be aware that unvaccinated patients are over represented in the aftermath of a traffic crash so all these these people are unvaccinated are a really big dangerous to paramedics here according to this thinking and they actually talk about this affecting driver insurance policies in the future so because of this groundbreaking research we now realize that people that are unvaccinated are going to covid-19 are more likely to have road traffic accidents therefore we should increase their insurance premiums are they really saying this anyway that's just a few things about that I'm going to look at it in a bit more detail because I'm aware I haven't given my full uh sort of a level of evidence so we'll be giving all the references for this but I'm going to do that as a separate video because it is quite complicated but there there we go um needless to say we don't accept the the uh this contention that uh covid-19 is uh associated with uh fairly to take covid-19 vaccines associated with increased risk of road traffic accidents and uh it's done the medical literature and The credibility of science no good at all in my view that this has been published so we'll leave that there for now um I'm going to do this in detail uh straight away while it's all still fresh in my head if you want to watch it do check out the

       " \" [Music] welcome to another medcram covid-19 update today we're going to review a couple of papers that go into detail about autopsy findings in patients with disease in the heart related to Spike protein who have been previously vaccinated and specifically we're going to look at the brain and the heart in a particular case where someone died with Encephalitis we at medcram have talked extensively about the vaccines and not only their efficacy but also side effects and that goes back to April of 2021 when we covered the vaccine pause of the Johnson Johnson vaccine as it related to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis there was about six cases out of six million cases at that time and we also covered in September of 2021 in our video called coveted vaccines 10 key questions answered with Rhonda Patrick where we delved into the connection between mRNA vaccines and myocarditis as a pulmonary and critical care physician in full practice and on the faculty at two medical schools the side effects of medications are not foreign to me I use these medications all the time in the Intensive Care Unit and one of the medications that we see used often but also with side effects are blood thinners and so it was a privilege for me to be involved in research prior to the pandemic in 2017 where we looked at clinical outcomes of prolonged anticoagulation with rivaroxaban which is a blood thinner after unprovoked venous thromboembolism people who have blood clots and we don't know why they have blood clots get put on anticoagulation for a set period of time and then they are taken off of anticoagulation and so the question is how long should they be on it and whether or not they should be on it indefinitely so this was a real world study where we actually looked at patients who had discontinued anticoagulation which you see here in red and those that had continued anticoagulation clearly you can see that those that discontinue initial month period had a higher risk of venous thromboembolism than those who actually had stayed on it and so that's an important thing to see the efficacy of a medication but the flip side of it is to see the safety if we're getting benefit but also seeing worsening and side effects that's not good so we asked the same question of the same cohort except in a little different way we asked how many of these actually had major bleeding which of course we see all the time in the Intensive Care Unit when patients are put on blood thinners and as you can see here there really wasn't much difference so this was a boon this is basically a situation where there's very little risk of continuing the medication and if you continue the medication you reduce their chances of getting blood clots no-brainer in this one we came to the conclusion that continued riverox event in this case beyond the initial three or six month treatment period significantly lowered the risk of recurrent thromboembolism without a significant increase in major bleeding compared to the treatment that discontinued at three or six months and so the key here is that for any medical intervention that you're ever going to do you have to understand that there's always risk it would be very surprising to me to hear that perhaps there's never been any kind of side effects in any way shape or form to the vaccines I think that's just Preposterous any medical intervention that we do even drinking water to an excess can cause difficulties so when those side effects happen they have to be characterized and I think that's a legitimate thing and here we're going to talk about a case that was published back in October of 2022 titled a case report multifocal necrotizing Encephalitis and myocarditis after bnt-162b2 which is basically the Pfizer mRNA vaccine against covet 19. this was published recently in just October of last year it talks about a 76 year old gentleman who had gotten three doses of a covid-19 vaccine now the first one was actually the AstraZeneca the Oxford AstraZeneca which is not an mRNA vaccine but rather a DNA this one actually goes into the nucleus it is a Dental viral vaccine chimpanzee specifically according to this article when they interviewed the family they said that the patient on day one of that injection actually started to have cardiovascular side effects dose 2 which was in July of 2021 so a good two months later was actually the Pfizer vaccination and after some time it doesn't say how long after that but sometime after that there was behavioral and psychological changes and worsening of their Parkinson's disease so this patient had already been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease is not only a neurological degradation it's also a manifestation of mitochondrial dysfunction and it also has cardiovascular effects so there is a confounder there in the fact that Parkinson's disease is well known to cause cardiovascular issues and neurological issues of course and autonomic issues that's the shrine Drager aspect of the parkinsonian disease and then finally in December of 2021 so a full five months later the patient had the second dose of the Pfizer biotech vaccine two weeks after that had collapsed while eating apparently the patient was continuing to do worse ever since shortly after July and then again in one week where the patient actually collapsed it was felt that the patient had had an aspiration to money that's where the patient cannot control how they swallow which is actually very common in Parkinson's disease the food goes down the wrong way and causes a pneumonia and actually that was what was seen on autopsies we'll talk a little bit a family was quizzed about this there was no symptomatic coveted disease although the paper does not mention whether or not the patient was actually ever tested for SARS cov2 infection they don't mention it so I don't believe they probably were by the way you can find this article here in this link you can also search it by title let's get into this in a little bit more detail on the lungs microscopically there was cloudy secretions they're purulent spots brittle parenchyma bilateral muco purulent tracheal bronchitis dissol is basically code words in the anatomic pathology and Pulmonary discourse for basically pneumonia copious purulent secretions that is what I would see on a bronchoscopy if I was to Bronk this patient or put a scope down into the lungs and this is basically the manifestation of a significant and very bad pneumonia which in people who are immunocompromised don't really cause a lot of symptoms unfortunately people who are older and immunocompromise when they get pneumonia they don't complain of shortness of breath they don't complain of chest pain instead they become lethargic sleepy tired and pass away I see this often so yes bilateral broth and ammonia was known in the lower lungs there was multiple stages development of lobe filling with secretions and fragile parenchyma this is basically what you would see in chronic aspiration that's exactly what you would see in Parkinson's disease as well as the patient has difficulty controlling their ability to swallow things will silently aspirate down into the lungs no surprise there but some surprises here as we go along there was actually quite a lot of findings in the heart macroscopic examination revealed manifestations of acute and chronic cardiovascular insufficiency that just means basically coronary artery disease there was a pulmonary edema so when the heart doesn't work the fluid backs up into the brain congestion chronic hepatic congestion this is one of the organs right behind the heart renal tissue edema pituitary tissue edema evidence of shock kidney disorder and so forth and so forth there was hyper contraction of cardiomyocytes there was a number of histiocytic infiltrates this just means inflammation prominent endothelial swelling this is not what you want to see and also something called coagulation necrosis as well as fibrin clots so a lot of damage going on and what they did was they started to stain the tissues to look for two things specifically one is the spike protein and the nucleocapsulin protein now why that's important is because of the following when you have the virus the virus is made up of Spike proteins which sit on the surface and has been the target of vaccines for antibodies and then there are the nucleocapsid proteins which are inside which are not the target of vaccines and so this is what a virus would look like a true virus and the vaccine of course is just going to make Spike proteins or ask your cells to make those Spike proteins nucleocapsids if they are seen are basically indicative that the virus is there and that's the important part with understanding about nucleocapsids when they stain for Spike and when they stain for nucleocapsid this is a respiratory secretion in a patient who has been infected with SARS cov2 this is not the patient that we're talking about who died and is in the autopsy and is part of the paper this is in the paper but they're showing you a control that you can stain for this you can use an antibody which has the dye Amino bin benzodine marker on it and that's what you're seeing here with this brown so what you're seeing here is antibodies against the spike protein so we're seeing spike in respiratory secretions in a patient who is positive for SARS cov2 in those same respiratory secretions we're staining for nucleocapsid proteins these are in the respiratory epithelial cells in the respiratory secretions that's primarily where the infection is taking place so that's important to understand this is the control that they're doing in this situation now let's go back to the patient that died and was getting the autopsy so when they looked at the patient's brain they did the same sort of staining here they're looking for the presence of Spike protein in the brain of the deceased patient who they never tested for SARS cov2 but what did they find as you remember he was vaccinated three times and the purpose of those three vaccinations is to make Spike protein and what are they seeing here they're seeing Spike protein here in the brain so this is lighting up on this immunohistochemical staining for SARS cov2 Spike subunit one when they do the same thing for the nucleocapsid protein it's crickets they don't see anything there's no staining whatsoever in the brain why is there no nucleocapsid protein that is up for discussion but there isn't any as we can see here on this page let's go to another specimen from the same patient also brain again we're looking for the presence of Spike and as you can see here there is Spike protein Spike protein this blue arrow by the way is not Spike protein it is actually an individual glial cell so just ignore that that is not Spike protein Amino histochemical stating again brain deceased they're looking for nucleocapsid protein and again we don't see anything there's no nucleocaps in protein staining all right let's keep going now let's look at the hearts in the same deceased patient we're looking for Spike protein and we see again Spike protein staining on immunohistochemical staining we look for nucleocapsid protein and once again we do not see any nucleocapsulin protein in that individual so what did this lead the author of this paper that was published in October to say well first of all on the autopsy the final diagnosis was this is the official death diagnosis after the autopsy bilateral bronchopneumonia undeniable because the patient was probably silently aspirating Parkinson's disease necrotic Encephalitis based on what they saw and myocarditis as well let's see what the author says they say immunohistochemistry for SARS cov2 antigens which is the spike protein and the nucleocapsid revealed that the lesions with necrotizing Encephalitis that means dying part of the brain inflammation as well as acute inflammatory changes in the small blood vessels in the brain and heart were associated with abundant deposits of Spike protein subunitive one since the nucleocapsid protein of SARS cov2 was consistently absent it must be assumed that the presence of Spike protein in affected tissues was not due to an infection of SARS cov2 but rather to the transfection of tissues by the gene-based covid-19 vaccines the reason why they can safely say that this was not an infection from SARS cov2 is because there was no nucleocapsid proteins seen on the autopsy they go on importantly Spike protein could be only demonstrated in the areas with acute inflammatory reactions brain heart and small blood vessels and in particular the endothelial cells microglia and astrocytes this is strongly suggested that the spike protein may have played at least a contributing role to the development of the lesions and the course of the disease in the patient they go on based on the alteration pattern in the brain and heart it appear that the small blood vessels were especially affected in particularly the endothelium endothelial dysfunction is known to be highly involved in organ dysfunction during viral infections he does mention that this can happen in viral infections as it induces a pro-coagulant state microvascular leak and organ ischemia this is also the case for SARS cov2 infection so in other words this is looking like a SARS cov2 infection however he's not calling the SARS cov2 infection because there's no nucleocapsid proteins in the extra respiratory tissues they say here where a systemic exposure to the virus and a spike protein elicits a strong immunological reaction in which the endothelial cells play a crucial role leading to vascular dysfunction immunoth thrombosis and inflammation and those of you who know us at medcram we've talked extensively about this and how oxidative stress in the endothelial cells can lead to damage releasing on von Willebrand's fractor which causes these small micro clots in the circulation of the lungs and causing hypoxia that's probably what leads to happy hypoxics he goes on although there was no history of covid-19 for this patient immunochemistry for SARS cov2 antigens was performed Spike protein could indeed be demonstrated in the years of acute inflammation in the brain particularly within the capital endothelium and the small blood vessels of the heart remarkably however the nucleocapsid was uniformly absent during an infection with the virus both proteins should be expressed and detected together he says it doesn't give a reference for that interestingly but it makes logical Sense on the other hand the gene-based covid-19 vaccines encode only the spike protein and therefore the presence of Spike protein only but no nucleocapsid protein in the heart and brain on the current case can be attributed to vaccination rather to infection this agrees with the patient's history which includes three vaccine injections the first one was a DNA the last two were RNA and the third one just three weeks before his death but no positive laboratory clinical diagnosis of the infection doesn't sound like the patient actually had a covid-19 test which could be asymptomatic so the conclusion illusion was numerous cases of encephalitis and encephalomyelitis have been reported in connection with the gene-based covid-19 vaccines with many being considered causally related to vaccination however this is the first report to demonstrate the presence of the spike protein actually in these encephalitic lesions and to attribute it to vaccination rather than infection these findings corroborate the causative role of gene-based covid-19 vaccines and this diagnostic approach is relevant to potentially vaccine-induced damage to other organs as well he's making the point here that the absence of the nucleocapsid is the cinquequinone to speak the Latin that this is definitely vaccination contrast this with this paper this is a paper that was published in the annals of diagnostic pathology its original contribution notice here that this was available online even though it was published in October around the same time as the other paper the results of this paper were available since May of last year let's find out what this paper says they say here cardiac manifestations are common in severe coven 19. so these these are looking at covid-19 deaths these are deaths that are attributed to covid-19 and they're looking actually at 11 of these and 11 controls and what they're able to do is something called insight to hybridization which is a way of measuring RNA samples and they're also using exactly the same technique that they used in the first paper which is immunohistochemistry for viral proteins and what did they do they looked for ace2 expression which we're not going to get into because that's not really the purpose of this they did see that ace2 expression was 10 times greater than the heart tissues of cases and controls with obesity or type 2 diabetes I think that's really interesting but what they found is these are covid-19 cases that died and what they found starting right here is interesting however in each case abundant SARS Kobe 2 Spike protein was evidence but SARS cov2 RNA and nucleocapsid protein were rarely detected in situ in any covid-19 heart let me repeat that again here these are known to have covid-19 from source cov2 even in these cases in non-respiratory tissue whereas they found plenty of Spike protein they did not find nucleocapsid protein as well what they conclude though is that the viral Spike protein is endocytized by macrophages in the lung and are carried to the heart and the brain and other organs and that's the reason why you're seeing the spike protein and not the nucleocapsid so let's take a look at some of the data here here's what's called a western blot from proteins extracted either from the nasopharynx which is NP that's part of the respiratory where you'll see a lot of nucleocapsidin Spike with no evidence of SARS cov2 or a positive result so here's the nasopharynx it's negative and you can see here we don't see any proteins here's the nasopharynx with someone with a very high copy count of SARS cov2 and what you see here is you see this band and you see this band this blue band at the top is the spike protein and this Brown Band down here is the nucleocapsid protein notice that when you look at the nasal pharynx and you have low copy count you can see still the spike protein but this nasal frenchial sample of nucleocapsid protein is almost non-existent which means that even in respiratory tissue where there's a high copy count you might not pick up nucleocapsid protein even if you are infected with SARS cov2 all right let's move on to the nucleocapsid proteins specifically so here we have nucleocapsid protein and this is the band that you want to look at because that is the nucleocapsid protein these are covered lungs covered lung one covered lung two notice in normal lung we do not see that nucleocaps at protein by the way these are just reference lines let's take a look at these covid organs we have covid liver organ one there is no band if we look in the brain in this coveted patient no band covid cns-1 no band how about the spleen in covid no band of course the normal CNS there's no band either they said their nucleocaps of protein is only evident in the lung samples and nasopharynx that's respiratory that's where it divides and it's not found in any of the other organs tested what about Spike maybe it's just not there maybe the spike isn't there either maybe it just didn't go it was a mild infection no because most of the covid-19 heart samples showed a band that analyzed for viral spikes so where's the spike protein this is Spike this is Spike so in the lung we see spike in the heart we see a light spike in this heart we see a light spike in this heart we see a light spike in this coveted heart too we see a light Spike pre-covet heart no Spike spike can go to extra respiratory organs but we have not seen an example here where the nucleocaps that goes to extra respiratory organs in SARS Kobe 2. they say here quote interestingly only the covid-19 lung and nasopharyngeal samples showed a signal for the nucleocapsid protein specifically 0 out of 11 cardiac cases were positive for the nucleocapsid protein whereas 7 out of 11 were positive for the viral Spike and the envelope proteins they did not show that data in this but that's what they showed now let's take a look at the immunohistochemical staining which is what they did in that first study and let's see what we see here we see lung do we see nucleocapsid absolutely we see nucleocapsid in the same way that we would normally see it but do we see heart Spike yes these little pink things are heart Spike well if we're seeing heart Spike we should also see heart nucleocapsid right because this is a viral infection but we see crickets here we see nothing there is no nucleocapsid in viral infections so what do they say they say the source of the endogenous Spike protein in severe covid-19 would likely be the extremely high copy viral load seen in the lungs of these patients they're saying here that in the lungs of patients this is where the virus is replicating so much that you're going to be able to see both Spike and nucleocapsid the virus in the lung induces a micro angiopathy that causes viral degeneration and is a logical source of viral Spike proteins entering the circulation this is exactly what we've been talking about and docking in organs with a high perivascular bed and ace2 population that would be Hearts preliminary data suggests that the viral Spike protein alone with the Matrix and envelope proteins are carried by macrophages in the circulation this could explain in many studies which have shown that the viral Spike protein per se or more accurately the S1 subunit the spike protein which has the RBD sequence for ace2 can demonstrate cytotoxic effects so you may never see the nucleocapsid going to distant organs that are non-respiratory because it's the spike that gets picked up by the macrophages and not the nucleocapsid so remember when we go back to that first study remember there was a control and here we saw a spike in the respiratory secretions and here we saw nucleocapsid in the respiratory secretions but we never saw this for non-respiratory secretions remember that the author of the first study says since the nucleocapsid protein of stars cov2 was consistently absent it must be assumed that the presence of Spike protein in affected tissues was not due to infection I'm not sure if that is a logical assumption anymore based on the data that we have now and that was actually available at the time of publication even back as far as May of 2022 it seems very likely in fact that you're not going to pick up the presence of nucleocapsid proteins in non-respiratory organs of the body in patients who are infected with SARS cov2 let's go back to our case study again I would be very surprised if there wasn't a single case out there or multiple cases even where there has been significant injury or even death from an intervention right I see this all the time in my Intensive Care Unit I have patients that come in with head bleeds because they're on anticoagulation and clearly as a result of the anticoagulation that they're on but the Hope was is that that anticoagulation would prevent a stroke and indeed we know that every year thousands and thousands of Strokes are prevented because people are put on blood thinners but we also get maybe a few tens 20s 30s of people who have head bleeds and we look at that risk benefit and so I think it's important to continue to look for these things but we also have to look at the data and make the analysis here to see whether or not in fact this is going on and this is what I've done looking at data and actually telling you things that could falsify my interpretation conclusions in this situation the patient had a mRNA vaccine dose 3 and it was two weeks later that the patient collapsed and then one week later the patient died so three weeks after this basically this mRNA Pfizer vaccine was given so the question is if this is actually happening we should see a signal after people have been vaccined so I go again to the graph of vaccination versus excess deaths here up on the top we see daily SARS cov2 infections during the beginning of the pandemic we have the first wave this is a scale going to 1 million you can see here the first wave was about 300 000 and this Delta wave here again was probably maybe 250 000. this was up here almost a million we didn't catch all of these people some of them weren't tested but we tested as many as we could and we can kind of get relative looks at these things down here we have excess mortality so this is anybody who died and the thing I like about excess mortality not none coveted mortality it doesn't matter what's put on the death certificate whatever's on the death certificate is on the death certificate all you need is a death certificate and a date and it goes in here so it doesn't matter if the patient is misdiagnosed as having covet or not having coveted or they died of encephalitis and they didn't think it was from covet it's all going in here it's all being captured notice here that the same pattern of SARS cov2 matches the same pattern here of this excess wave happening exactly at the time that it should happen maybe two to three weeks after it we have the same thing here with the Delta wave and we see again here because that Delta wave was just so virulent we see it exactly popping up two weeks later because it takes about two weeks for people to die once they get infected from Stars Kobe 2. the Omicron wave once again so we see here that the Peaks completely line up superimposed on top of that and reversed for ease of looking at here is the number of vaccinations whereas we had about 300 000 Stars Kobe 2 cases here in a single day we vaccinated three and a half million people over 10 times the number of people got a spike protein from the vaccine then the people that got a spike protein from the first wave of SARS Kobe 2. and so if this is what we're seeing as a result of excess deaths from the first wave we should see something approximately three weeks later down approximately right here as a result of vaccination with an mRNA vaccine I'm not saying that it doesn't happen as I said I would be very surprised if there was absolutely no risk associated with a intervention there's risk associated with every intervention but what I am saying is that whatever the magnitude of that risk is has to fit underneath this curve at that point if we're talking about an immediate effect from SARS cov2 vaccinations If This Were happening I would have expected depending on the magnitude I would have expected something to look like this you know be a little bit delayed or I would expect it's something to look like this or if it was less in magnitude or even less in magnitude something that would look like that when this is the number of I have it upside down here right so that's the peak this here is the peak of all vaccinations in the United States we vaccinated in one day on this day three and a half million people doesn't mean that there's not long-term effects but I'm not seeing an acute Association here at least on this curve going back to the publication that I was involved with we have to realize that there is always going to be side effects and we can see that here that as time goes on regardless of if you're on the anticoagulation or not on the anticoagulation there are going to be people who have major bleeding events but the key to understanding whether or not and how you can prevent those is not to compare somebody who would never have an event with someone who did have an event you have to compare someone who did have an event with someone who didn't get the intervention and that's where it's important to be able to look at things epidemiologically and with studies and with data the other thing that this shows is that sometimes things may seem logical but this is the reason we press for evidence-based medicine even though something may seem logical or it may seem like it makes sense like in this case it would seem logical that if you see the spike protein without the nucleocapsid that it would make sense that since the vaccine only makes the spike protein without the nucleocapsid this would implement Kate the vaccine however there could be other factors that are preventing that nucleocapsid protein from getting out of the respiratory tissue and into non-respiratory tissue organs the second paper highlights that even though this thing made sense it may not be the case and without my condolences to all of these people that had perished from one reason or another that were used in these studies and with the families as well I know all too well the impacts here we talk about statistics and numbers but each one of these people have families loved ones and again my condolences I am a Frontline doctor that works in the Intensive Care Unit so I understand the actual reality of all of these issues and with that this concludes I just wanted to remind you to subscribe turn on notifications and leave a comment below about what you

       " ' - [Presenter] There\\'s a\\r\\nlot of excitement right now around the record speed\\r\\nvaccines for COVID-19, some of which are already\\r\\nstarting distribution in parts of the world. But given that these are mRNA vaccines are relatively new technology that has not been widely used before. We wanted to explain how\\r\\nthey work and what happens to your body from the moment\\r\\nthat needle touches your skin. - Like vaccines, we\\'re used\\r\\nto seeing these vaccines will be injected into the\\r\\nupper muscle of your arm but unlike typical vaccines which introduce inactive or\\r\\nweakened forms of a virus, these will release genetic\\r\\nmaterial called messenger RNA. So what exactly does this mRNA do? Well in a regular cell of your body, you have DNA inside of the\\r\\nnucleus and this DNA stores all the information and\\r\\ninstructions important to the functioning of your cells your body and ultimately makes you you. Inside your cell is machinery\\r\\nthat reads through your DNA and transcribes it into mRNA which then leaves the nucleus\\r\\nand goes into your cytoplasm. And it\\'s here that the ribosomes and yourselves read the RNA and depending on the specific code to\\r\\nbuild a series of amino acids which fold in on\\r\\nthemselves to make proteins which keep you alive and functioning. This process is known as translation. In fact, it\\'s this process\\r\\nthat viruses take advantage of in the first place. They insert their own\\r\\ngenetic information into you and then your cell machinery\\r\\nunwittingly starts taking that information and building proteins to help create more viruses. - So back to the needle, the mRNA that is being injected into you from the vaccine also\\r\\ncarries genetic instructions but in this case, it\\'s only coding for one small part of the virus instead of the whole thing. You\\'ve probably seen SARS\\r\\nCoV2 represented like this with the spikes on it. And it\\'s this spike protein\\r\\nwhich on its own is harmless that the vaccines mRNA codes for. The mRNA makes its way into\\r\\nthe cytoplasm of your cells where the ribosomes read the information and start to create the spikeD proteins. Once the protein is made, it goes to the cell membrane\\r\\nand then your cell breaks down and destroys the injected\\r\\nmRNA instructions. - So what good does having a\\r\\ntiny fragment of viral spike in your body do? Well, it gives your body\\r\\nand more importantly, your immune system, a preview\\r\\nof what the virus looks like without causing disease. Suddenly your antibodies\\r\\nwill notice it and go, well, this doesn\\'t belong here which triggers an immune\\r\\nresponse to recognize and prepare your body for the real thing without ever having to come in contact with the actual virus itself. Your immune system\\r\\nessentially gets a headstart by creating powerful\\r\\nantibodies that can neutralize and kill the real virus. And this antibody memory\\r\\nis stored in your B cells so that if you\\'re ever\\r\\ninfected in the future with the SARS CoV 2 virus, your\\r\\nbody now has the upper hand. This is known as an\\r\\nadaptive immune response. Your body has already seen\\r\\nthese spike proteins before and therefore it already knows what to do. Essentially, these mRNA\\r\\nvaccines allow your body to protect itself from a future infection without ever having to\\r\\nrisk the consequences of getting the COVID-19. - So why haven\\'t mRNA\\r\\nvaccines been used before? While they are relatively new researchers have actually been experimenting\\r\\nwith them for decades but in the past they\\'ve\\r\\nbeen very unstable. Enzymes in your body would\\r\\nbreak down the mRNA quickly so they needed to be packaged well. The ones being released\\r\\nnow have the mRNA encased in lipid nanoparticles\\r\\nwhich essentially protect the mRNA from being degraded. Since there are more unstable\\r\\nthan other types of vaccines, they have to be kept cold. For example, the Pfizer vaccine it has to be stored at\\r\\nminus 70 degrees Celsius and at normal refrigerated temperatures can only last five days. Of course, a global pandemic\\r\\nhas certainly increased the funding and resources going towards these types of vaccines which has helped to accelerate their development. - What makes these vaccines so appealing is that unlike other vaccines, they can be made in a lab with\\r\\nreadily available materials and actually made much quicker\\r\\nthan other types of vaccines. Instead of fully developing\\r\\nnon-infectious viruses and then injecting them,\\r\\nthese mRNA vaccines can sort of pass many hurdles\\r\\nby using your own body in an ingenious way. It\\'s also far more cost-effective\\r\\nto create mRNA molecules rather than the proteins themselves and also a lot more scalable which is helpful when we are\\r\\nin a global pandemic waiting for a vaccine. - So is it safe? And given that it\\'s a\\r\\nrelatively new technology, should you be concerned at all? Well, that\\'s what these initial\\r\\ntrial stages have been for. Not only to test whether or not they work and cause immunity but to make sure they have minimal side effects. As of now around 70,000 people have been given these vaccines with no serious concerns, a caveat being that the full research hasn\\'t been published yet\\r\\nas of recording this video. But it\\'s important to remember that just because it\\'s safe doesn\\'t mean there won\\'t be any soreness or pain. Some recipients did report aches and pains and as of now you\\'ll\\r\\nneed to receive two shots to ensure efficacy. I saw a really great analogy\\r\\nby the professor Shane Crotty who works in vaccine research and he said, \"It\\'s not unlike going to\\r\\nthe gym and getting exercise \"and really sore muscles. \"A bit of pain can be a positive sign \"that good things are happening. \"Sometimes you have to earn your immunity, \"just like you have to earn\\r\\nthose biceps you wanted so bad.\" - We know you\\'ve been asking\\r\\nabout these vaccines a lot, we\\'ve also had our questions. So we hope that all this\\r\\ninformation was useful and concise and educational for you \\'cause it does sort of help make things seem less unknown and scary\\r\\nin a very strange time. - Thank you all so much for watching. If you want to hear more about vaccines, our podcast is on YouTube. You can check that out, we\\r\\nhave a few episodes on vaccine. - We gossip about vaccines to be honest. - You would love to see\\r\\ngossip about vaccines.

       " \" Time now to connect the dots and we make the news make sense. The COVID vaccine was hailed as a miracle by many when people first started getting the shot nearly three years ago. But since then, the amount of people getting the shot has taken a dive. Fewer people are getting the latest COVID-19 vaccine. Let's connect the dots. The vaccine was hailed as a miracle when it first arrived. More than 90% of all adults got at least one dose of the vaccine. But as new updated boosters rolled out, the number of shots going into arms has scaled back. So far, only 7% of adults have received a dose of the new vaccine. That's compared to the quarter of folks who have gotten a flu shot. So what's behind the disconnect? Experts say it's a combination of poor messaging from health authorities and less concern about the virus itself. Doctors warn this could have a big effect on the population. Fox reports, half of seniors who are going to the hospital with the virus never even got a vaccine in the first place.

       " \" well a warm welcome to today's talk Monday the 29th of May now last week the World Health Organization put out a release showing that there was a possible cause or relationship between covid-19 vaccine and multiple sclerosis and we're allowed to report on this because it is an official who paper we're limited to other things we can report but we can report this now this is the paper here now um it says covid-19 vaccination can induce multiple sclerosis via cross reactivity with t helper cells so quite a mission from the World Health Organization now this isn't available on quite a few servers now but I've got DuckDuckGo on my um on my desktop so I could find it again but that's that's that's it there and it is as I say who publication so we can actually talk about this nice to be able to talk about things now what is this actually uh showing what what is going on here well I'm going to sort of do a quick explanation of what seems to be going on so what we have here imagine this is a nerve fiber here so the nerve that the nerve impulses will travel down here and this will be in the brain or the spinal cord and these nerve fibers are surrounded by this protective myelin sheath and in the nest central nervous system they're made by cells called oligodendrocytes here we have the spike protein from a natural uh SARS coronavirus II infection and here we have the spike protein produced by the vaccine on its own now in learning to recognize this is the CD4 lymphocyte here the T helper cell this is the famous tea helper cell that's disordered in um in HIV so when people become immunocompromised in AIDS acquired immunodeficiency syndrome what actually happens is is the virus destroys a lot of the CD4 helper cells until they can't produce any immune response but here it's not lack of immune response it's too much immune response that is the uh the problem so the CD4 is learning to recognize rightly as in the principles of vaccination these uh these Spike proteins and it can beat up these Spike proteins which of course is is good these are the spike proteins produced by the vaccine and the idea is that will help the CDL CD helper cells to get rid of the spike protein should there be a natural infection which we could argue about but the point is the same sort of chemical profile that we're finding on the surface of the spike protein um molecules there we're finding very similar proteins on the surface of the well there are very similar proteins on the surface of the myelin sheath so the T helper cells are also orchestrating a response which beats up on these myelin sheaths and when the myelin sheaths go in central nervous system um that is multiple sclerosis the myelin sheaths of course are essential they facilitate what we call bouncing transmission much faster so-called salutatory transmission of nerve fibers the nourish protect the protect the nerve fiber so without them basically you get progressive paralysis that is the main feature with multiple sclerosis and I've looked after many hundreds I guess of multiple sclerosis patients so over the years horrible debilitating disease although with a very varying path so that's what seems to be happening and that's reporting on this paper so if you can't find it on Safari or something do do try Duck Duck Go because that's where I got it I actually started to prep this about three days ago and when I went and clicked on it this morning it just wasn't there you know one of those can't find it sort of make messages anyway let's look at a little more detail now because it's a pretty significant paper and it's not only showing what this this particular autoimmune reaction is to Multiple Sclerosis but is there other autoimmune reactions well the one I'm allowed to talk about is is this one because it's a who publication um you get the impression it's probably been taken down from some other servers um but hey what do I know now this is the paper here uh covid-19 vaccination can induce now this is the this is the who so Canon juice multiple sclerosis via cross-reactive T helper uh CD4 Health cells recognizing SARS coronavirus to Spike protein and as we've said myelin this essential myelin that protects the cells in the central nervous system now the article goes on both natural infection and mRNA vaccine based vaccinations can be accompanied by transient autoimmune phenomena now this is pretty significant in itself because here we have the who actually admitting that uh SARS coronavirus 2 vaccines can cause autoimmune phenomena this is actually a pretty big breakthrough um let's hope this paper stays up because it really is quite a groundbreaking piece and I am live from the who website now via Duck Duck Go uh and uh and um I can't remember the search engine now but just don't don't go anyway um do let me know if you find it under the search engines because I've had difficulty um so on set of autoimmune disease confirmed by the World Health Organization now here we have a test case of two multiple sclerosis patients with clinical signs and new radiological Signs Now what this means is radiological signs is the um if you do MRI of the brain and the spinal cord it's very obvious when you see multiple sclerosis because you have these multiple patches in the old days multiple sclerosis used to be called disseminated sclerosis because you get patches in different parts of the body hence the different uh symptoms in different parts of the body from different lesions in the brain and spinal cord but we now call it multiple sclerosis now they're saying it's a temporal relationship to the spike protein vaccine in other words the vaccine came first and the multiple chlorosclerosis came second does this mean there's an automatic cause or correlation no it doesn't but we go back to the title of the paper covid-19 vaccination can induce multiple sclerosis so the very title of the paper is indicating that there is a causal relationship at least that's the way I read the title of that paper how long it will be there for of course is a different matter um the aim of the study uh the onset of multiple sclerosis in two cases are very likely so the saying very likely caused by the CD helper cells that cross recognize SARS coronavirus to spike protein from myelin proteins now um Spike specific uh T helper cells from peripheral they found these cells in peripheral blood and they found them in the cerebrospinal fluid most of you probably know the cerebrospinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord all the central nervous systems in this cerebral spinal fluid is a shock absorber but it's also immunologically very important as as well and they were underwent Auto antigen screening now an auto antigen is is part of you it's a it's a it's a it's a it's part of you it's endogenous um but it stimulates the production of Auto antibodies so it's when one of your own proteins stimulates antibodies to beat up on your own proteins which of course is the the essence of autoimmune disease and that is what is happening in this case according to the who circular which is uh which is still there um um so they looked up a list of well-known Auto antigens in multiple sclerosis these people knew what to look for the results self-reactive T cells were detected from Spike specific T-cell populations so the yes the vaccine in that sense worked it stimulated the T helper cells but also showed reactivity against various proteins now this MBP we'll look at in a minute the MOG is the myelin oligodendrocyte protein now what that means is this is the um this is the central nervous system here's the myelin sheath and in the central nervous system this myelin sheath is produced by the oligodendrocytes or the oligodendron glial cells so it's a protein that's specific to these cells that are producing this myelin sheath the oligodendrocytes so these are specific myelin related proteins now I'm just going to give a quick this is papers in parenthesis here but um this is just to give a some insight this is about multiple sclerosis and myelin based proteins um my myelin-based protein uh so this MBP that they found the cross reactivity to one of the ones so this cross-reactivity between the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and the spike protein there's also a cross-reactivity between this myelin-based um protein here it's a central nervous system protein in the myelin as uh MBP has long been studies as a factor in the pathogenesis and the beginning of autoimmune the auto neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis so this is not new science this is well established it is the cross-reactivity where the antibodies produced from the vaccine that is new and multiple sclerosis is characterized by central nervous system inflammation demyelination axon or loss and as we said Progressive paralysis so getting back to the paper finally we found pro-inflammatory T cell clones so in other words these the T cells were involved as as well um now it's the T Cell involved here just seems to be the T helper cells whether other ones were involved we're not told but anyway these pro-inflammatory T cell clones like the CD helper cell the CD4 cell they recognize spoke Spike protein and immunodominant myelin-based proteins in other words they're beating up on the myelin tooth as well as the spike protein and as we said myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptides which have previously been implicated in multiple sclerosis their conclusion detailed studies of both peripheral blood and cerebral spinal fluid derived CD4 plus T cells that's the C help Burton CD4 helper cells the T helper lymphocytes shows that the onset of multiple sclerosis in these two very likely caused by the T helper cells clones that the population of these cells that are developed the cross-recognized SARS coronavirus 2 Spike protein derived peptides and peptides derive from myelin proteins in other words it's beating upon the same it's beating up on the same similar structures a similar molecular structures in both of these areas beating up on the spike protein is good beating up on your own um myelin in the central nervous system is potentially a disastrous so um I think we'll actually leave that out there's more I'll tell you well we'll go on for a bit more there's always more there's always more to say but um um you've got the main effort so that's just part of the text I was working on before I lost before I found the new DuckDuckGo site uh now post misrepresent research on multiple sclerosis vaccines found by 2who databases now the fact Checkers have helpfully waded in on this and um quite a few fact Checkers it's obviously put the wind up them a bit um very good of these fact Checkers to tell us uh what's going on so we don't need to bother thinking for ourselves but I think we'll pass on it because I think we do like to think for ourselves now this is a bit of line because this is not new now this is a paper here this is another paper new diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in settings of mRNA covered vaccine exposure this is published published published in January 2022 so this is based on data collected in 2021. why wasn't this highlighted at the time why wasn't it highlighted at the time multiple sclerosis with onset uh with onset in the settings of acute SARS coronavirus 2 virus infected people has been reported so yes it's possible after natural infection and reactivity of multiple sclerosis following mRNA covered vaccines there have been three reports of newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis following exposures to mRNA covered vaccines so yes that is occurring in 2021 the association cannot be determined to be causal of course because it could be caused by other factors but it's temporal correlation whereas the new who paper goes further and says it's now lightly um we report a series of five cases of newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis following recent exposure of mRNA covered vaccines now this bit's a bit concerning latency from vaccination to initial presentation varied neurological manifestation the clinical course appear to be typical for MS so the time between people getting vaccinated and developing the features of multiple sclerosis varied there was latency how long could this latency be we don't know in these cases it was fairly short because of course the vaccines only started in in 2021 so these must have been within the course of a year are there more to come we don't know that not least we haven't been told that someone there's probably some information around somewhere um but there's multiple sclerosis responding as normal so their conclusion was acute neurological deficits in the settings of recent mRNA covered vaccination and administration may represent new onset multiple sclerosis so we knew that in uh 2022 and yet nothing changed incredible why won't the warned of these risks at a much earlier stage well the the research wonders but it didn't translate into um any meaningful findings right now just a couple of quick things um this is um petition if you're in the if you're in the UK you can sign this petition here that we're concerned about the new who amendments and some amendments that are going to kick in in just a few months that we didn't know about that have been kept quiet so if you click on that if you're in the UK you can sign that uh petition and when we get to 100 000 signatures there has to be a parliamentary debate albeit it's a fairly small one but there has to be something let's get up to a hundred thousand and um stop this uh uh these new international health things from the World Health Organization or at least not stop them let's have a parliamentary debate rather than rubber stamping it and the other thing I'll put a link in in the description as well but I've started a sub stack as well um don't know how much time I'll have to put on things but um you can put some I've put some quite detailed physiology and pathophysiology on there and um as well as news more news related items so there we go World Health Organization quite surprising really covid-19 vaccinations can induce multiple sclerosis from The Who itself um and I can tell you about this one because it is an official who site let's hope the who published more so I'm free to discuss more pathology a bit concerning about what's going to happen over the next couple of years in terms of prevalence but um we'll find out won't we we'll leave it there for now and uh thank you for watching\": 0.3755005237817739,\n",
       " \" hello warm welcome to this talk Saturday the 13th of January now I want to be talking about disease X in a minute from a small radio station in Switzerland called radio Davos I think it was more on that shortly but a bit of a disappointment first this is from the UK Co inquiry and unfortunately the uh public hearings for the inquiry fourth investigation into vaccines and therapeutic module will be rescheduled the hearings were provisionally scheduled to take place in the summer of 2024 they will now take place at a later date and then there's some rationale given there which you may choose to accept or not to enable organizations to prioritize providing evidence for the inquirer's third investigation into the impact of the pandemic on healthare well I would have thought um they knew what order this was in before they did this but never mind that's what they've said this is from the site here um this is from baroness Hallet who's the chair of the inquiry I know that the postponement of these hearings will be a disappointment for some yes it will and I think there's a degree of urgency as I'll point out um I want to ensure our hearings of uh in 2024 are as effective as possible well yes and I recognize the increasing pressure on organizations to respond to requests and provide information to the inquiry now I would have thought they'd known that when they scheduled the inquiry at the first place um maybe um they've had to reschedule this because there was some new information came to light we we we're basically not told which is disappointing but we are assured it's going to be finished by the summer of 2026 so let's hope there is time to squeeze in this rather important module because it's not on as scheduled unfortunately so I had been genuinely looking forward to that and it's pretty disappointing that that is now being delayed now I want to give you something from the mail online now that I'm just hoping they don't know more than we do about it because they actually say uh Co inquirers probing to vaccines is delayed indefinitely indefinitely they're saying well let's hope that's not the case uh as chair admits postponement will be a disappointment for some yes um hearing for the fourth module of this is from the from the mail online now hearing of the fourth module of the official inquiry to be what what it was set of the official inquiry were set to begin this summer a long awaited probe into the development of covid vaccines and drugs was today postponed and again they say indefinitely here so let's hope this is not the case baroness Hallet says I know the postponement will be a disappointment I wish to reassure you that we will hold these hearings as soon as possible good we'll look out for it uh but we're still going to be finished by the summer of 2026 so let's hope it's time now this inquiry has cost you and me the plait Ariat the pans so far it's cost us 145 million um quite incredible now um I'm going to talk about disease X in a minute but just before we do that um this is just a completely unrelated uh article I was reading in the Guardian newspaper from November 2022 this is Paul Burl who was a royal Butler and Paul borrow reported a conversation with her majesty the queen prior to her sad recent uh departure uh and Paul Bor reports that the queen said this Queen Elizabeth said this there are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge so uh it looks like uh there are powers at work uh but we don't know what they are so in Donald Rumsfeld terms this would be a known unknowns I guess now I want to talk now about disease X which is on this website here this is the uh World economic Forum site as far as I can uh derive disease X this is how we should prepare for the next big virus wow so uh this you can listen to it here or you can um read it there it's all very easy to understand while being rather uh difficult to understand now disease X um I've been teaching this sort of thing pretty well fulltime since 1990 I know I've been a clinical nurse since 1975 when I was a first year student and um I'd never heard of this disease X so I looked at some of my books because when I wrote my book I couldn't remember putting it in so it wasn't in there but I could easily miss it couldn't I so I did check in uh Reuben's pathology these are the definitive texts see it in there either uh so I checked in G and Hall superb physiology book not in there either um uh porth's pathophysiology um not in there either it's fairly thick book you think it could be in there somewhere um you get the idea not in that one can hardly pick this one up path physiology all these standard textbooks um not in there so it must be a new disease can't say I like the sound of a new disease we've had a new disease already haven't we anyway um this is just I want to give you some highlights from the um the radio Davos uh talk disease X is looming the world needs to be better prepared to tackle a future pandemic and you'll see here that the text is from the world economic Forum site um they go on to say uh by mapping viruses with the potential to become the next disease X the global Health Community and governments uh the governments and governments can be more responsive the next time a pandemic looms looks like they're anticipating another pandemic here Global collaboration and adequate funding are needed to improve pandemic preparedness and ensure fast action to keep a viral outbreak at Bay uh it says you can get a long way being able to produce something not quite sure what's being produced but you can produce something or other something or other that will Target a novel virus before that virus even emerges I assume here they're referring to repurpose drugs which could be rolled out very quickly and uh very cheaply and may be efficacious against a range of conditions maybe that's what they mean but anyway they're going to produce something um can't read too much into that all they say is something could even mean a vaccine I don't know whatever they mean there um anyway that will Target a novel virus before that that virus even emerges um it's a virus we don't know yet but we do know it's out there uh do we but we do know it's out there now unfortunately much to my annoyance and your annoyance I felt um compelled to delete yesterday's um video my apologies the the the trick is to live to fight another day um that's what we aim for but the video I was doing yesterday was examining a particular virus uh that was uh experimentally used to infect mice caused a disease of the brain and on at the end of the study none of the mice at the end of of the study were alive anymore none of them were alive anymore um because a certain event had happened to them that made them not alive um and that virus my understanding from reading of the paper was it had been it evolved in cell cultures in a laboratory so as a result of going through cell coaches in a laboratory the function of the virus had been uh had been increased it would appear it became a more functional virus there was a function and uh there was potentially um an increase uh maybe even a gain uh anyway but but um we know it's out there so they know it's out there uh obviously they don't know a precise geographical location but they know it's out there uh and we know it has the potential to spill over from animal populations potentially into humans well yeah there can be natural spill over vents of course there can also be other origins of viruses perhaps mutate or adapt itself and then begin spreading and killing people faster than we can contain it um carrying out research and oh and vaccine development carrying out research and vaccine development for no own viral families could impact humans of which there are 25 viral families they're saying uh would give Humanity a decided advantage over the next disease X so who who knows maybe the world economic Forum will be good enough to uh develop a vaccine for as great unwashed so it's all ready for us um I'll leave it with you read the article for yourself it's all there um it's all there yep from Radio Davos quite concerning really a disease X they seem to think it's coming um that's hope they don't know too much more than us we'll leave it there thank you for watching\": 0.5015031378474774,\n",
       " \" welcome to today's talk Friday the 25th of November now for the first time in the United States we've got data that says there's been more covert deaths in people that are vaccinated versus people that are unvaccinated and we want to look at that in a little bit of detail in a minute and put some context in that and also we want to look at the bivalent vaccine boosters that are being given in the states and we're going to be looking at information from V safe which shows that 54.8 percent of vaccine recipients of the bivalent boosters had a systemic side effects most of which weren't serious in the time frame they were looking at now that's about the only way I can summarize this it is a bit complicated and of course YouTube rules and my own personal standards insist that we will be looking at a data from official sources and other reputable sources of data so we're not going against any uh any guidelines from the United States government now um here we have this this is this is this was a report it was commissioned by The Washington Post Kaiser Family Foundation vice president Cynthia Cox who does a lot of this kind of work now um this is quite interesting 58 of coronavirus deaths in August with people who were vaccinated or boosted and that is people who'd had a primary uh course of vaccines at least a primary course of vaccines so what it looks like is happening here is we're getting waning of the protective effects of the vaccines it's now waning and of course this combined with the systemic side effects that we're going to look at from the booster doses needs to be taken into account as we consider the the consider the risk of benefit analysis because we started these vaccination programs a while ago and the risk benefit analysis has changed um we're not saying the vaccines aren't effective we're not saying that there are anything about the vaccines we're just saying the risk benefit analysis has changed let's go on um so therefore 42 of deaths in August were in people who were unvaccinated so the majority For the First Time The More Death covered deaths in the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated population in the United States now it's fair to contextualize this because if we look at CDC data we do find that 80.06 percent of the United States population is vaccinated so there's more people in the vaccinated group than in the unvaccinated group but it's also true as we saw that there were more covert deaths in the vaccinated group for the first time now historically this is quite interesting September 2021 vaccinated people 23 percent of the coronavirus fatalities in people that were vaccinated January in February 2022 had gone up to 42 percent and as we saw now it's now gone up to 58 percent so we see that the risk of benefit analysis is changing the data is there before our eyes so a direct quote from the Kaiser foundation in the Washington Post we can no longer say this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated so uh Mr Biden's um not saying Mr Biden was wrong at the time but um times have changed we know protective effects Wayne and this needs to be taken into account when we look at risk benefit analysis in my view so this was a the Kaiser Foundation had conducted the analysis now A Center for Disease Control and prevention morbidity and mortality weekly report and this is this paper here from from the CDC so we're banging bang in the middle of official U.S government data safety monitoring a bivalent covid-19 vaccines now um August the 31st 2022. um the FDA authorized the bivalent booster for Pfizer and moderna um MRI encoding the spike protein from the original SARS coronavirus II and from Oregon ba4 and ba5 so it was this bivalent combination vaccine advisory committee on immunization uh practice recommended all persons over 12 receive an age-appropriate dose of the one of these vaccines that was their recommendation at the time and indeed still is now v-safe is a voluntary smartphone-based U.S safety surveillance system established by the CDC to monitor Adverse Events after covid vaccination and here we have it it's a v safe here now I don't actually know too much about that so if people that are using it in the states have been giving me some feedback on that that would actually be really uh really quite useful to get some information on that as of the 3rd of October I believe there were 10 million users of that period of time so it looks like it's being fairly well used are we getting better data now from the states it certainly is starting to look that way we're getting better quality data now vaccine Adverse Events reporting system is the other way of course and um information is also taken from that total data from the 31st of August the 23rd of October 14 odd million uh had received a Pfizer bioentec 8.2 million uh the modernist just over uh I think the modern is just over 18s so pretty large numbers that we're getting here now v-safe is a bit more confusing it looks like in this period of time there was 211 959 registrants age over the age of 12. slightly complicated as well because people under the age of 16 have to have supervision to use this program so quite how that's working out I don't really know in the states but registrants now it looks like these are people that had just started using the app in that period of time but as is often the case with CDC it's not that clear really the way the writers is not that not that transparent very often August 31st to 23rd of October is the period of time so um just that finite window of time 2022 reports in the week after vaccination be put so this is just a one week period now clearly you don't have to be a that clever to realize that this isn't going to pick up any potential long-term side effects we're not saying there are long-term side effects but any potential long-term side effects would by definition not be picked up in the first week so it is limited but anyway injection site reactions 60.8 that's not too surprising and it's not really concerning you get a soil arm of course um systemic reactions though this is more concerning to me 54.8 percent fewer than one percent and I think we'll see later it's about point eight percent uh received Medical Care so vsafe is reporting that some people did need uh medical opinions and medical care after the vaccination I don't think that's controversial it's a simple statement of fact uh vaccine Adverse Events reported system so uh 5542 reported Adverse Events of bivalent uh vaccine pretty small number really actually um are all the cases being reported to bear as of course not of course not uh but 4.5 of those were serious now remember this is of cases actually reported but still a reasonable proportion of the case is actually reported were classified as being serious Adverse Events now this is straight from the CDC Healthcare Providers and patients can be reassured that Adverse Events reported after bivalent boosters are consistent with those reported after monovalent vaccines do you see what they've done here they're comparing the bivalent boosters with the monovalent they're comparing two groups this is a relative risk not an absolute risk not saying the CDC are being disingenuous not at all but we they are reporting a relative risk not an absolute risk the absolute risk um they didn't put that in not given so it's a relative risk the absolute risk is going to be smaller than the relative risk how much smaller don't know they didn't say information not given disappointing from the CDC that they're just talking about relative risk the health impacts after covered vaccines uh vaccination are less frequent and less severe than those associated with covered illness again they're comparing people that have had illness with people that are vaccinated a relative risk not an absolute risk for the whole population not saying the CDC are being deliberately disingenuous here but it would have been better to have information on absolute risk as well as relative risk unfortunately the the absolute risk is not given but we know it will be smaller than the relative risk now the reference they use for this is interesting because they're making this broad statement here health health impacts which so Health impacts is a broad statement it applies to everything but the reference they give reference to there is quite specific now that's the reference there and uh it just refers to myocarditis pericarditis and combinations of those or multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children within seven days or 21 day risk window after the index date so again this is only a 14-day window that they're taking this information from and even then they're giving it as a relative risk I mean we're not saying the CDC are trying to give the wrong impression here but it just doesn't seem very well written to me um I I I know many relatively Junior academics who could write it much more clearly than this I think but we're not arguing with the numbers that the CDC are giving we're more uh commenting on their on their presentation okay comparison between and after uh vaccines after infection again they're comparing between the infections and uh after the vaccines two groups the relative risk between those absolute risk not given again so we see that the CDC are really giving relative risks comparing one group with another group not giving the absolute risk for the population as a whole CDC please you need to give both we need to know what the absolute risk is as well as the relative Risk please now a bit do a bit more detail here a review of these safe data from the mobile app again during August the 31st to 23rd of October same time period now this is what they say 211 212 000 nearly registrants these are presumably people that registered new newly in that period of time um they're covered a fairly good age group um a few to 12 to 17s as we see there more in the uh more in the older age groups but a good a good spread of Ages no complaints there at all uh quite a few of these 50 45 were the fourth dose and the fifth dose was 50.2 percent but of course we know that if these risks if the heart disease complications especially that the CDC does admit can occur after vaccines they're more likely after the second dose so again it's not giving a really good overall picture it's really quite specific to these um bivalent boosters that they're talking about uh in the week after rece receiving um a bivalent booster dose local injection site reactions now this is interesting uh 49.7 amongst the over 65s higher in the younger age group and the age group they use for comparison here is the 18 to 49. so younger people men and women getting more local uh reactions systemic reactions it's the same 18 to 49 getting 67.9 local reactions as opposed to 43.5 in the over 65s and when they look at the specific problems they see this same Trend that it's younger people that are getting more so 30 in older people 53 in younger people headache again 19.7 in older people 42.8 in younger people and again we see it the same with the muscle pain and the fever now it reported inability to complete normal daily activities was 10.6 amongst those over 65 and 19.8 percent in those aged 18 to 49 after vaccination so over 19 in that younger age group couldn't carry out their normal activities after the uh the booster vaccine I would have thought these are fairly fairly High numbers uh receipt of Medical Care was reported by 0.8 percent now 0.8 percent who took medical advice after vaccination I would have thought that is rather high but the CDC just report it they don't say anything about it they just say that's what it was I would have thought it's rather High 0.8 percent you can decide whether you think that's high low or indifferent again we're talking about risk benefit analysis so so there we go um I know that's fairly data intense um but it looks like um the risks after the risk of side effects after vaccination are becoming clearer with uh vsafe although I don't yet fully understand how it's working but it's good that these are being honestly reported and just combine that with the risk benefit analysis um that more covert deaths are now occurring in vaccinated versus on vaccinated despite the fact we have to be clear about it only 20 of the the population are unvaccinated so the vaccinated is a much larger group thankfully though uh covert cases are getting milder they still do cause some deaths as we'll see seeing some hospitalizations but the trend is that they're getting milder and I think these things should be taken into account where the risk benefit analysis so that's about as far as we can go on this talk I think lots of data there all the references are given I've been as honestly I've been as honest to the data as I can and um check the links and uh I'm pretty sure all of my numbers are accurate you'll have to decide uh how you interpret the information I have given you interesting don't want to say any more well could say more but probably best not say more thank

       " \" the Centers for Disease Control and prevention has endorsed updated coid shots for everyone aged 6 months and older the vaccines from adna fizer and its partner bch will be available by the end of the week the US has seen a surge in coid hospitalizations this summer as new variants emerge with hundreds of people still dying each week the new shot will be available at pharmacies and some doctor offices and will be mostly free through private insurance Medicare or Medicaid for more now lets bring in the director of the CDC man Cohen thank you so much for joining us tonight great to be with you late today you officially signed off on these booster shots the shots come as we're of course seeing an uptick in coid cases how soon will the new shop be available well today the CDC recommended that everyone should get an updated coid vaccine and within the next number of days you're going to see those start to show up in doctor's offices and pharmacies around the country fewer than half of adults older than 65 and just one in five Americans got the booster shot last fall many Americans view CO as a mild threat now are you concerned that very few people will opt for boosters this fall Well we'd all wish for Co to be in the rear viw mirror but unfortunately it's still here and what we know is that our immunity decreases over time so even if you've had coid before or been vaccinated that immunity and that protection does decrease over time plus what we're seeing is that this virus the co virus continues to change that's why today the CDC is recommending an updated coid vaccine for everyone over the age of 6 months again it's to protect you from the serious consequences that this this virus still can have and many Americans as you know have ditched their masks as we head into the fall and winter do you see a world where people should mask up again in crowded spaces and inside well as we get to the fall and winter we're going to have not just coid circulating but remember flu is out there RSV that impacts our our young kids is out there and other viruses so we want to use all the tools we possibly can to protect ourselves vaccine is a great tool and going into the Fallen winter we have vaccines against all three of those major viruses so right now ahead of Fallen winter is a great time for you to get not just your coid vaccine but your flu shot and if you're an older adult to get an RSV vaccine um but we have to use other tools right so if you do get sick make sure you're getting tested because getting tested allows you to then get treatment and treatment makes sure that you won't get very sick end up in the hospital so we need to use all the tools we possibly can to protect ourselves as we get into the fall and winter you've just started this job Beyond coid and what we've already discussed with regard to the flu and RSV what are your biggest Health priorities at the CDC well as you mentioned you know first and foremost we're focused on these respiratory viruses it's unfortunately the thing that is going to take a number of lives in the coming months but we have the tools to protect ourselves so focusing on protecting ourselves from coid flu and RSV is certainly first priority but many other health threats that are out there and the CDC is designed to be that um asset for this country to detect and respond to threats so other threats like um declining in our mental health or the opioid crisis that we're seeing or we're seeing unfortunately more suicide so that is certainly something that we are focused on at the CDC as well making sure we can bring data and evidence and best practices to support folks not just with respiratory illnesses but maybe their mental health um and addiction as well and before we let you go do want to ask for those who are concerned about the safety the medical issues potentially down the road that they say they are concerned about with regard to getting these coid shots what's your response to those who are still skeptical and doubting well I want folks to know that these vaccines have been studied frankly more than any vaccine in history we've given over 600 million doses of the coid vaccine so it's been studied in terms of its safety extensively um so I wouldn't recommend anything I wouldn't recommend for my own family I'm not just the head of the CDC I'm I'm a mom I'm a wife I'm a daughter so you're going to see my nine and 11year old daughters get vaccinated um with coid and flu uh this fall my husband my parents so we're hoping that everyone will protect themselves when we get into the fall and winter get their updated Co shot as well as a flu shot CDC director Mandy Cohen we really appreciate your time tonight thank you thanks for having me hi everyone George

Okay, now let's talk.\\r\\nSpeaker 2: All right. I have a lot of videotape,\\xa0\\xa0 and if I wanted to go into the archive, I could\\xa0\\r\\nsend you where I pretty much alone in media was\\xa0\\xa0 questioning the pharmaceutical industry and\\xa0\\r\\nthink people like Monsanto. I was the early\\xa0\\xa0 part of the century with the growers,\\xa0\\r\\nright? Yeah. So I'm not the guy to hit\\xa0\\xa0 that for you. And you're for Monsanto.\\r\\nSpeaker 3: I was the vaccine shit.\\xa0 Speaker 2: And I've been way\\xa0\\r\\nout on a limb on that one too.\\xa0 Speaker 3: You were wrong.\\r\\nSpeaker 2: I don't know\\xa0\\xa0 which one. I don't know what your stance on\\xa0\\r\\nvaccines is. Why don't you tell me yours and\\xa0\\xa0 I'll tell you mine and we'll see who's wrong.\\xa0\\r\\nThey're trying to kill us. They're trying to.\\xa0 Speaker 3: Yeah. That's why\\xa0\\r\\nthey're giving us the vaccine.\\xa0 Speaker 2: I don't think they're trying.\\r\\nSpeaker 3: Well, they are killing us.\\xa0 Speaker 2: Well, it's much more.\\r\\nSpeaker 3: Complicated than us.\\xa0 Speaker 2: Who hates us? The\\xa0\\r\\npharmaceutical industry? No, actually.\\xa0 Speaker 3: The crazy psychopath billionaires.\\xa0\\r\\nOh, boy. They hate the regular people.\\xa0 Speaker 2: Okay, Bernie. So. But you're\\xa0\\r\\nnot one of the regular people. Look at\\xa0\\xa0 you. You're a southern belle. You're like in\\xa0\\r\\na Tennessee Williams play. And you're the.\\xa0 Speaker 3: I've always depended\\xa0\\r\\non the kindness of strangers.\\xa0 Speaker 1: All right. They're killing us. They are\\xa0\\r\\nkilling us. The vaccine is killing us. We really\\xa0\\xa0 need to take this head on, because this. This\\xa0\\r\\nwill not go away. This talking point will not\\xa0\\xa0 go away. Has even a single person died from the\\xa0\\r\\nCovid vaccine? I'm open to the possibility that\\xa0\\xa0 someone has in the sense that when millions and\\xa0\\r\\nmillions and millions and hundreds of millions,\\xa0\\xa0 maybe billions of people get a vaccine, there are\\xa0\\r\\ndifferent adverse reactions. And could someone die\\xa0\\xa0 from an adverse reaction? Sure. But I've been\\xa0\\r\\nlooking everywhere for instances where someone\\xa0\\xa0 died from the Covid vaccine. I just haven't found\\xa0\\r\\na single instance. Right. We start looking into\\xa0\\xa0 the data. There have been rare cases of serious\\xa0\\r\\nside effects. The JNJ vaccine was associated with\\xa0\\xa0 a rare blood clotting disorder, specifically women\\xa0\\r\\nunder 50. The AstraZeneca vaccine wasn't even used\\xa0\\xa0 in the United States associated with those issues.\\xa0\\r\\nBut have any actual deaths been attributed to\\xa0\\xa0 it? I wasn't able to find any in terms of more\\xa0\\r\\ngenerally. There's this idea that if you're 80\\xa0\\xa0 and you get vaccinated and you die three months\\xa0\\r\\nlater, that that's a vaccine death. And a lot\\xa0\\xa0 of the vaccine deaths reported in the Vaya system\\xa0\\r\\nare things like that. But can we attribute even a\\xa0\\xa0 single one to the vaccine? I haven't been able\\xa0\\r\\nto find a single one with any vaccine. You can\\xa0\\xa0 have an anaphylactic reaction and it seems with\\xa0\\r\\nthe Covid vaccine, it was happening in five out\\xa0\\xa0 of every million doses administered. It's a severe\\xa0\\r\\nallergic reaction. It can occur after a flu shot\\xa0\\xa0 or whatever. From what I've been able to find.\\xa0\\r\\nNo deaths from anaphylaxis were reported. There\\xa0\\xa0 were studies done of other sorts of reactions.\\xa0\\r\\nThe myocarditis, the pericarditis. Uncomfortable\\xa0\\xa0 certainly can be serious. I have been able to\\xa0\\r\\nfind no evidence that anybody actually died from\\xa0\\xa0 it. Now, you might. You might be able to find\\xa0\\r\\nsomething. Hey, here's two people that we know\\xa0\\xa0 died from a reaction they had to the vaccine.\\xa0\\r\\nOkay. Send it to me and I will look at that.\\xa0\\xa0 But Tucker Carlson pulled this as well, saying\\xa0\\r\\nthe vaccine could be killing thousands, hundreds\\xa0\\xa0 of thousands of us. I still have not been able\\xa0\\r\\nto find any evidence of that. And importantly,\\xa0\\xa0 there have been population studies of large groups\\xa0\\r\\nof people. Just here's a group of people the same\\xa0\\xa0 age. One group was vaccinated, one wasn't. The\\xa0\\r\\nvaccinated group had a lower rate of all cause\\xa0\\xa0 death in the period following the vaccine. So I\\xa0\\r\\nwould love it if someone presented some of the\\xa0\\xa0 evidence. Roseanne Barr certainly didn't. Tucker\\xa0\\r\\nCarlson certainly didn't when he brought it up.\\xa0\\xa0 If someone in the audience has the evidence,\\xa0\\r\\nplease send it to info at David packman.com.\": 0.4860167610167611,\n",
       " \" hey guys welcome to another video yesterday i\\xa0\\r\\nwas seeing one of my patients in the pulmonary\\xa0\\xa0 clinic and she was asking me about my\\xa0\\r\\nthoughts about getting the covid vaccine\\xa0\\xa0 she also asked me if i heard about the doctor\\xa0\\r\\nin florida who died after getting the first\\xa0\\xa0 pfizer vaccination so this is something i want\\xa0\\r\\nto talk about so there was an obstetrician\\xa0\\xa0 gynecologist in miami who received the first\\xa0\\r\\ndose of the pfizer vaccine on december 18th\\xa0\\xa0 and shortly after receiving the vaccine he\\xa0\\r\\nreportedly developed acute immune thrombocytopenia\\xa0\\xa0 he died 16 days after getting the vaccine his\\xa0\\r\\ncause of death being a result of brain hemorrhage\\xa0\\xa0 or bleeding into the brain obviously\\xa0\\r\\nthis is horrible it's tragic and you\\xa0\\xa0 have to feel for his family but it makes you\\xa0\\r\\nwonder was his death a result of the vaccine\\xa0\\xa0 and if it was a result of the vaccine should that\\xa0\\r\\nchange your perspective on getting the vaccine\\xa0\\xa0 so i'm going to tell you my thoughts on this but\\xa0\\r\\nfirst let's learn a little bit more about what\\xa0\\xa0 happened pfizer is actively investigating the case\\xa0\\r\\nbut they don't seem to think that the vaccine is\\xa0\\xa0 the cause of this so far over 10 million people in\\xa0\\r\\nthe united states have received at least one shot\\xa0\\xa0 of either the pfizer or the moderna covid\\r\\nvaccine these are the two authorized in the\\xa0\\xa0 united states as of right now me personally\\xa0\\r\\ni received both doses of the pfizer vaccine\\xa0\\xa0 which overall went very smoothly now so far\\xa0\\r\\nthere have been about 40 cases of anaphylaxis\\xa0\\xa0 as a result of these vaccines meaning a severe\\xa0\\r\\nallergic reaction none of which were reported\\xa0\\xa0 as being fatal now many people have had other\\xa0\\r\\nside effects that are very common after the\\xa0\\xa0 vaccine like having a sore arm having some fatigue\\xa0\\r\\nheadache or fever and this typically lasts a day\\xa0\\xa0 or two the miami-dade county medical examiner's\\xa0\\r\\noffice is investigating this death as well\\xa0\\xa0 and as of right now there is no official autopsy\\xa0\\r\\nreport but based off the reports let's see what\\xa0\\xa0 we can make of this case so this man was healthy\\xa0\\r\\nhe did not smoke he did not take any medications\\xa0\\xa0 never had any reaction to any medication or\\xa0\\r\\nvaccines supposedly three days after he gets\\xa0\\xa0 the first dose of the pfizer covid vaccination\\xa0\\r\\nhe gets tiny reddish spots or petechiae caused\\xa0\\xa0 by bleeding under the skin of his hands and feet\\xa0\\r\\nthis prompted him to go to the er he gets blood\\xa0\\xa0 work done and his platelet levels are low and this\\xa0\\r\\nis something called thrombocytopenia platelets are\\xa0\\xa0 one of the components of blood clotting if\\xa0\\r\\nplatelets are too low it makes people more\\xa0\\xa0 prone to bleeding normal platelet counts range\\xa0\\r\\nfrom anywhere from 150 000 to 400 000 or so\\xa0\\xa0 people can have spontaneous bleeding including\\xa0\\r\\ninternal bleeding but that doesn't typically\\xa0\\xa0 happen unless the platelet levels are less than\\xa0\\r\\nten thousand his levels were reportedly zero\\xa0\\xa0 and because they're so low or absent really\\xa0\\r\\nhe gets admitted to the intensive care unit\\xa0\\xa0 for two weeks doctors tried to get his platelet\\xa0\\r\\ncount higher as he had experts from all over the\\xa0\\xa0 country involved in his care now presumably\\xa0\\r\\nthey tried a number of different treatments\\xa0\\xa0 typically we give platelet transfusions which is\\xa0\\r\\nreally a blood product that we're transfusing but\\xa0\\xa0 also we give steroids specifically glucocorticoids\\xa0\\r\\nsuch as salimetrol or methylprednisolone if that\\xa0\\xa0 doesn't work we try other drugs like ramiplostim\\xa0\\r\\nor eltrombopag to try to stimulate the bone\\xa0\\xa0 marrow to make more platelets sometimes we give\\xa0\\r\\nimmunoglobulins sometimes we give a drug called\\xa0\\xa0 rituximab which is a monoclonal antibody if\\xa0\\r\\nall else fails the last resort is to take out\\xa0\\xa0 the spleen because sometimes a spleen plays a\\xa0\\r\\nrole in sequestering and destroying platelets\\xa0\\xa0 so they were actually planning on doing\\xa0\\r\\na splenectomy meaning removing his spleen\\xa0\\xa0 but shortly before that he ends up developing a\\xa0\\r\\nhemorrhagic stroke that took his life in a matter\\xa0\\xa0 of minutes in other words he bled into his brain\\xa0\\r\\nnow just because someone bleeds into their brain\\xa0\\xa0 it doesn't necessarily mean that they die but\\xa0\\r\\nwhat happens is if the bleeding is severe enough\\xa0\\xa0 the pressure starts building up inside the skull\\xa0\\r\\nand this is known as raised intracranial pressure\\xa0\\xa0 and this compresses the brain and eventually the\\xa0\\r\\npressure forces the brain down through the base\\xa0\\xa0 of the skull that big hole at the bottom\\xa0\\r\\nof the skull known as the foramen magnum\\xa0\\xa0 when this happens the only life-saving option is\\xa0\\r\\nemergent brain surgery where a neurosurgeon does a\\xa0\\xa0 craniotomy to relieve the intracranial pressure\\xa0\\r\\nbut his bleeding was so severe and happened so\\xa0\\xa0 quickly it took his life and his thrombocytopenia\\xa0\\r\\nwas not only severe but it wasn't getting better\\xa0\\xa0 despite all the treatments that they tried and\\xa0\\r\\nthis leads to the question why does a healthy\\xa0\\xa0 guy all of a sudden get severe thrombocytopenia\\xa0\\r\\nto the point of bleeding to death because no\\xa0\\xa0 matter what the cause is this kind of thing is\\xa0\\r\\nincredibly rare i've never had a similar case\\xa0\\xa0 like this in the intensive care unit now there are\\xa0\\r\\nsome cases like this reported with certain drugs\\xa0\\xa0 medications can lead to thrombocytopenia\\xa0\\r\\nas a result of drug-induced antibodies\\xa0\\xa0 being made by the immune system that\\xa0\\r\\nend up attacking the body's platelets\\xa0\\xa0 so drug-induced thrombocytopenia refers to\\xa0\\r\\nacute immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and\\xa0\\xa0 it should be suspected when someone has a sudden\\xa0\\r\\nsevere thrombocytopenia so ditp or drug-induced\\xa0\\xa0 thrombocytopenia is even more strongly suspected\\xa0\\r\\nwhen a patient has repeated episodes of a sudden\\xa0\\xa0 severe drop in the platelet count by far the\\xa0\\r\\nmost common drugs that cause this are things like\\xa0\\xa0 quinidine the blood thinner heparin and then also\\xa0\\r\\nsulfonylureas like trimethoprim saltomethoxazole\\xa0\\xa0 aka bactrim and also there's other antibiotics\\xa0\\r\\nthat are fairly common that cause this as well\\xa0\\xa0 so it's not just drugs that can cause this\\xa0\\r\\nbut also certain foods herbal remedies and one\\xa0\\xa0 vaccine the mmr vaccine the risk of itp occurring\\xa0\\r\\nwithin six weeks after getting the mmr vaccination\\xa0\\xa0 is increased however the attributable risk of\\xa0\\r\\nthrombocytopenia within six weeks after mmr\\xa0\\xa0 vaccination remains overall low at one in 25 000\\xa0\\r\\nvaccinated children now complications or long-term\\xa0\\xa0 consequences of itp in this age group are rare\\xa0\\r\\nfor the majority of children less than six years\\xa0\\xa0 of age the illness is self-limiting vaccines\\xa0\\r\\nstimulate the immune system and in theory could\\xa0\\xa0 in rare cases cause it to mistakenly identify some\\xa0\\r\\nof a patient's own cells as enemy invaders that\\xa0\\xa0 should be destroyed but with that said millions\\xa0\\r\\nof various vaccinations are given every year\\xa0\\xa0 and clusters of thrombocytopenia don't occur and\\xa0\\r\\nregarding the covid vaccine millions of doses\\xa0\\xa0 have been given and so far there are no other\\xa0\\r\\nreports or associations with low platelet counts\\xa0\\xa0 so did the pfizer vaccine cause this based on the\\xa0\\r\\ntiming of things it seems like it but it's too\\xa0\\xa0 early to come to a conclusion one way or another\\xa0\\r\\nwe have to know all the facts and understand the\\xa0\\xa0 autopsy report but even then it's still not a\\xa0\\r\\nguarantee that we come to a solid conclusion\\xa0\\xa0 although this is an incredibly sad story and even\\xa0\\r\\nif it does prove that the vaccine did cause this\\xa0\\xa0 i hope people aren't dissuaded from getting\\xa0\\r\\nthe vaccine because this type of thing is still\\xa0\\xa0 very incredibly rare every decision we make\\xa0\\r\\nin medicine is based on risk versus benefit\\xa0\\xa0 and when you compare the risks of covid\\xa0\\r\\nand the risks and benefits of the vaccine\\xa0\\xa0 the benefits outweigh the risks for the vast\\xa0\\r\\nmajority of people in fact there are lots of\\xa0\\xa0 covet patients in the intensive care unit that\\xa0\\r\\nhave thrombocytopenia so that is something\\xa0\\xa0 else to put in perspective knowing more details\\xa0\\r\\nabout this case might help us to better devise\\xa0\\xa0 treatment plans in case this happens again and\\xa0\\r\\nother people after they get the vaccine but\\xa0\\xa0 i doubt we're going to hear many more cases like\\xa0\\r\\nthis anyway that's all i have for this video\\xa0\\xa0 thanks for

       " \" [Music] a newly peer-reviewed study from the Cleveland Clinic found that the risk of covid-19 varied by the number of covid-19 vaccine doses previously received and the higher the number of vaccines previously received the higher the risk of Contracting covid-19 popular YouTuber and comedian who has been a prominent skeptic over vaccines and mandates throughout the pandemic Jimmy Dore tweeted FYI it's not a vaccine it's a failed experiment we are the guinea pigs all right take these findings with a grain of salt but this is interesting because the first this first came out earlier this year I think around February and there was a lot of pushback at that time part of the pushback was that it was not a peer-reviewed study it was just what's known as a preprint now we're talking about this again because it has been peer reviewed and the parts of the study that raised a red flag to some vaccine Skeptics are still there in the study yeah yeah go ahead yeah so the the the authors of the study note that this is unexpected like I don't think these are people who were these are not like anti-vaccine people who are setting out to disprove the efficacy of vaccines and so so they're saying there was an association of increased risk of covid-19 with higher number of Prior vaccine doses importantly and it was not because so you could rationalize why that might be the case well maybe people who are getting the most um Jabs the most doses of vaccine are people who are older and higher at risk anyway so then yes they're more likely to get coveted because they're higher risk so it would just be incidental that they're more likely to get a lot of vaccines and they're more likely to get covered but that's not one doesn't have anything to do with the other however that is not the case here as they lay out of the Cleveland Clinic they're like okay we see why you might think that but the um the yeah that most of the people in this study were young people some young people can be at a high risk of covet if you have a pre-existing condition but you would not expect that to be most of the people and so they're saying that that really makes this finding um unexpected um yeah the risk yeah the people despite this their risk of acquiring covid-19 the people who had fewer injections was lower than those who'd received a larger number of Prior vaccine doses so it's worth noting that the overall conclusions of the study is that the vaccines do work to buy valence specific valent vaccine work to lower the incidence of covid right they work that this is not a the study is not saying that in that ultimate conclusion should be taken into account the question is whether at a certain point requiring or suggesting that people get multiple vaccines at a certain point that they're whether there is diminishing returns so there's we should distinguish between getting a vaccine or incrementally boosted versus a certain volume that seems to have an unexpected effect the paper also notes that this is not the only study to find a possible association with more prior vaccine Doses and higher risk of covet 19. during an Omicron wave in Iceland individuals who had previously received two or more doses were found to have a higher odds of reinfection than those who had received fewer than two doses of vaccine and an unadjusted analysis and it goes through some um kind of technical scientific reasons why this might be happening something called immune imprinting and some stuff with the spike protein that I think is beyond the technical uh know how of us here but it is being interpreted as validating some concerns and some anecdotal evidence that people have had that folks in their lives who got more vaccinations and more boosts seem to have succumbed to the virus more frequently than those people who only maybe got the first round or what have you again I could see for a very at-risk population or the elderly you might say well even if this is increasing the chance you get coveted honestly the odds of getting you know when a wave comes through you have good odds of getting it anyway you want if you're an elderly person or immuno compromised person the protection from the dose is more important than some slightly increased odds that you would get it in the first place the odds being that you were going to get it anyway however to you know to repeatedly boost younger people who are healthy otherwise over and over again they might be saying well you know if I get it I get it but I'd rather not I'd rather not increase my risk of getting it because if I get it I'm probably gonna not have such a bad time with it and maybe I was you know you were maybe you were vaccinated originally and we're just talking about subsequent doses or maybe you had it before they're actually in this paper it does say that um the multivariate analysis also found the more recent the last prior covet episode the lower risk of covid saying again that's the you know some kind of enduring natural immunity um and I just keep thinking how you know the the places in our society that are still trying to take this decision away from individuals like University campuses where the bivalent some of them is going to be required still in the fall uh that that can like how how naive and and and and unscientific it is to take that decision out of out of people and their doctors and then also the kind of the attempts to suppress um criticism of vaccines you know calling it all misinformation that has occurred online and and Elsewhere for the last three years so short-sighted so a couple of things first it should be noted that this was an unexpected observation in this study and they in the study say that the it needs to be steady further uh so that is you know it's we We I Wouldn't draw too many hard and fast conclusions though I take Jimmy Dora's point that it does feel like if there is in fact a negative result like making people more vulnerable to getting covered and they're just saying well we should have studied this more I can understand people feeling like they are guinea pigs in this situation right that there there should have been more of this kind of research that happened earlier but there was a real hesitancy to do so when we were in the throes of the pandemic but it's also worth noting that the objective or the biggest gain of getting vaccinated we've now known for a long time is preventing hospitalization so this study is talking about whether or not people are more susceptible to access coming to the virus but there's a whole separate conversation about whether or not it's preventing you from having the worst outcomes here so for young people who already tend not to have the worst outcomes I think that's a really interesting question that you're raising about college campuses and the like for even older people there could be a calculation that says sure you might be this percent more likely to catch covid than you might not if you had gotten multiple boosters but if you hadn't gotten boosted you might end up in the hospital or be more likely to die so it's better just to basically like take on more softer waves than to wait for the one big one to take this is yet more or this is another point of data in the column of the group of people for which it is least justifiable if you think it's justifiable at all to require them to get vaccinated is actually the population where the the requirements were most likely school-aged populations sure yeah and I that's just that's so people are going to feel I think so gaslit about all this stuff saying again the the initial promise may be implicitly I guess but a lot of people in the media reported it was that everybody has to get vaccinated we're really encouraging it where we're not requiring it outright we're encouraging it because this is how we're going to stop the spread and we're going to you know get rid of covid because when we have her immunity because you're no longer going to be able to transmit it or get it when you're vaccinated that didn't pan out and like on and on and on and on and on yeah that I I you know not under selling the vaccines I understand that they are the findings are still that they're very protective against severe decent disease and death for at-risk populations but the the logic of the requirements was really for the public health rationale was really on stopping cases yeah I totally get get that and I agree that that was the rationale but it hasn't been out for some time yeah and so I just think from a public health perspective as people are considering these kind of studies it's important to really emphasize that the goal the stated goal for some time now has been to prevent hospitalization and death and that vaccines including this study show that there is a significant benefit when the vaccine is correlated to the stream that's happening it does effectively lower hospitalization uh in depth here right but again you could have a more targeted even based on this study you could say are you in this risk category yeah look at this study you would benefit from vaccination on net you would benefit because even if you're increasing your likelihood of getting covid the protection is is important for severe indices and death you are in this this categorization you're a healthy young person and really all you're doing by getting you know your fifth or something dose is making it a slightly more likely you're going to get covered or whatever it is and that doesn't make as much sense for you and and we and we have not had that Approach at all and people are going to feel anything just valuably outraged and I think that people like Jimmy Dore who are saying well where was all this research why hasn't there been more research about what's going on with covid I think are completely right and I think there also needs to be a sensitivity to and frustration about the lack of research with respect to Long covet as well whatever you think about it the or whether or not it's credible or whether you're skeptical about how how real it is as a phenomenon the reality is that we are out of ignorance about what's going on allowing the government to basically ratchet back any protections any long-term health care support for people with long covet any way to protect protect themselves against it and also insulating the manufacturers of vaccines from any liability there's a whole mixed bag of shielding that's happening for people who are going to have outcomes one way or the other and I do think that before we are overly interested in saying well I don't think that long covet is a thing because it's being used as a pretext for the government to have overreach also downplaying the possibility of long covet having this effect that's being used as an excuse for the government to not have any responsibility for policies that may have set up a significant portion of the American public to be dealing with a crisis a Health crisis where we don't have Universal Health Care long after the government has washed its hands of all of it well I mean as you know I remain um extremely skeptical of a lot of long-covered claims however if and I I don't know what should be studied I mean it should be studied and I don't really know what people who are very worried about law and covid I'm not sure what the state of their claims are with respect to like is it worse if you've gotten a more coveted more times or is it is it correlated with the severity of the infection severity of so if you've gotten it if you get covered a bunch of times but none of them were severe you're not going to get it's no it's also correlated with a number so that's what I'm getting at so so a vaccine that makes you if you're again in a population where you're not at severe risk of it's going to make you more likely to get it maybe from a long coveted perspective that is I mean that kind of cuts both ways but that's why I agree with everyone who's looking for profound scripture more more more research and more studies and I do think there is a real issue with there being so much delay here in getting some of this kind of information out well we'll have more Rising right after this foreign [Music]\": 0.49032323587742344,\n",

Right now, there’s about 7 billion\\xa0\\r\\npeople all waiting for the same thing:\\xa0\\xa0 A vaccine that will protect us\\xa0\\r\\nfrom the virus causing COVID-19. And if you’re like me you want to know\\xa0\\r\\nwhat’s in it…\\xa0 what makes it work?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Making a vaccine and getting it out to the\\xa0\\r\\npublic is a long process with a lot of steps,\\xa0\\xa0 so we can make sure the\\xa0\\r\\nvaccine is safe and effective.\\xa0 And it’s pretty typical for\\xa0\\r\\nthat to take ten years or more, In an emergency, like this pandemic,\\xa0\\r\\nwell… we can’t skip any of those steps,\\xa0\\xa0 but we can speed this up by\\xa0\\r\\ndoing some at the same time But none of that can happen until\\xa0\\r\\nyou figure out the first step:\\xa0\\xa0 What do you put in your vaccine\\xa0\\r\\nthat will make it protect people. …and it’s what we’re going to talk about today. We’re gonna visit a lab and meet some\\xa0\\r\\nscientists who study the coronavirus.\\xa0\\xa0 We’re also gonna meet a really big Awesome\\xa0\\r\\nScience Machine, and learn how they used\\xa0\\xa0 it to design this: the key ingredient\\xa0\\r\\ninside the very first COVID-19 vaccines. Here’s my goal with this video: To show you\\xa0\\r\\nwhat exactly is in the new COVID vaccines\\xa0\\xa0 that makes them work—and how they got\\xa0\\r\\nmade faster than any vaccine in history.\\xa0\\xa0 My hope is that you’ll be better\\xa0\\r\\ninformed when you get your shot,\\xa0\\xa0 and you’ll have a new appreciation for\\xa0\\r\\nwhy science like this is so important. This is how to make a COVID-19 vaccine. It turns out that some of the most\\xa0\\r\\nimportant research for making the\\xa0\\xa0 COVID-19 vaccine is happening\\xa0\\r\\nright down the road from me… …at the University of Texas—which is pretty\\xa0\\r\\ncool. Because I did my PhD right *here*,\\xa0\\xa0 and in *here* is the lab of… Dr. Jason McLellan. He studies how pathogens\\xa0\\r\\nlike the coronavirus cause disease… There are four human coronaviruses that occur\\xa0seasonally and generally cause the common cold.\\xa0\\xa0 And then there've been three coronaviruses\\xa0that have caused pandemics.\\xa0\\xa0 And that's the first SARS\\xa0\\r\\ncoronavirus back in 2002,\\xa0\\xa0 the MERS coronavirus in 2012. And now\\xa0\\r\\nSARS-CoV-2, which emerged earlier this year. So at the end of December, 2019, it was on the\\xa0\\r\\nnews that there’s these pneumonia clusters in\\xa0\\xa0 China. Uh, in the scientific community, we thought\\xa0\\r\\nmaybe a new flu virus or possibly a coronavirus.\\xa0 I was actually snowboarding with my family and\\xa0\\r\\nmy collaborator, Barney Graham at the vaccine\\xa0\\xa0 research center at the NIH called. And he\\xa0\\r\\nsaid, he's been in contact with US CDC,\\xa0\\xa0 Chinese CDC. Uh, it looks like it's a\\xa0\\r\\nbetacoronavirus similar to SARS coronavirus, and\\xa0\\xa0 they want it to move rapidly, try and make a\\xa0\\r\\nvaccine. And I said, we're definitely in… So you're just like scrolling\\xa0\\r\\nthrough your phone. in this ski\\xa0\\xa0 lodge, and you're\\xa0\\r\\nlike we gotta get to work! So while the rest of us were\\xa0\\r\\nfocused on royal family drama\\xa0\\xa0 and just hearing the first mentions of\\xa0\\r\\n“coronavirus” for the very first time,\\xa0\\xa0 scientists like Jason knew this was serious,\\xa0\\r\\nand they were already getting to work. As soon as researchers in China decoded\\xa0\\r\\nthe virus’ genome and published it online,\\xa0\\xa0 Jason’s lab could start designing a vaccine…\\r\\nI texted Daniel Wrapp my graduate student\\xa0\\xa0 and let them know be on high alert\\xa0\\r\\nbecause as soon as we get the sequence,\\xa0\\xa0 we're going to race on this thing\\xa0\\r\\nand move as quickly as we can. Jason was on that winter vacation and texted\\xa0\\r\\nme that it was a CoronavirusAnd eventually\\xa0\\xa0 in early January, the sequence\\xa0\\r\\nwas released online publicly. That's when the clock started ticking because we\\xa0\\xa0 knew a bunch of people were\\xa0\\r\\ngoing to be working on this. Uh, and then things started moving pretty quickly… Let’s step back for a minute.\\xa0\\r\\nWhat does a vaccine do?\\xa0\\xa0 It trains your immune system to\\xa0\\r\\nknow what a germ, like a virus,\\xa0\\xa0 looks like. So it can recognize the germ, fight it\\xa0\\r\\noff, and keep you safe, without you getting sick. This is the virus that causes COVID-19.\\xa0\\r\\nThe outer shell is made of a few different\\xa0\\xa0 kinds of proteins, butthese proteins\\xa0\\r\\nsticking off the side are the most\\xa0\\xa0 important part. The spike.These spikes are\\xa0\\r\\nwhat give this family of viruses their name:\\xa0\\xa0 The coronaviruses, because\\xa0\\r\\nthey look kinda like a crown. The coronavirus uses that spike to sneak\\xa0\\r\\ninto our cells. The 3-dimensional shape of\\xa0\\xa0 that spike is super important, because that\\xa0\\r\\nexact shape is what lets the virus latch on\\xa0\\xa0 to receptors on the outside of our cells … almost\\xa0\\r\\nlike picking a lock. And then, it sneaks inside. Those shapes sticking out on the outside of\\xa0\\r\\na virus are also what your immune system is\\xa0\\xa0 feeling for, to figure out if this is a\\xa0\\r\\nforeign invader, if it should attack or not. The problem is, the first time your body sees a\\xa0\\r\\nvirus, your immune system responds so slowly that\\xa0\\xa0 the virus has time to make gazillions of copies\\xa0\\r\\nof itself, and you can still get very, very sick. That’s what’s great about a vaccine. It\\xa0\\r\\ntrains your immune system what to look for,\\xa0\\xa0 so when the real virus shows up,\\xa0\\xa0 your body can respond super fast—and destroy the\\xa0\\r\\nvirus before it has a chance to hijack your cells. So what’s actually in a vaccine? Sometimes,\\xa0\\r\\na vaccine has a weakened or dead virus.\\xa0\\xa0 That’s how polio and measles and\\xa0\\r\\nmumps and some other vaccines work.\\xa0 But these days, a vaccine usually just\\xa0\\r\\ncontains a little piece of the virus. The newest COVID-19 vaccines?\\xa0\\r\\nThey’re just the spike. But for that spike to work as a vaccine, to train\\xa0\\r\\nyour immune system to recognize the actual virus,\\xa0\\xa0 it has to have the same 3-dimensional shape\\xa0\\r\\nas the spike on the whole, complete virus. But making the spike all by itself,\\xa0\\xa0 not attached to the rest of the\\xa0\\r\\nvirus, turns out to be really hard. Because the spike is actually pretty\\xa0\\r\\nfloppy just floating around on its own. It doesn’t look much like the\\xa0\\r\\nspike on the actual virus. And this is the key thing Jason’s lab figured\\xa0\\r\\nout how to make.\\xa0 For years they’d studied SARS\\xa0\\xa0 and MERS viruses, which are really closely\\xa0\\r\\nrelated to the virus that causes COVID.\\xa0 So they already knew what tiny tweaks\\xa0\\r\\nto make to freeze coronavirus spikes\\xa0\\xa0 in the perfect shape. Um, so we got to work\\xa0\\r\\ndesigning our stabilizing mutations into the\\xa0\\xa0 new spike sequence. There was just two amino acids\\xa0\\r\\nthat we knew would, uh, if we mutated them that\\xa0\\xa0 would stabilize the spike protein and make it\\xa0a lot easier to work with in the laboratory. A protein, like the coronavirus spike…\\xa0 ...is a long, folded string of\\xa0\\r\\nindividual units called amino acids. And these strings of amino acids are built\\xa0\\r\\nusing code written in RNA, and stored in DNA*. By changing, or “mutuating” the letters of\\xa0\\r\\nDNA code, we can change the amino acids in\\xa0\\xa0 our protein string. So that's cool. You're like\\xa0\\r\\nbuilding scaffolding into the protein, to be like\\xa0\\xa0 “freeze in this shape.”\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Yeah, that's a good way to put it.\\xa0 How do you get from there to\\xa0\\r\\nmaking the actual spike protein? I can show you…\\xa0 Scientists are able to grow special immortal\\xa0\\r\\nhuman cells outside the body which they use as\\xa0\\xa0 factories. They put a modified gene for something\\xa0\\r\\nlike their spike protein, into those cells… …and then they'll start spitting out this protein So they're just pumping it\\xa0\\r\\nout into the liquid, right? Yeah, that's right. They take that liquid, run it through\\xa0\\r\\nspecial purification machines,\\xa0\\xa0 and are able to isolate a pure\\xa0\\r\\nsample of their spike protein. But how do they know for sure\\xa0\\r\\nthat this special spike protein\\xa0\\xa0 looks like the real thing, 3-D shape\\xa0\\r\\nand all? They take pictures of it… …using a big Awesome Science Machine. (VO) This is a cryo-electron microscope.\\xa0 This machine took a 3D picture\\xa0\\r\\nof the coronavirus spike,\\xa0\\xa0 and helped design the first COVID-19 vaccines Check out the big science machine! It looks like a giant microwave Am I ok to walk up here? Yeah, it’s ok. I mean the room is a million\\xa0\\r\\ndollars, and the microscope is another million.\\xa0 So you’re saying don’t touch\\xa0\\r\\nthis screen right here. You can see the floor is separate\\xa0\\r\\nfrom the instrument, it’s on its\\xa0\\xa0 own, free-floating. So vibrations are bad.\\r\\nThese are wall panels that contain water\\xa0\\xa0 running behind them to keep the\\xa0\\r\\ntemperature constant in the room. Oh wow, that’s… Then it also has to be\\xa0\\r\\nelectromagnetically shielded too.\\xa0 That is nuts. Look at this beefy cable over here. That’s the high-tension, that’s the\\xa0\\r\\n200,000 volts comin in over here Oh ok, so don’t lick that one! Oh this is… Sciencey! Look at all that science happening in there.\\xa0 It’s kind of a marvel of physics and engineering. Joe N (OS): Can you play Doom on this thing?\\xa0 Um, some of our computers you\\xa0\\r\\ncan play Far Cry at max settings. So maybe this sounds like a super stupid question,\\xa0\\xa0 but why can't you just use a regular light\\xa0\\r\\nmicroscope to take a picture of a protein? Well, the wavelength of visible light is\\xa0\\r\\non the order of hundreds of nanometers. And that means the smallest things\\xa0\\r\\nyou can see with visible light are\\xa0\\xa0 also on the scale of hundreds of nanometers. But what we want to see—the atoms in a\\xa0\\r\\nprotein molecule—they’re angstroms apart,\\xa0\\xa0 tenths of a nanometer, so\\xa0\\r\\nwe can’t use visible light.\\xa0 We have to use a special electron microscope.\\r\\nSo super high energy electrons make very\\xa0\\xa0 tiny wavelengths, which lets you see\\xa0\\r\\nvery, very small resolution things. Okay. I want a camera like that. That's\\xa0\\r\\nbetter than 4k. We can go angstrom-K.\\xa0 So, to take a 3D picture of a protein\\xa0\\r\\nwith a cryo-electron microscope,\\xa0\\xa0 first you put a drop of protein\\xa0\\r\\nonto a special metal grid.\\xa0 Then you freeze it in place with liquid ethane.\\xa0\\r\\nWhen we shoot a beam of electrons at it,those\\xa0\\xa0 proteins will be in all kinds of random\\xa0\\r\\norientations, some like this, some like that. Each orientation leaves a particular “shadow”. Powerful computers look at all those 2D\\xa0\\r\\nimages, and combine them into a final 3D shape. It’s kind of like using a bunch of 2D\\xa0\\r\\nphotos of someone’s head to make a 3D model. And when Jason and Daniel and their team\\xa0\\r\\nlooked at the spike they made, with their\\xa0\\xa0 tiny little tweaks and mutations, their spike has\\xa0\\r\\nthe same 3D shape as the spike on the whole virus. Now we can put that spike into people, and see if\\xa0\\r\\nit trains their immune system, and protects them\\xa0\\xa0 from the real virus. And? It works. This protects\\xa0\\r\\npeople from COVID-19. The research you just saw,\\xa0\\xa0 from those scientists, is literally what’s\\xa0\\r\\nbeing used in the very first COVID-19 vaccines. And some of those vaccines work in a\\xa0\\r\\nreally cool way. Instead of having to\\xa0\\xa0 make the actual spike protein, in big factories,\\xa0\\r\\nwith huge tanks of cells like the ones we saw…\\xa0\\xa0 some of these new vaccines, the genetic\\xa0\\r\\ninstructions for making the spike is\\xa0\\xa0 all that’s in the shot, on a molecule called mRNA. Your body uses those instructions to\\xa0\\r\\nmake the spike. YOU are the factory.\\xa0 That’s awesome. This is a really incredible piece\\xa0\\r\\nof science. A year ago, no one had ever seen this\\xa0\\xa0 virus before, and thanks to these scientists\\xa0\\r\\nand thousands of others around the world,\\xa0\\xa0 now we have vaccines that work. It’s gonna take months, maybe years to get these\\xa0\\r\\nvaccines, and the dozens of others still being\\xa0\\xa0 worked on, to the billions of people that need\\xa0\\r\\nthem, and that is a huge challenge on its own. But this is a really hopeful story. No\\xa0\\r\\nvaccine in history has ever been invented\\xa0\\xa0 this fast, and we were able to do it safely.\\xa0 And we were able to do this so quickly\\xa0\\r\\nbecause scientists like Jason and his lab\\xa0\\xa0 and others, they were ready. Because they\\xa0\\r\\nwere studying basic scientific questions about\\xa0\\xa0 other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, they’ve\\xa0\\r\\nspent years trying to figure out their secrets,\\xa0\\xa0 so when this one showed up, they were\\xa0\\r\\nalready ten steps ahead. And to me,\\xa0\\xa0 that’s why work like this—supporting basic\\xa0\\r\\nresearch—is so important, and why we need it. Stay curious…\": 0.5101237980475269,\n",
       " \" well welcome to today's talk it's Sunday the 4th of February 2024 now in my country we have something called prime minister's question time where members of parliament can ask the Prime Minister questions now this was the British prime minister last Wednesday the 31st of January not 2021 but 2024 just a few days ago prime minister let me be unequivocal from this dispatch box that Co vaccines are safe Mr speaker now I know that you'll be struggling with credulity at this point so I don't want to quote the Prime Minister out of context so let's look at the context now Mr Andrew bridgen asks the question and Richie sunak the Prime Minister answers the question let's just watch the whole exchange only lasts for a couple of minutes brid thank you Mr Speaker more than two decades ago the then prime minister Tony Blair misled this house by promoting and endorsing the post office Horizon it system as perfect protecting the large corporation that created it and causing Untold harm and damage and misery to innocent people can the current prime minister think of anything he has promoted in partnership with huge businesses as safe and effective which has ultimately harmed the British people and will he use this opportunity to correct that safe and effective statement or will he choose the same line as Tony Blair sit back do nothing and let the misery just continue to pile up Prim Minister Mr Speaker as we've been clear the Horizon Scandal is a terrible miscarriage of justice and we're doing everything that we can to make it right and to what he was more broadly insinuating let me be unequivocal from this dispatch box that covid vaccines are safe Mr speaker now your Member of Parliament May well have been if you live live in the UK one of those that was poo pooing Mr bridgen when he said safe and effective and he may your elected member May well have been one of the ones that were cheering when Mr Richie sunak said the vaccines are safe notice he didn't say they were effective this time but he did say they were safe now let's just look at some more information on this here now this is the uh the channel where you can watch that that's the official UK uh Parliament Channel where it's all available check out the link for yourself and we also have this document called Hansard which records everything and that's the link for that check it out for yourself can the current uh prime minister think of anything he has promoted in partnership with huge business as safe and effective but has ultimately harmed the British people so clearly Mr bridgen there is talking about the vaccines and gives the Prime Minister an opportunity to uh correct previous errors now the Prime Minister here is talking about the Horizon now this Horizon Scandal there was this terrible thing where postmasters were accused of theft and it wasn't it was the computer system goes way back to Tony blle you might have heard of him something to do with was it an invasion of Iraq or something like that something like that anyway um sticking to the point um this Horizon was uh Scandal was ignored but recently Von clean and the these poor innocent people who suffered uh greatly have been completely exonerated although not adequately compensated yet the analogies are there Mr bridon of course did advocate for the Horizon victims in his own constituency quite strongly at the time but again was poo pooed as he is now so he was drawing this kind of analogy there so the Prime Minister had this opportunity to say just a minute but he actually said this let me be unequivocal so let me be une equivocal and is I think when he said unequivocal is that the point where he banged his hand down and said this is unequivocal and this is from the dispatch box now in the UK that means it's it's this dispatch box that the Prime Minister talks from in Parliament basically is saying by the authority vested in me as the British prime minister uh covid vaccines are safe and effective sry that are cross out safe there my mistake um so there you go now I'm not just blaming I am cont CRI critiquing Mr sunak of course unequivocally I am um I think he's wrong but we have a we have his Majesty's opposition in this country that are supposed to say just a minute government let me get you in check here so Richie sunak says something K starm with the leader of the opposition should be on his feet in second saying just a minute what about way back to the Joseph frayman paper what about the yellow card data what about all the international data that shows unequivocal evidence of vaccine harms no nothing Ju Ju Just huray and they went on to the next point so there we have it that was the uh they were the exchanges in the British Parliament British prime minister 31st of January 2024 let me be unequivocal from this dispatch box that covid vaccines are safe unbelievable but at least it didn't say effective now just a couple of uh lighter points now to finish off with we did a video a few days ago I know quite a of you saw it on icin use in Africa and those patients that were treated with icin in Africa for the scab bees are just virtually cured I'm going to be showing some videos that I've just been sent a couple of days ago I might do them tomorrow don't think we' got time today um but um I made an error in the video so as always I'll come back to apology olog um so apologies and correction from from John about a mistake I made in that video in this video I wrongly say that the scabies might are insects they are not they are correctly classified as a Radia uh this is because the adult might have eight legs as spiders do so they're in the same group as spiders not insects and of course even someone who's done school biology knows that spy all insects have six legs uh and the might are actually 0.2 to 0.4 5 mm not 10 times bigger as I said sorry I simply put the decimal point in the wrong place so my apologies for that and um hopefully normal service will be resumed so my mistake sorry if I've misled anyone but the content of the video uh and the videoos of course absolutely valid totally valid IV mein uh in combination with hygiene and cleaning the clothes basically eradicated The Wretched curse of gab is from that family and with many others that's just one we chose to video from our community health project in in Africa now I'm going to read a couple of the comments from that video now as we've said before there's a whole qualitative research project in looking at these video comments if anyone bothered to do it but I'm just going to read out a couple of comments on the uh from the Iva meon and scab's video now this says um um I'm not going to read out the names of the commentators but you can look at it they're all there they're in the public domain during the pandemic I caught the Delta version of the size Corona virus to and was very sick Strangely I contacted scab the same week not wanting to infect my doctor I phon my doctor and managed to get a prescription of icin a day later I was better so excellent glad to hear that very strange coincidence getting skabes and Delta variant all at the same time although I must say personally I do keep Ivon in the house just in case I get scabies another one here um my brother Dr William Colby started the icton distribution program in the Congo Basin in the 1980s 1 billion Doses and not one complaint now this is doses given to human beings not to horses not to cows to human beings a billion Doses and not one complaint according to this comment I have noticed that there is absolutely no Co in the covid base and not even in the G refugee camp where there is TB and starvation nothing to see here can't possibly comment of course but um congratulations to Dr William Kobe for starting the Ivon distrib distribution program in Congo in the 1980s and there's many other comments I'm just going to give you the gist of one of them again I'm not just I'm just reporting what's been commented don't know if they're true or not can't tell it's just comments but they're in the public domain you can read them for yourself um I've had long covid and I've been on oxygen at 5 liters for 2 years 247 um and at some point this commentator says I found some 12 12 milligram tablets of irtin in 24 hours my oxygen saturation levels Rose to prec covid level my mind cleared overnight from the fog my ears are ringing and improving my eyesight is improved today I went to my old doctor to show him your video he already was ahead of me he prescribed 40 milligrams a day for two weeks but I told him I would like to try 20 milligrams per day because 12 migam rocked my world and increased the level if needed um a little more detail about the individual there this has been a miracle in my life no machine day or night and I assum he was referring to the oxygen concentration machine um and he also refers to some personal tragedy so they're they're in the comments there now of course I have no idea whether they're correct or not they're just comments and whatever you do do not take medicines based on what we say on this um Channel we do not prescribe you need to go to your doctor for that but interesting that those things are in the comments and again congratulations to Dr William kobby for His Brilliant work in the Congo eradicating things like river blindness and uh uh elephantiasis the massive swelling of the limbs the terrible blindness and of course huge range of other parasitic diseases and now almost certainly IA Ian eradicating um scab as well although scab Beast keeps cropping up because people keep getting reinfected so there we go uh let me know what you think of the

       " ' Vaccines prepare the immune system, getting\\r\\nit ready to fight disease-causing organisms, called pathogens. A vaccine is introduced to the body to mimic\\r\\ninfection, triggering the body to produce antibodies against the pathogen, but without\\r\\ncausing the illness. Conventional vaccines usually contain a weakened\\r\\nor inactivated pathogen; or a piece of a protein produced by the pathogen, called an antigen. RNA vaccines are a new generation of vaccines. Instead of the antigen itself, RNA vaccines\\r\\ncontain a messenger RNA – mRNA - that encodes for the antigen. Once inside the body’s cells, the mRNA is\\r\\ntranslated into protein, the antigen, by the same process the cells use to make their own\\r\\nproteins. The antigen is then displayed on the cell\\r\\nsurface where it is recognized by the immune system. From here, the sequence of events is similar\\r\\nto that of a conventional vaccine. Some RNA vaccines also contain additional\\r\\nmRNA coding for an enzyme, which, after being translated in host cells, can generate multiple\\r\\ncopies of the antigen-encoding mRNA. This essentially amplifies the production\\r\\nof antigen from a small amount of vaccine, making the vaccine more effective. These are called self-amplifying RNA vaccines. RNA vaccines are easier and safer to produce\\r\\nthan conventional vaccines. This is because mRNA molecules can be synthesized\\r\\nin a cell-free system using a DNA template with a sequence of the pathogen; while conventional\\r\\nvaccines usually require a more complicated and risk-prone process of growing large amounts\\r\\nof infectious pathogens in chicken eggs or other mammalian cells. Without the risks of being contaminated by\\r\\ninfectious elements or allergens from egg cultures, RNA vaccines are also safer for\\r\\npatients. Because protein synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm,\\r\\nRNA molecules do not need to enter the nucleus, so the possibility of them integrating into\\r\\nthe host cell genome is low. RNA strands are usually degraded by cellular\\r\\nenzymes once the protein is made. The relative simplicity of the production\\r\\nprocess makes it easier to standardize and scale, enabling rapid responses to emerging\\r\\npandemics. Other advantages include lower production\\r\\ncosts, and the ease of tweaking RNA sequences to adapt to rapidly-mutating pathogens. On the minus side, it can be challenging to\\r\\ndeliver mRNA effectively to the cells, since RNA sequences and secondary structures may\\r\\nbe recognized and destroyed by the innate immune system as soon as they are administered\\r\\nintravenously. These limitations can be overcome by optimizing\\r\\ncodons, using modified nucleosides to avoid recognition, and packaging RNA into protective\\r\\nnanoparticles. Another disadvantage is that most RNA vaccines\\r\\nrequire uninterrupted refrigeration for transportation and storage, which can be a hurdle for vaccine\\r\\ndistribution. Research is ongoing to engineer thermostable\\r\\nvaccines.': 0.4286028487641391,\n",

the kennel master we do have a kennel master there he's an MA like most most at least most places in the Navy have him and we had to run a blue gold schedule because they didn't want us all there um and training you know we were kind of Off the Grid so no one knew we really existed kind of so we got away with you know doing what we wanted to do wasn't too bad to me it's fascinating and alarming that uh the whole Co experience had the impact that it had on our military well it got me out yeah forced me out really yeah I didn't take it no [\\xa0__\\xa0] I I refused it in my uh EOS lined up and it was a complete and utter abortion and Alleyway for me because I had to put a religious R waiver in like most guys Kick the Can down the road long enough until it was my time to go and I literally made the choice I think I got out in like 61 days wow no plan no job no nothing no doubt no kids or two kids in a family just said nope this doesn't feel right guys I'm sorry it just doesn't feel right and uh and unfortunately it wasn't what the brochur said the experience anymore so it was taking my smile so it was time for me not good for you I I I applaud that I think uh how do you how does it sit with you now looking back and seeing the military saying hey if you want to come back in cuz you didn't do it you know you're welcome like how many of those guys are like [\\xa0__\\xa0] you I'm not coming back in do you know anybody that's come back in no and all the guys were already at that point of [\\xa0__\\xa0] you yeah because of how they were being treated the guys that were saying hey this doesn't feel right I don't think I agree with this I mean they got railroaded oh man I mean I know I know on the I know on the west coast they were pretty powerful movement over there and on the East Coast they just coralled these dudes in an office and said check in every day we don't care you know like it was you're black bald man like it was yeah they wanted you under ma supervision I mean it was what dude guys were for not getting the shot guys were fighting for their lives man dude what fighting for their lives dude it was crazy um dude that's that's embarrassing it's very embarrassing and uh it got to the point with me my wife and I were you know holding tight saying hey well we feel this way then we're being told it's time to get to leave yeah wow um but I I I feel like you like you to answer your question I feel like it's complete UT dog [\\xa0__\\xa0] that they're going welcome people back they kicked out yeah I mean there's no way I would do it absolutely not matter of fact I'm going to come after you and probably sue you to be honest with you yeah I think I think they should yep uh do you know about how many guys ref like how many no [\\xa0__\\xa0] active duty seals refused the shot and were forced out of the military I don't have that number ballpark dozens hundreds I would say dozens because I know in the West CO I think the the group in the west coast that kind of started it like Hey we're going to lawyer up this doesn't feel right it was a pretty big group of dudes I don't think it I think it was somewhere 10 or more and I know in the on the East Coast it was guys were on a daily mission like well if I don't do this and I got you know and that was another dozen two dozen dudes that were in a holding pattern of what their future was going to be and these weren't all like new guys This Is War you know veterans that were like this does not feel right that's absurd yep absolutely absurd yep um so all right so you play that game long enough to at least get out without having to kicked out got my got my honorable which was good did the the were the guys that were forced out for not getting the shot did they get other thanor I believe so or they're getting threatened with that I believe if not dishonorable because you were getting hit by you were not you were disobeying a direct order to me this sucks for two reasons right uh actually more than two reasons but the primary two are that I get the hey when you sign up like you can't refuse all the other inoculations and you can't be like no I don't want that like this is what you're getting you signed up that's part of the deal I get that where this is different is is that you know that's not one that you signed up to get number one and number two it's like you know I mean you can argue till we're all blue in the face about the efficacy or the lack of efficacy of it but the fact that it was you know essentially experimental it was rushed through it wasn't part of the program when you signed up you know it's it's kind of an oddball you know to me from a legality standpoint it's kind of a weird grade area that way like you know where I think it's the most disheartening is that you know to take guys say look like I could understand if the Navy said we would like everybody to get it but we're not going to force you to get it you know um you can suggest of sell to me all day long yeah but I have to have a choice yeah to to me that that is how they should have handled it to to legitimately like slap your dick on the counter and say if you don't get this we're we're kicking qualified combat veteran active duty Navy Seals out of the military because you won't take this [\\xa0__\\xa0] shot to me says so much more about what what I've been bitching about since you you and I have have come in contact with each other since last night and just just the lack of overall quality leadership and the higher you go the worse it gets you know and to me this is as clear-cut of an example that exists uh you know of that um from morale standpoint from a an overall Community Vibe if you will you know you've you've gotten now how the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is there a fly flying around in here especially in this weather Bryce handle that will you um the uh from your perspective having gotten out fairly recently um how would you characterize the overall morale of of the seal Community right now I have more conversations on a weekly basis with the guys that are so lost because they lost what they feel as a part of of them when they had to inevitably leave the sealed teams before they wanted to yeah um I was one of them and I think between that instance the situation we're talking about now and then everything else because the op Tempo isn't where it was and now everyone's so focused on I hate to say but like haircuts and shaves and stuff that I understand we join the military and there has to be some bearing there I'm not going to say we're special so we should get special but we should be focused on our priority and that's defending this country at the highest level yeah and I don't think that that's necessarily the priority all the time and I think from the the mafia you know the little E5 E6 Mafia it's um they're still going to be pipe hitters and they're still going to get after it but I think that a lot of guys are really looking at it like man it's not what the brochure said yeah and I think that it's it's heartbreaking it was for me it was really difficult to to make that transition out when I wasn't done I had plenty of left in me to give to the Navy um and uh yeah like I said a lot of my buddies it's a weekly conversation on what's next what do we do next how how do we navigate this space that we didn't anticipate being in and I found my you know found my silver lining s my found my light through helping others get out with what they're entitled you know to get out with so yeah it's it's low morale is low my friend let's just to put it in nutshell very low and I'm talking with guys coming off you know coming off the birds now from deployment and you know on my Coast it's we we got to get across the street we got to get over to the command like we're trying to we want we want them to take the next step forward you know yeah I mean I think from a from a again from a big picture standpoint I you know would would beg to differ a little bit in that uh you know it's called Naval special Warfare called Special Operations know you know so so to me you know whether you're shaved or not or you're uniform looks a certain way it's like yeah you're in the military but Special Operations are unconventional unconventional by Design correct and I I think you should you should always look at like I was saying last night you know to me the the simplest question that you should always ask yourself when you're deciding whether or not to do something is does it make us a more effective War fighting force the answer is yes do it to me if if you're expecting guys to be uh as Blended in and and as um kind of autonomous as possible within the military to go execute anti terrorism and and quick strike raids and unconventional warfare to me the smart answer is will let them from a uniform and and code standpoint let them be however they need to be to be good at that you know um I think being clean shaven with a high and tight has no bearing on that and and if anything you know the amount of time that you spend going through training and getting to that point is something that very few people uh obtain and and if something as simple as letting guys have beards and out of rgg tattoos and [\\xa0__\\xa0] ponytails or Top Knots they look like Vikings or or whatever if that helps them feel more like a a Band of Brothers if it raises morale why not do it you know it's not hurting anything we need you back man we need you back bro\": 0.4792125531934448,\n",
       " ' In the 20th century, most vaccines took\\r\\nwell over a decade to research, test, and produce. But the vaccines for COVID-19 cleared \\r\\nthe threshold for emergency use in less than 11 months. The secret behind this speed \\r\\nis a medical technology that’s been developing for decades: the mRNA vaccine. This new treatment uses our body’s \\r\\nexisting cellular machinery to trigger an immune response, protecting us from viruses without\\r\\never experiencing an infection. And in the future, this approach might\\r\\nbe able to treat new diseases almost as quickly as they emerge. So how do these \\r\\nrevolutionary vaccines work? The key ingredient is in the name. mRNA, or messenger ribonucleic acid,\\r\\nis a naturally occurring molecule that encodes the instructions \\r\\nfor producing proteins. When our cells process mRNA, \\r\\na part of the cell called the ribosome translates and follows these instructions\\r\\nto build the encoded protein. The mRNA in these vaccines works\\r\\nin exactly the same way, but scientists use the molecule to safely\\r\\nintroduce our body to a virus. First, researchers encode trillions \\r\\nof mRNA molecules with the instructions for a specific viral protein. This part of the virus is\\r\\nharmless by itself, but helpful for training \\r\\nour body’s immune response. Then, they inject those molecules \\r\\ninto a nanoparticle roughly 1,000 times smaller \\r\\nthan the average cell. This nanoparticle is made of lipids, the same type of fatty material that forms\\r\\nthe membrane around our cells. But these lipids have been \\r\\nspecially engineered to protect the mRNA on its journey \\r\\nthrough the body and assist its entry into the cell. Lastly, the final ingredients are added:\\r\\nsugars and salt to help keep the nanoparticles intact \\r\\nuntil they reach their destination. Before use, the vaccine is kept at a \\r\\ntemperature of -20 to -80 degrees Celsius to ensure none of the components\\r\\nbreak down. Once injected, the nanoparticles\\r\\ndisperse and encounter cells. The lipid coating on each nanoparticle\\r\\nfuses with the lipid membrane of a cell and releases the mRNA to do its work. At this point, we should note \\r\\nthat while the vaccine is delivering viral genetic material into our cells, it’s impossible for this material \\r\\nto alter our DNA. mRNA is a short-lived molecule that would need additional enzymes and \\r\\nchemical signals to even access our DNA, let alone change it. And none of these DNA altering components\\r\\nare present in mRNA vaccines. Once inside the cell, the ribosome\\r\\ntranslates the mRNA’s instructions and begins assembling the viral protein. In COVID-19 vaccines, that protein \\r\\nis one of the spikes typically found on the virus’s surface. Without the rest of the virus \\r\\nthis lone spike is not infectious, but it does trigger our immune response. Activating the immune system\\r\\ncan be taxing on the body, resulting in brief fatigue, fever, \\r\\nand muscle soreness in some people. But this doesn’t mean \\r\\nthe recipient is sick— it means the vaccine is working. The body is producing antibodies to fight\\r\\nthat viral protein, that will then stick around to defend \\r\\nagainst future COVID-19 infections. And since this particular protein is\\r\\nlikely to be found in most COVID variants, these antibodies should reduce \\r\\nthe threat of catching new strains. This approach offers significant\\r\\nadvantages over previous vaccines. Traditional vaccines contain \\r\\nweakened versions of live viruses or amputated sections of a virus, both of which required time intensive\\r\\nresearch to prepare and unique chemical treatments\\r\\nto safely inject. But mRNA vaccines don’t actually\\r\\ncontain any viral particles, so they don’t have to be built \\r\\nfrom scratch to safely adjust each virus. In fact, every mRNA vaccine could have\\r\\nroughly the same list of ingredients. Imagine a reliable, robustly tested\\r\\nvaccine that can treat any disease by swapping out a single component. To treat a new illness, researchers would \\r\\nidentify the right viral protein, encode it into mRNA, and then swap that mRNA \\r\\ninto the existing vaccine platform. This could make it possible to develop\\r\\nnew vaccines in weeks, giving humanity a flexible new tool \\r\\nin the never-ending fight against disease.': 0.445001639774367,\n",
       " \" well a warm welcome to this talk it's Saturday the 1st of April now I want to look at the World Health Organization guidelines for vaccination have changed in the past few days do we hear the sound of back pedaling from the World Health Organization in terms of covid vaccination not exactly but let's look at it and see what they're actually saying and um some of the things that they say here are actually quite uh incredible protects the World Health Organization so it must be right so let's let's look at the material that they're giving us now so here we see um Sage update this is there this is their scientific Advisory Group of experts I believe they call it on covid-19 vaccines now note these are experts so we can trust fully what they are saying we would certainly hope because their World Health Organization experts strategic Advisory Group of experts yeah that's what they call it experts Experts of course are people who are remarkably good at something and know lots about it so we just have to sit there and say thank you great experts for giving us the benefit of your expertise so let's get that benefit now um revised roadmap for prioritization of the use of covid-19 vaccines to reflect the impact of Omicron and high population level immunity due to infection and vaccination well quite seriously this is actually really good news here we see the World Health Organization at least admitting the existence of a natural immunity which is a step in the right direction now I know this sounds absurd but quite a few governments around the world you still don't really hear government officials in the UK talking about natural immunity unfortunately even though we know natural immunity is dead good and saves us from lots of other diseases so population level immunity due to infections and vaccinations I'm welcoming them in that welcome that as a positive admission of the obvious blatantly obvious from the World Health Organization you might say it's a little belated but hey you know we can only report what they're currently saying the roadmap newly considers the cost effectiveness of covid-19 vaccines for those at lower risk is this the back pedaling that we're hearing now could be could be a little bit let's go on uh now namely for children and adolescents which of course are but much much lower risk of severe disease very very low risk especially when you combine the high levels of immunity that are currently around revised roadmap reemphasize the importance of vaccination though still at risk of severe disease they say mostly adults and those with underlying conditions now this is the chair uh Dr Hannah no neck of the uh of the World Health Organization countries should consider their specific context in deciding whether to continue vaccinating low-risk groups could be a message here for countries like oh let me think the United States for example that are still advising children over the age of six months to be vaccinated um so maybe this might be of some benefit to the decision makers in the United States let's let's hope so like a healthy children in adolescents while not compromising the routine vaccines that are so crucial to health and well-being in this age group now this is serious dead serious now a really important point about this it points out that routine childhood vaccinations such as polio and measles have been lacking over recent years now these are wretched diseases polio is a terrible debilitating disease measles kills incredible amounts of children all around the world still mostly in the poor World context and to miss out these childhood vaccinations is a real threat to the life of these young people and the idea that a covered vaccine has somehow taken priority over a polio vaccine or a measles vaccine I would find strange but it it looks like it has done over the past couple of years unfortunately so we very much agree that these routine childhood vaccinations are absolutely uh essential to Community Health and individual health high priority group now of course in the high priority group they go through the usual suspects that we you know people would expect at the elderly the people with comorbidities diabetes obesity Etc which we could argue about but we're not going to at the moment but then they actually say that healthcare workers should be uh boost this healthcare workers should be a priority group here healthcare workers we're talking about young fit working age people obviously by definition um some not so young of course um but um but basically it's it's working age people they're very often young very often incredibly healthy and here we have the World Health Organization seeing these people these people should be boosted and well healthcare workers have been exposed to the virus so many times perhaps on a daily basis for years the natural immunity and the mucosal compartment immunity will be in place and yet we have the World Health Organization saying these people should be boosted um well there you go saying they should be boosted now of course I've talked to many colleagues who are healthcare workers and uh over the past years and we've debated this matter but here's the World Health Organization guidelines uh high priority group Frontline healthcare workers including young fit athletic healthcare workers they don't differentiate um now of course this is a family channel we don't use bad language no matter how much we are tempted to do so but that's the World Health Organization guideline that that Sage group recommends an additional booster either six months or 12 months after the last dose for young fit healthcare workers who've had multiple exposures this is the recommendation from the World Health Organization and you know what we're not allowed to disagree because it's the who let's hope there's no vested interest in their uh decisions medium priority group healthy adults unusual under the age of 50 60 without comorbidities and then they say this although additional boosters are safe for this group Sage does not routinely recommend them so this was published towards the end of March 2023 and here we have the World Health Organization saying boosters are safe boosters are safe now as I've already clarified we don't use bad language on this channel so we won't be using bad language on this channel no matter how much we are tempted to do so here we have the World Health Organization despite all saying additional boosters are safe and we can't disagree okay low priority group healthy children adolescence age six months to 17 years primary and boosted doses are safe and effective in Children and adolescents well it looks like even the CDC in the FDA and the uh the UK authorities got this wrong that there's not a risk of myocarditis because safe to me means safe so there doesn't seem to be we've all got it wrong there appears to be no risk at all from these vaccines in young healthy fit male adolescence there is no risk at all to give this vaccine to young men who are otherwise perfectly healthy it's safe to do so we know that's true because of the World Health Organization is saying so sorry primary and booster doses are safe and effective in Children and adolescents that's what the World Health Organization is telling us at the end of March 2023 sorry I'm calm again now well I'm not I'm hiding it that's what they're telling us now Public Health impacts of vaccination health health of children and Adolescence is comparatively much lower than the established benefits of traditional vaccines in children now again we agree these traditional vaccines are not adenovirus Vector vaccines these traditional vaccines are not messenger ribonucleic acid vaccines they are attenuated or dead antigen which of course is what we've been protecting our children with for Generations now let's hope there's no conflation of these two ideas because they are completely separate vaccinating pregnant persons including with an additional dose of dose of more than six months have passed since the last dose protects both them and the fetus now a vaccination of pregnant persons what the heck of the World Health Organization talking about here maybe they mean pregnant women but of course we don't know because they say pregnant persons but doesn't it show what a virtuous organization the World Health Organization is because it doesn't want to insult anyone personally I prefer Clarity of communication so I think it's talking about pregnant women but we'll never know for sure because it doesn't say that we only know what the World Health Organization actually says vaccinating pregnant persons an additional dose protects both them and the fetus so again despite any data you might have heard about it looks like you were completely wrong vaccinating pregnant um persons um isn't a isn't a problem in fact it is recommended by the World Health Organization other meeting highlights included and here here seriously over polio vaccine I mean you go into any Village in India for example and um there's these terrible children with polio form deformities it really is a tragic illness and should have been eradicated decades ago it's such an indictment on Humanity that along with smallpox polio is not confined to a historical curiosity so polio vaccine no I'm not saying this without risk or polio vaccine can have transmission risks of course but um basically the polio campaign should have been finished a couple of decades ago and it's tragic that it hasn't and um I'm I'm sorry I'm just thinking of particular children that I've come across and know with these polio form deformatives and um it's it's truly wretched two truly wretched disease let's get polio eradicated with good use of oral polio vaccines and indeed other other polio vaccines let's get going with this um let's get going with that as soon as we possibly can um Regional reports on measles with measles cases increasing in all who retro regions this is concerning measles still cures a lot of children especially in poorer countries it is a big risk and should be vaccinated against on a global scale it's not an mRNA vaccine in 2021 25 million children missed out so that there is this is a life-threatening condition no doubt in my mind that children will die as a result of these emissions unfortunately and will be more spread of the disease status of new tuberculosis vaccines now tuberculosis is a leading cause of death and a vaccine that prevents the disease in adolescence and adults is urgently needed a sustained effort to vaccinate to for vaccine development is underway now I'm a bit confused here because when I was a child I was vaccinated with the BCG vaccine and the World Health Organization here appeared to be implying we don't have a vaccine for tuberculosis they seem to be developing a new one now I'm slightly concerned about this because in South Africa there is research going on at the moment not mocking South African medicine is good but in South Africa there is research going on just picked a place I know of for a messenger ribonucleic acid vaccine for tuberculosis which I find pretty frightening so quite why they're not using BCG vaccines I don't know vaccinologists can certainly let me know about that but um it protected us for a long long time and the the idea that the waiting for new vaccines which probably will be in license probably more expensive hmm yeah anyway I don't I'm a bit concerned about new things I like trust tried and test it but that's just me I'm old-fashioned anyway so they're saying they need this malaria of course now this one I'm going to look into that this new malaria vaccine I have no knowledge about that at all so I will check that out but I do know that we've recently distributed mosquito Nets in Uganda for example as part of our collaboration with Uganda and that um we believe this is already preventing cases on malaria so um quite what's happening with the malaria vaccine we don't know so there we go that's the uh latest wisdom from the World Health Organization that uh we can be grateful for so for now thank you for watching\": 0.5023922623922622,\n",

       " \" what a warm welcome to this talk it's Wednesday the 22nd of March now today I'm going to be looking at a paper and this is the paper here I want to look at is there a link between the 2021 covid-19 vaccine uptake in Europe and 2022 all cause mortality not covered mortality all cause mortality and this study did find such a correlation now let's look at it now this is the question that's the paper now this is studied in this is paper this papers published in Western Norway University of applied sciences now in Norway they have certain freedoms that we don't have in Western countries we don't have in the UK or the United States for example in Norway you can actually camp anywhere so there's certain freedoms in Norway that we don't have in other other countries anyway getting back to the topic in hand um conflict of interest statements the authors declare no conflict of interest so I think we can take it from this that the authors are not being paid uh huge amounts of money by vested interest which of course is always good to check so no vested interest there the authors say we primarily study a possible link between 2021 covid-19 vaccination uptake in Europe and all cause mortality in 2022 so the correlating vaccines in 2021 for covered 19. and monthly mortality in 2022 now let's be perfectly clear this is a preprint this is not a peer-reviewed paper but I wanted to cover this paper because I think the possibility of this getting published in a mainstream peer-reviewed Journal is essentially zero leave that there I don't think it's going to get published in the peer-reviewed journal if it does I'll be very surprised and more certainly report on it but I think it's important to report on it now because this is the whole point of uh preprints they are papers for discussion and we're discussing it now um so I.E mortality higher than before the pandemic so this is taking the mortality in 2022 comparing that to pre-pandemic levels now the analyze 31 countries January to September 2022. they did point out the importance of analyzing the last three months in 2022 when they get the full data available for that is it just where that went up to 31 EU member states throwing in Norway Iceland Lichtenstein and Switzerland all cause mortality this is direct quote from the paper increased more the higher the 2021 vaccine uptake in other words countries with more covid-19 vaccines in 2021 had higher excess mortality in the first nine months of 2022. this is what we call a positive correlation between vaccination in 2021 and excess deaths in 2022 and they quantify it there was a one percent Point increase in 2021 vaccination rate so for every one point and one percent that went up basically the mortality went up by a tenth of a percent so the mortality in 2022 was 0. 105 basically tenth of a percent so uh I consider that number to be uh huge one percent increase in vaccination in 2021.1 percent increase in overall mortality in 2022. it's a huge number absolutely huge number when controlling for alternative explanations the association remained robust so they remained robust and significant now 2021 or cause mortality was lower the higher the vaccination uptake so interestingly in 2021 um we uh the more vaccines people had the less people died in 2021 but in 2022 it was the opposite but and it's a big but in 2021 when they controlled for other uh variables that became a non-significant effect so there was an inverse correlation between covered vaccines and all-cause mortality in 2021 but it was not significant after they accounted for um quite a few variations that they cleverly accounted for in this paper this is from data's from eurostat we've looked at this many times official European statistics check it out for yourself EU experienced success mortality in the first nine months of 2022 we've looked at that before no question that that is the case tragically tragically we're talking about um mortality here as if it's some abstract concept of course it's not it's multiple individual human tragedies and bereavements this is why we do this this is this this is of massive importance covid-19 vaccinations prevented SARS cov2 related Hospital admissions and deaths so there's evidence that in 2021 May 2021 and 13th of May so these are both may 2021 and given that these papers were both published in May 2021 they're dealing with um data from January February March mostly 2021 very early on in the pandemic the Alpha and the Delta stages of the pandemic so evidence that the vaccine was effective from 2021 and 2021 that's from the landsat that's from British medical journal so vaccines were preventing SARS coronavirus to related Hospital admissions and deaths specifically of course to SARS coronavirus 2 not talking about or cause mortality covid-19 vaccination are side effects such as myocarditis and pericarditis says who don't take my word for things well as always we give evidence evidence for myocarditis and pericarditis post vaccine this one's from uh Journal of the American Medical Association Cardiology a note we're now into 2022 so this is a year later so uh that this is six seven months later 25th of January 2022. so we can clearly see that times have changed a recent study falsified suspected association between the two diagnoses that's myocarditis and pericarditis and covid-19 virus infection so journal of clinical medicine that's that publication there they found post-covered 19 infection was not associated with either myocarditis or pericarditis so that makes us a bit curious about where the increase in myocarditis and pericarditis came from if it's not caused from the natural infection vaccine uptake is the percentage of the no this is how they've got the data vaccine update they took us the as the percentage of the total population that's received a primary course by week 52 of 2021 in other words this only goes up to the end of 2021. now here are the countries they studied and these are the percentages of the primary courses now of course all of this is in the article I just put this here to show you what a huge epidemiological study this actually is so percentage of primary courses by the end of 2021 and that's what they took their correlations from so low in Bulgaria going all the way up to uh Iceland and Ireland 76. 6 percent countries that you might be interested in you can see there of course the UK no longer a member of the European Union but we will be at that very much the higher end of this um and of course of course the accounting for population size needless to say their conclusion here of direct quote from the paper the interaction between vaccine uptake and time passed in months since the beginning of 2022 is strongly significant strongly significant and implies that the mortality increase and the higher the vaccine uptake so implies that the mortality increases the higher the vaccine uptake so the more people had vaccines in 2021 so that was uh vaccines in 2021 and this was a increasing deaths in 2022 there is a positive correlation between the two the higher the vaccination rate the higher the deaths the lower the vaccination rate in 2021 the lower the excess deaths um now of course these are correlations so they they rightly went on and looked at other things that could be causing this um potential reverse causality we looked at could it be the excess mortality that was causing the vaccinations well they eliminated that because of course the excess mortality came after the correlations and we know from um you know the the the need the need for uh temporal correlations that the cause has to come before the effect um but anyway They carried on concerning alternative explanations we control for average or cause mortality in 2020 and 2021 by dividing the average between 2016 and 2019. so the mortality data they were taking was from before the pandemic so that got rid of that variable relatively low mortality at one period is followed by relatively High mortality and later on and vice versa so in other words what they're saying here is well if lots of people died in 2020 you'd expect or 2021 you'd expectually expect fewer people to die in 2022 and the exact opposite was the case but they did mathematically account for that so we know that it's it's not that is not the cause of the excess mortality uh but even when they took account of this direct quote from the paper we still observe a significant association between 2021 vaccination uptake and 2022 monthly increasing all cause mortality countries with higher vaccines in 2021 had a higher or cause mortality in 2022. now they did acknowledge What's called the ukological fallacy uh now the the this would say that because something is true a nation is not necessarily true of uh of individuals which of course is is true and they acknowledge that they acknowledge that uh we are cautious about making uh individual level inferences from our nation level findings so very honest of the researchers there now excess mortality um caused by delayed medical treatment or diagnosis um which of course is the main reason given in the UK Parliament for the excess deaths that is caused by delays in medical treatment during the pandemic and indeed the relative chaos in the NHS at the moment which is true but um we cannot see that the issue the issues have been more prevalent in high vaccine versus low vaccine countries in other words delay in healthcare is is all over the place all countries have delays in healthcare but the correlation is still there when they looked at the um when they looked at the countries vaccine when they looked at the vaccination rates that one when they looked at that one the correlation is still there is still there so um they don't think it's caused by that and they actually specify this I.E we do not expect delayed diagnosis on medical treatment during the covid-19 pandemic to substantially over I've included omitted variable bias so they don't think it's that so there we have it it's very clear that there's a positive correlation um it's in that paper there the higher the uh the higher the vaccination rates were in 2021 the higher the excess mortality in 2022. so that's the end of this video I've nothing more to say on that now on a completely separate matter I've been um thinking of might go to the states and take up some uh start playing basketball no nothing drag I'd probably just start with Semi-Pro and then build up but I've been looking at the terminology and apparently um you have something called a slam dunk in basketball and this is a literally a goal scored in the basket by by putting the ball straight down into the loop with one's hand so that's a slam dunk the same points as a traditional basket but it's a show of force dominance and skill so a slam dunk is something that is a completely convincing as I say nothing to do with this today's talk um but I'll need to use the correct terminology for when I'm playing basketball in the states so do look out for me I'm quite optimistic about it but for now thank you for watching\":

       " \" let's do a couple of covid related stories Brett Weinstein evolutionary biologist and podcast host of the Darkhorse podcast was recently interviewed by former Fox News propagandist Tucker Carlson and Brett told Tucker something that sounds shocking because it is and it's wrong which is that 17 million people have died from the covid vaccine that is quite a claim let's take a listen to what Brett had to say gauge Tucker's reaction and more generally we will discuss it there was uh a press I was recently at a conference uh in Romania on the covid crisis and so there was a lot of work trying to unpack what we actually understand and I saw a credible estimate of something like 17 million deaths globally from this technology so 17 million deaths from the coac well when you know when you scale up to billions uh it's not hard to reach a number like that with the technology that's dangerous now to your deeper question I think let's and by the way these are not our subtitles they're a mess but I just want to make clear these are not our subtitles Steelman so just for perspective I mean that's like the death toll of a global war yes absolutely it is this is a a a great tragedy of History so that proportion um and amazingly there is no way in which it's over I mean we are still apparently recommending these things for healthy children never stood any chance of getting any benefit from every chance of suffering harms that are uh not only serious but tragic on the basis that children have long lives ahead of them so listen uh let's start anecdotally okay okay the claim is 17 million people have been killed by the covid vaccine and it's continuing let's start anecdotally which is not the way we do things but sometimes it's useful to start with an anecdote just as a sniff test and then we'll go further okay first of all does anybody in my audience know a single person who had a serious vaccine complication maybe there's a couple of you okay sometimes that happens extremely rare we have an audience in the millions C L it's possible that someone in the audience not not you but knows someone who had a serious vaccine complication maybe there's a few of you okay does anyone in my audience know of anybody personally right who died from the covid vaccine I assume the answer is zero since almost no one okay almost no one has died from vaccine complications so does anyone in my audience then know anybody who has died from covid or covid complications just about everybody I know says the answer is yes I assume the answer is yes both personally and certainly obviously we know of people through through the media my aunt died of complications from covid she was imuno compromised had a number of health issues got covid never recovered passed away an uncle of mine died from Co pneumonia now let's go beyond anecdote okay the global death toll of covid about six million closer to seven depending on whether we talk recorded deaths or an excess death model OKAY somewhere between six and7 million Deb of covid and 17 million dead of the vaccine now you can go and watch the presentation that Brett saw in Romania okay it's a Canadian scientist Dennis rancour uh here's just like a few seconds of it this is all available online it's 26 minutes scene that is explained by the magic of mathematical models written by bought out scientists working for bought out politicians so it is not true the vaccine did not save lives okay you can go and watch this entire thing and then you will have the information that that uh Brett has and then you can also find the 130 page so-called analysis of this on which that presentation is based we're not going to link to it we're putting up a screenshot but we're not going to link to it since I don't know we could be banned or something who knows and here's what this quote analysis did the analysis looked at all cause mortality in 17 countries and the analysis claims that all cause mortality data shows there was no benefit from a covid vaccine now all it does is it looks at population data doesn't confirm whether anybody who died was even vaccinated and it makes it an impossibility to draw any kind of conclusion about the relationship between vaccination and morality like at the top level it's bogus we don't even need to go further but we can the analysis also ignes really good evidence that we have that when we see a spike in excess mortality in a country it aligned with a covid surge not a vaccination surge if you look and you say okay we know there was a covid surge in this country at this time and then you see excess mortality go up that's really good data about what might be going on on the other hand and if you look at a country like Peru when you saw the excess deaths Spike uh did not coincide with when the vaccination rates went up we know when the vaccination rates went way up in Peru and you didn't see excess deaths so the studies that we have show all cause mortality is uh higher in the states with lower vaccination rates and all cause mortality was lower in states with higher vaccination R so it is truly dangerous listen do I think Bret Weinstein really believes this I genuinely do not know I do not know whether Brett Weinstein believes this stuff five years ago four or five years ago I would have said Brett Weinstein is too smart to fall for this crap it's just what my view would have been and I don't know what the answer is because unfortunately if he doesn't believe it then he's deliberately spreading misinformation which I mean what's worse being a liar being misinformed being a deliberate liar seems worse to me it's really sad what's happened to Brett Weinstein and of course opportunist Tucker Carlson loves the ability to just promote the hell out of this crap for clicks and is he even getting clicks I don't know something that's been in the news a lot lately is data Brokers collecting vast amounts of data about everything you do on your phone and computer where you go what you look at they identify patterns in your behavior and it's really quite disturbing how much data Brokers know about us even our health information and then we found out that sometimes government agencies like the FBI will buy that information from data Brokers to spy on Americans without warrants ad companies buy the data to serve you ads financial

       " \" what's in your medicine cabinet how many daily meds and supplements are you using do you know what you're putting into your bodies it has been 2 years since coid vaccines were first introduced yet we continue to gain new insights into their impact on our bodies especially on women's reproductive Health now over the past two years there's no denying that these vaccines have prevented millions of hospitalizations and deaths so before I proceed let me be clear vaccines are the best protection against several life-threatening diseases is but do we know enough about them new studies have also highlighted the hidden risks of coid vaccines specifically for Women's Health ranging from irregular menstrual cycles to miscarriages and even reduced milk supply in breastfeeding mothers it begs the question what potentially harmful elements are we injecting into our bodies are we unknowingly endangering our health in the pursuit of immunity we know that coid 19 vac vaccines have different effects on women when compared to men so we must consider whether the Pharma industry is giving sufficient and equal thought to the impact of their products on women's health the question is is there adequate research to address the gender gap in medical studies in the latest development a new study has discovered the presence of mRNA from coid vaccines what is mRNA it stands for Messenger ribonucleic acid and it is a single stranded molecule that carries the instructions to make proteins it has a fundamental and essential role that makes our bodies function so an mRNA vaccine tricks the body into producing some of the viral proteins itself they work by using this mRNA which is a molecule that essentially puts DNA instructions into action that's how the vaccine works now a new study has found that in the breast milk of breastfeeding mothers for up to 45 hours after receiving this vaccine MRN na is still present the study has been published in the journal Lancet 70% of the breast milk samples analyzed in the study were found to contain mRNA from the vaccines although the detected amount was largely fragmented it retained 12% to 25% of its original Integrity the researchers suggest that more studies needed to determine the minimum amount of mRNA that could potentially trigger an immune response in newborn babies the samples were collected from 13 healthy postpartum women both before and after vaccination in total there were 20 vaccine exposures and 154 breast milk samples considered now full disclosure the 13 lactating women had received either the modna or fisa vaccine what the study found was Trace Amounts of mRNA were present in 10 to 20 exposures up to 45 hours after vaccination the study noted that the SAS cov2 Spike protein was not expressed all participating women tested negative for coid before the collection of milk samples the samples collected before vaccination tested negative now this finding is significant in its scope extending Beyond mRNA coid vaccines the study offers valuable insights into the transport and presence of vaccine mRNA and breast milk which can be relevant for assessing the safety and efficacy of future therapies which are given to pregnant women and lactating women in particular it is important to note that in 2021 study showed that no traces of mRNA vaccines ended up in mother's breast milk at the time it was suggested that such vaccines are safe during lactation and lactating women were encouraged to take them without stopping breastfeeding however when the vaccines became available changes in women's menstrual cycles were reported While most women showed no evidence of menstrual alteration some indicated either an increase or a delayed cycle a Saudi Arabian study evaluated the impact of ID 19 vaccines on all aspects of the menstrual cycle including cycle length amount of bleeding and pain the study included a total of 673 women 46% of them reported changes in their cycle after both coid 19 vaccine doses the study was conducted from May to September last year and the report concluded by promoting the co 19 vaccine stating that there is no statistically significant association between the vaccine and the many issues that the women in the study based however this raises important questions were there temporary issues factored into research did we know beforehand what effects these vaccines might have on women's health because when you experience late periods abnormal bleeding or increased pain it can cause panic and anxiety if these effects had been discussed earlier women might have been better prepared to handle them almost all research on Co 19 and clinical trials of vaccines do not include data sufficient data on women how can we combat the pandemic if half of the human population is left out of Co 19 research the lifelong consequences of this neglect could be severe for women globally particularly as new V variants and other viruses emerge and potentially exacerbate the differences even more take this study for example it was published last year and proves the exclusion of women from studies it demonstrates how this exclusion harms Women's Health in the long run and slows our response to the pandemic it highlights that studies still neglect to include enough women in clinical trials despite big differences pandemic research and medical research in general could be transformed by focusing more on gender specific effects of disease and treatment it is crucial to include women in research to assess the short and

       " \" hi good evening I'm Dr Philip McMillan thank you for joining me and today I'm sharing with you the wonderful news from the wh that covid vaccines have saved 1.4 million lives across Europe it's remarkable how you can understand how successful this is but can't explain how people get severe disease well from my perspective from the scientific view I'm interested in how patients die and therefore if I understand how they die I can then explain the nuances like for instance how did Africa not get decimated with covid-19 they had low vaccination rate so if you can't explain that how then can you go on to make claims and credit for everything else so today what I'll be going through I'll give you a quick quick insight into what the topics are here I'll be talking about The Who and the fact that um this is the uh the the media coverage that they've had I'll go through that quickly I'll also be talking about what has happened in Africa with regards to vaccine coverage I'll also be looking at our worlding data and the vaccine doses being done in one specific area which is Zambia and I'll quickly mention something about the prevalence of pre-existing serological cross reactivity for SARS COV 2 additionally I'll be linking you in to some of the research that I've done which breaks down why you get severe disease and who is actually at risk for severe covid-19 so that's essentially what I'll go through quickly in a minute or two before I start I just like to remind everyone who may be interested coming up in a few days or if you've missed it you will see a link for it is our nitric oxide and covid presentation so nitric oxide and covid potential strategies for improving outcomes again being creative with research and science to come up with unusual patterns that may help to prevent severe disease Additionally you can join us on our huming heroes where in collaboration with Lena and putting together a book that will hopefully clarify some of the ideas around mucosal immunity and how nitric oxide could help join our Kickstarter on the link below so and why is this now an important topic so I've got here the World Health uh uh organization statement and this is from uh January 2024 and what they've said here is covid-19 vaccinations have save more than 1.4 million lives in the European region a new study finds uh firstly I couldn't yet find the study I'm not sure if it's peer-reviewed as yet but it's relevant in terms of these are likely to be computational models where they are anticipating the reason that they so many lives were saved and you can see here and as they pointed out since the introduction in December 2020 covid 19s have reduced deaths due to the pandemic by at least 57% saving more than 1.4 million lives in the wh Eastern European region now what is what I'm clarifying here is not that covid vaccines may have reduced deaths from severe disease but to say 1.4 million when you don't fully explain the mechanism of severe disease and you don't explain what has happened in Africa how do you explain Africa now let's just break that down into a little bit more detail and then I'll come back to why it's so important to understand the science so what I've got here is the Africa dashboard and this here is showing the CDC covid-19 vaccine dashboard and they're looking at all of Africa and they have delivered one um technically 1 billion doses of vaccines 1.13 7 and they've covered 51% 51.8% of Africa and they've shown it here by member State and which vaccine they have given that link is in the description the first thing that I will say is that I am very disappointed that Africa didn't take the lead on covid-19 by far they had the best outcomes up until probably certainly 2022 even after Omicron they had by far the best outcomes from the pandemic how do you explain that because they also had the lowest vaccine coverage now those numbers when I show you 51% I'm going to break it down because the timing is actually very very important so here you have a situation where you first have to ask what was happening in Africa and I've picked one country in Africa I've picked Zambia just because they've done a significant amount of vaccination and this is from our world in data and I've I've got here these are the peaks in terms of deaths daily new con confirmed covid-19 deaths and this is from the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 all the way out till now and you can see here that in August 2020 they had a peak then in February 2021 they had another Peak and that's uh and that um that was probably the the beta variant and then you had the Delta variant here this peak now what's important to note is that even though this was a peak you are talking about just about 250 deaths so this is not a lot of numbers compared to what was happening in the rest of the world this is a tiny number then they had a little bump here with regards to Omicron and then it ended so that was the situation of Africa now what you have to then do is look carefully at what they then did around vaccination because that's the bit that I was trying to understand they had a brilliant response low deaths in terms of Zambia yet they have gone to vaccinate most of their population I'm not talking about just a high-risk care who that could make sense but trying to Target your whole population I'm trying to understand the logic in it so here you have the daily covid-19 vaccine doses administered and you can see here again this is in uh 2021 because they didn't really get anything prior to April 2021 they started to get some vaccines low amounts all the way into December this was one of the horrific situations in the pandemic is that if covid was as lethal we would have left Africa to die but anyway here they're plotting along still getting some vaccine doses and then at this point here and this is just about May 2022 so that's after Omicron you see one big Surge and then they have another surge here in October 2022 let it be clear this was probably after the rest of the world had been not taking their vaccines so there was vaccines left over it's important for Africa to know you are not the priority here just reminding you this is what was after what was left that you were given why did you doubt your results in the first place and again you can see here from our world in data you can see for Zambia as I said you can see this is the number of people who had at least one dose you can see it was plotting along here until in about May 2022 you see the surge this is after they had faced Omicron and therefore had broad population level mucosal immunity why didn't they take the lead they had the best results the best outcomes why didn't they say why don't you explain why we have done so well with poor health infrastructure huge rural populations and limited access to vaccines how did Africa as a whole do so well so here is now the science and I'll try and explain this science to you as simply as I can the first thing you have to understand is what causes severe disease in covid-19 in truth we knew this from the data or the research that was done in about 2016 with SARS C the mechanism of disease is technically the same and it's all about the interferon response if you have a disregulated interferon response you're going to get severe disease this is Most Fascinating look at this carefully here this dark blue is interferon and what it's showing you here is that and green here represents the viral load so when someone gets infected if they have an early interferent response that means that the immune system the mucosal immune system recognizes it they have mild disease they don't end up with severe disease and again even when you have a huge surge of virus in Co and in SARS COV if they had a poor interferent response that means if they were immune supressed if they were old very frail again they had mild disease what caused severe disease was a delayed strong interferent response now that's just the science and it explains why some people even very frail people with comorbidities didn't die from covid-19 and this leads me to another very very important slide I think that I I put together just to try and explain this if you get this you understand severe covid-19 you have a number of factors that need to come together so I've created this ven diagram one you need to have have the representative age obesity comorbidities if you have this in theory you're at risk of severe covid-19 so this was a cohort who probably would have benefited most from vaccination additionally interferon Auto antibodies our problem was we didn't know which people who could be younger had interfer and auto antibodies the other thing was a strong systemic immune response that means me that that's the delayed interference so if you had weak immunity and this is talking about the first and second waves it's a bit different now but if you had strong systemic immunity that's what predisposed you to severe covid-19 in combination with all of this plus critically no recent exposure to any Corona virus I didn't say sarov 2 any Corona virus any cold virus would have caused the mucosal immunity to give an interferent response which would have prevented severe covid-19 unless that person had interfer on all to antibodies that's the science if you understand the science you can then understand why it was that some areas probably did so well and you can see as well in Africa and this is a paper that um I pulled up here they recognized that from 2021 there was high prevalence of preexisting serological cross reactivity against SARS kov 2 in subsaharan Africa so a lot of people were exposed to other Corona viruses and therefore they had high levels of mucosal immunity which would have prevented severe disease you can look at the paper it's not a big study but it's still quite relevant additionally in many parts of Africa they have been using at population level a number of drugs that are not considered to be relevant with covid-19 if we had been thinking about the science and if we had just been looking for answers the scientific Community would have gone back to look at Africa and say how did they have such a good outcome with regards to covid-19 and they would have looked at every option including the drugs that they were using at population level that could have had an impact and we could have been in a completely different place than we are now so taking it from another angle just a reminder in terms of my slides I've put this together to try and see if I can help somebody understand it first question have you got prior exposure to any Corona virus if if the answer is yes the next question is do you have interferon Auto antibodies if you don't you have more protection but if you have interferent autoantibodies that that disregulated that interferent response you are at risk and on top of it if you have the comorbidities and a strong systemic immune response you're at much higher risk of severe covid-19 so a weak immune response initially was almost protective you wouldn't get severe covid-19 what's remarkable is this has changed since we have done broad population level vaccination that those people who seem to be at lower risk are no longer the same so people who are immune suppressed in the first wave are no longer as protected subsequently these are important scientific questions that we really really need to answer so the point is this in order to make that claim and this is why I think the science is so important so I'll take you back to what that claim was that more than 1.4 million lives were saved if they don't include in their analysis the fact that almost 90% of the population was already exposed to any Corona virus and would not have a delayed inter response then those numbers are unlikely to be inaccurate but who am I this is coming from our lead organization so just a reminder as to what I said anything that delays this interferent response is likely to lead to severe disease and so whether it's interferon Auto antibodies or no prior exposure to any Corona virus or covid-19 you are at higher risk of SARS uh severe disease just remember at this point almost everybody has been exposed to um Omicron and so there is going to be only a small number of people if any who don't have mucosal immunity and therefore wouldn't respond in that way to interferon and so seeing severe covid-19 as an illness is unlikely to occur at this point unless there are other mechanisms at Play and so what we have to prepare for now as excess deaths remain up especially across highly vaccinated regions the question that needs to be asked is are we moving into a different phase of the pandemic where different mechanisms leading to severe disease are now extremely important to understand this is a different phase but just remember if we had taken or let Africa Take the Lead it's very unlikely the world would be where it is now we still have challenges in front of us and there no amount of um hiding those facts is going to change that reality have a good [Music] evening [Music]\": 0.484406263164027,\n",
       " \" Have you been able to get  your COVID-19 jab yet? Many countries are rolling out the COVID-19 vaccines so that the pandemic will be over  and we can get back to normal. If you’ve never had COVID-19,  your body doesn’t know  how to fight it off. Vaccines help train  your immune system to recognize the virus  and be ready to attack. But as we all have  different immune systems,  we respond differently to the vaccine and the virus. Having side effects has nothing to do  with the effectiveness of the vaccine.   So let's see what's going on  once you get the jab. Congratulations! You’ve just had your first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.  For this episode, we'll be focusing on messenger RNA, or mRNA vaccines. Once it enters your body, the mRNA vaccine instructs your cells  to create a spike protein. This simulates part of the SARS-CoV-2 viral structure  and tricks your body  into believing that it's been infected. The spike proteins will then head to the surface of your cell. Your immune cells will detect these proteins that don't belong  and begin making antibodies. If you happen to catch the virus  in the future, these antibodies will attach  to the spike proteins on both  your infected cells and the coronavirus. This will mark them  for immediate termination by your immune cells. To be clear,  the mRNA does not change your DNA  in any way.  Hear what I say? Once the spike proteins are made,  your body destroys the mRNA.  Five minutes after your vaccine shot,  you'll feel some soreness in your arm. To be safe, the Centers for Disease Control recommends you stay at the vaccination site  for at least 15 minutes in case of a severe reaction. While it's rare, you could have anaphylaxis, which is an immediate allergic response. It causes a series of symptoms such as hives or swelling. Thankfully,  trained healthcare personnel will be available at every vaccination site to treat you immediately with epinephrine. And according to the CDC, you have a greater chance of being struck by lighting, around one in 500,000, than having an allergic reaction. Four hours after your vaccine, you could feel nothing at all. Lucky you. But you could also get a slight headache or a low-grade fever and feel tired. This is perfectly normal and is a sign that your immune system has kicked into action. At this point, you may experience mild symptoms as your body acclimatizes to the vaccine. You might feel tired and feverish. Be sure to get some rest and take the day off work if you need to. After about 48 hours, you should start to feel normal again. So let’s keep going. Okay, if you got the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, you’d need to get your second booster shot three to four weeks after the first dose. Your immune system would be stronger than the first time.  But let’s see how it goes next.  After your second dose, you might feel crummy again.  You could feel tired feverish and you might get the chills.   These reactions are more common after the second dose of the vaccine.  But they’re mainly mild to moderate and usually go away in a day or two. And two weeks after your second shot, you’d be fully vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus. So far, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 illness.  In either case, the vaccine can prevent hospitalization and death in people who have gotten sick. So getting a vaccine is your safest path to protect yourself, your family  and your community against this virus.  It could also help reach herd immunity by having vaccinated people act as a barrier between non-vaccinated people and those who have been infected.

day\\xa0\\xa0 sometimes people end up taking more than\\xa0\\r\\nthey should sometimes it's intentional\\xa0\\xa0 overdose sometimes it's accidental overdose\\xa0\\r\\nregardless this accounts for almost half of\\xa0\\xa0 the cases of acetaminophen-induced acute liver\\xa0\\r\\nfailure acetaminophen toxicity it presents in\\xa0\\xa0 three phases the first phase involves nausea and\\xa0\\r\\nvomiting in the first 24 hours in the second phase\\xa0\\xa0 during hours 24 to 72 there's a dramatic rise\\xa0\\r\\nin liver enzymes seen on the blood work elevated\\xa0\\xa0 ast and alt in high ast to alt ratio during this\\xa0\\r\\nphase acetaminophen causes kidney damage as well\\xa0\\xa0 the third phase our 72 through 96 consists of\\xa0\\r\\nencephalopathy here the brain is not working right\\xa0\\xa0 because it's swollen there's confusion or lethargy\\xa0\\r\\nthis often progresses to coma there's usually\\xa0\\xa0 jaundice at this point as well the treatment\\xa0\\r\\nfor acetaminophen toxicity is a drug called an\\xa0\\xa0 acetylcysteine knack can be life-saving the\\xa0\\r\\nsooner it's given the better the outcome if\\xa0\\xa0 it's given within 10 hours of ingestion there's a\\xa0\\r\\n95% chance of survival acetaminophen levels can be\\xa0\\xa0 checked in the blood work increased levels help\\xa0\\r\\nmake the diagnosis but even if they're normal\\xa0\\xa0 it doesn't rule out the possibility of toxicity\\xa0\\r\\nwhy because it's possible that the liver already\\xa0\\xa0 metabolized the acetaminophen in fact it's not\\xa0\\r\\nthe actual acetaminophen that destroys the liver\\xa0\\xa0 instead it's one of its breakdown products it's a\\xa0\\r\\nmetabolite called napqi which turns the liver into\\xa0\\xa0 mush here's a picture of what i'm talking about\\xa0\\r\\nthis is liver necrosis and this is what a healthy\\xa0\\xa0 liver looks like when you look at it underneath\\xa0\\r\\nthe microscope this is what you get napqi it also\\xa0\\xa0 damages the kidney and when the kidneys aren't\\xa0\\r\\nworking people stop peeing this is why it's so\\xa0\\xa0 important that people make sure they're not taking\\xa0\\r\\ntoo much acetaminophen this drug is often combined\\xa0\\xa0 with other drugs and toxic levels can sneak up\\xa0\\r\\non people for example over-the-counter cough\\xa0\\xa0 medications percocet vicodin they all have\\xa0\\r\\nacetaminophen in them medicine is complex it\\xa0\\xa0 always comes down to risk versus benefit whether\\xa0\\r\\nthat be tylenol or other

my eyes we have been left with no help at all not only am I in here that vaccin there's another man over there whose life's been ruined by That covid-19 vaccine I know people who have lost legs amputations I know people with heart conditions like myself RI sunak why have I had to set up a support group in Scotland to look after the people that have been affected by That covid-19 vaccine why are the people who are in charge who told us all to do the right thing have left us all to ro and left me and the thousands and the tens of thousands in this country to ro R soon look me in the eye when are you going to start to do the right thing the vaccine damage payment scheme is not fit for purpose in Scotland right now according to the yellow card system there are over 30,000 people have had an adverse reaction to That vaccine and deaths John thank you very much indeed for your question for you to start doing the right thing and you you you've made really strong point John prime minister yeah John well I'm very sorry to hear about your personal circumstances and you said someone over here also seems to have suffered by the similar by a similar thing now obviously I I don't know about the individual situation that you're in we're silenced social media and everything we are silenced we are the most silenced people in this country Sil the Press because my story in the press okay had to go to the government for comment and they made take all the stuff out forgive me forgive me both no one no one no one is saying no yeah okay I've lost my house my wife successful career and Sir You Raised some very valid points I'm sure what I've got to say is though we haven't got you on microphone and as you know we've got to get through this I'm sure we can we can raise your points with the prime minister at a later date but in the mean time Prim Min if you cover I'm I'm very happy to so there is a vaccine compensation scheme that in place as you alluded to in the NHS obviously everyone individually will work through their cases it's difficult for me to comment on anyone's individual case I'm sure you'll appreciate that I'm very happy to go and look at the cases and I'm sure you'll get them to the team here I mean I'm I'm very saddened and shocked to hear that you've been silenced by anybody that is surprising to me so please do get your details to Stephen and the team and I will happily take that away of course you should be able to speak about your experience what's happened to you and as I said we have a compensation scheme in place for that

we haven't got a microphone on you so our viewers and listeners won't be able to hear I the the last thing I'd say is you know we went through a pandemic like everyone else at the points when it came to the vaccine those decisions were always taken on the basis of medical advice from our medical experts to tell us as politicians who are obviously not doctors about how best to roll out the vaccine what was in the public health interest the priority order how that should be done who should be eligible that was something that the doctors recommended on and that's something that we followed now obviously if there are individual circumstances which haven't worked out then that's why we have the compensation scheme in place and I'll make sure that we follow up on your cases okay prime minister thank you jents both of you do give us your details we will get that to the Prime Minister and as he said he will I'm sure look at that for you now that is an issue that's haed you a little bit

first time to you that will be in our contract with the people there has to be an inquiry you heard it from those gentlemen I'm hearing up and down the country Ser so okay let's just have this rise so

       " \" [Music] vaccines are turning the tide but they're not without risks especially for women they've been rare cases of blood clotting even fatal ones leading some governments to slow down vaccinations we have now today chosen to continue our vaccine rollout without estracinica but each delay puts more lives at risk as the coronavirus spreads it's a balancing act between speed and caution in the fight against covert 19. the risk of dying from covert is much higher than getting a blood clot from a vaccine but even more concerning is a new report from oxford university that shows catching the coronavirus puts you at even more risk of a deadly blood clot in a moment we'll talk to a vaccine scientist at johns hopkins university first this report astrazeneca's covid19 vector vaccine has hardly been out of the headline since last december until now it's been instrumental in the success of the uk's vaccination program but from now on its use there will be restricted to those over 30 years of age there have been worries in the european union about its effectiveness and potential side effects germany initially restricted its use to under 65s now berlin is recommending it purely for over 60s those worries were compounded by several cases of a rare thrombosis type following astrazeneca vaccinations some of them fatal the european medicines agency in amsterdam felt it was time to take a stance on the jab it's director stressing that the benefits of the anti-viral agent far outweigh any risks this vaccine has proven to be highly effective it prevents severe disease and hospitalization and it is saving lives vaccination is extremely important in helping us in the fight against covet 19 and we need to use the vaccines we have to protect us from the devastating effects scientists have been investigating the reports and circumstances of the thrombosis britain's medicines and health care regulator agency says 20 million doses of the astrazeneca vaccine had been administered by the end of march with 79 cases of thrombosis later reported 19 of which were fatal the cause is thought to be a rare immune reaction most of them presented some two weeks after inoculation there are no apparent risk groups such as age or sex several countries like germany france and canada have tightened restrictions on the use of astrazeneca's covid19 vaccine others have suspended it totally waiting for the ema's verdict it has now recommended the continued unrestricted use of the astrazeneca jab regardless of any rare cases of thrombosis so mixed messages there about vaccine safety to unpack this let's bring in corso talacci's a vaccine scientist and infectious disease physician at johns hopkins university in baltimore maryland so let's start with astrazeneca as as we heard that's been given to more than half the adults in britain and is credited with saving tens of thousands of lives i'd gladly take it but authorities here in germany and other countries are blocking its use and offering no timely alternative isn't that in itself putting people's lives in danger so when you have a pandemic that's out of control like we have with the kovic 19 pandemic then any facts then you have to weigh the risks and benefits of any available preventive such as a vaccine or treatment and for the astrazeneca vaccine it has been shown to have saved millions of lives already and so the the potential benefits might outweigh any risks now there are some very serious risks associated with it in very very rare circumstances and i think i think each country but also each individual needs to be able to weigh that risk benefit equation for themselves to decide whether or not they're willing to take that risk for the potential for the protection against the virus when you have a vaccine that's available and that's not being used people can die and that's something that each each government and each person needs to weigh and this isn't only a problem with astrazeneca we've now got johnson johnson six million immunized in the united states and yet it's on hold because six people may have had side effects isn't one in a million an acceptable risk level during times like these so i think that the equation in the united states is a little bit different because we've vaccinated so many of our high-risk individuals already and we have two other approved vaccines that are that are more available than the johnson johnson vaccine even is um and i and i think whereas europe has been gathering information about the astrazeneca vaccine for several weeks we are just starting to learn about the any potential risk associated with the johnson and johnson vaccine and so i think the pause is to gather that information to truly understand what that risk is is it one in a million or is there something higher is it even um associ is the the clots that we saw with with in those unfortunate women associated with it and so i think the um the the pause is appropriate while we gather that information and make a decision about the risk benefits but i think in places where there's the virus is increasing in terms of the transmission and there is no alternative vaccine that it should be seriously considered to use this vaccine while that data is being gathered in the u.s the calculus is a little bit different because we do have two alternative vaccines that don't seem to have that same risk the strange thing though is that and this is what will get many people especially women worried about this is that those people affected by clotting were women in a certain age group and it's been a similar profile for astrazeneca as well so why is it being blocked for everyone or everyone under 60 or so i am that is probably uh due to logistics and programmatic issues but also because while we're gathering that information we need to understand better what that risk is and who truly is at risk while the majority people who have been affected so far seem to be women there were men in europe who have had this unusual rare blood clot happen um there was one man in the trial in the united states who had this unusual blood clot occur and so we need to gather that information and understand the process better and who truly is at risk to be able to maybe target the vaccines at people who are at lower risk but you know it's interesting that you say that because there's a lot of adverse events from vaccines that seem to particularly affect women and especially women in their reproductive years um and that's probably because our hormones are different than in the pre and post-reproductive period and also from men um and that may put us at um that may give us an advantage or a benefit but they may also put us at um some increased risk from the adverse events if you look at the anaphylaxis cases that are happening after the mrna vaccines in the united states the vast majority of them are happening in women as well so there's just there's a difference in the biology between men and women that we're just starting to understand can we go as far as saying that vector vaccines could be the problem in terms of the the clotting that's been seen exactly yeah in terms of adverse events in terms of clotting and or adverse events so each vaccine is going to have its different adverse events each vaccine platform has different kinds of adverse events that happen um and so for the vectored vaccines um especially for astrazeneca potentially for for johnson and johnson as well it looks like clotting may be an increased risk factor um that we didn't see with the mrna vaccines and in the united states over 100 million people have now been vaccinated with one of the two mrna vaccines without the same sort of signal that we've seen with the um with the with the with the antivirus vaccines but this hasn't necessarily been seen with other adenovirus vaccines in the past so we need to better understand what is happening and i think that this pause allows scientists and researchers to really dig deep into each of these cases to better understand what's happening and also to understand the mechanisms a little bit better and it's been fantastic having you on the show explaining to us what all this means kosovo talat of johns hopkins university thank you very much for being on the show today thank you very much take care whatever the risks vaccines are here to stay for now more on that from derek williams will we only have to be vaccinated once or will we need regular booster shots once again the straightforward answer is we don't know yet but a lot of experts do think it's very likely that even fully vaccinated people will need booster shots in the future there are a couple of different reasons why that might become necessary the first involves the fact that the vaccines we're using now have been approved for emergency use because they were safe in the vast majority of people who've gotten them and also extremely effective at least in the short term but we still don't know how long that effectiveness on average will last don't forget it's been under a year since the very first subjects and trials received their first shots but based on what we know about naturally acquired immunity to the disease and what we know about other coronaviruses the general expectation among immunologists appears to be that most vaccinated people will remain largely immune to covet 19 for at least six months and likely retain at least some immunity for a year or two assuming the virus doesn't mutate faster than we think however nearly all the experts i've read now also think that down the line variants of sars cov2 will change enough that we'll have to modify current vaccines at some point so the companies that make them are already in trials looking at possible ways to prolong vaccine-induced immunity and a lot of those trials will involve giving test subjects booster shots of tweaked vaccines you heard it from derrick williams i'm ben fosulin thanks for watching stay safe and see you again soon [Music] you\": 0.5381000933518922,\n",
       " \" last night at GB news's people's Forum with the Prime Minister there was one standout viral moment my name is John W and I'm one of the covid vaccine injured in this country I want you to look into my eyes soon I and I want you to look at the pain the trauma and the regret I have in my eyes we have been left with no help at all why are the people who are in charge who told us all to do the right thing have left us all to ro so there is a vaccine compensation scheme that's in place as you alluded to in the NHS obviously everyone individually will work through their cases it's difficult for me to comment on anyone's individual case I'm sure well John's comments actually got a round of applause from the audience and a massive reaction online so that man is John wat who had I believe three vaccines and developed a heart condition that nearly killed him before I was fit and healthy and used to do boxing H would do CrossFit you know do a lot of weight weight training and you know keep myself in good shape when I had my fight that's my world just toally crumbled yeah I mean he ended up in a wheelchair it it nearly killed it okay he is a voice for the vaccine injured and those who are sadly no longer here to make their voice heard he thinks people have been lied to and betrayed over vaccine safety and he wants the government to take responsibil I'm very pleased to say that he joins us now to tell us his story John thank you very much I know we've spoken a couple of times today and it's taken it out of you especially considering your condition could you just explain to our viewers and listeners exactly what went on with you then in terms of the vaccine please man I'd be here all night if I was to tell you what's happened to me but um just like you said I was bed ring for 14 months in a wheelchair um had numerous conditions um poorts poort orthostatic tardia syndrome H stomach issues NE I've got neurological issues now so people may have seen me moving back and forth in the video and they think you know that unfortunately that's my problem now when I'm when I stand up I feel like I'm dizzy and I'm off balance so if you see me moving about or anything like that unfortunately it's how I cope with things now for me doing that last night it's adrenaline and a heart issue does not go well Patrick and it took a lot out me to do that and drive down there and I seen an opportunity and unfortunately I had to take it Well you certainly did and you were still being demonized okay and earlier on today uh Kevin Maguire is a journalist well he he said this we'll play the clip I think he would but didn't you watch the the bit where some antia went on and on and on that's I think the two of them I think why would K starm subject himself to that yeah John I mean how does that make you feel being called an antivaxer first of all who is that guy I don't know who he is but anyway what is an antivaxer Patrick can somebody tell me can somebody elaborate what an antix us because I I took three of them I took three of these Vine so does that man have any idea how how stupid he sounds at this point in time by saying that it's you know this is the the terminology the language people are using just now saying Ana and all this nonsense to be completely honest with you the narrative is safe and effective in my opinion is no longer because to be honest with you Patrick I ask anyone and I call anybody in this matter someone show me the data to show that this saved one single life I'm asking anybody because since the roll out there has been a massive increase in people dying and one of the reasons I spoke out Patrick is because I'm not going to be a died suddenly statistic and that's the honest answer and these debates and everything need to be spoke about and the vaccine injured and bed need to be heard and I just can't believe that that's where we at you know you call me a antiva honestly I don't want to use the wrong language here you know but yeah okay well look as you know you the government goes well it's it saved many lives Etc but can I get your views on the compensation scheme and where you're at with it because that was one of the things you were really trying to hammer home to the Prime Minister wasn't it because you feel completely left behind and completely forgotten about and that it's been left to you actually really and and other people like you to really Bang the Drum to try to get Justice yeah I mean where I'm with it I've recently just got my doctor's notes it's taking about six months to get those doctor's notes but I know certain people who have you know I speak to all the vaccine injured in the UK there's only been a very very small percentage that have had a payout and I'm talking about people that have had spinal Strokes you know people who got heart conditions now what is 60% look we're no further for we're no further forward wew a year ago we're EXA we're in the exact same position where we were a year ago Patrick and it's it's ridiculous and when I stood there in front of him yesterday and I told him look me in the eye you you know Rich you've never been notified that we exist it's not the first time mate and see to be honest with you this goes to all the politicians because this is a political issue this is this is a message to you all because the long as you leave you B your head in the sand this isn't gone away you want to talk about the post office Scandal this is bigger this is global it's getting bigger and bigger you know it's getting worse and to be honest with you you can't run away from it any longer yes all right and look meanwhile the Department of Health and Social care has previously said more than 144 million covid vaccines have been given in England which has helped the country treat to live with covid and save thousands of lives all vaccines being used in the UK of under gone robust clinical trials and have met the medicines and Health Products regulatory agency strict standards of safety Effectiveness and quality we reached out to the NHS Business Services Authority for comment but are yet to get a response however previously they have said We are continuing to work with Healthcare Providers to assess the remaining records as a priority and to highlight that any delay in receiving medical records impacts the progress of vaccine damage payment scheme claims to the independent medical assessment stage right okay let's get the thoughts of my panels GS presented and qu Ser of MP for sto on Trent North Jonathan gullis an author and broadcaster am Niel Turner Jonathan I've got to ask you you know why is your government so slow to give these people payouts then look I think John gave a very moving account and I'm very sorry to hear the situation that he's found himself in that I was one of those who proudly promoted the vaccine because ultimately we were told by the scientists that this was going to help stopping the spread and ultimately build our resilience to the fact that if we did Catch Co that it would prevent ending up in hospital I think that was entirely the right thing to do and as you heard that 144 million of those have gone out to date but I don't deny the fact that there's huge frustration I think John was right fair in pointing out that with the post office Scandal and the payment scheme that's meant to be happening there that clearly bureaucracy is getting in the way I'm more than happy to sit down with people like John to hear firsthand about why payments aren't happening quick enough because ultimately it's about up to 12,000 that people are entitled to if they're entitled to it they should be getting it I mean people like John are demonized they're called antivaxers which ridiculous because they three of the things for stars he's obviously not an antivaxer yeah um people like him are are demonized and and they will feel I mean shunned from society laughed at scoffed by people who maybe have had a vaccine and are fine and that's not the case for everybody no they they absolutely shouldn't vaccine injured are very real they're very much there but in the same way nothing is risk-free planes crash those people are real that have been involved in that plane accident but we still see flying is safe the vaccine is still safe compensation or insurance I think the problem with the compensation is probably because it's extremely difficult to prove that the vaccine um caused that stroke that came five years later it's probably extremely difficult to prove that and I imagine in the cases where it's cut and dry like in John's case it he will get and he deserves every single penny he gets um but we can't get away from the fact that vaccine hesitancy is far more dangerous than getting the vaccine of course it mil doses there going to few that had but the thing is we were told we were we were told oh if you if you if you get this vaccine it's going to stop transmission uh you're not going to be able to give it to anyone it's going to stop you from getting Co and to be fair that wasn't true well you see that's the thing so I was like Jonathan I was you know an advocate for the vaccine I encourage people to get vaccinated because I thought you'd be protecting others and and yourself and so on and so forth and I do feel a bit duped at that point because I was working helping the government out and everything else like that and the reason I feel duped isn't because I know obvious see terribly and tragically some people

       " \" the International Community is marking World Cancer Day cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide but now thanks to a Cutting Edge covered vaccine technology we might just might be closer to stopping cancer Germany's biotech is launching a trial in the United Kingdom of personalized cancer vaccines this Autumn more on the technology in this upcoming report during the covid-19 pandemic vaccines were rolled out within a year faster than most experts believed possible and messenger RNA vaccines were among the first to gain approvals they work by giving the body's immune system a preview of potentially dangerous Invaders a dose contains many copies of a short stretch of precise genetic information the messenger RNA it induces cells to start making proteins that are otherwise only found on a specific pathogen like the proteins that stud the surface of sarsko V2 the virus that causes covid-19 then when the immune system encounters the virus it quickly recognizes the Invader and wipes it out categorically messenger RNA vaccines have proven to be exceptionally effective they have proven to be able to protect people against severe and life-threatening disease and consequently saved millions of lives there are different types of RNA but all of them are coding molecules and that code can be Rewritten that's why many drug developers describe RNA as medicinal software vaccines that use this software have a major advantage over other platforms their codes can be easily altered to also make other proteins found on other disease-causing microbes teaching the immune system how to fight them as well and RNA can encode for proteins found not just in infectious diseases but also for instance in cancers in addition to messenger RNA a range of other rnas play key roles in metabolism and health so they also have potential as medicines cancer application is quite interesting because it is not a vaccine that will prevent cancer but rather it is a therapeutic vaccine it is a vaccine directed custom tailored to the cancer of the of the patient which enhances and directs the immune response to more efficiently clear the tumor around 20 RNA treatments have been approved so far globally and dozens more are in trials in a wide range of diseases and for more on this we are joined Now by Dan Milner the executive director of access to oncology medicine's coalition thank you for joining us sir there's been as we've been hearing high hopes for this mRNA cancer treatment how different just to begin would it be from the Technologies we now use to cure cancer so great question so currently the technologies that we use are largely directed at killing the tumor using you know either General targets which is classical chemotherapy or targeted therapies which we have for example for lung cancer but in those targeted therapies these are still molecules or antibodies that are manufactured and don't use the body's own immune system naturally our bodies can fight cancer many cancers off and we never develop those cancers because our immune systems take care of them so we're moving away from the traditional approach of attacking the cancer with something exogenous to moving to an RNA or an internal approach where we actually use the body's own immune system to attack those Cancers and Destroy them uh Mr Miller we saw of course uh how during the coveted pandemic how quickly vaccines could be ruled out once they were discovered can we hope for similar speed with cancer I I think so but I think there is a major barrier which we did not do not have with infectious disease and that's choosing the target for an individual patient as you have was described in the piece before this the ability to Target an infectious disease is quite easy because it's a foreign molecule it's a foreign piece of material that's not naturally in the human body but when we talk about cancer and personalizing the vaccine what we're talking about is finding some piece of the tumor that's been mutated or changed enough that we can then Target that protein or that molecule with the vaccine and destroy it and so we have to pick through all of the bits of the tumor using sequencing or other very robust processes to find the target pull it out and say yes this is the best one for this patient and then use it and that process at the moment is still rather tedious and difficult and expensive to do for each patient and again our concept is personalized so we want to do it for each patient so that's the bear really have to overcome is rapid Target selection for patients with cancer and just if we put the cost in the individualized treatment challenges Assad for a moment uh how long you think we'll have to wait for a wide scale rollout well I think that you know the agreement that the British government just signed with bioin tech for 10 000 patients by 2030 is very promising there was also the agreement personality signed with moderna using their sequencing platform I think these are signals that this is coming much more quickly than it would have you know we've been working on these vaccines for more than a decade for cancer with very little progress but now that we've sort of gotten through all the hard Parts with covid we've taken the vaccine to scale we've distributed Etc now we can focus in on what is the one last barrier and I think these kinds of Agreements are going to speed this process up I would say that there are four trials reporting this year one on melanoma two on influenza and one on herpes and that melanoma trial will be really crucial to see the results because I think if that is a positive trial we'll start to see more trials on the back end and we'll see more results coming out that are moving this forward for patients okay thanks for that good news to Ann Milner from the medicines Coalition thanks so much\": 0.48138727173209944,\n",

He's doing lots of world saving. - We were 45 minutes early. - Okay. Ready? He's here, I'm admitting him right now. Here we go. (dramatic music) (bell ringing) - Hey, hey, hi guys, how you doing? - [All] Hi, Dr. Fauci! (upbeat music) (light music) - [Zach] On December 14th,\\r\\nthe first vaccine for COVID-19 in the U.S. was administered, beginning our nationwide rollout. - Now there are a lot of questions and misinformation out there, and today, we are having the one\\r\\nperson who can debunk all of the conspiracy theories joining us. - Although there's a lot of\\r\\nmisinformation out there, today, we're talking to Mr. Information. - Today, we're speaking\\r\\nwith Dr. Anthony Fauci, a physician and immunologist. I certainly have a crush on him. (Zach laughs) - He's the most important\\r\\nman of the last year. - The Beyonce of medicine. - Right? - He is the Beyonce of medicine. - [Narrator] Immunologist,\\r\\nDr. Anthony Fauci. - Dr. Fauci. - Dr. Fauci. - There's nothing more important\\r\\nthan him doing his job. - I'm Dr. Anthony Fauci. - My name is Dr. Tony Fauci. - During the course of the\\r\\npandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci has been the physician most\\r\\nAmericans have relied upon for their information. - [Narrator] Fauci\\r\\ngraduated first in his class at Cornell Medical College. His career spans six presidents and over 30 years of research. - [Narrator] Not only\\r\\ndid Dr. Fauci foresee this kind of pandemic,\\r\\nscientists at the NIH have spent years preparing for it. - We're gonna use public health measures to help us safely get\\r\\nto where we want to go. - Hey.\\r\\n- Hi, Dr. Fauci. - Hello.\\r\\n- Hi, everybody. Hi, guys, how you doing? - We're so good.\\r\\n- Wonderful. - Doing well, thank you.\\r\\n- Good. - We love you. - So Dr. Fauci, this\\r\\nis the fastest vaccine in human history. People wanna know, did\\r\\nwe undermine the safety of the vaccine because it was done so fast and without long-term studies? - Okay, so that's a great question. It's the most commonly asked question. There was no cutting corners. Safety was not compromised. Scientific integrity was not compromised, and I think people need to\\r\\nunderstand that the speed was related completely to the breathtaking scientific advances that had been made over the previous 10 or more years, where you can get the genetic\\r\\nsequence of the virus, which then take that sequence and insert the appropriate gene into these very new and unbelievably efficient\\r\\nvaccine platforms, and that didn't sacrifice\\r\\nany safety at all. That was purely a technological advance. Then the Moderna trial was 30,000 people. The Pfizer trial was 44,000 people, and it happened to be\\r\\ntaking place in the middle of a ferocious outbreak. So when you're trying to\\r\\nprove a vaccine works, and there are just a few infections here and there in society, it could take seven\\r\\nyears to get a vaccine. There was so many infections\\r\\nthat we went from sequence to getting the vaccine in\\r\\npeople's arms in less than a year. That is historic, but it's historic from a scientific standpoint. There was absolutely no\\r\\ncutting of corners at all. - So you're saying that there's no chance that there's some weird side\\r\\neffects that are gonna pop up three years down the road? - The chance of that happening\\r\\nis spectacularly low, and let me tell you why. If you look at the history\\r\\nof all vaccinology, and you say when did these so-called longer term effects occur? The overwhelming majority,\\r\\n90 plus percent of them occur between 30 and 45 days after\\r\\nthe vaccine trial ends. That is the reason why the FDA said that in order to make an\\r\\nemergency use authorization, you had to wait 60 days from the time 50% of the people in the\\r\\ntrial got their last dose. So if you wait 60 days,\\r\\nyou're already beyond when essentially all of the\\r\\nlong-term effects occur. I've never seen one, where\\r\\nI get vaccinated in 1982, and I get a toxic effect in 1986. I mean, it just, I've\\r\\nnever seen that happen with any vaccine. - Mm, mm-hmm. - Wow, that's amazing. Okay, I'm gonna ask you a question here. Can I still infect someone\\r\\nelse after I get the vaccine and do I have to keep wearing\\r\\na mask after I get it? - The answer is yes, and I'll explain why. It is still conceivable\\r\\nthat you could get infected and be asymptomatic, and\\r\\neven though the vaccine protected you from getting sick, it didn't protect you\\r\\nfrom getting infected. So you may not even know\\r\\nthat you're infected and be completely asymptomatic, and then spread it to somebody else. - I think that's been the scariest part of this whole pandemic, is\\r\\nthat I could totally have it and not know, and that terrifies me. - We can pull back on masks when we get such an overwhelming proportion of the population is vaccinated that there's herd immunity,\\r\\nwhich means that the level of virus is so low that it's not a threat. - What percentage of people\\r\\nneed to get the vaccine for us to achieve that? - You know, we don't\\r\\nknow the exact number, but we can make a back of\\r\\nthe envelope calculation that it's somewhere between\\r\\n70 and 85% of the population needs to be vaccinated\\r\\nto get herd immunity. - Here's, you know, some\\r\\npeople, there's a lot of people talking about things out there. Some people think maybe it'd be easier to just achieve herd\\r\\nimmunity by letting the virus spread rampantly through the population. What do you think about that? - Okay, well that's maybe the worst idea. (both laughing) - [Keith] Okay. - I don't want to compare it to anything. I don't want to insult anybody. - It's not my question. It's just a question that I have read, and I'm relaying to you\\r\\nbecause you're the expert. - Did you read it on Facebook, Keith? - I did read it on Facebook.\\r\\n(Fauci laughs) - The general level of\\r\\nherd immunity right now in the country, the last\\r\\ntime the CDC looked at it, was like 10%, 12%. Some cities like New York, it was 22%, because New York got hit\\r\\nso badly in the beginning. So let's say that the\\r\\nlevel in the country today, let's say is 20%. So with 20% of the people infected, we've already had 352,000 deaths. To get to 80, you'd have to\\r\\nhave four times as many people. So are you willing to\\r\\naccept 1.2 million deaths in order to get to herd immunity? I don't think so. So the road to herd immunity is a vaccine, not just letting people get infected. - And how soon after getting\\r\\nthe vaccine would I be immune? - So let's say you get\\r\\nvaccinated, and then 21 to 28 days later, you get a boost, anywhere from 10 to 14\\r\\ndays following the boost, you can consider yourself protected. - Dr. Fauci, a new COVID\\r\\nvariant has been reported in over 40 countries and is\\r\\nsaid to be more transmittable. Will that make the vaccine irrelevant? - That has a mutation,\\r\\nwhich is causing the virus to be much more easily\\r\\ntransmissible from person to person. According to the Brits, who've\\r\\nlooked at it very carefully, and we will also be doing the same thing, they find that the mutation\\r\\ndoes not make people sicker or even more people\\r\\ndying, nor does it seem to interfere with the protection that's afforded by the vaccine. So the only thing that's\\r\\nfunctionally different, it appears to spread more easily. - My fiancee, Maggie, she actually got the\\r\\nvaccine already at work. They've been prioritizing nurses. For me, there's like a lot of contrasting information out there. Like I'm immunosuppressed,\\r\\nand I don't know, am I supposed to get it? - You can take a vaccine. The only time an immunocompromised person should not take a vaccine is when it's a live attenuated vaccine, because the virus can then\\r\\nreplicate a lot in you, and not stop replicating the way a person who has a normal immune system would be. But you should get vaccinated, because even though the immune compromise may not get you to have\\r\\nas robust a response, a less than robust response\\r\\nis better than no response. So go get vaccinated. - Some protection is better\\r\\nthan no protection, yes. - I learned that in college. (group laughing) - Stop guys, stop, stop.\\r\\n(Keith laughs) - I have a newborn child. We just got his two months' vaccines for all of the other stuff, but I've been really worried about COVID. When can my kids get the vaccine? Do they need to get it? - They do, but let me tell\\r\\nyou what the strategy has been for decades and decades\\r\\nand decades with vaccines. Children and pregnant\\r\\nwomen are vulnerable. So the general policy has been\\r\\nyou do not vaccinate children or pregnant women until\\r\\nyou've proven that the vaccine induces the same sort of\\r\\nresponse that it induces in normal adults and protects them. And you do what's called a bridge. You bridge the immunogenicity\\r\\nstudy in the children and the pregnant women\\r\\nwith the efficacy study that you've already completed, and you make a determination that it's okay to give it to children. We're gonna start that likely\\r\\ntowards the end of January, we'll be doing that in children. - Oh, that's soon. - So Dr. Fauci, we know that the vaccine doesn't instantly make everything better. So what can you tell us about what the next few months look like? - By the time we get to April, I think it would be open season. Namely, anybody can get vaccinated. There's no restrictions on it at all, because all the priority\\r\\npeople have been vaccinated. If we then vaccinate at a very good rate, President Biden has made the announcement that he's gonna try and\\r\\nget 1 million doses a day, so that a hundred million\\r\\nin the first hundred days. If we do 1 million a day, by the time we get to\\r\\nthe end of the summer, we will have reached that a\\r\\npercentage of herd immunity. So that in the fall, if\\r\\neverybody gets vaccinated that should get vaccinated, we can start approaching\\r\\na degree of normality. That doesn't mean nobody wears a mask, but that does mean kids\\r\\ncan feel secure at school, you can go to a sporting event, you can go to a restaurant\\r\\nand have dinner, you can go to the\\r\\ntheater, things like that. The critical issue is that\\r\\nwe wanna really make sure that this vaccine hesitancy\\r\\nthat we see around gets overcome by the truth, that the vaccine is safe\\r\\nand it's efficacious, and it will protect you, your family, and ultimately all of society. So go out there and beat the bushes. Tell your friends to get vaccinated. - Dr. Fauci, you've been\\r\\ninterviewed by the best of the best the world has to offer, but\\r\\nnever by four idiots at once. Next up, we have a lightning round. Are you ready? (dramatic music) - [Announcer] Lightning Round - These are some of the\\r\\nmost widely believed COVID vaccine conspiracy\\r\\ntheories on the internet. - Okay, Dr. Fauci, are\\r\\nyou lying when you said you got the vaccine? - No. (laughs) Right here. - [Announcer] Lightning Round. - Does the COVID vaccine cause COVID? - Absolutely impossible. - [Announcer] Lightning Round. - Are the vaccine ingredients more toxic than COVID-19 itself? - Absolutely not. - [Announcer] Lightning Round. - Will the vaccine change my DNA? - Absolutely impossible. - [Announcer] Lightning Round. - Well, do the vaccines\\r\\ndeliver a microchip barcode into my arm to keep a\\r\\ntrack of me wherever I go? - (chuckles) No, it doesn't.\\r\\n(both laugh) - [Announcer] Lightning Round. - And Dr. Fauci, one final question. Will coupons that are redeemable for one vaccine shot be called Faucers? - (laughs) I hope not. - Think about it.\\r\\n- That's a good idea. You know? You can run with that. - Dr. Fauci, we wanna thank\\r\\nyou so much for your time. Is there any one last thing\\r\\nyou would say to people who do not want to get the vaccine? - Yeah, I think they really\\r\\nneed to examine carefully in their mind the reasons for that. If it's really based on a lot\\r\\nof people talking about hoaxes and things like that, you\\r\\nreally gotta take a look at the risk that we're going through. We're going through a\\r\\nreal historic challenge, the likes of which we\\r\\nhaven't seen in 102 years and all of this nonsense\\r\\nabout fake news and hoax and all that, I mean, that just results in more people dying. - We wanna thank you so much- - Thank you so much.\\r\\n- For everything you do. - Yes, it's been a real pleasure. - [Ned] Go get vaccinated, everybody. - You bet! Do it. - [All] Bye, Dr. Fauci! - I love you. Oh, he hung up. - Guys, thanks so much for watching. We hope you are taking this as seriously as we need to take it.

       " \" hi good evening to everybody thank you for joining me um this has been doing the rounds on social media today so this is more like an update for my subscribers so that you're aware of some very interesting things that occurred in the news and I'll be able to give a little bit more background about this because I'd spoken about it about a year ago and what you have here is that you have a a John Watts this is this John Watts here he's very angry at the time and he intervened or he asked a question to Rishi sunak the UK prime minister at the time at a people's Forum where it was a tour a political tour going around different parts of the country it was an unanticipated question I think because it seems to have taken him off God so I'm going to play the three minute clip with the question and the response from rashisa with a few points around it but to make sure that you have context I'm also going to highlight to you that just about a year ago a little over a year ago in January I looked at his case and I had mentioned the fact that he waited for about a year before a diagnosis of madius was made which was a vaccine induced and so he was very upset at the time and so to give you context for what he was going to say when he spoke to Rishi sunak I went back into my archives and listen to what he had to say at that time this would probably been about 18 months ago here is John Watts making his point message to all the health professionals I'm going to start calling you the health unprofessionals if I had sat here and it just accepted what you told me I would never have got an answer and never understood what was going on with my heart here I want people to realize it took me a year and it's taken me £27,000 to get an answer for my heart I want people to realize if you're going to your doctor and your doctor's telling you this is in your head this is anxiety or whatnot this vaccine is doing more harm than good one year they have left me with myocarditis I think it's time for people to start questioning people start questioning the health professionals it's for you help professionals to realize you're doing more harm than good I could have taken my own life because you made me believe this was in my head this narrative will change in the near future trust me when I see it I want this message to get around the whole world and make you realize it's time to start doing the right thing well John really made his point there and so Rishi sunak would not have known what was coming to him because he hadn't anticip ipated the question and he hadn't anticipated that this could happen so it raises an important point about the fact that many people who were going along with the recommendations happen to have been injured but instead of acknowledging these injuries it has been passed off as being completely rare not too much to worry about because the priority from public health and politics was to ensure that as many people as possible were vaccinated that was their decision at the time and that was their call so they have to live with that call because it does come with consequences so let's get back to exactly what was said actually I just want to make a quick Point here because just recently Rishi sunak was asked in Parliament by Andrew brident with regards to the vaccine roll out and whether or not we should have an investigation into exit deaths it was put back as being there's no concern everything is safe I think he didn't say effective this time he just said safe now I just want to highlight a very simple point before I move on to show this here so this is the jcvi statement on covid-19 vaccination program for Autumn 2023 and so jcvi which is is the joint committee on vaccination and immunization in the UK made some eneral points in Autumn um 2023 I'm highlighting Autumn because it's relevant to what I think I'm going to point out and they were looking at this time at who was eligible for vaccination and I've also got here uh the vaccine products for Autumn 2023 and so this is the bit that I found very interesting so when they looked at adults over 75 they had madna madna fisa and sopi now look very carefully and they have not mentioned astroica isn't that interesting when we go down to the age group 18 to 74 recommendations are fisa fisa Mna and Mna below 12 to um 17 years are just fisa and fisa and fisa where is the astrazenica vaccine why is it not included in that lineup and what seems to have happened is that there was some degree of concern and this was happening in different countries where they pulled back because of some of the side effects that were identified and they found that the mrnas they thought were safer but it raises the question is if it is is it safe or is it safer if that makes sense because you then have to ask the exact same question with what you're doing now now is it that it is safe or is it safer than what you don't yet know we'll come to that in a minute but let us listen again to what John Watts had to say this time to the prime minister at his people's Forum I've got so much to say but such little time my name is John W and I'm one of the covid vaccine injured in this country I want you to look into my eyes R soon I can I want you to look at the pain the trauma and the regret I have in my eyes we have been left with no help at all not only am I in here that's vaccine injured there's another man over there whose life been ruined by That covid-19 vaccine I know people who have lost legs amputations I know people with heart conditions like myself Rak why have I had to set up a support group in Scotland to to look after the people that have been affected by That covid-19 vaccine why are the people who are in charge who told us all to do the right thing have left us all to ro and left me and the thousands and the tens of thousands in this country to ro R soon act look me in the eye when are you going to start to do the right thing the vaccine damage payment scheme is not fit for purpose in Scotland right now according to the yellow card system they are all 30,000 people have had an adverse reaction to That vaccine and deaths John thank you very much indeed for your question for you to start doing the right thing and you You' you've made a really I'll just pause it right here just for a second um just to highlight an important Point here is that he's made a very strong case with regards to the fact that he's been injured and many others have been injured he said 30,000 in Scotland that would need to be corroborated but he's put Rishi sunak on the spot with regards to the fact that he is damaged and what are they going to do about it so let's listen carefully to what Rishi then said wrong Point John prime minister yeah John well I'm very sorry to hear about your personal circumstances and you said someone over here also seems to have suffered by the similar by similar thing now obviously I I don't know about the individual situation that you're in s social media we are silenc we are the most silenced people in this country silenc in the Press because my story in the press okay had to go to the government for comment and they made forgive me forgive me both no one no one no one is lost my house my wife successful career and Sir You Raised some very valid points I'm sure what I've got to say is though we haven't got you on microphone and as you know we've got to get through this I'm sure we can we can raise your points with the prime minister at a later date but in the meantime prime minister if you cover the is I'm I'm very happy to so there is a vaccine compensation scheme that's in place as you alluded to in the NHS obviously everyone individually will work through their cases it's difficult for me to comment on anyone's individual case I'm sure you'll appreciate that I'm very happy to go and look at the cases and I'm sure you'll get them to the team here I mean I'm I'm very saddened and shocked to hear that you've been silenced by anybody that is surprising to me so please do get I'm just pausing you here just a minute before I go forward on it that's a really important Point Rishi sunak is surprised that he was silenced but if you think about it from a government strategy they have highlighted that anyone who asks questions is technically promoting misinformation so you have a problem there because how can you ask questions if from a government policy you are not allowed to ask questions and I'm saying this from a very realistic point of view because I have had the experience of censorship just in case anybody doesn't know in the last few days just talking about the experience of people who are doing autopsy research on vaccine injuries and it is being silenced so this is occurring and so Rishi sunak shouldn't be surprised let's continue and hear what else he has to say your details to Stephen and the team and I will happily take that away of course you should be able to speak about your experience what's happened to you and as I said we have a compensation scheme in place for that and I'll make sure that we're working through that obviously I think you'll appreciate it's hard for me to comment on your specific circumstances just not knowing them and those things forgive me sir we haven't got a microphone on you so our viewers and listeners won't be able to hear I think the the last thing I'd say is yeah we went through a pandemic like everyone else at the points when it came to the vaccine those decisions were always taken on the basis of medical advice from our medical experts to tell us as politicians who are obviously not doctors about how best to roll out the vaccine I'll just pause here a minute and I will just make a very important point just in case anyone didn't realize I predicted this easily a year and a half to two years ago I said if there are found to be issues in the future who is responsible and I guarantee you it will not be Pol politicians he just said it there he said he's taken advice from the doctors and the experts as politicians across the world World they have taken advice from the scientific community and therefore if there are problems as far as they are concerned it is not their responsibility let's think about that and this is what I highlight to people this is why I'm asking questions because fundamentally clinicians are the ones who are front-facing they are the ones who is seeing the patients the responsibility ultimately Falls to them that's the reality and so ensuring safety is not just simply about me being curious this is directly related to my responsibility as a patient advocate just to make it clear the politicians will not intend to take the blame if there are problems and so therefore there is no incen to look for problems that's the issue important let's hear the final bit what was in the public health interest the priority order how that should be done who should be eligible that was something that the doctors recommended on and that's something that we followed now obviously if there are individual circumstances which haven't worked out then that's why we have the compensation scheme in place and I'll make sure that we follow up on your cases okay prime minister thank you jents both of you do give us your details we will get that to the Prime Minister and as he said he will I'm sure look at that for you in so yes that's it in terms of a rra this is the important bit that I'm emphasizing to people listen at the end of the day politicians are politicians they are just doing what they think will work for their political experience and what they are battling for clinicians doctors nurses um Health Care staff you represent the advocates for the patient because your interest should and always should remain the patient not the pharmaceutical industry not the political Elite not Financial backers patients and as Patient Advocates you always have to look out for their needs if people are injured it's not acceptable to ignore them you need to find out why you need to understand the mechanisms of injury because should there be more injury in the future you will still have to sort it out that's my advice at the moment to the medical community don't ignore this because if it goes wrong it is going to be your responsibility not the politicians not the industry have a great evening [Music]\": 0.4976482182276882,\n",

       " \" there's a new report from The Epic Times which seemingly reveals that the CDC drafted an alert for state and local Health authorities about myocarditis and other complications relating to the covid vaccine but for reasons unknown did not send it now this email that the news Outlet obtained allegedly from Dimitri desalis the cdc's top official for equity in covid-19 data and engagement to to two other CDC officials Bears the subject line draft alert on myocarditis and mRNA vaccines desalis adds that this is the most recent draft of an alert as discussed happy to discuss further the email is stated May 21st 2021 3 days later the CDC acknowledged for the first time that reported cases of myocarditis uh existed after receiving a covid-19 vaccination that there were those levels were higher than expected however the agency still recommended that most Americans 12 and older get vac vacinated here to discuss is RAV Aurora an independent journalist at the illusion of consensus podcast welcome back to Rising hey guys great to be here yes thank you for joining us again I turn to you uh whenever there's news on the vaccine and myocarditis front um specifically how significant is this um development that there was this draft email um concerning this issue which you have talked about so much yeah yeah I think there there should have definitely been an alert and some kind of public engagement on this topic and um you saw there was some early reporting just a couple days prior in The Epic Times as well that Zachary styberg great credit to him for this fantastic reporting um about how in in in April um the CDC I believe April 27th the CDC said um relle binsky in this uh White House Press briefing that they had deliberately looked in over 200 doses uh given to the American public of the MRNA vaccines and they could not find a myocarditis signal when in fact uh there were hundreds of reports and vs already on myocarditis up until that point uh they had already consulted with the Israeli Ministry of Health with the Department of Defense um and uh there was also the the US military as well that reported on uh cases of vaccine myocarditis in the military which is kind of unsurprising because that's a kind of concentrated group of uh younger males um who are incredibly fit and healthy which uh where myocarditis cases are particularly concentrated yet days later in late April the Public Announcement by the CDC was that there's no signal here and then when you fast forward to may you have this alert that's drafted um and it's it's not clear what the alert was going to say this is very vague um but days later they do acknowledge that there is a vaccine myocarditis issue um but then it's they say that well the cost benefit analysis for teenagers and young adults is still to get vaccinated so they later do acknowledge it but they don't actually change their tune and they continue recommending it which I I think is particularly egregious when at that particular point and afterwards as well we knew the infection fatality rates we knew who was at risk from covid we knew this was primarily concentrated among elderly individuals with comorbidities people who are obese so for the CDC to have all this data already in vs Israeli Ministry of Health Etc um and to have this this proposal for this draft not being shared to the public and instead um days later it being promoted uh to uh Young Americans without any clear evidence of benefit um I think is completely wrong and just shows just how captured these regulatory agencies are uh help me understand Rob because my understanding was that although the there's an argument to be made about the diminishing or marginal benefits of the covid vaccine for younger people without coor comorbidities as you've described there are also when you look when you compare the risks of having heart uh disease as a consequence of covid versus the risk of having heart disease as a consequence of the uh covid vaccine myocarditis as a consequence of the covid vaccine it's still even if you think that all being a wash you shouldn't get the vaccine the the balance comes out in favor of uh being vaccinated in terms of having a lower uh incidence of heart rate at least within every population except for the narrow band of men within a certain age bracket so was it inaccurate for the CDC to advise that there was still some benefit even if it is marginal to Young people getting the vaccine especially given that many young people do in fact have comorbid comorbidities R obes these are not um rare uh rare quantities to have and unfortunately in our population yeah yeah no it was it was completely inaccurate and this particular comparison between hard complications from the vaccine versus covid you know I'm not a cardiologist so initially for me I was looking at this topic um and I was wondering like what's going on here CU you read mainstream media and you read you listen to Peter hotz they're all talking about how the cardiac risks from uh covid are far greater than the vaccine then I interviewed this guy Dr Anish Koka who distributed uh covid vaccines at his own clinic in Philadelphia Koka Cardiology um I highly recommend you check out his stuff I interviewed him and that interview is actually going to be coming out soon there was an earlier article that I did with him and we went over this for like three hours um and I I fact checked him and we did rigorous research and he's still operating the clinic and he explained to me and this really Bears out in the data is that Co viroc caritis from covid is fundamentally different from myocarditis from the vaccine because myocarditis from the vaccine particularly affects younger and healthier people and more importantly than that you can still see myocarditis in people in their 40s and 50s but myocarditis from covid is not the same thing it's not myocarditis in any traditional sense it's more like individuals who are in the hospital who are having multiple complications they're being pushed over the edge uh they have they're having lung issues Brea you know breathing issues uh they might not potentially make it and they're also having cardiac issues and when you test them you find elevated cardiac levels so it's labeled as myocarditis whereas with vaccine myocarditis it's just myocarditis it's not 10 other different things going on and the individual um struggling in the hospital uh with with every last breath it's individuals who otherwise would have been uh healthy so those two groups are very very different so that's actually an apples and oranges comparison which is something that I didn't know initially thankfully now I'm educated on this topic so that comparison doesn't really work when it comes to younger healthier people now Brianna you're absolutely right and this is something um that I've I've debated with some people and talked about is that in the United States comorbidities are real it's not just you know 0.00 something percent of the population there are significant rates um of obesity but when it came to the vaccine discussion the CDC just refused and just were not doing an honest conversation about risks and benefits there was just always this very strange from the outside and to many other scientists very strange like dogmatic approval um and promotion of these covid vaccines in younger Americans when they hadn't done that proper risk benefit analysis right how much are we actually lowering mortality you know what are the risk of myocarditis versus uh you know preventing um hospitalization from covid I mean these kind of conversations were not actually uh being had um you know very clearly and instead they were pushing it uh kind of zealously and then it was left to other uh research agencies like around the world like studies in Thailand and Hong Kong um which I don't know why they had to do those studies and we couldn't do those studies but a lot of those countries actually did the myocarditis studies the rigorous myocarditis studies like subclinical myocarditis and they ended up finding like 1 to 2% of uh young uh adolescents uh young teens uh had gotten some form of subclinical or clinical myocarditis and those rates are absolutely terrifying if if if those rates actually apply some of those studies are very small they're in one 100 or 200 people um but there again we weren't clear on the risk benefit analysis the CDC seem to be clear absent the requisite evidence and instead of being cautious about this and instead of when we're talking in April and May when they had gotten all these reports in v and Israeli Ministry of Health and Department of Defense instead of being like Oh let's let's be careful here let's maybe recommend this to elderly people or to people who are vulnerable the CDC never did that they never did what European countries like Denmark and Sweden and certain Asian countries that here we had this potentially predictably very zealous pharmaceutical traditional American approach where it's all about medication vaccination just you got to take these products by fiser and madna and if you question it then suddenly you're antiva that's not how science should be done and the CDC completely failed in my opinion RAV Aurora thank you so much for joining us today we appreciate it

       " \" astrazenica is being sued in the high court for a lawsuit that claims its coid 19 vaccine was defective but many people are not aware that there is already a scheme in the UK for compensation payments if you've been injured as a result of taking a vaccine those who are severely disabled as a result of taking the co 19 vaccine may be eligible and qualify for a single lumpsum tax-free payment of £120,000 a piece many people are not aware of this but to the extent that some people over on my other channel black belt Secrets make sure you go and subscribe there as well called this out as being conspiracy theorists going after cash now I've done a couple of videos on this now here on black belt bar I'm going to go into a little bit more of the law and over on black belt secrets you can see a more General summary if you want to go there as well I'll link that below but co9 vaccines are not the only thing that people can be eligible for these payouts if they are severely injured disabled as a result of a vaccine in fact the vaccine damage payment scheme covers things including Corona virus which was added as it was reported as a precaution along with uh dip theia influenza misol the mumps all sorts of other different things that are on this list which are will link below so you can go and read that as well for yourself and there's a number of different bits of legisl all around surrounding vaccines about the pre-approval the post authorization and all of these kind of things about how they are tested how they are supposed to be uh vigorously tested before they're safe and released and so on now on the 3rd of December 2020 the UK Department of Health and Social care issued a press release announcing that the co 19 vaccines will generally be added to the vaccine damage payment scheme this announcement made the day after after the fiser vaccine was granted temporary authorization this press release stated that there were no safety concerns identified during the clinical trials of the fiser vaccine however as a precautionary step it was said that this was added to this scheme to provide financial assistance in the extremely rare circumstances where somebody might be severely disabled as a result of taking the coid 19 vaccine now according to official data released under an foi request to the NHS open data portal the following statistics are quite interesting the numbers in terms of people are indeed very low which fits the categorization of extremely rare circumstances however there have been a number of payouts across various different age groups so I'll go through those statistics and then address why it might therefore be that there are two cases coming to the high court against astroica let's look at the statistics first of all in the age bracket of 0 to 17 29 people made a claim of which zero received a payment in the age bracket of 18 to 29 556 people made a claim but only eight people were paid out to the tune of 96,000 in the age bracket of 30 to39 1,171 people made a claim of which 16 people were paid out to the tune of1 1.9 million pounds in the age bracket of 40 to 49 1,499 people made a claim and 37 received a payment in the age bracket of 50 to 59 1,871 people made a claim of whom 44 people received a payout in the age bracket of 60 to 65 a shorter age bracket this time 885 people made a claim uh 24 people received a payout and 66 onwards 1,350 4 people made a claim and 19 people received a payout a grand total payout under this scheme of 17.7 million for severe disabilities or injuries caused by the coid 19 vaccine now this of course is not conspiracy theorist discussion these are actual statistics from NHS open data portal as to those that have been paid out under this scheme so why is it then that there are two cases going against astrazenica to the high court and why are ministers calling for change to say that this scheme is no longer adequate well according to court filings which have recently been revealed the claim suggest that these vaccines were defective in some way and resulting in very serious injuries including speech difficulties reduced cognition memory and processing and accordingly the claimants are seeking damages from astroica it has to be said that in April 2021 the medicines and healthc care products regulatory agency issued an updated information to say that there were possible risks of extremely rare and unlikely to occur specific types of blood clots following the vaccination with the astrazenica jab this regulator also said that the benefits of vaccination continue to outweigh any risks but advised careful consideration given to people who are at higher risk of specific types of blood clots all because of their medical condition so on the one hand we do have this vaccine damage payment scheme under which eligible people will receive a tax-free oneoff payment of £120,000 on the other hand many people are claiming that this is not sufficient for the injuries that they claim to have sustained after taking a vaccine such as the Oxford astrazenica Co 19 vaccine so whil you're at an early stage and this case has obviously not gone to court yet it's not going to be in court for around a year or so it is going to come to the Forefront and the high court is going to have to rule on the evidence before it as to First ly whether or not the severity of these injuries were directly resultant from the coid vaccine and secondly I presume whether the provisions under the vaccine damage payment scheme are already sufficient but either way as you might remember that I've said in previous videos this whole pandemic is likely to result and has resulted in a great number of different cases for many years to come I've experienced many contractual claims whereby parties have either been unwilling or unable to fulfill their obligations under the contract and those cases have gone to court there have been a great deal of employment cases discrimination cases and of course there will be a whole catalog of medical injury claims for many years to come but as always I will keep you updated on any of these if you have specific questions do leave them in the comment section below please do go over to Black Belt Secrets check out my video there where I talk a little bit more about those statistics and just while I was putting this video together uh partly as a bit of a caveat and disclaimer and partly just because I thought it was entirely uncanny somebody sent me an email from the NHS to say that they are a priority for seasonal flu and coid 19 vaccinations having both vaccinations will reduce the risk of serious illness and help to recover more quickly if they catch the flu or Co 19 and then details about how to book it to go book online by going to nhs.uk Booky coid so all of those details are available on the NHS website I know many of you are supportive of the coid vaccines and I know many of you are against them my videos here as the caveat are in no way to provide you medical advice they are in no way to encourage or discourage you from having the coid vaccine this is entirely at your discretion and which should be entirely at the advice and direction of your own person personal medical practitioner so if you see this video or you see any other video about the coid vaccine and any other vaccine for that matter you should not rely on those as a replacement for your medical advice any more than you would rely on my videos as a replacement for legal advice you shouldn't and you

       " \" As more and more employers require employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19, many workers are pushing back, citing religious beliefs against getting it. But what does the law say and how does an employer decide? ABC 10s Kurt Rivera explains in tonight's cover story at Destiny Christian Church in Rockland, and so on the form. All the scripture references a pastor signs exemption forms, citing religious beliefs as protection from the need for a COVID-19 vaccine for us who choose not. 2. We put our faith in the Lord, but how does that hold up in the workplace? According to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, employers must provide quote reasonable accommodations for workers who have quote sincerely held religious beliefs. It doesn't mean that they have to grant all exemption requests. Michelle Mello is a Stanford law School and health policy professor for the University School of Medicine. She says in the past, employers have granted a quote fairly large birth for religious exemptions. But with Kovid that has changed in this context, there are some distinct challenges because many of the people who are filing religious exemption requests have never refused vaccines before. This is the only vaccine that they object to, and the nature of their objection isn't truly religious. It's more of a personal belief exemption that they're trying to shoehorn into their religious exemption channel, and she says under the law employers are allowed to question the employee about their exemption. That doesn't require that you've tide to a recognized denomination or that you have a letter from your clergyperson It does require that you articulate an argument that is religious in nature and not more generally just about your personal beliefs. And then there's a portion that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says gives the employer the right to deny a religious exemption on what's called undue hardship that's defined as quote more than a de minimis or minimal burden or cost to run an employers business. It could lead to an employee getting fired for certain industries. There isn't a reasonable accommodation in the employee is going to be faced with a hard choice. And health care is certainly one of those industries. Education is probably another where you know remote work is not really feasible and some of the other accommodations that the employer might think about just aren't going to do the trick in terms of reassuring everyone that they can operate a safe workplace. San Joaquin County Public health officer Dr Maggie Park says, quote, the California Department of Public Health guidelines stress religious exemptions should be based on sincerely held religious beliefs. San Joaquin County Public Health Services continues to reach out to our faith based. Organizations to help answer questions about the COVID-19 vaccine and making the shots readily available to the community and the Federal Labor Code also allows an employer to grant a different religious accommodation than what the employee is asking for if it poses undue hardship to the business.\": 0.3726797862001943,\n",

It's highly\\xa0\\xa0 likely to be present in the other adenoviral\\xa0\\r\\nvector vaccine such as the Russian vaccine\\xa0\\xa0 Sputnik. I have previously talked about the\\xa0\\r\\npossible pathophysiology of how these adenovirus\\xa0\\xa0 vector vaccines lead to blood clots and ultimately\\xa0\\r\\nlow platelets. Now low platelets occur through a\\xa0\\xa0 mechanism where the platelets get consumed in\\xa0\\r\\nthe clot so when we measure the platelet values\\xa0\\xa0 they're quite low. Now this condition similar\\xa0\\r\\nto what we call heparin-induced blood clots\\xa0\\xa0 and low platelets. Heparin is a blood thinner\\xa0\\r\\nthat we use to prevent and treat blood clots.\\xa0\\xa0 Now this week some new additional information on\\xa0\\r\\nthe pathophysiology of vaccine-induced blood clots\\xa0\\xa0 was reported in the journal of Science Advances.\\xa0\\r\\nThere's a link to the research paper in the\\xa0\\xa0 description below. Now understanding how the\\xa0\\r\\nmechanism that is how these vaccines induce\\xa0\\xa0 blood clots which can be fatal is important not\\xa0\\r\\njust to prevent the outcome but also to treat it.\\xa0\\xa0 We also need to understand this because\\xa0\\r\\nwe use adenovirus viral vectors to deliver\\xa0\\xa0 treatments. Now just a quick recap on this\\xa0\\r\\nparticular condition the frequency is on the\\xa0\\xa0 order of one in thirty thousand to about one\\xa0\\r\\nin a hundred thousand. A review at the end\\xa0\\xa0 of July in the journal Blood reviewed the\\xa0\\r\\nUnited Kingdom experience with AstraZeneca\\xa0\\xa0 and the U.S. experience with J & J up to\\xa0\\r\\nsometime in July. As you can see on the slide\\xa0\\xa0 there are a number of cases of cerebral vein\\xa0\\r\\nthrombosis. This is an unusual kind of blood\\xa0\\xa0 clot that we can see involving the veins of\\xa0\\r\\nthe brain and these veins drain the brain\\xa0\\xa0 and of course if you get blood clots in there\\xa0\\r\\nit will not drain the brain properly. It's an\\xa0\\xa0 unusual diagnosis I must say I've only managed a\\xa0\\r\\ncouple of people with this in my 30-year career.\\xa0\\xa0 Blood clots also were being found in other\\xa0\\r\\nareas which were not usual including the\\xa0\\xa0 abdominal blood vessels. The majority of the\\xa0\\r\\nblood clots were seen after the first dose.\\xa0\\xa0 18% of people in the Uk group died and 11% in the\\xa0\\r\\nU.S. group so pretty significant mortality. Now\\xa0\\xa0 previous studies which I've reported on previously\\xa0\\r\\nhighlight the role of platelet factor 4 which we\\xa0\\xa0 know is what happens with this heparin-induced\\xa0\\r\\nblood clotting. It can occur in veins as well as\\xa0\\xa0 arteries just like the vaccine-induced condition\\xa0\\r\\nI'm talking about. Here's the research paper. The\\xa0\\xa0 researchers studied three different adenovirus\\xa0\\r\\nvectors which have been deployed as vaccination\\xa0\\xa0 vectors in the different Sars Cov2 vaccines. This\\xa0\\r\\nmodel of the AstraZeneca viral vector they had to\\xa0\\xa0 determine. They had to elucidate where there might\\xa0\\r\\nbe binding with platelet factor four and how it\\xa0\\xa0 actually would bind and whether it was plausible.\\xa0\\r\\nThey ultimately showed that the adenovirus vector\\xa0\\xa0 combined with platelet factor four via an\\xa0\\r\\nelectrostatic interaction something like\\xa0\\xa0 something electrically positive joining was simply\\xa0\\r\\nelectrically negative. In other words opposites\\xa0\\xa0 attracting. They showed that a stable complex gets\\xa0\\r\\nformed with the vector and platelet factor four.\\xa0\\xa0 Now platelet factor four is only present in the\\xa0\\r\\nbloodstream so this kind of interaction does not\\xa0\\xa0 occur in muscle cells where the vaccine might\\xa0\\r\\nbe. They did look at a common medication called\\xa0\\xa0 Fondaparinux which is an anticoagulant that\\xa0\\r\\nI've used many times for both acute coronary\\xa0\\xa0 syndromes such as heart attacks as well as\\xa0\\r\\nblood clots in the leg and the lung and they\\xa0\\xa0 found that this medication reduces the number of\\xa0\\r\\nbinding events with the adenovirus vector surface\\xa0\\xa0 from AstraZeneca and platelet factor four. So it\\xa0\\r\\nablates this electronegative potential between\\xa0\\xa0 there and inhibits the binding suggesting\\xa0\\r\\nthat this might be a plausible treatment.\\xa0\\xa0 Now their study was performed in test tubes\\xa0\\r\\non the bench in the laboratory not in humans\\xa0\\xa0 but they did show that platelet factor four does\\xa0\\r\\ncontact the surface of this adenovirus vector\\xa0\\xa0 when allowed to freely move around in simulations.\\xa0\\r\\nVaccine-induced blood clots typically occur 5 to\\xa0\\xa0 24 days after vaccination which is the time frame\\xa0\\r\\nwhere you're going to get an antibody response.\\xa0\\xa0 Now complete elucidation of what truly happens\\xa0\\r\\nhas not completely been worked out but this\\xa0\\xa0 schematic provides the best evidence that we have\\xa0\\r\\nas to what's happening so far. Now first someone\\xa0\\xa0 will get vaccinated and somehow the vector enters\\xa0\\r\\nthe bloodstream either by an injection that does\\xa0\\xa0 not truly go into the muscle in other words\\xa0\\r\\nit goes into a small blood vessel directly\\xa0\\xa0 due to injection technique or more specifically\\xa0\\r\\nlack of aspiration and the needle is actually in\\xa0\\xa0 the blood vessel when the injection occurs. If\\xa0\\r\\nthere's damage to tiny capillary blood vessels\\xa0\\xa0 as the needle is inserted where small amounts\\xa0\\r\\nof the vaccine might be able to gain access to\\xa0\\xa0 the bloodstream even though the vaccine might\\xa0\\r\\nbe placed correctly into the deltoid muscle\\xa0\\xa0 this could be the case as well. Perhaps there's\\xa0\\r\\nanother mechanism which I haven't thought of where\\xa0\\xa0 some vaccine particles can actually access the\\xa0\\r\\nbloodstream. Then in schematic two as you can see\\xa0\\xa0 there is that electrostatic positive and negative\\xa0\\r\\nattraction of platelet factor 4 to the vector\\xa0\\xa0 and the complex then gets engulfed by other\\xa0\\r\\ncells because they see it as being foreign.\\xa0\\xa0 They send it to one of your lymph nodes which\\xa0\\r\\nthen stimulates the b cells in the lymph nodes\\xa0\\xa0 to generate anti platelet factor four antibodies\\xa0\\r\\nor antibodies against the whole complex. Now these\\xa0\\xa0 antibodies then activate platelets and a number of\\xa0\\r\\nfactors are released which causes more platelets\\xa0\\xa0 to clump together in more platelet factor four\\xa0\\r\\nultimately it causes clot formation and thus the\\xa0\\xa0 syndrome of vaccine-induced blood clots and low\\xa0\\r\\nplatelets. Again the platelets are low because\\xa0\\xa0 all of the platelets are bound within the clot and\\xa0\\r\\nthey're not freely circulating in the bloodstream.\\xa0\\xa0 Now this is important research for many reasons\\xa0\\r\\nas I mentioned earlier. This key feature\\xa0\\xa0 is that this happens in the bloodstream and while\\xa0\\r\\nwe can't definitively say that this happens due to\\xa0\\xa0 vaccination technique it could certainly be. It's\\xa0\\r\\nobviously important when injecting the needle into\\xa0\\xa0 the deltoid muscle that you deliver the vaccine\\xa0\\r\\ninto the muscle and not into a tiny blood vessel.\\xa0\\xa0 As I mentioned previously on this particular\\xa0\\r\\nvideo this does happen based on surveys of nurses\\xa0\\xa0 that have given intramuscular injections\\xa0\\r\\nover the years. Many of them have said\\xa0\\xa0 that they have aspirated blood just before they're\\xa0\\r\\nabout to inject the intramuscular injection and so\\xa0\\xa0 they always check before they inject. Now it would\\xa0\\r\\nbe terrible to find out down the road that this is\\xa0\\xa0 something to do with side effects that's the lack\\xa0\\r\\nof aspiration when it could have been preventable.\\xa0\\xa0 Of course we don't know that that's definitely the\\xa0\\r\\ncause there's lots of vaccinations going on and a\\xa0\\xa0 randomized trial would be interesting and could\\xa0\\r\\ndefinitively answer the question. It wouldn't be\\xa0\\xa0 that difficult to do. You would obviously need\\xa0\\r\\na lot of patience given the low frequency of\\xa0\\xa0 the side effects involved but of course we\\xa0\\r\\nare vaccinating a lot of people right now.\\xa0\\xa0 I have told my patients who have encouraged\\xa0\\r\\nvaccination to make sure that they ask the\\xa0\\xa0 person doing the vaccination to aspirate before\\xa0\\r\\ninjection. It's such a small accommodation of only\\xa0\\xa0 about three seconds. It makes me think about all\\xa0\\r\\nthe requests that my patients often ask me for,\\xa0\\xa0 reasonable requests. I think of things like\\xa0\\r\\nmedications that they may or may not want before\\xa0\\xa0 a procedure or at other times sometimes they have\\xa0\\r\\nrequests of getting them positioned in a certain\\xa0\\xa0 spot for their endoscopy just before I'm about\\xa0\\r\\nto sedate them they might want an extra pillow\\xa0\\xa0 or a pillow between their knees to make sure that\\xa0\\r\\ntheir back is comfortable while they're asleep for\\xa0\\xa0 20 minutes. If their accommodations are reasonable\\xa0\\r\\nand not harmful, I always follow their wishes.\\xa0\\xa0 Often it doesn't take any additional time\\xa0\\r\\nbut it shows that I care. It shows people\\xa0\\xa0 that I'm listening to them and it allows for\\xa0\\r\\nshared decision making which is crucial in\\xa0\\xa0 the doctor-patient relationship. It ultimately\\xa0\\r\\nmeans that they will be happy and so will I.\\xa0\\xa0 Asking for someone to aspirate before injecting\\xa0\\r\\nas I did before both of my vaccinations is not\\xa0\\xa0 much to ask for even if it's not the usual way\\xa0\\r\\nthat the vaccinator might perform their task.\\xa0\\xa0 Healthcare providers should always be receptive\\xa0\\r\\nto those that they're delivering care to\\xa0\\xa0 being inflexible or emphatic in their beliefs\\xa0\\r\\nand deciding that it's their way or the highway\\xa0\\xa0 so to speak that has no place in medicine. Thanks\\xa0\\r\\nfor joining me today on Medicine with Dr. Moran.\\xa0\\xa0 I'm Dr. Keith Moran. Get healthy and stay healthy.\": 0.530831094193163,\n",
       " \" this is a cartoon of what the coronavirus looks like magnified thousands of times from this picture you can see where it gets its name because it looks like a crown of thorns and corona literally means crown in latin these thorns in the viruses crown are actually called spike proteins and they really are the viruses key weapon to attack our bodies by attaching onto cells and invading them early last january scientists from china published the genetic code for the virus on the internet so that folks from around the world could start working on it you see these little squiggles here represent the genetic information for the virus scientists basically copied a tiny part of it that's responsible for making the spike protein the other term you've heard for this little piece of genetic material is mrna which stands for messenger rna hence the mrna vaccines i like to think of the mrna vaccines like a fortune cookie you have this messenger rna to tell the body make the spike proteins but the mrna is fragile and it gets broken down quickly so we wrap it inside a ball of fat or my fortune cookie so it lasts long enough to get injected in our bodies and get the message to ourselves to start making those spike proteins simply put the vaccine or my fortune cookie with the mrna wrapped in a little ball of fat to protect it gets injected in our muscle tells our bodies to produce the spike protein and then our immune system sees it as something foreign that deserves to be attacked and starts ramping up our immune system to make antibodies antibodies are the little soldiers our immune system makes to fight infections so our antibody soldiers learn how to fight off the coronavirus spikes without ever having to be infected with the actual coronavirus so just having the spike protein around gets us all of the benefits of having immunity without all of those nasty consequences associated with getting infected with the actual virus\": 0.40707384403036573,\n",
       " ' - Hey, y\\'all welcome back. I\\'m mama Dr. Jones, a Board Certified ObGyn, a mom to four, and today I\\'m giving you an\\r\\nupdate on COVID vaccination as it relates to pregnancy and fertility. I recently made an\\r\\nupdate video on COVID-19 and its effects in pregnancy, If you\\'d like to check that out I will link it in the iCard, or in the description box below. This information is up to\\r\\ndate to the best of my ability as of the day of filming, which is August 31st, 2021. In this video we\\'re covering are COVID-19 vaccination\\r\\nsafe in pregnancy? Do the COVID-19 vaccinations\\r\\ncause infertility? Does COVID-19 vaccination lead your body to attack placentas? Aren\\'t you concerned about\\r\\nthe long-term effects of the vaccine? And whether antibodies are transferred through the placenta and\\r\\nthrough the breast milk to the baby. If you\\'re new here and you\\'d like to subscribe, we would love to have you. I talk about all things, periods, pregnancy, period\\r\\nproducts, gynecology, and everything in between. Hit that subscribe button, turn on notifications so\\r\\nyou never miss an upload. I promise you\\'ll leave with\\r\\nthings to tell your friends. (energetic music) Are COVID-19 vaccination\\r\\nsafe in pregnancy? We now have sufficient data to say that COVID-19 vaccinations are safe to be given during pregnancy. This means the outcomes\\r\\nand people who are pregnant and not vaccinated, are similar to people who are pregnant and they get vaccinated. And people who are pregnant and get vaccinated have better outcomes if they contract COVID-19\\r\\nduring the pregnancy, than people who get\\r\\nCOVID-19 during pregnancy and are not vaccinated. Please, please, please get vaccinated, even if you are pregnant. The recommendation to get\\r\\nvaccinated during pregnancy, if you have not already been vaccinated, is not just coming from me. This is from every major\\r\\nmedical organization and expert that is tasked with taking care of people who are pregnant, or who have recently had a baby. Please, please, please consider this, and if you have any questions bring them up with your doctor or midwife. Does the COVID-19 vaccination\\r\\neven work in pregnant people? Yes, we have very good data now to indicate that COVID-19\\r\\nvaccination is not only safe, but also effective if you are getting it during pregnancy. It does decrease the risk\\r\\nof COVID-19 infection. Does COVID-19 vaccination cause\\r\\nmiscarriage or stillbirth? There is absolutely zero evidence to indicate there\\'s an association here. I know this is one of the\\r\\nthings that goes around on the internet as disinformation,\\r\\nand it is not true. JAMA recently released\\r\\na review of V-safe data that indicated that these risk rates fall within the expected range\\r\\nfor the baseline population, and are not increased in\\r\\npeople who are vaccinated. In fact, the rate of pregnancy loss in the largest data review that we have on people who are vaccinated for COVID-19 during pregnancy, indicates that their pregnancy loss rates rank at the lower side\\r\\nof the range that we see in people in the general\\r\\npopulation for pregnancy loss. Based on this data we can say there does not appear\\r\\nto be any increased risk in miscarriage, stillbirth,\\r\\npregnancy complications, growth restriction, congenital anomalies, or neonatal death or complications in people who were vaccinated\\r\\nfor COVID-19 during pregnancy. As always, I\\'ve linked these sources\\r\\nin the description box below if you\\'d like to check out the data. I will, once again, here repeat. Many of these things are\\r\\nsignificantly increased in people who have COVID-19, especially severe\\r\\nCOVID-19 during pregnancy. The vaccine reduces the risk\\r\\nof COVID-19 in pregnancy, as well as severe infection in pregnancy, and thus reduces your risk if\\r\\nyou are to contract COVID-19, even if you have a breakthrough infection. Please, please, please understand that this can be very dangerous\\r\\nand devastating at baseline, but especially if you are pregnant. Does COVID-19 vaccination\\r\\ncause infertility? This is another one that\\r\\nis spread over and over as misinformation on the internet. Why? Because it\\'s effective\\r\\nand it scares people. So, what do we know? Earlier this year I did a video about where this idea originated and why it was biologically\\r\\ncompletely implausible. The idea that these two\\r\\nproteins are so similar that your antibodies could\\r\\nmount an immune response is a bit of a extremist claim. They do have some similarities, a lot of viruses have similarities. They would need to be extremely similar, and we\\'re just not finding that when you actually look\\r\\nat the genetic sequencing of the spike protein and\\r\\nthe syncytin-1 protein that they\\'re talking about. I also discussed in that video that the person who is\\r\\nspreading the information has no expertise in pregnancy or birth, and has no understanding of\\r\\nbasic pregnancy physiology based on the fact that they presumed that COVID-19 antibodies\\r\\nwould attack the placenta and that this would cause infertility. I probably have a very large\\r\\nviewership right now going, \"That doesn\\'t make any sense because if it attacks the placenta, that wouldn\\'t cause infertility it would cause pregnancy loss.\" And you\\'re right. Why? The placenta is not even functioning until nine weeks into the pregnancy, so if this theory was true, it\\'s not, it would actually cause\\r\\nmiscarriage not infertility. But there is no evidence\\r\\nthat COVID-19 vaccination causes either of those. Despite the lack of biologic plausibility we studied it anyway, and this study revealed that if you compared people\\r\\ngoing through IVF treatments and having an embryo transfer, and you looked at a group of\\r\\npeople with no antibodies, natural antibodies from a\\r\\nprevious COVID infection, and antibodies from a vaccination, there were no difference\\r\\nin pregnancy rates across these three groups. Meaning, neither COVID\\r\\ninfection in the past nor vaccination in the past, decreases your chances of\\r\\npregnancy in the future. Additionally, we also can review the data\\r\\nfrom the original studies on the vaccination, the number of unplanned\\r\\npregnancies did not differ between the patients who\\r\\nhad received the placebo and the patients who had\\r\\nreceived the COVID vaccine. There was no difference. If these vaccinations\\r\\nwere affecting fertility you would expect to see a far lower number of accidental pregnancies, and a far lower number of\\r\\npregnancies in the IVF study in the people who had been vaccinated. So, we\\'ve established that theory has no biologic plausibility, no data, and sufficient data to say it is nonsense. Of course, once this\\r\\nperson was proven wrong by my biologic possibility\\r\\ninformation in the original video several months ago, and now with hard data, they decided that they would\\r\\nchange their tune and say, \"Well, it may not cause infertility but COVID vaccine antibodies definitely cause placental attack, which could lead to\\r\\npregnancy complications and miscarriage.\" Fortunately, we expected this, people who spread misinformation\\r\\nwhen they\\'re proven wrong they switch and they spread\\r\\nit in a different way, especially if the campaign\\r\\nwas effective the first time. So, we studied this and\\r\\neven almost before it could come out of this person\\'s\\r\\nmouth, we proved it wrong. Now we have a study that looks specifically at\\r\\nthe histology of placentas and compares placentas from\\r\\npeople who were vaccinated to people who were unvaccinated\\r\\nat the time of delivery. And what that study found, based on four histological\\r\\nmarkers of placental damage, is that there was no difference between histological\\r\\nindicators of placental damage in the group which was vaccinated and the group which was not. Interestingly, there was actually an\\r\\nincreased risk of inflammation in the placentas which came\\r\\nfrom unvaccinated people. However, the relevance of\\r\\nthat information at this point is completely unclear, so we\\'re not going to\\r\\ntalk about it at length. As I said earlier, we\\'ve\\r\\nalready figured out that based on the data we have there is also no increased\\r\\nrisk of miscarriage or pregnancy loss, based on a huge review of the\\r\\ncurrently given vaccinations in people who get the\\r\\nvaccine while pregnant. All of these studies are linked\\r\\nin the description box below if you would like to review them. What do I have to say\\r\\nto the people who say, \"We don\\'t know the long-term\\r\\neffects of the vaccination. You can\\'t say this until\\r\\nwe have three years of data or five years of data.\"? This is arbitrary. You can\\'t just come up with\\r\\nan arbitrary amount of time for long-term complications. We need to look at this from\\r\\na historical perspective, as well as an absolute and\\r\\nrelative risk perspective. Never in the history of vaccinations has there been a vaccine which was safe and effective early on, and then three years later we found a random severe side effect that just suddenly popped up, MRNA, specifically, is what\\r\\npeople seem to be worried about. MRNA is degraded in your\\r\\nbody within hours to days, and certainly is gone\\r\\nwithin a couple of weeks. And all that remains is\\r\\nyour body\\'s response, meaning antibodies to\\r\\nprotect you against COVID-19. Vaccine side effects are known to occur mostly in the first few days but maybe up to a couple of months after you get the vaccine. So, no, we do not have to wait\\r\\nthree years or five years, or some other arbitrary number that someone who has no idea\\r\\nwhat they\\'re talking about comes up with, to decide that COVID-19 vaccinations do not cause infertility. We have the data, we have historical precedence for this. And even if we didn\\'t, I think it is extremely\\r\\nimportant to look at this from a relative and\\r\\nabsolute risk standpoint. In the short-term COVID-19 is dangerous, it can cause extreme illness and death in higher amounts, by far, than any vaccine side\\r\\neffects that we are seeing. In the short term vaccines are known to be\\r\\nboth safe and effective at preventing these problems. In the long-term we know that a history of COVID infection can cause major issues, we also know that historically many viruses have complications which go on long-term or\\r\\npop up later on in life. Vaccinations have never done that, and there is absolutely no data to indicate that that will be different with this vaccination. When you are weighing the\\r\\nrelative risk and benefit for somebody who is either\\r\\nwanting to be pregnant, currently pregnant,\\r\\nmight ever be pregnant, or even doesn\\'t even wanna get pregnant but just is concerned about the things that people are saying, the vaccine outweighs\\r\\nthe virus by magnitudes as far as safety goes. Please, please, please protect yourself and protect your fertility by staying alive and getting vaccinated. Are antibodies transferred to the baby through breast milk or the placenta? We now have really good data to say that, yes, antibodies do go through\\r\\nthe placenta to the baby and through breast milk to the baby. As far as how much protection\\r\\nthis actually provides, we aren\\'t sure yet. Step one is figuring out if it happens, which we know it does. Step two is figuring out what the level is that is needed for protection, and if this antibody transfer actually conveys that\\r\\namount and protects the baby after birth, either through transfer\\r\\nthrough the placenta or breastfeeding. We are working on that. Step three is figuring out\\r\\nhow long this protection lasts and the optimum time for a\\r\\nbaby or child to be vaccinated, and that\\'s something that\\r\\nwe\\'re working on as well. I do think it is incredibly encouraging that we are seeing the\\r\\nantibodies transferred through the placenta and\\r\\nthrough the breast milk to the baby. I hope that you learned something today. If you did, please leave a like, send this to a friend, give a comment, anything to help it get out to more people and combat the misinformation\\r\\nthat we are seeing everywhere on the internet.

       " \" what a warm welcome just a brief evening update for Wednesday the 25th I wanted to bring you this sort of hot off the press it's from The Joint Committee on uh vaccination and immunization and basically what they're saying is as from the 12th of next month healthy under 50s are not going to be eligible for covert vaccination in the UK some might say this is a sensible targeting of resources as we move towards endemicity others might suggest it's uh frantic backpedaling the report is written in very positive language about this move to a more rational distribution of resources nothing about side effects nothing about adverse reactions nothing about changing risk benefit analysis some of you might find what I'm about to say fairly pathetic but let's do it anyway jvci makes uh recommend interim recommendations and we can expect these to be taken up by the government of course has advised that plans should be made for those at higher risk of severe covid-19 to be offered to booster vaccination this Autumn so looking at head so it's not saying that young people are at minimal risk especially in the age of Omicron it's not saying that we've now got huge amounts of natural immunity it's not saying we've now got huge amounts of mucosal immunity no it's just a simple rationalization and targeting of of resources Professor Lim chair as the transition continues away from a pandemic emergency response towards pandemic recovery yep in England at the closure of the Autumn booster campaign will be on the 12th of uh February 2023 still over two weeks away I guess um two and a half weeks away basically it means no more boosters for health healthy under 50s which we are of course very pleased to um very pleased to see uh similarly the jvcis advising that the primary course of covert vaccination should move over the course of 2023 towards a more targeted offer so this is going to include primary immunization as well as the boosters fairly soon and this is all here really for yourself it's just put in language which makes everything sound so positive there's no mention of anything negative it really does strike me as being it's not written in a genuine way as far as I can see but but there we go now the current recommendations in the UK oh there's also another document here um that that is linked to covert vaccination program this is actually the official document oh uh blood clotting myocarditis and pericarditis and Guillain-Barre syndrome um I guess it's not any longer possible to ignore these uh adverse reactions what's the word that describes that there's a word they use um rare that's it these rare these rare reactions so it's good to see some honesty at least on on that site there now at the moment in the UK and um let me just read it um coronavirus covert vaccinations in the UK everyone age five on or before the 31st of August 2022 I know we can get a first and second dose of the covid-19 vaccine at the moment in my country you can take a perfectly healthy child in to see a professional health care advisor Healthcare practitioner and they will inject a healthy five-year-old child with a messenger ribonucleic acid vaccine that is the current position in my country at the moment I'm not allowed to disagree with this um I merely reported there you go that's the advice there from my government enough of that now Denmark of course is ahead of the uh the curb somewhat as usual um here's the the Danish government site they've already actually adopted this position very kind of the Danish authorities of course to make a full copies available of their documentation in English saves me using Google translate we recommend vaccination of people age 50 years and over as well as selected risk groups so ahead of the game other countries have got to move to this pretty soon haven't they I mean they simply they simply have to the risk of severe disease in young people from Omicron who have been previously exposed to The Vibes and we all have been previously exposed now it's absolutely minimal risk benefit analysis has changed as I've been saying for um well now what we are yeah for over a year now for over a year now radical change now just to finish off on a completely separate matter and this is nothing to do with the history of the MRNA vaccines of course um regulatory funding this article in the British medical journal now the British medical journal says industry money saturates the global leading Regulators not my words British medical journal that's what they say saturates and here we have a table in I'm aware you won't be able to see this I'm going to read some of the uh some of the Salient points about industry money uh proportion of the budget derived from industry so this is it here so Australia it's uh 96 percent Europe it's 89 United Kingdom it's only 86 percent so that means in the United Kingdom 86 of The Regulators money comes from industry and I don't imagine it's you making industry to you in the United States it's actually quite a bit lower it's only 65 percent now of course no one's saying that the fact that Australia get 96 of the money that the Europe get eight to nine percent of the money that UK get 86 of the money the Japan gets 85 of the money that the U.S Regulators get 65 in Canada only 50.5 no one's saying any of these huge percentages have any influence on their decision making of course we merely report what is in the British medical journal the various other things that the bmj has kept this in the public domain so check it out for yourself so there you go um if there was anyone here that wants to rush out and get a vaccine who's healthy below the age of 50 before the expiry time in the UK you've got until the 12th of January um

       " \" choose Ingrid Kelley catches up with the doctor to separate fact from fiction. Census released the Covid vaccine and booster in the medical community and the U. S government as safe and effective. But despite the voice of confidence from the experts, there are those who continue to reject the vaccine and booster shots. I am definitely against it. Me and my family because there's just too many complications with it. They want us to take a vaccine they made in less than three weeks. No it's saying the shots of causing strokes took my third booster side lost my taste and smell. So what's the benefits of me? Keep taking more sets? Cardiologists at core? Well East, formerly Beaumont say they hear the concerns. I believe it's coming from the fact that we know that the vaccination in the booster, especially the Moderna is associated With a very small but real risk of my own card itis, also known as inflammation of wall that can cause heart failure and even cause someone to die. Therefore we have to review the risks of that vaccination. So what I'm hearing from you is that there is a real possible connection between Cardiac arrest and the covid vaccine. Is that correct? Well what I would say is there is a definite association. But doctors still question if other factors could be involved, So could it be from the covid vaccine itself, causing that risk of myocarditis and therefore sudden cardiac arrest? Could it be from the coronavirus? Itself which caused long term effects, or could it be the lack of medical care patients received during the lockdown when people had to stay home? We don't have the full story Let It Rip in the next few months, we will have a better understanding as long as that data is published, So should you get the vaccine and booster shot at this point? I think it's irresponsible to say Don't get it. I think it's irresponsible to say definitely get it Its seek information about the vaccine. Through an Internet search or social media.

       " \" More Americans are declining COVID boosters right now the CDC says only 20% of adults in the nation are getting boosted that leaves them with little protection against being hospitalized for symptoms of COVID joining us to discuss this Dr Peter Hotez from the Baylor college of medicine Dr thanks for joining us the first question many people are wondering. Why do they need another shot some may have even gotten pretty sick with COVID after getting boosted. Yeah I get the question a lot a lot of people a lot of Americans don't realize including here in Houston that the bivalent booster that became available last September is a different vaccine from the original one and that it specifically targets these- Makran variants. That are- can currently circulating so the original vaccine does not protect nearly as well against these new- Makran variants including the XPB one point five the circulating one point one six and others so you really need to get that bivalent booster and we're we're not getting the word out as effectively as we need to. Only about 1718% of Americans have taken that bivalent booster since became available last September so important message number one is if you've not gotten that bivalent booster it's not too late to get it there's still a lot of COVID. going down in our Houston area but they're going potentially up in New York and Connecticut and so there's a possibility it's going to go up again this summer in Houston so get your bivalent booster. A point number one second if you've gotten your bivalent boosters- last September October it is also wearing often so if you're over the age of sixty five or if your amino compromise you're eligible for a second bivalent booster and that's- that's also really important. I think it's critical to remember that COVID-19 is still with us- the levels of transmission are not as high as they used to be the hospitalization earn earn as high. But if you've not got not by Bill the booster you still have that vulnerability to hospitalizations serious illness like you're just mentioned the variants are changing. So are these shots and boosters still affected now because like. You just mentioned the variants are changing. There changing the hallmark. A boost was designed so that it could withstand some of those changes including against these new XP B. R. variants that are rising so that's why you so you still need to get it- the other the other reason is not only for serious illness or hospitalization. But let's remember long COVID long COVID can happen after any COVID case but it's more likely to occur after severe illness and it's more likely to occur with multiple. Infections so this getting this bivalent booster will not only or the second bivalent booster if you've already gotten one will help not only against hospitalization severe illness but also reduce the likelihood of long COVID as well. Few seconds left doctor can people build up natural immunity at this point. There is some natural immunity on one of the things that people don't realize is D. if you only. Have natural immunity after one of those early- Makran infections the virus doesn't is represent replicate is deeply in the system often- as the original variance so. I'm just getting and as one- Makran infection is not enough immunity you still need to get vaccinated on top of it. And that'll create much more durable protection and just real quick lastly what age group should get the booster shot who is most at risk. Both both adults and kids can get that first a bivalent booster if you've already gotten one. The second bivalent boosters only for those over the age of sixty\": 0.5094418979713097,\n",

michigan who died\\xa0\\xa0 three days after getting the pfizer vaccine the\\xa0\\r\\ncause of death is being investigated by the cdc\\xa0\\xa0 and according to the patients on on twitter\\xa0\\r\\nthe preliminary autopsy report showed that he\\xa0\\xa0 had fluid around his heart so what caused his\\xa0\\r\\ndeath before i tell you my thoughts on that it\\xa0\\xa0 first helps to understand what the background\\xa0\\r\\non what myocarditis is it's inflammation of the\\xa0\\xa0 heart muscle and pericarditis is inflammation of\\xa0\\r\\nthe pericardial sac that's where the heart sits\\xa0\\xa0 in there sometimes pericarditis can cause fluid\\xa0\\r\\nto build up within the sac but around the heart\\xa0\\xa0 muscle and this is called a pericardial effusion\\xa0\\r\\nthe first reports of myocarditis after covid 19\\xa0\\xa0 mrna vaccines that involved u.s military\\xa0\\r\\npatients and patients from israel the israeli\\xa0\\xa0 cohort identified a male predominance with an\\xa0\\r\\nincidence of one out of every twenty thousand men\\xa0\\xa0 aged eighteen to thirty we know that the covid\\xa0\\r\\nvaccines from pfizer and modern can cause it but\\xa0\\xa0 actual covid infection is a much more common\\xa0\\r\\ncause the cdc has received 1226 preliminary\\xa0\\xa0 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following\\xa0\\r\\nabout 300 million total doses of the pfizer and\\xa0\\xa0 moderna vaccines myocarditis is most common in\\xa0\\r\\nthe ages of 12 to 30 and it's more common in boys\\xa0\\xa0 among people 12 and older there were 267 reports\\xa0\\r\\nof heart inflammation meaning myocarditis after\\xa0\\xa0 one dose of vaccine and 827 after the\\xa0\\r\\nsecond dose and 132 after an unknown dose\\xa0\\xa0 so overall the number of cases of myocarditis\\xa0\\r\\nrelated to the covid mrna vaccines is very low\\xa0\\xa0 and for those who do get it it's usually a small\\xa0\\r\\namount of heart inflammation that lasts for about\\xa0\\xa0 a week or so requiring minimal treatment in fact\\xa0\\r\\nnot only is myocarditis way more common from covid\\xa0\\xa0 the risks to the heart from infection can be\\xa0\\r\\nmore severe take a look at this ultrasound\\xa0\\xa0 of the heart aka an echocardiogram this is\\xa0\\r\\nof a young patient with covid myocarditis\\xa0\\xa0 this is a poorly pumping heart this is why the\\xa0\\r\\ncdc still recommends vaccination for those 12 and\\xa0\\xa0 older now there's three recent studies that came\\xa0\\r\\nout that looked at specific cases of myocarditis\\xa0\\xa0 that developed after getting the covid mrna\\xa0\\r\\nvaccines pfizer and moderna in the first study\\xa0\\xa0 in the journal pediatrics they reported on seven\\xa0\\r\\ncases of myocarditis from the pfizer vaccine\\xa0\\xa0 all the patients were seven otherwise healthy male\\xa0\\r\\nteenagers all of them tested negative for covid\\xa0\\xa0 none of the patients met criteria for multi-system\\xa0\\r\\ninflammatory syndrome in children or misc\\xa0\\xa0 all had an elevated troponin level troponin is a\\xa0\\r\\nprotein in heart muscle cells and whenever there's\\xa0\\xa0 heart tissue damage as occurs with either a heart\\xa0\\r\\nattack or inflammation of the heart that troponin\\xa0\\xa0 ends up being leaked into the bloodstream the\\xa0\\r\\nhigher the troponin the more heart tissue damage\\xa0\\xa0 an echocardiogram which is great for looking at\\xa0\\r\\nhow the heart is functioning was normal in all but\\xa0\\xa0 one patient cardiac mri which is especially great\\xa0\\r\\nfor looking at detailed structure of the heart\\xa0\\xa0 especially when looking for heart inflammation\\xa0\\r\\nshowed myocarditis in all of the patients\\xa0\\xa0 three patients receive nothing more\\xa0\\r\\nthan nsaids meaning non-steroidal\\xa0\\xa0 anti-inflammatory agents this includes things like\\xa0\\r\\nibuprofen or the more powerful toradol aka ketorolac\\xa0\\xa0 these drugs not only help to suppress\\xa0\\r\\ninflammation or fight inflammation\\xa0\\xa0 but they also help to alleviate pain four patients\\xa0\\r\\nreceived iv ig meaning intravenous immunoglobulin\\xa0\\xa0 and they receive steroids and all of them had\\xa0\\r\\ntheir symptoms resolved in less than a week for\\xa0\\xa0 the one who did have an abnormal echocardiogram\\xa0\\r\\nlet's take a closer look at his case so he's a\\xa0\\xa0 14 year old previously healthy male who gets the\\xa0\\r\\npfizer vaccine one day later he develops a temp of\\xa0\\xa0 38.3 celsius and one day after that starts getting\\xa0\\r\\nshorter breath and he has pleuritic chest pain\\xa0\\xa0 pleuritic chest pain meaning it hurts more when\\xa0\\r\\nhe takes a deep breath or hurts more if you cough\\xa0\\xa0 or sneeze so he goes to an urgent care clinic ekg\\xa0\\r\\nshows st segment elevation st elevation can mean a\\xa0\\xa0 lot of different things depending on the clinical\\xa0\\r\\ncontext sometimes it means there's a heart attack\\xa0\\xa0 sometimes it happens with myocarditis and then\\xa0\\r\\nsometimes it happens with pericarditis especially\\xa0\\xa0 when you see it in most of the leads and that's\\xa0\\r\\nwhat he had and his ultrasound showed mildly\\xa0\\xa0 depressed left and right ventricular systolic\\xa0\\r\\nfunction meaning his left ventricle and his right\\xa0\\xa0 ventricle weren't pumping quite as strong also\\xa0\\r\\nhe had an elevated troponin eye level of 22.1\\xa0\\xa0 ngs per ml which normal range for that hospital\\xa0\\r\\nwas noted to be less than 0.045 ngs per ml now\\xa0\\xa0 in hospital day 3 cardiac mri showed some areas\\xa0\\r\\nof heart muscle swelling meaning edema as well as\\xa0\\xa0 some areas of scarring he was treated with nsaids\\xa0\\r\\nfirst it was toradol and later with naproxen he\\xa0\\xa0 was also treated with a diuretic called lasix aka\\xa0\\r\\nfurosemide they later repeated the echocardiogram\\xa0\\xa0 which showed improvement and he was discharged\\xa0\\r\\nfrom the hospital after four days on follow-up\\xa0\\xa0 13 days later he appeared well but he did have\\xa0\\r\\nchest pain with exertion despite instructions\\xa0\\xa0 to avoid strenuous exercise now an ekg showed\\xa0\\r\\nnon-specific changes at that time and a third\\xa0\\xa0 echocardiogram was also done at that time which\\xa0\\r\\nwas back to normal so overall the seven cases\\xa0\\xa0 of covet vaccine myocarditis in this study had\\xa0\\r\\ngood outcomes then there was this study which had\\xa0\\xa0 eight patients that were hospitalized with chest\\xa0\\r\\npain within two to four days of receiving either\\xa0\\xa0 the pfizer or the moderna vaccine all of them were\\xa0\\r\\notherwise healthy males between the ages of 21 and\\xa0\\xa0 56 so older age range in this group all but one\\xa0\\r\\npatient developed symptoms after their second dose\\xa0\\xa0 most had chest pain within a day or two of the\\xa0\\r\\nvaccine and all had elevated troponin levels and\\xa0\\xa0 myocarditis seen on cardiac mri two of them had\\xa0\\r\\nslight reduction in their heart function one of\\xa0\\xa0 them did undergo a heart biopsy and the pathology\\xa0\\r\\nresults didn't show any abnormality all patients\\xa0\\xa0 had resolution of their chest pain and they were\\xa0\\r\\ndischarged from the hospital in stable condition\\xa0\\xa0 then there was this study that involved seven\\xa0\\r\\npatients hospitalized for acute myocarditis-like\\xa0\\xa0 illness following covid vaccination all were men\\xa0\\r\\nless than 40 years old six patients received the\\xa0\\xa0 mrna vaccine either moderna or pfizer and then\\xa0\\r\\none received the johnson and johnson vaccine\\xa0\\xa0 all the patients presented within three to seven\\xa0\\r\\ndays after they got the vaccine they all had acute\\xa0\\xa0 onset of chest pain and it's basically more of\\xa0\\r\\nthe same as the other patients that we just talked\\xa0\\xa0 about the one patient in this study that did have\\xa0\\r\\na heart biopsy done it didn't show any evidence of\\xa0\\xa0 myocarditis when they did the pathology study now\\xa0\\r\\nalthough the heart biopsy was normal that doesn't\\xa0\\xa0 necessarily mean that there wasn't myocarditis\\xa0\\r\\npresent in a different part of the heart because\\xa0\\xa0 trying to hit that right spot is like throwing\\xa0\\r\\ndarts blindfolded when doing an autopsy though\\xa0\\xa0 this changes because you can look at essentially\\xa0\\r\\nthe entire heart underneath the microscope and\\xa0\\xa0 finally there's this case report this is a 52 year\\xa0\\r\\nold man who developed myocarditis shortly after\\xa0\\xa0 the moderna vaccine and was ultimately discharged\\xa0\\r\\nfrom the hospital they had special permission\\xa0\\xa0 from the patient to test him for just about every\\xa0\\r\\nmarker of the immune system that you could think\\xa0\\xa0 of all these different cytokines and chemokines\\xa0\\r\\nand so forth they're trying to identify an\\xa0\\xa0 immunological pattern but the authors were unable\\xa0\\r\\nto identify a characteristic profile so back to\\xa0\\xa0 the 13 year old boy in michigan who died three\\xa0\\r\\ndays after getting the pfizer vaccine according\\xa0\\xa0 to the patients on twitter the preliminary autopsy\\xa0\\r\\nreport showed that he had fluid around his heart\\xa0\\xa0 now the cdc is investigating this but there is\\xa0\\r\\nno official autopsy report but one of the biggest\\xa0\\xa0 questions is what did the pathology show when they\\xa0\\r\\nlooked at the heart underneath the microscope did\\xa0\\xa0 it look normal or did it show that there was an\\xa0\\r\\ninflammatory infiltrate like either one of these\\xa0\\xa0 regardless people especially males between the\\xa0\\r\\nages of 12 and 30 who get the mrna covid vaccines\\xa0\\xa0 should be aware especially aware\\xa0\\r\\nof the possibilities of myocarditis\\xa0\\xa0 especially after the second dose even though it's\\xa0\\r\\nstill very rare getting covid is still far worse\\xa0\\xa0 compared to the vaccine including adolescents\\xa0\\r\\naged 12 through 15. so right now pfizer is the\\xa0\\xa0 only one approved in this age group between\\xa0\\r\\n12 and 15 and studies with the other vaccines\\xa0\\xa0 in younger children are underway covid is\\xa0\\r\\nless severe in children compared to adults\\xa0\\xa0 but the risk of getting misc following\\xa0\\r\\nacute covid infection plus the risk of\\xa0\\xa0 severe disease in children who have underlying\\xa0\\r\\nmedical conditions and the general desire to\\xa0\\xa0 prevent covid in children they're all valid\\xa0\\r\\nreasons for vaccination of children also because\\xa0\\xa0 misc is associated with immune dysregulation\\xa0\\r\\nthat's precipitated by covid immune related\\xa0\\xa0 side effects following vaccination in children\\xa0\\r\\nhas to be closely monitored so that's all for\\xa0\\xa0 this video thanks for watching and don't forget\\xa0\\r\\nto like it if you liked it and if you haven't\\xa0\\xa0 done so already hit that subscribe and

       " ' This episode was filmed on February 9th, 2021. If we have any updates about COVID-19\\xa0\\r\\nvaccinations or the pandemic in general, they’ll be in the playlist\\xa0\\r\\nlinked in the description. [♪♪♪] With the COVID-19 vaccines finally\\xa0\\r\\ngetting into people’s arms, you might’ve heard that your second dose\\xa0\\r\\nmight feel a little rougher than the first. And it’s true. Participants in clinical\\xa0\\r\\ntrials, plus the recently vaccinated public, saw more frequent and more intense side\\xa0\\r\\neffects on their second jab than their first. This is actually a sign that the\\xa0\\r\\nvaccines are working properly. So while you should prepare to feel crummy\\xa0\\r\\nfor a couple days, it’s a good thing overall! And it might hint at the\\xa0\\r\\npossibility of more good news: that people who’ve recovered from\\xa0\\r\\nCOVID-19 could only need one shot! The key thing to understand is\\xa0\\r\\nthat these reactions to vaccines, things like fever, chills, and other side-effects,\\xa0\\r\\naren’t really from the vaccine itself. They’re natural byproducts of your\\xa0\\r\\nimmune system learning to fight the germ the vaccine is teaching it to spot. And that response is stronger\\xa0\\r\\nafter the second shot because the first shot did\\xa0\\r\\nwhat it was supposed to do! To understand what I mean, let’s have\\xa0\\r\\na quick refresher on how vaccines work. In general, vaccines teach your\\xa0\\r\\nimmune system to spot a pathogen by giving it some harmless version\\xa0\\r\\nor just part of it to study. That way, if ever encounters a real\\xa0\\r\\ndeal, it’ll know how to fight it. We call this adaptive immunity —\\xa0\\r\\nbut it doesn’t happen immediately. It takes weeks to fully develop the strong,\\xa0\\r\\ntargeted response that vaccines are aiming for. So the first time a vaccine introduces\\xa0\\r\\nyour immune system to a new pathogen, any discomfort you feel is something\\xa0\\r\\nelse: your innate immunity kicking in. This is a generalized first line of defense that\\xa0\\r\\nattacks anything the body perceives as a threat. And it can definitely have some\\xa0\\r\\nuncomfortable side effects. For instance, within a few hours,\\xa0\\r\\nyou can have local reactions, which are things like pain and\\xa0\\r\\nredness at the injection site or tenderness in the armpit of the\\xa0\\r\\narm that received the injection. You can also have systemic\\xa0\\r\\nreactions that point to a more widespread activation of your immune system. These are symptoms like fatigue,\\xa0\\r\\nheadache, and all over muscle pain. But often, these side-effects are\\xa0\\r\\nminor, or maybe not noticeable at all. What matters is what’s\\xa0\\r\\nhappening in the background. While your innate immunity is doing its thing, the immune cells that do the\\xa0\\r\\nheavy lifting in adaptive immunity\\xa0\\xa0 are studying the foreign material and building up targeted weapons like antibodies. That way, by the time you get\\xa0\\r\\nyour second dose of the vaccine, your adaptive immunity has the\\xa0\\r\\ntools it needs to fight the invader. And it does. That, too, can set off local\\xa0\\r\\nand systemic reactions. So following your second shot, you get both\\xa0\\r\\ninnate and adaptive immunity acting at once! Which is why the side effects\\xa0\\r\\nare often more severe. This strong, dual immune\\xa0\\r\\nreaction also ensures your body takes the threat seriously and ramps\\xa0\\r\\nup its defenses against it even more. So as much as we dislike\\xa0\\r\\nthe potential side-effects, the result is lasting protection from the virus. Now, some people get the\\xa0\\r\\nshort end of the stick here. Thanks to their unique\\xa0\\r\\nexperiences and genetic makeup, they really feel it when their immune\\xa0\\r\\nsystem gets riled up, while others don’t. And we don’t totally know why. But, if you’re going to feel crummy, the odds\\xa0\\r\\nare higher it’ll happen in dose number two. And that’s not news—that’s exactly what was\\xa0\\r\\nseen in the clinical trials for these vaccines. For example, across all age\\xa0\\r\\ngroups in the Moderna trial, more participants reported some\\xa0\\r\\nkind of local or systemic reaction on their second dose of the vaccine. And something similar was seen with the BioNTech\\xa0\\r\\nvaccine, now being distributed by Pfizer. While pain at the injection site was\\xa0\\r\\nmore common after the first dose, the researchers noted more redness\\xa0\\r\\nand swelling after the second dose, as well as more body-wide reactions\\xa0\\r\\nlike fatigue, fever, and muscle pain. Thankfully, in trials, these effects almost\\xa0\\r\\nalways went away after two or three days. There’s also nothing really special\\xa0\\r\\nabout the side effects occurring now. You’re hearing about them because lots of\\xa0\\r\\npeople are getting vaccinated all at once, and this is a really big deal,\\xa0\\r\\nand everyone is talking about it. But these side effects are on\\xa0\\r\\npar with what’s seen following other multi-dose vaccines given to adults. Take Shingrix, for example—a shingles vaccine\\xa0\\r\\nyou might get if you’re over 50 years old. Most people get a sore arm, while some\\xa0\\r\\nfeel fatigue, headaches, or muscle pain that lasts a couple of days. That said, some people who’ve already had\\xa0\\r\\nCOVID-19 are reporting something different: they seem to be having those stronger,\\xa0\\r\\n“second-dose” side effects after dose one. That may be because the disease itself\\xa0\\r\\ncan act kind of like a first vaccine dose, in that it teaches the immune\\xa0\\r\\nsystem to spot the virus. So, the first dose of the vaccine may be having\\xa0\\r\\nsimilar effects to everyone else’s booster. What’s nifty about that is that it\\xa0\\r\\ncould mean they only need one dose. To be clear, the vast majority of the\\xa0\\r\\nclinical trials for these vaccines have only used a two-dose vaccination strategy. So no one has tested this one-vaccine hypothesis! But two recent preprint articles\\xa0\\r\\nconcluded that we might be able to reallocate the limited doses of the\\xa0\\r\\nmRNA vaccines being distributed by Pfizer and Moderna without compromising safety. One found that people who had\\xa0\\r\\nrecovered from COVID-19 developed at least ten times as many\\xa0\\r\\nantibodies after one dose of an mRNA vaccine as previously\\xa0\\r\\nhealthy people who got two. And the other found that healthcare\\xa0\\r\\nworkers who had previously had COVID-19 had antibody levels on par with folks\\xa0\\r\\nwho got two doses of the mRNA vaccines but had never been infected. That might mean that previously\\xa0\\r\\ninfected individuals might only need one shot to protect them long term! And if that’s the case, we may be able to\\xa0\\r\\ngive that second vaccine dose to someone else, and hopefully get people vaccinated even faster. Now, each of these studies only\\xa0\\r\\nhad a few hundred participants, and neither has been peer-reviewed, so we\\xa0\\r\\ncan’t start making sweeping statements yet. And there are no changes in policy or anything. So, in the meantime, keep doing what your\\xa0\\r\\nmedical professionals tell you to do! Still, if you have had COVID-19, be warned\\xa0\\r\\nyour first vaccine shot could be the rough one. And for everyone else, it might be helpful\\xa0\\r\\nto set your expectations ahead of time. Yes, there’s a good chance you’ll feel\\xa0\\r\\nbad after your second dose in particular, and need to take a day or\\xa0\\r\\ntwo to rest and recuperate. But it’ll be worth it, because these\\xa0\\r\\nexpected temporary side effects are way less intense and debilitating\\xa0\\r\\nthan getting a bad case of COVID-19, and we all just want to get through this\\xa0\\r\\npandemic so we can relax a little bit.

       " \" all right we're talking about a new vaccine uh pretty much an update for coven so let me tee this up for you guys remember how when there was all this confusion about which vaccine when to get the vaccine the booster the new variant version all of this as it was evolving over the last three years now we have word from the FDA that we can expect in this country this fall to have a newer covid-19 vaccine that incorporates the latest circulating strains just as we do with the influenza vaccine which is good news right because before we had the bivalent booster we were still using the same vaccine from the original wild type coronavirus um genetic fingerprint we need to evolve the vaccines to be current with the strains that are circulating so xbb 1.5 as if that doesn't just roll off the tip of your tongue that's most likely going to be in the fall version but they have to make this calculated guesstimate as to what will be circulating in the country now the benefit of this new mRNA technology is that within a hundred days we should be able to turn around a vaccine according to the circulating strain within 100 days yeah three months about that time but they're they're already working on the one that we should be able to be getting in the fall and you mentioned that flu vaccine how we get flu every fall this is going to become just one of those things we get yes exactly unless you're in a high-risk group and then you might need it more frequently but I cannot emphasize this enough so many so few Americans have gotten that bivalent booster it's part of the reason why our coveted death rates have dropped down so much is that these vaccines are keeping people out of the hospital talk to your doctor first absolutely well hey there GMA fans Robin Roberts here thanks for checking out our YouTube channel lots of great stuff here so go on click the Subscribe button right over right over here to get more of Awesome videos and content from GMA every day anytime we thank you for watching and we'll see you in the morning on GMA\": 0.5005994822171294,\n",

THANK YOU SO MUCH.  >>> A NEW STUDY FINDS THAT  COVID-19 IMMUNITY, THE NATURAL  KIND CAUSED BY GETTING THE  VIRUS AND BEATING IT, CAN BE  JUST AS PRODUCTIVE AS GETTING A  VACCINE.  THE STUDY FOUND INFECTION  GENERATED IMMUNITY CAN CUT THE  RISK OF HOSPITALIZATION AND  DEATH COVID-19 BY UP TO 88% FOR  UP TO 10 MONTHS.  >> A DISTINGUISHED CHAIR AT THE  UNIVERSITY OF IOWA JOINING US  NOW.  THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.  YOUR BIG TAKE AWAY FROM THE  STUDY?  >> FIRST, THANK YOU FOR HAVING  ME.  MY TAKEAWAYS FROM THIS STUDY  ARE REALLY THAT NATURAL IN  ACTION WORKS PRETTY WELL IN  PREVENTING HOSPITALIZATION ON  SUBSEQUENT RECHALLENGE.  THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE  SURPRISE.  THIS IS WHAT WE EXPECT IT TO  DO.  THE PARTS OF THE STUDY THAT I  THINK RAISE QUESTIONS OR THAT  ARE INTERESTING, IS THE QUESTION IS HOW IT COMPARES TO  VACCINATION AND WITH THIS STUDY  DOES IS IT COMPARES PROTECTION  FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN  IMMUNIZED WITH THE BASIC TWO  SHOT SERIES VERSUS REINFECTION  AND THE REINFECTION DOES A  LITTLE BETTER.  AS WE ALL KNOW NOW, PEOPLE HAVE  RECEIVED BOOSTERS, PARTICULARLY  THE FIRST BOOSTER IS IMPORTANT  FOR PROTECTION AND THE SECOND  BOOSTER MAY HELP SOME,  ESPECIALLY AGAINST THE OMICRON  TYPE VARIANCE.  >> IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE  BUILDING TO IT.  THE BOTTOM LINE, DO PEOPLE  STILL NEED TO GET BOOSTERS AND  VACCINES IF THEY'VE ALREADY HAD  THE VIRUS?  AND THEREFORE HAVE IMMUNITY?  >> I THINK THAT IS THE QUESTION  AND IT HAS TO BE A NUANCED  ANSWER BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW IS  FOR MANY PEOPLE BEING INFECTED  AND BEING READ BOOSTED BY  GETTING THE INFECTION AGAIN,  MAY PROTECT THEM, BUT THERE ARE  GROUPS THAT THIS IS NOT TRUE.

       " \" dr ashton here we were trying to get a handle on yes uh you got some new data on boosters there's a new published study out in lancet the journal lancet infectious disease about the fourth dose and what happens to our antibody levels it is not a surprise that they've released new data confirming that after the fourth dose of pfizer or moderna that antibody levels rise significantly they surge in the several weeks after that dose we've known that for a while but here are the caveats we don't know how long that lasts number one and our immune response remember is not just about antibodies it's about that t cell response also which you can't really measure as well as just a pure antibody level and it's about whether or not they're blocking or neutralizing antibodies to the variant that we're seeing so when people hear these headlines they shouldn't be surprised yes of course you're going to get a surge in your antibody levels but how long that lasts is the issue and it's certainly not just about more boosting for everyone people who have high antibody levels there's the potential i want to underscore the potential we haven't seen any evidence of this um of this immune phenomenon known as tolerance where if you already have high antibody levels and you get another booster that your immune system can start to say well what what am i needed for and can kind of start to shut down so um we if you're in that category of people who the fda and cdc is recommending to get a booster 50 and over 65 and over with a with a chronic medical condition yes by all means but everyone else don't think that more boosting is the answer we don't know that that's the case yet all right that's very important information we appreciate it thank you very much well hey there gma fans robin roberts here thanks for checking out our youtube channel lots of great stuff here so go on click the subscribe button right over right over here to get more of awesome videos and content from gma every day anytime we thank you for watching and we'll see you in the morning on gma\": 0.5095515058418284,\n",

COVID-19, a virus orders of magnitude smaller\\r\\nthan a particle of dust, has turned daily life on earth into something deeply unfamiliar. In the ten or so months since it first emerged,\\r\\nthe virus has settled at a steady clip of killing 5,000 people per day, or nearly a\\r\\nmillion total, currently. It has played havoc with the world economy,\\r\\nplunging the globe into the worst economic crisis since World War Two. It has interrupted an era of mounting globalization,\\r\\nand pushed us into a more insular, nationalistic state. The effects of this virus are truly all encompassing\\r\\nand consistently dreadful, but time has bestowed upon us a reward for our patience. We are potentially nearing the beginning of\\r\\nthe end, meaning we could now be at the end of the middle. That end of this virus will take far longer\\r\\nthan the beginning—we’re likely far from halfway through the pandemic in terms of time—but\\r\\nthe slow decline in dreadfulness is potentially on the horizon. That’s because a vaccine is coming. There was previously a period of doubt on\\r\\nwhether an effective vaccine could be developed, it’s never a sure shot, but all indications\\r\\ncurrently suggest, given the unprecedented extent of scientific effort, that it is indeed\\r\\ncoming. The only and paramount question is when. Right now, in September, 2020, all attention\\r\\nis focused on the late-October, early-November timeframe. That’s the earliest possible moment when\\r\\nany of the frontrunner vaccines, from major manufacturers including AstraZeneca, Pfizer,\\r\\nand Moderna, could enter regulatory review. If all the data confidently point to the vaccine\\r\\nexhibiting an acceptable level of safety and effectiveness, it is possible that one of\\r\\nthese will then be granted emergency use authorization by the American FDA, or its equivalent by\\r\\nother major national regulators. It’s worth noting that this is far from\\r\\na sure-shot, but experts do say that having a vaccine in 2020 is a less-than-long-shot\\r\\npossibility. However, it is almost certain that you will\\r\\nnot be injected by a COVID-19 vaccine in the year 2020. It is possible, but for the average person,\\r\\nwhen you actually get a dose of a COVID vaccine has much less to do with when it’s approved,\\r\\nand more with how fast it is manufactured and distributed. The full effects of the pandemic—health,\\r\\nsocial, and economic—will not end until a critical mass of people are vaccinated. That means that when we get back to normal\\r\\nlife has much more to do with when the last person is vaccinated, rather than the first. This is why some have said that the fast distribution\\r\\nof a vaccine will be an even greater challenge than the development itself. This process, this challenge of getting the\\r\\nmajority of the world's population vaccinated, can quite legitimately be described as the\\r\\nmost daunting and consequential single logistical challenge ever. The stakes have never been higher, but the\\r\\nchallenge has also never been greater. Let's look at why. First and foremost, it's a scale problem. Shipping and administering one vaccine to\\r\\none person is not difficult, but shipping and administering five billion vaccines to\\r\\nfive billion people is. That’s because there just isn't enough room\\r\\nin our world's logistics network, as it is now, to do that. Making it even tougher, there’s more chance\\r\\nthan not, based on the current leading candidates, that the first major vaccine to be approved\\r\\nwill require two doses administered 21 or 28 days apart. That doubles the challenge. Distributing ten or more billion doses of\\r\\na vaccine would be difficult enough in normal times, but these are far from normal times. With international travel all but nonexistent—currently\\r\\nsitting at more than 90% down—passenger airlines have dramatically cut back their\\r\\ninternational route networks. Now, this is an issue because traditionally,\\r\\nsome 50% of pharmaceuticals are shipped in the belly-hold of passenger aircraft, rather\\r\\nthan on dedicated freighters, as this can help get them closer to their final destination\\r\\nfaster. With limited passenger service, overall cargo\\r\\ncapacity is down about 30%, while cargo demand is only about 15% down, meaning there is already\\r\\na supply crunch. This has led to existing dedicated freighter\\r\\naircraft being used more, additional dedicated freighters coming into service, but still,\\r\\ndue to constrained supply, a dramatic increase in shipping costs. Even already, before the COVID vaccine comes\\r\\ninto the global logistics network, pharmaceutical manufacturers have had to come up with new\\r\\ntechniques to ship their goods including, for example, flying their product to where\\r\\nshipping rates are cheaper and trucking them to their final destination or charteri ng\\r\\nprivate planes. Of course, the world already experienced a\\r\\nmassive logistics challenge this year with the distribution of personal protective equipment,\\r\\nand shippers were able to scale up for that reasonably successfully, but there’s one\\r\\nsimple reason why it won’t be so easy this time around: the cold chain. Vaccines are temperature-sensitive. Most all of them have to be stored in a highly\\r\\nprecise, climate controlled environment in order to stay safe and effective. So, the cold chain is the supply chain suited\\r\\nto shipping goods that need to be kept cold or frozen, such as meat, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Of course, the difficulty with the cold chain\\r\\nis that everything used has to be specialized—the origin warehouse, the truck, the plane, the\\r\\nen-route warehouse, and the final destination each need to have the equipment to keep the\\r\\ngoods at the specified temperature or the goods have to be shipped in packaging that\\r\\nkeeps them at the specified temperature. Both options are complicated and complication\\r\\ncompounded by other complication is what makes a true logistical challenge. It doesn’t end there, though. One of the leading vaccine candidates, Pfizer’s\\r\\nBNT162b2, must be stored and transported at around -90 °F, or -68 °C. That is far, far\\r\\ncolder than the requirements of most vaccines, which can ship either at refrigerated temperatures\\r\\nor a wider range of freezing temperatures. A thermal requirement such as this is a whole\\r\\ndifferent ball-game, and it means that they'll be able to use only a subset of cold chain\\r\\ninfrastructure, which is already a subset of the overall logistics infrastructure. Beyond the issue of actually getting such\\r\\na vaccine to a distribution site, most hospitals don't even have facilities to keep a vaccine\\r\\nat such a temperature, let alone clinics or pharmacies, meaning that even finding places\\r\\nthat can receive this vaccine is a challenge. Part of the reason why this obstacle has come\\r\\nup is that traditionally, vaccines are thoroughly tested to determine what sort of storage and\\r\\nshipping conditions they can endure while still staying safe and effective, but with\\r\\nthe breakneck pace of development for these COVID-19 vaccines, there likely will not have\\r\\nbeen enough time to conduct these tests before distribution, meaning they'll have to keep\\r\\nthe standards at what's already proven. So, to reiterate, already, a likely vaccine\\r\\nwill only be able to be shipped through a subset of a subset of a subset of an already\\r\\nstrained logistics network, to a subset of sites, and it'll need to happen many billions\\r\\nof times, but even the solutions to these challenges present additional challenges. Pfizer, for example, knowing that the unique\\r\\ndistribution requirements of their vaccine could limit its commercial success, has developed\\r\\na partial solution. It’s essentially a highly specialized stand-alone\\r\\nbox that can, with the use of dry ice, keep the vaccine at the required temperature for\\r\\nup to ten days. This means that, hypothetically, the vaccine\\r\\ncould be shipped through a more traditional logistics network, however, this box has highly\\r\\nspecific requirements. For one, upon arrival, it can only be opened\\r\\ntwice per day, not more than one-minute at a time, in order to keep the vaccines at the\\r\\nrequired temperature. That means that a distribution site would\\r\\nneed to accurately predict how many doses they would need in a given day before that\\r\\nday—if they take out too little, they’d be slowing the process by not vaccinating\\r\\neveryone they can, but if they take out too much, they’d have potentially life-saving\\r\\nvaccines go to waste at the end of the day. Also, this box can only carry vaccines in\\r\\nmultiples of a thousand, and keep in mind that it only keeps cold for ten days. So, how, for example, do you go about getting\\r\\nthe vaccine to a clinic that can only vaccinate fifty people in a day—like a rural clinic\\r\\nin a small town. Even if shipping was instantaneous, they could\\r\\nonly vaccinate five-hundred people in ten-days, meaning half their vaccines would go bad. Pfizer is apparently developing a smaller\\r\\ntemperature-controlled box to solve this problem, but that means adding a whole other type of\\r\\ndistribution, which increases complexity, which slows the process down. In its scenario planning, the American CDC\\r\\nmapped out a distribution process for if both Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines are approved\\r\\nand, if this happened, the Pfizer vaccine would be directed to only large distribution\\r\\nsites that would either have the facilities for ultra-cold storage, or the capacity to\\r\\nvaccine enough people that the short shelf-life of these vaccines wouldn't be an issue. Then, the Moderna vaccine, which only requires\\r\\ntraditional freezer temperatures, would be directed to smaller sites with less advanced\\r\\nfacilities. This would certainly create a scenario in\\r\\nthe US, and likely elsewhere, where the Pfizer vaccine would be primarily distributed to\\r\\npeople in cities, while the Moderna vaccine would be the vaccine of choice for rural areas. Another challenge that needs to be confronted\\r\\nis the order of operations for distribution. The Coronavirus affects different people in\\r\\ndifferent ways. This means that if we want a vaccine to save\\r\\nthe the most number of lives possible, the first person in line should be that who is\\r\\nmost susceptible to COVID-19, and the last person in line should be that who is least\\r\\nsusceptible. One set of research modeled two scenarios—the\\r\\nfirst where, of the first 3 billion doses available, 50 high-income countries buy up\\r\\n2 billion of them. The second was where the first 3 billion doses\\r\\nwere distributed to countries proportionally based on their population, regardless of wealth. In this model, twice as many people died overall\\r\\nwith the first scenario—the wealthy countries first scenario—than the equitable, proportional\\r\\napproach. However, for vaccination purposes, it is the\\r\\nleast wealthy countries, arguably those that need the vaccine most, that are toughest to\\r\\ndistribute to. Poor countries tend to have limited cold chain\\r\\ninfrastructure, let alone normal logistics infrastructure, and fragmented, poorly-funded\\r\\nhealthcare systems. Distributing and administering a complex vaccine\\r\\nlike Pfizer’s will already be tough enough in the wealthy countries like the United States,\\r\\nbut just imagine how difficult it will be to get a vaccine from distributor to someone’s\\r\\narm in rural Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, in ten days, while keeping it\\r\\nat -90 °F. How soon a COVID vaccine is administered will\\r\\nquite directly correlate to how many lives are saved. Every day of delay will, with certainty, lead\\r\\nto more death and despair. The manufacturers are working as fast as they\\r\\ncan, they are already producing millions of doses of their vaccines before they’re approved\\r\\nso they can be distributed as fast as possible, and regulatory agencies have been preparing\\r\\nfor months for an unprecedentedly fast review process, so it is now truly down to every\\r\\nmember of the global logistics network to save lives. Of course, many of those that will be involved,\\r\\nespecially once we get to wide-scale distribution, will be companies, not governments or nonprofits,\\r\\nand for them, this presents a massive business opportunity—in addition to the positive\\r\\npublic relations potential. UPS, for example, has built two freezer farms\\r\\nin Louisville, Kentucky, and Venlo, Netherlands, near their hubs, which can each hold 48,000\\r\\ndoses and can go down to the temperatures required for the Pfizer vaccine. DHL and FedEx too are reportedly massively\\r\\nupscaling their cold-chain infrastructure to be able to handle some of the surge in\\r\\ndemand, while other lesser known logistics companies are too. Ultimately, though, its tough to find someone\\r\\nin-the-know who doesn’t admit that shipping will be a bottleneck. We already know it’s not going to go perfectly,\\r\\nso right now, it’s about doing as much work as possible to make sure the process goes\\r\\nas well as it can be. This will come down to making sure that as\\r\\nmuch planning work as possible is done now, before the vaccine is approved, so that distribution\\r\\ncan happen as fast as possible when that does happen. Now is the time to figure out how and where\\r\\nthe vaccine will be distributed. If you are a healthy, relatively young person\\r\\nthinking selfishly, you should care tremendously about the distribution process, because you\\r\\nare at the back of the line. When you get your shot, when you get to start\\r\\nletting your guard down, has everything to do with how fast everyone in front of you\\r\\ngets theirs, and how fast they get theirs will also impact how many of them will die. We know this process will not be perfect,\\r\\nand it wouldn't be reasonable to ask for perfect given the complexity of the challenge, but\\r\\nif we truly put every effort into planning and preparing for this now, and create a system\\r\\nthat orders people by need, rather than wealth, we can at least know, at the end of this,\\r\\nthat no lives could have been saved if only the vaccine got to them faster. For our collective consciousness, looking\\r\\nback far in the future, this moment will be defined not by when we get to go back to concerts\\r\\nor parties or the gym, but rather by how many lives we saved when confronting what is hopefully\\r\\nthe greatest global challenge of this generation.

       " \" Well, the pandemic, as you know, is over, But thousands of people say they're still struggling with injuries from the covet vaccine and other treatments. Tonight, our Rebecca Lindstrom investigates the push to fund the federal program that promised to make it right. Lawmakers across the country say our investigation prompted them to demand answers about why it's taking the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program or CICP, so long to process claims. I appreciate you bringing to everybody's attention Congressman Mike Collins saw 11 alives investigation on frustrations. All of this is paperwork mounting with the CICP. People like Collins story recovering from a cascade of health problems after receiving the vaccine. 2 years later, he still has no idea if his claim will be approved. They keep asking for more. It's just roadblock after roadblock. It seems like Collins sat down to talk with the program's director and says part of the problem. Is technology. They did not even have a computer system in place, a software system to handle people making requests or even inquiring about what their status was, which was what you were talking about and and and and Y'all's reporting. The CSEP has asked Congress for $15 million to enhance communication and substantially increase its capacity to review at least 2000 claims, but with nearly 11,000 claims waiting. It would take more than five years to get through them, especially when you consider the CICP has only processed 706 so far. A third of the federal employees have been working from home, and that just doesn't work very well. The budget request asks to hire 42 fulltime employees and claims 34 positions were funded last year. But to date, the CICP has not answered our fundamental question. How many people are actually working? You're asking the same questions that we ask in every agency up here. Isn't that crazy? They don't know how many people they employ. Of the process cases, 684 were denied, only 22 were eligible for compensation, and the average payout so far is $1500. The story say they have a box full of receipts and haven't even started to add them up. His prescription last week was 600. You know, out of pocket. That was out of pocket upfront and you couldn't get it if you didn't have $600.00 upfront. The CICP has recently created an online portal to track claims, and while it may take years to get a response, people who feel they have been injured only have one year to file a claim.\": 0.4873309817754262,\n",

       " \" Welcome to another MedCram COVID-19 update. Here's\\xa0\\r\\nthe question that everyone seems to be asking and\\xa0\\xa0 that is: which booster should I take? Well in true\\xa0\\r\\nMedCram form, we're going to look at the data\\xa0\\xa0 and make a decision. Recently there's been a study\\xa0\\r\\nthat's come out that has not been published or\\xa0\\xa0 peer-reviewed, but is on this pre-print server\\xa0\\r\\nthat was conducted by a number of experienced\\xa0\\xa0 researchers out of a number of universities\\xa0\\r\\nacross the country and also in medical schools\\xa0\\xa0 across the country, including the NIH, and also\\xa0\\r\\nmajor hospital systems like Kaiser-Permanente,\\xa0\\xa0 and this study was performed in the United\\xa0\\r\\nStates, and it looks at just that question.\\xa0 So it takes a look at people who have been\\xa0\\r\\nvaccinated with Moderna, people who have been\\xa0\\xa0 vaccinated with Johnson and Johnson, and people who\\xa0\\r\\nhave been vaccinated with Pfizer, and they waited\\xa0\\xa0 about 12 weeks and they randomized them to receive\\xa0\\r\\na Moderna booster, a Johnson  and Johnson booster, and a\\xa0\\xa0 Pfizer booster. In each one of these categories,\\xa0\\r\\nthere were about 50 in each of these groups,\\xa0\\xa0 and they split it evenly, so that 25 in each\\xa0\\r\\ngroup was less than the age of 55 and 25 were\\xa0\\xa0 greater than the age of 55. And as it turns out,\\xa0\\r\\nthere was 154 in the Moderna group, 150 in the\\xa0\\xa0 Johnson and Johnson group, and 154 in the Pfizer\\xa0\\r\\ngroup. So a total of 458 subjects in this study.\\xa0\\xa0 And what these scientists wanted to ask is what\\xa0\\r\\nwas the safety data like for each one of these\\xa0\\xa0 categories, and what was the efficacy data like in\\xa0\\r\\nterms of the ability to mount an antibody response?\\xa0\\xa0 Well, let's take a look at the data. So let's look\\xa0\\r\\nfirst at the safety data, and what we see here\\xa0\\xa0 is we see the cohort that had Johnson\\xa0\\r\\nand Johnson as the original vaccination,\\xa0\\xa0 and then were boosted with the Moderna vaccine, but\\xa0\\r\\nnotice that in this study they used the full dose\\xa0\\xa0 Moderna vaccine, because that's what they\\xa0\\r\\nhad available to them. Currently, though, if\\xa0\\xa0 you were to go and get a booster shot with the\\xa0\\r\\nModerna vaccine you would get the 50 microgram\\xa0\\xa0 dose or what is known as the half dose. Be aware of\\xa0\\r\\nthat Moderna is the only one out of these three\\xa0\\xa0 that have reduced the dosages for the booster shot\\xa0.\\r\\nAlso notice that there are three different colors\\xa0\\xa0 here in terms of the graph. There is the light,\\xa0\\r\\nwhich is mild. There is the darker, which is the\\xa0\\xa0 amount of moderate reaction, and then there is\\xa0\\r\\nthe darkest which is the most severe. So what\\xa0\\xa0 we're going to do is we're going to look back\\xa0\\r\\nand forth here at the different slides, because\\xa0\\xa0 if you have had the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, we\\xa0\\r\\nwant to see how these side effect profiles look. If\\xa0\\xa0 you were to have the Moderna vaccin,e if you were\\xa0\\r\\nto have the Johnson Johnson vaccine as a booster,\\xa0\\xa0 or if you were to have the Pfizer vaccine as\\xa0\\r\\na booster. So this is what it looks like, here, if you focus on this first box, is if you were\\xa0\\r\\nJohnson and Johnson getting the Moderna booster,\\xa0 and this is what it would look like if\\xa0\\r\\nyou had Johnson and Johnson and gotten\\xa0\\xa0 the Johnson and Johnson booster, again as\\xa0\\r\\nthe second shot, you can see that there are\\xa0\\xa0 a little bit more severe reactions here under\\xa0\\r\\nmalaise or fatigue and the amount of pain\\xa0\\xa0 and tenderness at the local site has gone up\\xa0\\r\\njust a little bit, which is perfectly normal\\xa0\\xa0 and acceptable for a vaccine side effect, and\\xa0\\r\\nlet's also remember that a lot of these symptoms\\xa0\\xa0 are the results of the immune response that we're\\xa0\\r\\nhoping to get with the vaccines in the first place.\\xa0\\xa0 And here is the boosting with the Pfizer\\xa0\\r\\nvaccine. You can see a little bit less\\xa0\\xa0 in the way of severity, but still a little bit on\\xa0\\r\\nthe higher side, so not much difference in terms\\xa0\\xa0 of which of the three would give you the more side\\xa0\\r\\neffects. Okay let's concentrate now on those that\\xa0\\xa0 got Moderna as their original vaccination and look\\xa0\\r\\nand see what would happen if they got a booster\\xa0\\xa0 with Moderna. You can see here that there\\xa0\\r\\nis a side effect profile that you can see.\\xa0 There is more moderate symptoms here as you can\\xa0\\r\\nsee with Moderna what would happen if they got the\\xa0\\xa0 Johnson and Johnson as a booster. Here you can see\\xa0\\r\\nalso some moderate side effects, especially in the\\xa0\\xa0 headache, myalgia, and fatigue category. What about\\xa0\\r\\nif Moderna patients got the Pfizer booster? And\\xa0\\xa0 you can see here that there seems to be a little\\xa0\\r\\nbit more mild reaction to those who get the Pfizer\\xa0\\xa0 booster who had Moderna originally. Okay let's\\xa0\\r\\nfinally look at those who got the Pfizer vaccine.\\xa0\\xa0 In this case, those who got the Pfizer vaccine and\\xa0\\r\\nget the Moderna boost, you can see that there is\\xa0\\xa0 some side effects there in terms of moderate\\xa0\\r\\nmyalgia, malaise, headache, etc. When I say side\\xa0\\xa0 effects, I'm referring to the effects that we would\\xa0\\r\\nexpect to have happen if somebody got a vaccine,\\xa0\\xa0 but would be considered a negative on the face of\\xa0\\r\\nit, but something completely expected in this case.\\xa0\\xa0 For those who had the Pfizer vaccine and get\\xa0\\r\\nthe Johnson and Johnson booster, you can see\\xa0\\xa0 that there's also a little bit higher levels in\\xa0\\r\\nthis area of malaise and headache, but not much\\xa0\\xa0 different. And finally those going for their third\\xa0\\r\\nshot of Pfizer, that would be the Pfizer booster\\xa0\\xa0 for those that had Pfizer before, you can see\\xa0\\r\\nhere again a very similar type of profile and\\xa0\\xa0 while these symptoms after the vaccine boost were\\xa0\\r\\nquite frequent, most if not all of them went away\\xa0\\xa0 quite shortly after the boost. Now, let's talk about\\xa0\\r\\nefficacy, and here again we're going to be looking\\xa0\\xa0 at very similar types of situations in this graph.\\xa0e\\r\\nWe're looking at the IgG binding to s2pwa1 which\\xa0\\xa0 is basically using spike protein as a surrogate\\xa0\\r\\nfor immunity. So in other words, what we're looking\\xa0\\xa0 at here is, how well do the antibodies or the IgG\\xa0\\r\\nthat's made after the booster, how well does it\\xa0\\xa0 bind the spike protein that we see in SARS-CoV-2?\\xa0\\r\\nAnd in this case, it's a surrogate of\\xa0\\xa0 the actual viral spike protein, so the higher the\\xa0\\r\\nnumbers here, the better the immune reaction from\\xa0\\xa0 the booster shot. And what we're looking at here is\\xa0\\r\\nlooking at the amount of IgG binding on day one, so\\xa0\\xa0 that's basically the baseline and you can actually\\xa0\\r\\nget a lot of information just by looking at all\\xa0\\xa0 of these different day ones on all of these\\xa0\\r\\ndifferent graphs. And so what we have here is\\xa0\\xa0 those with the Johnson and Johnson here in the\\xa0\\r\\nfirst column getting a Moderna boost, those here\\xa0\\xa0 Johnson and Johnson getting a Johnson and Johnson\\xa0\\r\\nboost, and in the first column Johnson and Johnson\\xa0\\xa0 getting a Pfizer boost, but before we go to that,\\xa0\\r\\nlooking at the boost. Let's just take a look at\\xa0\\xa0 where things stand. On the first day, you can see\\xa0\\r\\nhere that the antibodies from the Johnson and\\xa0\\xa0 Johnson is considerably and consistently lower\\xa0\\r\\nthan the Moderna and or the Pfizer, and this goes\\xa0\\xa0 along with what we've seen clinically in terms\\xa0\\r\\nof prevention of hospitalization. So I do believe\\xa0\\xa0 that this surrogate marker is actually predictive\\xa0\\r\\nof clinical outcomes. So the higher this goes,\\xa0\\xa0 potentially, the better protection one would get\\xa0\\r\\nfrom getting a booster. Also remember too that this\\xa0\\xa0 scale here on the y-axis is logarithmic, so the\\xa0\\r\\nhigher up you go, the bigger the differences are.\\xa0\\xa0 Now again, I want you to remember that this is the\\xa0\\r\\nfull dose for Moderna, not the half dose that you\\xa0\\xa0 might pick up when you went to go get your actual\\xa0\\r\\nbooster shot. Let's talk about what happened. So\\xa0\\xa0 those who get the J and J shot, what happens\\xa0\\r\\nwhen they get a Moderna booster? You can see\\xa0\\xa0 that there's quite a rise in those antibodies. What\\xa0\\r\\nhappens when J and J gets a J and J booster? Not much\\xa0\\xa0 of a rise in comparison to the full dose Moderna.\\xa0\\r\\nWhat happens when a Johnson and Johnson gets a Pfizer\\xa0\\xa0 booster? You can see there that there is quite\\xa0\\r\\na bit of a jump. So I would say for a J and J\\xa0\\xa0 person, they should either get the Moderna or\\xa0\\r\\nthe Pfizer booster. What about those that have\\xa0\\xa0 Moderna to begin with? You can see here that out\\xa0\\r\\nof all three, typically the Moderna recipients\\xa0\\xa0 have the highest binding antibody levels, so\\xa0\\r\\nthe question is, what happens when they get\\xa0\\xa0 a booster of the three different types? A Moderna\\xa0\\r\\nbeing boosted by a Moderna does go up even still.\\xa0\\xa0 A Moderna going up with a Johnson and Johnson\\xa0\\r\\ndoes actually go up, and if you compare\\xa0\\xa0 the 29-day in both cases, it's actually not too\\xa0\\r\\ndifferent. A Moderna however being boosted with a\\xa0\\xa0 Pfizer seems to go up even higher than either one,\\xa0\\r\\nand the reason again why we don't have day 29 data\\xa0\\xa0 on the Pfizer boost there on the far\\xa0\\r\\nright is because this is a preliminary\\xa0\\xa0 data release, and that data has not yet come\\xa0\\r\\nin. So one can make the judgment here that\\xa0\\xa0 when you compare this to this one even still a\\xa0\\r\\nModerna vaccinated with the Moderna gives you\\xa0\\xa0 the highest antibody levels anywhere on this chart.\\xa0\\r\\nAnd so it could still be reasonably argued that\\xa0\\xa0 even though you've had Moderna before and you're\\xa0\\r\\ngonna get a booster, it might be best to get\\xa0\\xa0 Moderna for a third shot, but again we're still\\xa0\\r\\nmissing this data. We don't know where this is\\xa0\\xa0 going to go afterwards. Let's talk about those that\\xa0\\r\\nhave had the Pfizer vaccine. So those that have\\xa0\\xa0 the Pfizer vaccine and get the Moderna do go up\\xa0\\r\\nsignificantly here. Those that get the Pfizer and\\xa0\\xa0 boost with Johnson and Johnson don't seem to go up\\xa0\\r\\nas much, and those that have the Pfizer and boost\\xa0\\xa0 with the Pfizer do seem to go up as much as those\\xa0\\r\\nwith the boost for Moderna. Remember, we don't have\\xa0\\xa0 some of this data and also this is full dose that\\xa0\\r\\nwe're testing here, and what's actually available\\xa0\\xa0 for a booster is the half dose. Another way of\\xa0\\r\\nlooking at this is looking at the neutralizing\\xa0\\xa0 antibody titers in the same situations that\\xa0\\r\\nwe looked at before, and as you can see here\\xa0\\xa0 the results were nearly identical to looking at\\xa0\\r\\nthe IgG binding to the spike protein surrogate.\\xa0\\xa0 So of note, if we're interested in looking at the\\xa0\\r\\nefficacy of a booster on top of a fully vaccinated\\xa0\\xa0 person, then the question is what does a randomized\\xa0\\r\\nplacebo-controlled trial show and the results of\\xa0\\xa0 such a randomized placebo-controlled trial was\\xa0\\r\\npublished as a press release on October 21st\\xa0\\xa0 from Pfizer. This has not been peer reviewed\\xa0\\r\\nor published as yet, but Pfizer's record in\\xa0\\xa0 terms of releasing data in press releases has been\\xa0\\r\\npretty good, and the numbers have turned out to be\\xa0\\xa0 pretty accurate. So because of that, we shared\\xa0\\r\\nthese numbers here, so what they basically did\\xa0\\xa0 is they took fully vaccinated patients with two\\xa0\\r\\nshots of the Pfizer vaccine and there was about 10,000 subjects in this study, which was randomized\\xa0\\r\\none to one with a third shot of the Pfizer vaccine\\xa0\\xa0 and placebo and the participants in this study\\xa0\\r\\nwere 16 years and older, and remember now that's\\xa0\\xa0 a little bit different than what the FDA recently\\xa0\\r\\nallowed for boosters, but again this is the trials,\\xa0\\xa0 the phase three trials, for the booster and in\\xa0\\r\\nterms of the ages you probably want to know\\xa0\\xa0 how many of these were in what age category.\\xa0\\r\\nWhat they have told us is that the median age\\xa0\\xa0 was 53 years of age and that 23 of the people\\xa0\\r\\nin this cohort were above the age of 65 years.\\xa0\\xa0 Again, they've told us that there were 10,000 in\\xa0\\r\\nthis study, so we're assuming that there were about\\xa0\\xa0 5,000 in each arm since it was a one-to-one study\\xa0\\r\\nand they began looking for symptoms seven days\\xa0\\xa0 after the shot. They finally reached the end point\\xa0\\r\\nin the study with five cases in the intervention\\xa0\\xa0 group. The people that got the third shot of the\\xa0\\r\\nPfizer vaccine the booster and there were 109\\xa0\\xa0 cases of symptomatic COVID in the placebo group.\\xa0\\r\\nSo again we're looking for symptomatic COVID-19.\\xa0\\xa0 And because of those cases, they're saying\\xa0\\r\\nthat there was a 95.6 percent efficacy\\xa0\\xa0 of the vaccine to prevent symptomatic\\xa0\\r\\nCOVID-19 in patients who have already had\\xa0\\xa0 two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Now I'm going to\\xa0\\r\\nmake some assumptions here that if there were 5000\\xa0\\xa0 in both groups and the mean follow-up time was\\xa0\\r\\nabout 2.5 months, which is important to understand,\\xa0\\xa0 and that means if they had five cases in 5,000\\xa0\\r\\nthat would mean that there was a .00\\xa0 chance of having symptomatic COVID\\xa0\\r\\nin the intervention group, and about 0.0218 chances of having COVID with just two shots\\xa0\\r\\nof the Pfizer vaccine. So you can see these are\\xa0\\xa0 pretty low. Here you have a one in one thousand\\xa0\\r\\nchance as the absolute risk, and over here you\\xa0\\xa0 have about a two percent absolute risk. So the\\xa0\\r\\nreal key that we need to know in terms of the\\xa0\\xa0 value of an intervention is what is the absolute\\xa0\\r\\nrisk reduction? The absolute risk reduction is\\xa0\\xa0 simply one minus the other, and in that case\\xa0\\r\\nthe absolute risk reduction is 0.0. Now you'll know from statistics that if you want\\xa0\\r\\nto prevent one person from having symptomatic\\xa0\\xa0 COVID-19, how many people need to get the booster\\xa0\\r\\nto prevent one of those people from getting\\xa0\\xa0 symptomatic COVID-19? That's known as the\\xa0\\r\\nnumber needed to treat or in this case the\\xa0\\xa0 number needed to vaccinate and that's simply\\xa0\\r\\nthe reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction,\\xa0\\xa0 and in this case that's about 48. And to give\\xa0\\r\\nyou an idea of what this means, to prevent death\\xa0\\xa0 in somebody with a stroke TIA or myocardial\\xa0\\r\\ninfarction, giving an aspirin to them daily\\xa0\\xa0 given to 67 people, in fact, will prevent one death,\\xa0\\r\\nand that's a little bit less effective than what\\xa0\\xa0 we're seeing here in terms of the number of people\\xa0\\r\\nthat need to get one immunization to prevent one\\xa0\\xa0 of these people from getting symptomatic COVID-19\\xa0\\r\\nis 48. That's actually not too bad, but remember\\xa0\\xa0 of course that it actually could be even better\\xa0\\r\\nthan 48 because the follow-up time here was only\\xa0\\xa0 2.5 months, and I think most people agree that\\xa0\\r\\nthe vaccine shots, well we don't know how long\\xa0\\xa0 they last, probably last longer than 2.5 months.\\xa0\\r\\nIt'll be interesting to see once this paper\\xa0\\xa0 gets published and peer-reviewed what the final\\xa0\\r\\nconclusions are, but I thought I'd bring this up\\xa0\\xa0 in terms of the data out there and what it is\\xa0\\r\\nlooking like. Some might be wondering whether\\xa0\\xa0 or not this has a higher effect in those that\\xa0\\r\\nare older versus younger. Pfizer did say in the\\xa0\\xa0 statement that multiple subgroup analysis\\xa0\\r\\nof the efficacy were performed and there\\xa0\\xa0 was no difference of other core morbidities.\\xa0\\r\\nThey also mentioned that the adverse events\\xa0\\xa0 were consistent with all of the patterns\\xa0\\r\\nthat had been done before with the initial\\xa0\\xa0 vaccination schedule. As always there'll be more\\xa0\\r\\ndata to come and analyze. Thanks for joining us.\": 0.4637423312883436,\n",

       " \" from micro TV this is beyond the Noise episode number six recorded on June 20th 2023. [Music] I'm Vincent rack and yellow and joining me is your host Dr Paul offit hi Vincent good to see you after seeing you live last week right that was great when you were at Penn that was really fun that was a live twive that I got to watch at Penn yeah it was a lot of fun and I just did one at ASM in Houston as well we're doing a lot of live episodes this summer it's fun but right right now we have another version of one of your posts from Beyond the noise it's a sub stack column and today we're going to talk about do we really need a yearly covid vaccine and that's because last week June 15th an FDA advisory committee of which you were part pick the strain for this year's vaccine tell us all about it Paul right so so this would be the third then formulation of covid vaccine so so the first formulation which was released in December 2020 was just the Wuhan one string The ancestral strain the original strain and that served us well to protect us against a disease caused by the d614g variant and the alpha variant the Delta variant it worked very well in protected against severe disease and in the short term mild disease then Omicron hit um Omicron was an immune invasive strain that sort of entered the human the U.S population at the end of 2021 and with that the the um the pharmaceutical companies and the and the government felt that that this was so immunevasive that it really should be included in a vaccine although even protection against serious disease was holding up even with the original strain um certainly even if you've been naturally infected or vaccinated you could still get a mild disease because of Omar so what they did then which I think in retrospect was probably not the best idea was they had a bivalent vaccine so it was sort of a half a dose with what had been previously the dose of in this case the ancestral strain plus one of the Omicron variants which was the ba4 ba5 variant um That vaccine didn't perform any better than the monovalent vaccine as was shown clearly in a prospective controlled study of monovalent versus bivalent in France as well as studies that were done by Dan baruch's lab in Harvard as well as David hoselab in Colombia that this didn't seem to be any better primarily because likely imprinting by including that that that strain the ancestral strain with the ba4 ba5 that really hurt our ability to make antibodies against those novel epitopes on ba4 ba5 I think that was a lesson learned going into what happened on June 15th where now it's not a bivalent vaccine anymore it's just one of the circulating strains the so-called xbb strain this one in this case it's xbb15 because this virus does drift I mean the data that they showed was that if you had had a recent natural infection with ba1 which is the original Omicron where you had a recent natural infected with ba4 ba5 you still didn't make very good neutral using antibody responses against these xbb variants so they wanted to now have this as a vaccine we would still get protection against serious disease because those T cell epitopes are still conserved and there would for many then be better protection against mild disease at least in the short term I think what upset people in this meeting was the way that the question was phrased because the way the question was phrased it was a the what is this strain that we're going to pick for the 2023-2024 campaign and see that implied that this was going to be a yearly vaccine which may not be necessary so they didn't ask you should we make a new vaccine they said which strain should we pick right that's right remember FDA is a regulatory agency not a recommending body so ultimately how this vaccine gets recommended or how vaccines get recommended in the future always fall to the CDC so how many questions did they present to you for voting well that's really really that made that one question um do you do you uh think that we should include an XP screen and with that then they showed data looking at the different xbb strains to pick which was the best one and clearly this would be the best one but I think all three were would have been the right choice in a sense and what did you vote Paul I go to yes I I think having a monovalent vaccine it includes xbb makes sense I guess what I would uh worry about is that when the use of the word campaign implied that this was going to be like flu that every year we would be getting a a single dose of this vaccine for as in the case of flu everyone over six months of agent and that really doesn't comport with the cdc's data which is that that those who appear to have benefited from boosters in the past um are those who fall into high-risk groups people over 75 people who have multiple comorbidities on people who are immune compromised and that's not everybody so that that's what I worry about is that this is going to be seen as like this year's strain and and you know the people at the FDA said that that this is something that the public understands but I think that um they what they don't understand is that when we pick flu strains we better get it right because if we don't get it right a Miss is a mile and you have very poor protection which happened uh during 2004 2005 it happened again 2014 2015 it happened again 2021 2022 and when you missed the stranding in these cases it was H3N2 you have very little protection usually less than 15 against severe disease and that's not true with SARS cov2 where we continue to be protected against severe disease because of these shared or largely conserved T Cell recognition sites so so you always say Paul I want to see the data before recommending anything so what are the data which say that we should be switching to an xbb.1.5 instead of sticking with not a bivalent but an ancestral we didn't have a lot of data the data that were presented were primarily by moderna who had vaccinated 50 people with an xbb15 at what would be their dose so you could see what the neutralizing antibody response and you could see at least this limited subset of people what the safety response was you didn't have those data for moderna you didn't have those data from Nova vacs and I think most importantly what you really wanted to see was data on co-administration can you give this vaccine at the same time as the influenza vaccine can you give this vaccine at the same time as the RSV vaccine which I think at the end of this week this CDC is going to be voting on for likely a yes for uh people over 60 years of age so I think we again uh lack data and um what was presented to us was Mouse data which um as you know you know as we say in the world of vaccines my Sly and monkeys exaggerate so you really want to see dating people The ancestral vaccine which was used for a long time was in many many millions of people we know a great deal about it we know nothing about how xbb.1.5 is going to be performing isn't there a possibility that it won't do as well as Wuhan sure I mean I think the the um we don't have much data here I mean in in a better world um this would be considered a new product because it is a new product and I think that that at this point in the pandemic where um we are much better off we have a very high level population immunity and if you looked at the data that were presented to us last week by the FDA and the CDC the incidence of hospitalizations and deaths is way down so we really do have time I think to get the kind of data that would be a little more reassuring that this is the right way to go I I do think I I did vote Yes and I I do think that we do have a lot of data on the ancestral strain on the bivalent vaccine I think we have what you would expect to see with this xbb a one five from from pfizen which is you get clearly an increase in neutralizing antibodies for what has been a drifted virus from what have been the previous Omicron sub lineages all right so you mentioned original antigenic Center actually you said imprinting you didn't use the the religious word um so a lot of people have been infected and vaccinated probably vaccinated with ancestral vaccines isn't giving them this is this virus different enough that there will not be imprinting I would think there probably still would be imprinting as a guess I think that for say a six-month-old who no longer has passively transferred antibodies from their mother I think getting this vaccine would likely induce a very high neutralizing antibody response against what is currently a circulating strain it's very rare to find people who've neither been vaccinated nor naturally affected or both and so I think you're always climbing the imprinting healthy the good news about this virus is if there's any good thing you can say about a pandemic virus that's killed 1.2 million people in this country is that it really does look like those T cell epitopes are conserved so if you've been vaccinated or naturally infected or both you likely have long-lived memory T Cell responses that are protective so I think that's the good news we do learn as we go um I think there is some communication errors that we made with this vaccine um but I think that was to be expected in many ways so in a let's take a six year a six month old who's never been infected never been vaccinated at least with with active vaccines it's it sounds likely that they will make a good T-cell response but that remains an open question until we see right right you'd like to generate those data hopefully we'll be generators they don't I'm the the proud grandfather of a four-month-old and I will do what I can to try and convince my uh son and daughter-in-law that I think that that as this child hits six months of age it would be a value to vaccine because this virus is going to continue to circulate it's likely going to become a seasonal winter respiratory virus joining RSD and flu and human metanumovirus as a by one of the viruses that caused you know hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations and tens of thousands of deaths every year so I do think we we are going to continually be generating a group of people because three and a half to four million people are born every year in this country who are susceptible to this virus and I think they need to be protected you often say you can't predict anything about this virus but it could be that in the fall when the respiratory virus season begins that a very different variant will be circulating right that's been the story I mean when we first sat down in June of last year to consider a bivalent vaccine so June 28th of 2022. um the data we presented was with ba1 I mean you know the original Omicron that all the data including some clinical data were all ba1 by the time we sat down in June ba1 was gone and so we picked the A4 ba5 which by the end of the year was gone and so now we've picked xbb one five and where will that virus be three four months from now and will it be replaced by by similarly by viruses that have drifted to the point that neutralizing antibodies still don't protect you against mild disease in the short term we'll see so the recommendation will likely be everyone's six months older and up should get this booster is that correct I hope not I'd like to think we've learned the lesson here first of all when we made that recommendation or the CDC made that recommendation September 1st of last year um people basically didn't agree because the uptake was only about 17 percent of those for whom it was recommended got it and and it tended to be those who really were at higher risk I I'd like to think that we just really follow the data and recommend it for those who really do clear to benefit but clearly benefit from a goose but even there where the CDC can help us is who's getting hospitalized and who's dying from this virus right now the numbers are really low so we'll we'll see what happens this winter this winter will be really instructive so can you give a clear message about who you think should be getting this vaccine right I think this vaccine should be given probably in the fall we'll see what the CDC recommends in September to those who are at highest risk the greater than 75 year old those multiple comorbidities uh pregnant women and uh people who are immune compromised all right you can find the column that we've talked about today on on Paul's beyond the noise that substag we'll have a link below the video so you can go right there and read
