      "\n",
      "In the graph, many countries were compared in terms of deaths from Covid for million inhabitants, including two neighboring countries, namely Brazil and Argentina. As you know, Bolsonaro, president of Brazil, was harshly criticized for refusing to subject the population to lockdowns and other restrictive measures to fight the virus, contrary to what did instead Fernandez, President of Argentina, who, in addition to an eight-month lockdown, has imposed restrictions and impositions of all kinds on the population, with serious consequences for the economy of that country.
