79,254GdlKEz5I,Philippines Opens Borders to Vaccinated Travelers as Covid-19 Eases,"""The Philippines has reopened its doors to travelers from more than 150 countries with visa-free privileges, lifting entry restrictions for foreign tourists and businesspeople after nearly two years. It's a move to revive the battered tourism industry as the latest coronavirus outbreak started to ease. Foreign travelers will no longer be required to quarantine in government-designated centers upon arrival if they have been fully vaccinated and tested negative prior to arrival, officials said.\n\nThe government had initially planned to lift the ban on Dec. 1 but indefinitely postponed it as the more contagious omicron variant spread, which also prompted authorities to reimpose tighter restrictions.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte warned that unvaccinated Filipinos who defy orders to stay at home could face arrest. Commuters who have not been immunized were also prohibited from public transport in the capital region of more than 13 million people unless on urgent errands, for at least up to the end of the month. The decision has sparking protests from human rights and labor groups. \n\n“We’re done with border control,” Health Undersecretary Rosario Vergeire told a news conference in January, adding that government focus has shifted to preventing community transmission of the omicron variant\n\nThe number of tourists dropped by more than 6 million, and more than a million Filipinos lost their jobs in tourism businesses and destinations in the first year of the pandemic alone, according to government statistics. Tourism destinations, including popular beach and island resorts, resembled ghost towns at the height of pandemic lockdowns.\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8Gm\nSubscribe to our newest channel Quicktake Explained: https://bit.ly/3iERrup\n\nBloomberg Quicktake brings you live global news and original shows spanning business, technology, politics and culture.

94,N9OQbW0YOLU,Nurses in the Philippines: Underpaid and unprotected from COVID-19 while saving lives,"""In April 2020, the Philippines government imposed a deployment ban on nurses, blocking them from taking on jobs overseas. The labour minister, Silvestre Bello, explained that the country cannot lose the “services of our nurses” at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. Thousands of ‘prisonurses’ (coined from the term, prisoners) have appealed for the lifting of the ban. \n\nFor almost two decades, nurses in the Philippines have been fighting for fair compensation. A public law guarantees a starting salary of US$680 in public hospitals. In this episode of #UndercoverAsia, we spoke to a nurse who earns US$13 a day, barely US$3 above minimum wage in Manila. \n\nIn comparison, a nurse earns about US$2,400 in Germany, between US$2,700 and US$3,000 in the UK and about US$4,000 to US$8,000 in the US with overtime pay. \n\nThe Philippines government also promised that there’d be sufficient protection and introduced a hazard pay of US$10 a day for work during the pandemic. \n\nNurse Maria Theresa Cruz, 47, worked in Cainta Municipal Hospital. She had to purchase her own Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). When she showed signs of COVID-19, she was only given rapid tests that came back negative, despite a government memo stating that rapid tests “should not be used to definitively rule out COVID-19”. \n\nTheresa was later given a swab test which came back positive. By then, it was too late, she had already passed away. On top of her salary, she’d posthumously receive only US$1.26 a day in hazard pay. \n\nAs of November 2020, over 16,000 healthcare workers have yet to receive their hazard pay. \n\nWATCH the full episode of Undercover Asia’s Nurses Wanted: https://youtu.be/3F1qTKPeft4 \n\nALSO WATCH: \nStarving in Philippines' Coronavirus Lockdown: A 16-Year-Old's Story: https://youtu.be/RhDHGgo4yZg \nSex And Beauty Pageants In The Philippines: https://youtu.be/9qoFKvymZwM \nWhy's This Illegal Skin Lightening Treatment So Popular?: https://youtu.be/pV5lffYFDNY \n\nFor more, SUBSCRIBE to CNA INSIDER! \nhttps://cna.asia/insideryoutubesub\n\nFollow CNA INSIDER on:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/cnainsider/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/cnainsider/\nWebsite: https://cna.asia/cnainsider""",2021-04-19,31578,516,338,UC_Lnb8ZHqqgLbp-7hltuT9w,CNA Insider,2014-03-12,1600000,4134

Health care workers, police and military personnel were the first to receive the Sinovac shots, prompting thanks from Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Manila’s Food and Drug Administration approved the vaccine for emergency use on people aged 18-59, but 75-year-old Duterte has ruled out taking it himself because of his age. Authorities also advised against use of the Chinese vaccine for health care workers, citing its low efficacy rate.

What do we know about the spread of  SARSCoV2 at national and local levels? Will it get worse before it gets better? What about the  economy? What can we expect in the coming months? How should families prepare for what is  ahead? How should health workers prepare for what is ahead? \nSome of the assumptions will change because of the advances in the health sciences and  medicine. The vaccines will have an impact on disease transmission. Newer drugs are being  studied for treatment of moderate and severe COVID. People are slowly adapting and modifying  their behavior to protect themselves and survive. \nIn the next episode of STOP COVID DEATHS, UP Professor of Economics, Dr. Toby Melissa  Monsod, opens the webinar with a perspective on the economy. The main presenter is Dr. John Q.  Wong, lead epidemiologist of the IATF and reactors are infectious disease specialist Dr. Cybele  Lara Abad from UP-PGH and pulmonologist Dr Aileen David Wang of the UP College of  Medicine. \nWhile we cannot gaze into a crystal ball, we can look up the data and see where we are-- and move  toward where we want to be in the coming year, together. \nStay Safe.
