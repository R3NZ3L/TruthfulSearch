0,aLZ85hb4wjE,Loved the calmness of Manilla.
1,aLZ85hb4wjE,"After this pandemic I think every country should have a lockdown every month to give mother nature a time to heal, with all the pollution that the earth is experiencing."
2,aLZ85hb4wjE,manila looks beautifull with less people
3,aLZ85hb4wjE,"The lockdown makes the city look like a place I want to explore.

Before the lockdown, it looked like a crowded mess filled with traffic and pollution."
4,aLZ85hb4wjE,India also same
5,aLZ85hb4wjE,The president promised that he'll do his best to ease the traffic in the metro like 5mins of travel along EDSA. Fortunately it happened but unfortunately it wasn't in the ideal way. Nature's sense of humor tho.
6,aLZ85hb4wjE,"I went up the viewing spot at antipolo, its a very beautiful, almost smog free view of the metro skyline"
7,aLZ85hb4wjE,The sad part is people around the world did not intend to heal earth but afraid of death.
8,aLZ85hb4wjE,i hope it stays like this forever its beautiful with no messy people
9,aLZ85hb4wjE,2020 is the year when nature fight back and reduce human emission dramatically.

17,DWxIvQlpJK8,Let us remember that the reason why we had such high numbers or had COVID AT ALL was because this guy was afraid of hurting China's feelings by imposing a travel ban on them.
18,DWxIvQlpJK8,"Nakakamis un lock down, nakakamis un puro boses ni tatay digong inaabangan ng mga tao during lockdown. It means, lahat ng tao, nakaagapay s desisyon ni tatay digong, salute talaga kay fprrd dahil sya ang pres during pandemic."

30,cPVE7QGS7As,"Just because our neighbour Filipina increase their covid test testing does not mean they are the worst in South East Asia. For me I admire that they try to save their people the best they can and honest with the figure too. Better than countries who have huge problem with covid, denying that they have the problem. Sending our thought and prayer to Filipina people..from Malaysia. Keep fighting spirit alive. May god protect you all."
31,cPVE7QGS7As,"Stay strong, my Filipino mates, this too shall pass"
32,cPVE7QGS7As,"Please be safe you all there. 
Well wish from Malaysia."

Stay strong and resilient!!!
Until we meet again."
34,cPVE7QGS7As,I hope Filipino people be safe and overcome this happening. from South Korea.
35,cPVE7QGS7As,"Filipinos are very friendly, hopefully they can get this under control"
36,cPVE7QGS7As,Deaths have been low compared to other countries. The economy is the same as other countries reeling from the effects of the pandemic. We do what we can to live and survive through this and build again! We are a resilient and patient people where 4 months in a year we are visited by calamities. We have faith! We pray for this to end soon and I pray for everybody around the world who have lost family in this crisis.
37,cPVE7QGS7As,Every country is facing the same problems
38,cPVE7QGS7As,We are reaching 50k test per day now that's why cases becomes high. What's important is fatality is low and high recoveries.

It's really a community effort. Many people help fed covid patience.  A week a go were downgraded to GCQ, our hospital are at 45% utilization rate now. We're about to transition to MGCQ an even more lower status. So just hang in there guys, you can do it. Just follow the basic  health protocol. Stay safe, Stay home, Stay healthy and please be obedient.  ‚úå. For local tourist please go to Cebu it's open all ready. To help the local tourism industry.  Thanks."

58,iOE6rAY8l-k,"When people are bored and or looking for sources of income, they can't simply stay at home after 5 long months of waiting. Some don't take this disease seriously anymore after ECQ was  lifted....not properly wearing masks and don't observe physical distancing when law enforcers are not around. What can you expect?"

67,E5F3xA_zkFc,Very sad and disturbing.  My prayers are with all the people who are hungry and unemployed.
68,E5F3xA_zkFc,What's sad is that these are the same people who still vote for corrupt officials.
69,E5F3xA_zkFc,Very good documentary.
70,E5F3xA_zkFc,"Perfect docu , can't believe it's happening now, feels like it happened 20 yrs ago"
71,E5F3xA_zkFc,This is ridiculous! The country needs to open up to survive.

77,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"The poor gets poorer and the rich gets richer, that's how our country works... Even our farmers is not paid fairly..."
78,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"I became a Housemaid at the age of 13, so I can go to high school at night.  My parents had 9 children. I‚Äôve experienced nothing but poverty in my childhood.  It was harder for us, the older children. I wondered, even at 4 years old, why children are considered as ‚Äúblessings‚Äù, when we were all SUFFERING.  
There was no Pandemic in those days, but POVERTY was crippling us."
79,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,I was born and raised in Cebu Philippines in one of those slums. I have lived in Florida for 15 yrs now and I am so grateful to be able to help my family during these tough times. I bought my mom a duplex out in the country in 2016 so She is no longer living in the slums. It still feels like yesterday when we had to pawn Our clothes so we can buy food. I will never forget where I came from and will always be grateful for the blessings that come my way üôè
80,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"10 children and 13 grandchildren. Sometimes you can influence how you live your life. We are a poor family too, but our lives are much better than a family with 10 children and 13 grandkids."
81,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"Even without the pandemic.. many of Filipinos have been starving, and  unemployed. They also said here that ""Hindi kami natakot mamatay sa COVID, takot kami na mamatay sa gutom"" ""Walang nakakagmot sa gutom, patay ka."" and I think that's the most painful statements i heard in this video. Many filipinos experienced hunger amid the lockdown. In fact, the hunger incidence rate is at its highest in 6 years according to the social weather station. I can say that Filipinos don't easily give up in the situation and they are still helping through good and bad times."
82,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"Even without the pandemic.. many of Filipinos have been starving, and  unemployed"
83,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"I work 12 to 13 hours a day at minimum. Sometimes I feel like complaining  but after watching this, somehow I feel grateful to have kept my job and be able to take care of my family."
84,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"As someone who is privileged enough, these are the stories most of the government officials, middle and upper class Filipinos should see to realize what's really happening when we allow poor priority/decisions and poor politics plague our land. Let us have the initiative to help, both the government and the people together from making this our ""new normal"" üôè"
85,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"That's why Family planning is very important. Don't settle yet if you don't have your own house and stable job. Save money as much as you can, spend it wisely."

126,8dTelszbObM,Coronavirus: Death toll rises to 427: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eavggz1suMY
127,8dTelszbObM,There's always that one person that hides there sickness and risk a whole world.
128,8dTelszbObM,This sounds serious. Hope they get it under control.
129,8dTelszbObM,I hope this Outbreak will come to an end! Be safe Everyone!
130,8dTelszbObM,"0:07 - 20,438 confirmed cases.  How long ago did you film this?"
131,8dTelszbObM,"My wife is from mainland China. Her friends are from mainland China. We live in California. My wife and her friends are stand away from places they regularly go to that gave large numbers of Chinese. Classes in the evenings and weekends that have mostly Chinese students have less people showing up. Masks are sold out everywhere. Groups on WeChat are coordinating mask purchases from whatever places they find them online, even if expensive. 

I‚Äôm not as concerned but am respecting her wishes, I don‚Äôt want to cause her extra stress. 

The fear is real. 

You may think it unjustified but it‚Äôs not just people who aren‚Äôt Asian keeping their distance. Sure, some people are being idiots, especially those making comments around Asian people buy calling people racist and xenophobic doesn‚Äôt help. 

Do what you think is right for your family. Don‚Äôt let people shame you into not protecting yourself. 

At some point I expect someone to say something to my daughter who is mixed but looks Chinese but I‚Äôve just told her people are scared and when people are scared they sometimes say mean things. It‚Äôs not as if she hasn‚Äôt heard Chinese people say racist things about other cultures. 

I make sure she knows racism exists and isn‚Äôt acceptable. 

To date she gets far more abuse from other Chinese because her Chinese isn‚Äôt as good as others. She has been bullied by people from South America in the past. 

To date, she has never told me about being bullied by westerners, she just gets the occasional mean comment which young girls seem to make to each other. 

Racists and mean people come from all races and religions. I‚Äôve heard from the local Chinese community things like Mexicans are stupid, black people are scary, various things about Japanese so let‚Äôs not pretend many complaining about racism may also be racist, although they may not see it that way."

I am not a rich man but I thought I must do something to help. So I have been sending $125 pcm. I know this will be enough vegetables and rice to see them through. It will save them from starvation."

I hope that if you  know someone like them within your reach, or your community, may you make a difference, change lives and fate, please share thy blessings, a small amount could make a good meal.=)"

165,jEINZXA_ujo,"here in the philippines our houses are just so close to each other, The virus here can spread with ease, it's a good thing president duterte declared the lockdown earlier, we would've been all infected by now if it wasn't for that."
166,587N9bJ5J5k,"If you look at the lower income quarters, a lot of these settlements have significant overcrowding and unacceptable environmental hygiene; it just adds to the spread and these environments are a breeding ground for disease.  The situation is very similar to the Brazilian Favelas.  Many of their outdoor marketplaces are also a breeding ground for disease without proper safe food storage.

Many people in the Philippines can't afford private hospitals and don't have health insurance."
167,587N9bJ5J5k,the philippines still managed NOT  to be like india and indonesia until now despite having the most densed population in the world.. hoping it will not get worse this time üôèüèΩ

180,nTUWK8vufOk,"I was in the Philippines on a mission trip when Covid hit. After I was home in the US with my family, the worry I felt for the kids I'd met there was overwhelming. May God bless the Filipino peopleüíô"
181,nTUWK8vufOk,"I am so glad that they also tackled the mental health of the youth right now. It is also one of the worst problems that the youth of the Philippines can experience. I know a lot of people in my classmates who suffer from depression, that is why, we must take actions to fight and solve this problem."
182,nTUWK8vufOk,"The problem in the Philippines is that there are many less privileged, challenged people. The government officials and local government unit can be corrupt and don‚Äôt do their assigned jobs properly(not saying all of them but some or maybe most of them). The less privileged people and some teens just makes more babies and say having an accidental baby is a ‚Äúblessing‚Äù. It is only a blessing if it was planned and both couple/parents are ready to have their own family. That is why many people are suffering from poverty because many people do not plan making their family. Then they blame everything to the government and if there are people doing better than them they want to pull others down. #crabmentality ü¶Ä I feel sorry for the challenged people but some of the people just make their own problems.

Didn‚Äôt comment here to debate. Just giving my opinion ‚úåüèª"
183,nTUWK8vufOk,I'm here out of curiosity if they include how there are so many errors/incomplete in the modules given to students for online study. It's like it never even went to proofreading before it was released. Even our senate wants an investigation on this matter. How can we have internationally competitive students if the materials provided to them has so many errors.
184,nTUWK8vufOk,Ah bless jonathan he is so determined while my niece in the philippines her parents send her to a private school provided everything and now she did not finish school what a spoilt brat. I wish jonathan finish a degree someday he deserve to be help

187,1psSvU1km0I,Family planning is one of the main key to prevent poverty.
188,1psSvU1km0I,The irony is that those in the poverty are the one who lacks family planning. You‚Äôll notice they are the one with the huge family members.
189,1psSvU1km0I,I'm from Phillipines neighbouring country. Seeing many Filipinos living in poverty makes me sad. Many Filipinos come to our country to get a better life but sadly our government cannot do anything about them since they are taking care of their own people. I hope Phillipines poverty rate may drop
190,1psSvU1km0I,"filipinos like to laugh about china, now look whos poorer, this world doesn't need people to insult others with their own nationalistic ideas."
191,1psSvU1km0I,"As a Filipino myself. One of the weakest spots of my countrymen is that we are guilible, easily manipulated and are being exploited due to lack of education. Poverty is the driving force of these corruptions because they can control the poor by providing aid to them with malicious intent. Disinformation tru social media has led to many people electing skewed and incompetent politicians. As a result, it cascaded into substandard solutions and short term provisions which aggravated the poor even more. 

EDUCATION is a lengthy investment but I believe it will put an end to the never ending cycle of ignorance and the people being exploited by it."
192,1psSvU1km0I,Praying that the Philippines can overcome many of its problem and become a country of just for rich and for poor someday.
193,1psSvU1km0I,The Philippines has a lot of potential if the right decisions are made.

Would you now suggest again for another kind of vaccine at the expense of government money so politicians and profit oriented individuals  could amass more wealth?
215,PP3Yu-ro1tA,Marami nagka cases sa metro Manila ay mga vaccinated kasi 90% fully vaccinated nila. Pag 52% positivity rate nila ibig sabihin halos karamihan nagka covid ay bakunado. So sila ang nagpa laganap ng virus sa metro Manila mga bakunado. Dapat cla ang huwag palabasin kasi sila ang carrier.
216,PP3Yu-ro1tA,Declare alert level 4 before it gets worst. This omicron variant has exceeded the delta variant and spreading like wildfire.

229,SEHcakm-fAc,"Levels of lockdown/quarantine in the Philippines based on how strict it is:
6. EECQ - extreme/extensive enhanced community quarantine
5. ECQ - enhanced community quarantine
        a. LECQ - localized enhanced community quarantine - is only done on small areas of the city.
4. MECQ- modified enhanced community quarantine

232,SEHcakm-fAc,Is it timely?
233,SEHcakm-fAc,"ADVICE: If you have covid and is having a hard time breathing. Do a ""Belly Breathing"" - the most efficient way to breathe (you can search it up online). This is exactly what I did when I was slowly losing air to breathe. I was having a hard time inhaling through my nose so I used my mouth. Your belly should come outward as you take in air. As you exhale, your stomach will come back in. If it's hard to breathe through your nose then use your mouth. If this makes your mouth dry then try to have a glass of water and maybe a little bucket beside you where you can rinse your mouth from time to time. If it's hard to breathe when you lay down then just sit. You need to practice until your body gets use to it. Put your hand in your stomach so you can monitor your breathing. ( I tried the one where you hold your breath for a couple of times and cough at the last try but it didn't work for me. It made it even more hard for me to breathe.)"
234,SEHcakm-fAc,"Success is dependent on the action or steps you take to achieve it. Show me a man who doesn't have an investment and I will tell you how soon he'll go broke. Investment is building a safe haven for the future: with the right choice of investment that has at least 1% minimum risk and with an Expert guidance, profit and interest should be üíØ guaranteed."

‚ÄúO Lord, hear my plea for justice. Listen to my cry for help. Pay attention to my prayer, for it comes from honest lips. Declare me innocent, for you see those who do right. You have tested my thoughts and examined my heart in the night. You have scrutinized me and found nothing wrong. I am determined not to sin in what I say. I have followed your commands, which keep me from following cruel and evil people. My steps have stayed on your path; I have not wavered from following you. I am praying to you because I know you will answer, O God. Bend down and listen as I pray. Show me your unfailing love in wonderful ways. By your mighty power you rescue those who seek refuge from their enemies. Guard me as you would guard your own eyes. Hide me in the shadow of your wings. Protect me from wicked people who attack me, from murderous enemies who surround me. They are without pity. Listen to their boasting! They track me down and surround me, watching for the chance to throw me to the ground. They are like hungry lions, eager to tear me apart‚Äî like young lions hiding in ambush. Arise, O Lord! Stand against them, and bring them to their knees! Rescue me from the wicked with your sword! By the power of your hand, O Lord, destroy those who look to this world for their reward. But satisfy the hunger of your treasured ones. May their children have plenty, leaving an inheritance for their descendants. Because I am righteous, I will see you. When I awake, I will see you face to face and be satisfied.‚Äù (Psalms‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠17:1-15‚Ä¨)

But saw that they passed grade 5 with high grades. I told them to tell me the truth, and they told me, they were using math apps on their tablets to answer math problems. They never solved the problems on their own. This is sad, because now, their math level is like the level of a grade 2 student. It is unfortunate that there is no way to place a check system wherein the teacher can find out if they are finding the answers elsewhere. Hence, it takes them a long time to answer each question."

Dapat paglabas pa lang ng bahay ay hulihin na ang hindi naka mask.  Kaso hindi ginagawa.

280,o1kPskxFkQ8,"They say, health is our wealth.
But how it'll become our wealth if we don't have proper self discipline?
Come to think of it, they implemented a two-week ECQ in mega manila, yes it was a big help to prevent the wide spread of the virus, for a while. But then, after the ECQ, kanya-kanya na naman tayong labas ng bahay and worst may gumagala pa, even though hindi naman reasonable or valid  yung dahilan natin. And here comes us criticizing the government on what should they do about the issue, when it is clearly evident that we also have faults and lapses. Also, the government should always need to hear the voices of those frontliners, especially the medical professionals and staffs, because they're the ones who know what and how to prevent and avoid the wide spread of the virus. 

Just to be clear, I'm just being neutral about the issue and I just want to express my opinion. Respect is all that matters. This is for educational purpose only, and its not really in my nature to talks anything about politics.

281,o1kPskxFkQ8,How are covid19 patients counted if hospitals are unwilling to accept suspected patients with covid? As my mother and I experienced where we toured the entire Gen. Trias until we get to the Manila Hospital where she is also not admitted without even passing the swab test.
282,o1kPskxFkQ8,I think the thumbnail is incorrect based on what he wants to imply.  Just saying.
283,o1kPskxFkQ8,"There are a lot of things don't ad up here. In the last 5 months we have had just under 2000 deaths (an average of 400 per month), yet DOH figures show that in a normal year, before Covid, there are approximately 47,000 deaths per month from other causes, so why is it that the system cannot cope with a 1% rise in deaths. Is it incompetence, poor management and just plain panic, just as it is in other countries?"
284,o1kPskxFkQ8,"I may say that some people have  biased reasoning. While government officials are not experts on the pandemic, they are doing their best. Maybe not all, but most. Well, maybe not most, maybe some of them.  Regardless. They may not cover every facet of the strategic planning but people should also understand that it is also primarily a measure of each person's discipline.  Everyone is given a mind to think and the right to choose to do what's best for ourselves. Why blame all to the government when people are not doing their best to protect themselves? Government officials are humans, too.  They make mistakes, they get hurt, too. They get sick, they  get scared, too! They are not perfect, well so do we. Instead of blaming the government, why not do something to help them when it comes to the decisions they are making? We can start by reaching out. They have channels to do such. Why not help the government by helping others, too? At the end of the day, we should help each other instead of pulling others down by shooting their flaws or imperfections. Because believe it or not, everything gets better when we work together. So when do you plan to start? When do you plan to contribute for the good of your fellowmen?"

309,MmyIvf7bEGc,Duque again is the better among the rest prang wla ng ibang choices ang pangulo sana naman po paano po tayo uunlad nyan

312,xV1oR-RbOGU,How are covid19 patients counted if hospitals are unwilling to accept suspected patients with covid? As my mother and I experienced where we toured the entire Gen. Trias until we get to the Manila Hospital where she is also not admitted without even passing the swab test.
313,xV1oR-RbOGU,"The Philipphines has been locked down strictly for quite some time, right? That's respectable and impressive by a country that still is relatively poor. Must be tough. Respect to those pulling through."
314,xV1oR-RbOGU,Be strong Philippines
315,xV1oR-RbOGU,I feel super safe in the philippines when it comes to the whole pandemic situation.. The philippine handled this pandemic better than th most other countries. We atleast follow what is required and mandated by the government.
316,xV1oR-RbOGU,I don‚Äôt buy the ‚Äúno budget ‚Äú idea.  It‚Äôs the availability and the priority countries. We are not that poor
317,xV1oR-RbOGU,"The Philippine government should be wise enough not to depend too much on China for COVID vaccines as the country does not have a good reputation for its clinical trials.  Even Brazil stopped the clinical trials of the CoronaVac produced by SinoVac Biotech on its people due to various serious side effects.  It would be better for the country to be talking to American, Australian, or European Pharmaceutical companies (e.g. Pfizer, BioNtech, Moderna, Astra-Zeneca) that follow strict regimen for clinical trials with emphasis on safety and effectiveness of COVID vaccines."
318,xV1oR-RbOGU,"Philippine government strategy giving second dose vaccine isn‚Äôt a wise decision! In other  countries like in Europe and USA giving second dose of vaccine even your a front liners or vulnerable there is a certain period of time or a gap of 3-4 months as there priorities at least majority of people have a chance to have a first job to be protected, while waiting for the volume of vaccine arrival! Meanwhile countries in Europe grapple with more infectious variants, a shortages of vaccine globally while the risk of dying in a road of pandemic! The important thing is the outweighs the risk..."
319,xV1oR-RbOGU,My girlfriend is there and I pray for her and everyone there
320,xV1oR-RbOGU,"The leaders in the Phillippines should consider the efficacy of the following vaccines before they roll them out into the public:  Pfizer-BioNTech 95%, AstraZeneca 90%, Moderna 89%, Sinopharm 79%, and Sinovac 50.38%.  The promotion on the type of vaccines should be based on effectiveness and safety to the Filipino people, instead of political considerations or preferences.  Just my suggestion."
321,xV1oR-RbOGU,"They just admitted that since they were being used as test subjects, they hope they get some for free."
322,aoNQUUQno00,"It's so funny because while part of me still believes we should be wary about COVID at all times hence it still exists, part of me also is doubting the numbers. I have a friend who was trying to get a doctor's certificate for back to work after a 1 day absence due to fever and sore throat he got because of the hot weather and imagine he is marked as a COVID patient by the insurance company? We were both laughing because we know very well he did not get COVID üòÇü§£"
323,aoNQUUQno00,"Just like covid here in Canada, this news is meant to be spitted out to the ground. üòÖ"
324,aoNQUUQno00,How many deaths?  Maybe it's time to let natural immunity take it's course.
325,aoNQUUQno00,follow the money...

327,aoNQUUQno00,Unreal

329,aoNQUUQno00,"Magaling talaga ang pinoy sa ganito ""üß¢"" üòÇ"

343,a3-AiHSyTIU,NO MARK OF THE BEAST NO ENTRY NO BUY OR SELL NO RIDE NO WORK NO SCHOOL. VENGEANCE IS MINE SAYS THE LORD.
344,a3-AiHSyTIU,Since when is it normal to test people that are not sick! Political games for power and control.
345,a3-AiHSyTIU,"cases are only high bcuz of abnormally high volume testing and the inaccuracy of the test... seeking to shoooot the number of ""new cases"" higher....       what a jokkeeee"
346,a3-AiHSyTIU,"no vaccine card no business for you then , I wont buy your products and I wont shop at your stores, we will see who lasts longer lol"
347,a3-AiHSyTIU,"No vaccine, no swab testing, amd no quarantine. Kaya magpa bakuna na! Para maka avail sa swab testing, pag nagpa check up kayu dahil masakit ang tiyan ninyo. Sa mga balikbayan, dapat fully vacconated para ma'enjoy nila ang quarantine facility. üòÇüòÅüòÄ
Vaccine nga naman may pera na, pahirap pa sa tao."
348,a3-AiHSyTIU,"Revelation 13:17 ""so that NO ONE could BUY or SELL unless he had the MARK‚Äî the name of the beast or the number of its name."" 

This ""snake bite/ Vac"" isn't the mark of the beast but what we're experiencing right now is a precursor of Revelation 13:17. We don't struggle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, the authorities, the powers of this world‚Äôs darkness, and spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. But fear not, Jesus Christ has overcome the world. Only by the grace of God through Christ our Lord we can win this battle. Trust Him at all cost. He's coming very soon to rule and reign!  Hallelujah."
349,a3-AiHSyTIU,"Ohhh no wedding no vaccine card

352,-qFcO_onBdA,"Here in Armenia no signs of improvement for now and the number of coronavirus cases is increasing fast. And in some neighboring countries situation is even worth. Looks scary. But it's still much better than in EU countries. Why everyone starts to move only now? It was much easier to prevent the pandemic in early 2020 when it was just appearing, but by that time WHO saw no major risks of its spreading all over the world and mainstream media were focused on showing news from China."
353,-qFcO_onBdA,I wish we have a lockdown in AZ
354,-qFcO_onBdA,So a possible imported case from Singapore.... what to make of it...
355,-qFcO_onBdA,Wrong report.

357,-qFcO_onBdA,Oh no a kid
358,-qFcO_onBdA,Manila doesnt have 50million or even 15m thats way too much. 50million people is the number of population for the whole Luzon island. Before the community quarantine people dispersed to their home villages. Population of Manila right now might be 5m - 10m.
359,-qFcO_onBdA,Newscasters took turns to wear red and yellow

389,fp9uRsmTWqg,Unemployment rate has never been under 20% in Philippines. Many Filipinos are under employed in temp jobs this is why so many Filipinos flee Philippines to work as OFW's. The best and brightest leave Philippines due to it's hopeless corrupt government.
390,fp9uRsmTWqg,In September the unemployment rate is really high because of 20k plus new cases a day but now the new cases is only 2k or 1k I think the unemployment rate will low because of lower restrictions in October or November.
391,fp9uRsmTWqg,That rate is muchhhhhh higher. Its getting worse

469,ibWFsmcnefk,Why is it ok to keep drug prices high if there is inflation?  Because it has nothing to do with inflation.  It has to do with top 1% sending out lobbyists to make sure they don‚Äôt pay more taxes.  They must be sending lobbyists to news channels too.
470,ibWFsmcnefk,Honesty from the Philippines

Let China go home, look at the way they are treating Africans living in China. China have destroyed their reputation because they want to become world superpower. Shame on Chinese government"

643,8w61tigk0ag,"We don't hate them, we are just being cautious knowing that the health system (although our medical professionals are experts and commendable) is expensive and lacks the facilities to handle these cases."

Kudos to you brother Erwan, Mabuhay ka!"
656,FJEMcVK0MWI,"It's nice to find English Philippine news. Please do more. I just subscribed. I live in rural Philippines and not speaking Filipino, I rarely know what's going on and have to pry information out of my neighbors. We were in lockdown for a week before anyone told me."

668,LLFcBFAuauk,"I'm Filipino and I'm not that aware of what's happening in my country. After watching this video, I just realized how hard the lives of my fellow Filipinos. I'm not against with the government but I suppose this is not the best way to help them. Giving money is not enough, for many Filipinos, it'll not last for 3 days. I reckon, instead of giving money and putting the fund of the country in this way, why not arrange mass testing? Just try to test as many as possible so the virus will stop spreading. If that happens, the economy will be back to normal, more job opportunities again and each family can make enough money for a decent life."

My Mom who is a senior (65 years old) receives 500 pesos per month. Not much but its still a big help for us poor here in Manila. I just really hope that this pandemic will end soon. We closed all our small restaurants last year because of this."

673,EsW0ye2wjUQ,Who cares
674,R0i7i80ToUM,"I'm so happy I made productive decisions about my finances that changed my life forever,hoping to retire next year... Investment should always be on any creative man's heart for success in life."
675,R0i7i80ToUM,"The covid pandemic showed how uniquely different the Philippines is from the rest of the world. I'd say the BPO industry and OFW remittances kept the Philippine economy afloat during the pandemic, both of which showed marked increases contrary to expectations. Had we depended on the manufacturing sector like most of our neighbors, we most likely would not have bounced back from the pandemic that rapidly. In a short span of 2 years, the Philippines transitioned from a contracting economy to the best-performing economy in the region. (Btw, thanks to covid vaccine donor countries that saved us billions of dollars). Edit: Thanks also to the private sector that stepped up during the pandemic; it averted further deterioration of the economy."
676,R0i7i80ToUM,Good thing the philippines economy got it's recovery from the covid. Atleast now the philippines economy is growing very fast and catching up.
677,R0i7i80ToUM,"The Philippines, according to the IMF, will be the growth leader not only in the ASEAN Region but in the entire Asian continent."
678,R0i7i80ToUM,"Now it pays off being service oriented country, basta serbisyong Filipino, serbisyong maaasahan! Mula domestic service hanggang customer service, Pinoy ang unang hinahanap."
679,R0i7i80ToUM,"Thanks to the strong partnership between the government (Duterte and Marcos administrations) and the private sector, plus the repatriation of money by overseas Filipinos, the economy of the Philippines was able to bounced back quickly. That is an example of the ""bayanihan"" spirit of Filipinos both in the Philippines and abroad."
680,R0i7i80ToUM,"infrastructure is a force multiplier in terms of economic benefit. it needs to spend more in terms of more roads and bridges and high speed internet, social health care, education, and food security. it needs to develop a vertically integrated steel industry and mining industry and refining"
681,R0i7i80ToUM,"Been to Philippines recently, more families are struggling now than before Covid-19."

683,R0i7i80ToUM,Wow!
684,6zkba0hNiE8,".     In spite of massive demonstrations in Europe and in the US,  with no social distancing and lesser face masks, yet there is no abrupt spike of  deaths and cases as of now as everybody is projecting and watching the opposite. What happened ?
     If I may recall the video in March of this year of Naftali Bennett, the Defense Minister of Israel, that video stated that the people, the senior citizens are safe to get out of quarantine once  the immunity of the community reaches to 60 percent or better.  Thus, it is safe to say that the Defense Minister is correct.
     For now, social distancing and wearing of face masks etc are observed while there is no vaccine yet."

Yung mga ofw galing Wuhan, ang tanong ko ay kinuhanan ba sila ng tests? Or kinuwarrantine lang sila ng 14 days? kapag may symptoms dun lang sila ite-test? at dahil wala naman symptoms ay pinakawalan na sila after 14 days. What if beyond 14 days lumabas ang symptoms??

The Philippines has only 6.3% unemployment rate - one of the lowest in Asia.  What we need is to lower the cost of living which means we need to lower costs in food, energy and housing.  But of course this is something Leni cannot address since most of her financers are those who monopolize these industries."

908,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,"ADVICE: If you have covid and is having a hard time breathing. Do a ""Belly Breathing"" - the most efficient way to breathe (you can search it up online). This is exactly what I did when I was slowly losing air to breathe. I was having a hard time inhaling through my nose so I used my mouth. Your belly should come outward as you take in air. As you exhale, your stomach will come back in. If it's hard to breathe through your nose then use your mouth. If this makes your mouth dry then try to have a glass of water and maybe a little bucket beside you where you can rinse your mouth from time to time. If it's hard to breathe when you lay down then just sit. You need to practice until your body gets use to it. Put your hand in your stomach so you can monitor your breathing. ( I tried the one where you hold your breath for a couple of times and cough at the last try but it didn't work for me. It made it even more hard for me to breathe.)"
909,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Given that covid-19 especially the delta variant is highly contagious as per CDC's. 2M is 2% of our population and thankfully I lot have recovered. I remember Germany's Merkel mentioned in her speech last year that they'd expect 70% of their population being infected as per expert's data. We are nowhere as rich as Germany but 2% is considered low basing on experts data.
910,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Woooh go on! Record Holder! Go Philippines!
911,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,This is good news! That means many are acquiring natural immunity without dying.

Pag kelangan mo ma admit sa ospital (non covid related) kahit boosted ka pa at wala kang symptoms, kelangan mo pa rin mag pa swab test including yung magbabantay sayo sa kwarto. Pagtapos nun, ang bantay di pwede umuwi or umalis ng ospital baka daw may makuhang covid sa labas, in short parang nasa detention cell ka. Pero yung mga nagtatrabaho sa ospital freely pwedeng umuwi o mamasyal at pumasok sa ospital. Kahit hindi sila i swab test kada pasok sa duty. In short. Do not comply and dont get jabbed.

1030,D7zMgv16cik,"A new study published on the preprint server bioRxiv assesses the antiviral activity of stenoparib against four severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs). This study also focuses on the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant by a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir.

The researchers of the current study also evaluated the inhibitory action of a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir against the Alpha variant. When combined, the drugs acted synergistically and plaque inhibition increased to over 90%

Since stenoparib inhibits a host protein, the antiviral activity of stenoparib should inhibit all variant strains. The current study explored the activity of stenoparib against four SARS-CoV-2 strains including the SARS-CoV-2 67 Germany/BavPat1/2020 wild-type strain (wt), as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma SARS-CoV-2 VOCs"

You'd think it's a very important number to show the people if they want to continue to push the vaccine to people, no? But I guess it's not an important number because it's probably either majority of cases are vaccinated, or insignificant number of un-vaccinated cases ( because most are staying at home anyway)."

1145,Y-xQtgvNuvA,I'm Filipino and I hope we flatten the curve of covid 19 soon. Let's keep safe Indonesian cousins.
1146,Y-xQtgvNuvA,"I‚Äôm scared, I‚Äôm living in Indonesia

Edit: Thank you all for wishing us to be safe! Stay safe and healthy from the üáÆüá©"
1147,Y-xQtgvNuvA,"In Indonesia, no body talks about covid anymore. No one even remember how much the number now."
1148,Y-xQtgvNuvA,"I love both countries; they've been my home intermittently. Let's continue to pray and be hopeful that things will eventually go well if not soon then later.This virus isn't here to stay. This, too, shall pass. Fighting."
1149,Y-xQtgvNuvA,Philippines and indonesia are brothers. Let's help each others
1150,Y-xQtgvNuvA,"Huh? We already forgot having such high cases, we pretend to live like there's no covid-19. It's completely normal"
1151,Y-xQtgvNuvA,This is so sadüòî lets pray for the both countries.üôèüôèüôè
1152,Y-xQtgvNuvA,As the video said Philippines have a high number of cases in Southeast Asia becasue they have more COVID-19 test.
1153,Y-xQtgvNuvA,"In the Philippines, mandatory faceshields and facemask are required everytime you go to public places like malls, and public transport.. this helps to flatter the infection rates. From 6k daily last 2 months, now we have 1kplus to 2k cases per day.. i guess it works.."
1154,Y-xQtgvNuvA,"Considering how there was no proper testing in Indonesia, it should always have been the first, not the Phils. Just look at the death rates."
1155,lw0rcwYyiwE,"I remember my relative used to say "" When your government say do not panic, it means it's the perfect time to panic"" üòÇ"
1156,lw0rcwYyiwE,"I'm a little confused. He arrived March, which was 7 months ago. What does that have to do with the variant? Does he have it NOW or did he have it THEN when he arrived? If he's only had it now, are you suggesting that he couldn't have gotten it here (unless it mutated by itself inside him) and that it incubated for 7 months??"
1157,lw0rcwYyiwE,Follow minimum health standards pero yung mga namumuno mismo sa LGU hindi nasusunod yung protocol kitang kita sa video netong report na to. Complacent na rin karamihan ng pinoy. Goodluck sa Pilipinas
1158,lw0rcwYyiwE,This variant is from another universe fo sure. Multiverse of Madness is getting real. üò≠‚úåüèª
1159,lw0rcwYyiwE,VARIANT XZY IS NEXT PLEASE LOCK UP THE POLITICIANS
1160,lw0rcwYyiwE,"Next variant would be Alpha/Omega 
Next is XXX
Next is B1 B2 
Next is C2 Gin"
1161,lw0rcwYyiwE,"Just when we returned to pre-delta surge levels, a new one just comes in"
1162,lw0rcwYyiwE,"No one is panicking, everyone are pissed at your lies DOH!"
1163,lw0rcwYyiwE,The cinema industry is sweating
1164,lw0rcwYyiwE,"sasabihin nanamn ng DOH ""DOn't panic kino contol namin ang sitwasyun""
after a days bilgla na pala dadami"

1175,-gFQBxmwogE,"People aren't staying home.

Arrogant households violating guidelines and anti-hoarding regulations by bringing multiple household members and checking out multiple carts.

Security guards not enforcing 1 person per household quarantine carding.

PNP and Military check points no longer checking cars and pedestrians for credentials.

This is why cases are steadily growing."
1176,-gFQBxmwogE,"At least maaga na announce para makaprepare. Sigh, sana mamonitor na talaga kung nabibigyan tulong ang mga may kailangan. At this rate kung madami na ang social unrest, baka isang system na 1 linggo na may pasok: 2 linggo wala for the next months ay baka maging compromise. Posibleng effective pero mahaba at baka mas mahirap din sa ekonomiya long term.


So please sana maging efficient ang executive branch. From transparency sa president, to good coordination from the governors and mayors, to the barangay officials na nabibigay talaga ang kailangan, di magwowork ang ECQ kung di mapakali na lumabas ang mga tao. Walang patong sa mga goods sa panahong ito. Praktikal lang, kasi pwede naman nilang gawin next time, I mean, mas madaming buhay mas madaming botante hehe."
1177,-gFQBxmwogE,"Magpasalamat pa rin tayo kasi sa ibang bansa like Venezuela üáªüá™, napakalaki ng problema nila doon economic collapse + hyperinflation + COVID-19. At least I thank still the government for putting so much effort on the problem."
1178,-gFQBxmwogE,Numbers always go up once you actually begin to test people.
1179,-gFQBxmwogE,Total lockdown po ba ito??
1180,-gFQBxmwogE,when cases still scale up...hope for the best but expect the worst!
1181,-gFQBxmwogE,"At midnight of June 9 last year, a Chinese fishing vessel rammed and sank a wooden Filipino fishing boat, the F/B Gem-Ver 1, anchored in Recto Bank (Reed Bank). After the collision, the Chinese vessel turned off its signal lights and sailed away as the Filipino boat sank.
The 22 Filipino fishermen, abandoned in the water for hours, were rescued by a Vietnamese vessel.
