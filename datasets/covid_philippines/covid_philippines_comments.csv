0,aLZ85hb4wjE,Loved the calmness of Manilla.
1,aLZ85hb4wjE,"The lockdown makes the city look like a place I want to explore.

Before the lockdown, it looked like a crowded mess filled with traffic and pollution."
2,aLZ85hb4wjE,India also same
3,aLZ85hb4wjE,"After this pandemic I think every country should have a lockdown every month to give mother nature a time to heal, with all the pollution that the earth is experiencing."
4,aLZ85hb4wjE,manila looks beautifull with less people
5,aLZ85hb4wjE,The president promised that he'll do his best to ease the traffic in the metro like 5mins of travel along EDSA. Fortunately it happened but unfortunately it wasn't in the ideal way. Nature's sense of humor tho.
6,aLZ85hb4wjE,"I went up the viewing spot at antipolo, its a very beautiful, almost smog free view of the metro skyline"
7,aLZ85hb4wjE,The sad part is people around the world did not intend to heal earth but afraid of death.
8,aLZ85hb4wjE,i hope it stays like this forever its beautiful with no messy people
9,aLZ85hb4wjE,2020 is the year when nature fight back and reduce human emission dramatically.

16,DWxIvQlpJK8,Nakakamiss si tatay digs
17,DWxIvQlpJK8,Let us remember that the reason why we had such high numbers or had COVID AT ALL was because this guy was afraid of hurting China's feelings by imposing a travel ban on them.
18,DWxIvQlpJK8,"Nakakamis un lock down, nakakamis un puro boses ni tatay digong inaabangan ng mga tao during lockdown. It means, lahat ng tao, nakaagapay s desisyon ni tatay digong, salute talaga kay fprrd dahil sya ang pres during pandemic."

40,lw16DeB6zns,"To people asking why is there a discussion about South Africa, please back to 2:29. The reporter CLEARLY says ""We will now EXPAND this discussion..."" Meaning the topic will also be discussed using other countries' experiences. Philippines was just the main feature or example. It's NOT clickbait. And there's nothing wrong with the editing. Hope this helped :)"
41,lw16DeB6zns,Great insightful report from the reporter.
42,lw16DeB6zns,"They switched because they want to put the philippines as a title because they know they will get more views if the title has the word ""philippines"" on it"
43,lw16DeB6zns,Complete Lockdown is not a solution. Government must try smart lockdown and allow those people who are earning on daily bases. May Allah bless all the people Ameen
44,lw16DeB6zns,Philippines and then South Africa?
45,lw16DeB6zns,"Tthis was really confusing, plss fix ur news well next time,..."
46,lw16DeB6zns,its kinda cute to read angry Pinoy comments
47,lw16DeB6zns,Huh why South Africa? This was regarding the Philippines..the interview is irrelevant
48,lw16DeB6zns,Philippines shouldn't use lockdown...because many of them earn daily not monthly
49,lw16DeB6zns,"How this news jump from the Philippines and now goes to South Africa? I am confused and the hashtags are from the Philippines, i just want to make this news clear at all."
50,nTUWK8vufOk,"As a Filipino student, online class is frustrating because our internet here sucks."
51,nTUWK8vufOk,I hope the family was paid for being interviewed. They need support more than ever.
52,nTUWK8vufOk,nothing is more heartbreaking than children forced to grow up before there time...
53,nTUWK8vufOk,"As a teacher in Malaysia I feel for these anak- anak . Be strong and be safe ,only education can change your life and your family , Praying for success from Malaysia ."
54,nTUWK8vufOk,"I was in the Philippines on a mission trip when Covid hit. After I was home in the US with my family, the worry I felt for the kids I'd met there was overwhelming. May God bless the Filipino peopleüíô"
55,nTUWK8vufOk,"The problem in the Philippines is that there are many less privileged, challenged people. The government officials and local government unit can be corrupt and don‚Äôt do their assigned jobs properly(not saying all of them but some or maybe most of them). The less privileged people and some teens just makes more babies and say having an accidental baby is a ‚Äúblessing‚Äù. It is only a blessing if it was planned and both couple/parents are ready to have their own family. That is why many people are suffering from poverty because many people do not plan making their family. Then they blame everything to the government and if there are people doing better than them they want to pull others down. #crabmentality ü¶Ä I feel sorry for the challenged people but some of the people just make their own problems.

Didn‚Äôt comment here to debate. Just giving my opinion ‚úåüèª"
56,nTUWK8vufOk,Ah bless jonathan he is so determined while my niece in the philippines her parents send her to a private school provided everything and now she did not finish school what a spoilt brat. I wish jonathan finish a degree someday he deserve to be help
57,nTUWK8vufOk,"I am so glad that they also tackled the mental health of the youth right now. It is also one of the worst problems that the youth of the Philippines can experience. I know a lot of people in my classmates who suffer from depression, that is why, we must take actions to fight and solve this problem."
58,nTUWK8vufOk,I want to sponsor Johnathan and help him finish school.
59,nTUWK8vufOk,I'm here out of curiosity if they include how there are so many errors/incomplete in the modules given to students for online study. It's like it never even went to proofreading before it was released. Even our senate wants an investigation on this matter. How can we have internationally competitive students if the materials provided to them has so many errors.
60,cPVE7QGS7As,"Just because our neighbour Filipina increase their covid test testing does not mean they are the worst in South East Asia. For me I admire that they try to save their people the best they can and honest with the figure too. Better than countries who have huge problem with covid, denying that they have the problem. Sending our thought and prayer to Filipina people..from Malaysia. Keep fighting spirit alive. May god protect you all."
61,cPVE7QGS7As,"Stay strong, my Filipino mates, this too shall pass"
62,cPVE7QGS7As,"Please be safe you all there. 
Well wish from Malaysia."
63,cPVE7QGS7As,"We are with you Philippines. 
Stay strong and resilient!!!
Until we meet again."
64,cPVE7QGS7As,Every country is facing the same problems
65,cPVE7QGS7As,I hope Filipino people be safe and overcome this happening. from South Korea.
66,cPVE7QGS7As,"Filipinos are very friendly, hopefully they can get this under control"
67,cPVE7QGS7As,hi can i use this vid for educational purposes? it's for a school project. won't be posted in yt again
68,cPVE7QGS7As,"Although I agree that no country was spared, I also agree that there are countries who are doing a very good job in combating this pandemic w/o merely relying on a vaccine. PHILIPPINES is not that country. We are mismanaged."

71,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"The poor gets poorer and the rich gets richer, that's how our country works... Even our farmers is not paid fairly..."
72,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"I became a Housemaid at the age of 13, so I can go to high school at night.  My parents had 9 children. I‚Äôve experienced nothing but poverty in my childhood.  It was harder for us, the older children. I wondered, even at 4 years old, why children are considered as ‚Äúblessings‚Äù, when we were all SUFFERING.  
There was no Pandemic in those days, but POVERTY was crippling us."
73,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,I was born and raised in Cebu Philippines in one of those slums. I have lived in Florida for 15 yrs now and I am so grateful to be able to help my family during these tough times. I bought my mom a duplex out in the country in 2016 so She is no longer living in the slums. It still feels like yesterday when we had to pawn Our clothes so we can buy food. I will never forget where I came from and will always be grateful for the blessings that come my way üôè
74,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"10 children and 13 grandchildren. Sometimes you can influence how you live your life. We are a poor family too, but our lives are much better than a family with 10 children and 13 grandkids."
75,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"Even without the pandemic.. many of Filipinos have been starving, and  unemployed. They also said here that ""Hindi kami natakot mamatay sa COVID, takot kami na mamatay sa gutom"" ""Walang nakakagmot sa gutom, patay ka."" and I think that's the most painful statements i heard in this video. Many filipinos experienced hunger amid the lockdown. In fact, the hunger incidence rate is at its highest in 6 years according to the social weather station. I can say that Filipinos don't easily give up in the situation and they are still helping through good and bad times."
76,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"I work 12 to 13 hours a day at minimum. Sometimes I feel like complaining  but after watching this, somehow I feel grateful to have kept my job and be able to take care of my family."
77,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"Even without the pandemic.. many of Filipinos have been starving, and  unemployed"
78,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,Dont be ashamed any of you.  This is not your fault.  Keep fighting to stay alive and.never give up hope no matter what you have to do.  CANADA is with you.
79,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"As someone who is privileged enough, these are the stories most of the government officials, middle and upper class Filipinos should see to realize what's really happening when we allow poor priority/decisions and poor politics plague our land. Let us have the initiative to help, both the government and the people together from making this our ""new normal"" üôè"

116,587N9bJ5J5k,"If you look at the lower income quarters, a lot of these settlements have significant overcrowding and unacceptable environmental hygiene; it just adds to the spread and these environments are a breeding ground for disease.  The situation is very similar to the Brazilian Favelas.  Many of their outdoor marketplaces are also a breeding ground for disease without proper safe food storage.

139,8dTelszbObM,There's always that one person that hides there sickness and risk a whole world.
140,8dTelszbObM,This sounds serious. Hope they get it under control.
141,8dTelszbObM,"My wife is from mainland China. Her friends are from mainland China. We live in California. My wife and her friends are stand away from places they regularly go to that gave large numbers of Chinese. Classes in the evenings and weekends that have mostly Chinese students have less people showing up. Masks are sold out everywhere. Groups on WeChat are coordinating mask purchases from whatever places they find them online, even if expensive. 

I‚Äôm not as concerned but am respecting her wishes, I don‚Äôt want to cause her extra stress. 

The fear is real. 

You may think it unjustified but it‚Äôs not just people who aren‚Äôt Asian keeping their distance. Sure, some people are being idiots, especially those making comments around Asian people buy calling people racist and xenophobic doesn‚Äôt help. 

Do what you think is right for your family. Don‚Äôt let people shame you into not protecting yourself. 

At some point I expect someone to say something to my daughter who is mixed but looks Chinese but I‚Äôve just told her people are scared and when people are scared they sometimes say mean things. It‚Äôs not as if she hasn‚Äôt heard Chinese people say racist things about other cultures. 

I make sure she knows racism exists and isn‚Äôt acceptable. 

To date she gets far more abuse from other Chinese because her Chinese isn‚Äôt as good as others. She has been bullied by people from South America in the past. 

To date, she has never told me about being bullied by westerners, she just gets the occasional mean comment which young girls seem to make to each other. 

Racists and mean people come from all races and religions. I‚Äôve heard from the local Chinese community things like Mexicans are stupid, black people are scary, various things about Japanese so let‚Äôs not pretend many complaining about racism may also be racist, although they may not see it that way."

193,SEHcakm-fAc,"ADVICE: If you have covid and is having a hard time breathing. Do a ""Belly Breathing"" - the most efficient way to breathe (you can search it up online). This is exactly what I did when I was slowly losing air to breathe. I was having a hard time inhaling through my nose so I used my mouth. Your belly should come outward as you take in air. As you exhale, your stomach will come back in. If it's hard to breathe through your nose then use your mouth. If this makes your mouth dry then try to have a glass of water and maybe a little bucket beside you where you can rinse your mouth from time to time. If it's hard to breathe when you lay down then just sit. You need to practice until your body gets use to it. Put your hand in your stomach so you can monitor your breathing. ( I tried the one where you hold your breath for a couple of times and cough at the last try but it didn't work for me. It made it even more hard for me to breathe.)"
194,SEHcakm-fAc,"Success is dependent on the action or steps you take to achieve it. Show me a man who doesn't have an investment and I will tell you how soon he'll go broke.

217,Fd3HcncV6Zk,Well at least Dutarte has treated this as a health problem & didn't decide as with the Health Problem of drug abuse to just Cure anyone involved with a Bullet & not a Magic one just a plain old Bullet they still Die though & has it helped with the drug problem or pushed it further underground & made dealers etc more prone to carry weapons?
218,1psSvU1km0I,"As a foreigner who have lived in Ph for 4 years, I observe that: Wealth gap is a big problem in the Philippines; Many Filipinos have low income while the price of everything is too high."
219,1psSvU1km0I,Family planning is one of the main key to prevent poverty.
220,1psSvU1km0I,I'm from Phillipines neighbouring country. Seeing many Filipinos living in poverty makes me sad. Many Filipinos come to our country to get a better life but sadly our government cannot do anything about them since they are taking care of their own people. I hope Phillipines poverty rate may drop
221,1psSvU1km0I,The irony is that those in the poverty are the one who lacks family planning. You‚Äôll notice they are the one with the huge family members.
222,1psSvU1km0I,"As a Filipino myself. One of the weakest spots of my countrymen is that we are guilible, easily manipulated and are being exploited due to lack of education. Poverty is the driving force of these corruptions because they can control the poor by providing aid to them with malicious intent. Disinformation tru social media has led to many people electing skewed and incompetent politicians. As a result, it cascaded into substandard solutions and short term provisions which aggravated the poor even more. 

EDUCATION is a lengthy investment but I believe it will put an end to the never ending cycle of ignorance and the people being exploited by it."
223,1psSvU1km0I,its so hard too find jobs now in the PH... I'm Bachelor's degree holder and have different skill experience in many aspects but still they hire there relatives and friends in the company even they are not fully qualified instead of the one who is qualified...
224,1psSvU1km0I,"It‚Äôs not just a lack of family planning‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs a matter of *communication barrier* between the educated and those in poverty. We have different values, different ideals, different ways of speaking.
And WE ALWAYS FORGET THAT.

Say if I‚Äôm poor, I wouldn‚Äôt understanding family planning words like lower costs, investments, regulations, etc.
Tell me instead that ‚ÄúHaving kids is like raising utang,‚Äù THEN I‚ÄôLL UNDERSTAND. (Could use some work though)
It makes me sad that it took me years to understand this‚Ä¶
And it makes me sadder that the government and people are not fully aware of this‚Ä¶"
225,1psSvU1km0I,A bachelors degree is not even enough to get a huge pay in the philippines. How much more the people who cant afford education and just finding jobs to survive.
226,1psSvU1km0I,Praying that the Philippines can overcome many of its problem and become a country of just for rich and for poor someday.
227,1psSvU1km0I,The Philippines has a lot of potential if the right decisions are made.

256,PP3Yu-ro1tA,Nothing to worry about this figure for as long as no case of death happen to any vaccinated individuals. I am just wondering why government is so alarmed by this development of covid cases! Would you now suggest again for another kind of vaccine at the expense of government money so politicians and profit oriented individuals  could amass more wealth?
257,PP3Yu-ro1tA,What is the survival rate?
258,PP3Yu-ro1tA,Declare alert level 4 before it gets worst. This omicron variant has exceeded the delta variant and spreading like wildfire. Limit people movement and declare lock downs in places where incidence are high. Learn from what happened before and make drastic and decisive actions before it spreads further
259,PP3Yu-ro1tA,Marami nagka cases sa metro Manila ay mga vaccinated kasi 90% fully vaccinated nila. Pag 52% positivity rate nila ibig sabihin halos karamihan nagka covid ay bakunado. So sila ang nagpa laganap ng virus sa metro Manila mga bakunado. Dapat cla ang huwag palabasin kasi sila ang carrier.

They never solved the problems on their own. This is sad, because now, their math level is like the level of a grade 2 student. It is unfortunate that there is no way to place a check system wherein the teacher can find out if they are finding the answers elsewhere. Hence, it takes them a long time to answer each question."

281,o1kPskxFkQ8,"Wag nang magsisihan, lahat tayo ay responsible  sa bawat isa. Hindi natin ito ginusto. May mga tao kasi na irresponsible  na hindi naka mask sa public places o sa kalsada. At sigurado yung hindi naka mask yung ang pinagmumulan ng virus. At hindi hinuhuli ng mga itinalagang magbantay. Sa loob ng mga baranggay pabaya sila. Dapat paglabas pa lang ng bahay ay hulihin na ang hindi naka mask.  Kaso hindi ginagawa. Kayat kahit anong stricto magpatupad sa mga main  roads kung sa loob ng barangay ay pabaya, useless din ang mga efforts ng gobyerno. Marami talaga matitigas ang ulo."
282,o1kPskxFkQ8,"They say, health is our wealth.
But how it'll become our wealth if we don't have proper self discipline?
Come to think of it, they implemented a two-week ECQ in mega manila, yes it was a big help to prevent the wide spread of the virus, for a while. But then, after the ECQ, kanya-kanya na naman tayong labas ng bahay and worst may gumagala pa, even though hindi naman reasonable or valid  yung dahilan natin. And here comes us criticizing the government on what should they do about the issue, when it is clearly evident that we also have faults and lapses. Also, the government should always need to hear the voices of those frontliners, especially the medical professionals and staffs, because they're the ones who know what and how to prevent and avoid the wide spread of the virus. 

Just to be clear, I'm just being neutral about the issue and I just want to express my opinion. Respect is all that matters. This is for educational purpose only, and its not really in my nature to talks anything about politics. 

P.s. if you want to advice me or something, I am open for it. Have a nice day! üôÇ"
283,o1kPskxFkQ8,How are covid19 patients counted if hospitals are unwilling to accept suspected patients with covid? As my mother and I experienced where we toured the entire Gen. Trias until we get to the Manila Hospital where she is also not admitted without even passing the swab test.
284,o1kPskxFkQ8,I think the thumbnail is incorrect based on what he wants to imply.  Just saying.
285,o1kPskxFkQ8,"I may say that some people have  biased reasoning. While government officials are not experts on the pandemic, they are doing their best. Maybe not all, but most. Well, maybe not most, maybe some of them.  Regardless. They may not cover every facet of the strategic planning but people should also understand that it is also primarily a measure of each person's discipline.  Everyone is given a mind to think and the right to choose to do what's best for ourselves. Why blame all to the government when people are not doing their best to protect themselves? Government officials are humans, too.  They make mistakes, they get hurt, too. They get sick, they  get scared, too! They are not perfect, well so do we. Instead of blaming the government, why not do something to help them when it comes to the decisions they are making? We can start by reaching out. They have channels to do such. Why not help the government by helping others, too? At the end of the day, we should help each other instead of pulling others down by shooting their flaws or imperfections. Because believe it or not, everything gets better when we work together. So when do you plan to start? When do you plan to contribute for the good of your fellowmen?"
286,o1kPskxFkQ8,"There are a lot of things don't ad up here. In the last 5 months we have had just under 2000 deaths (an average of 400 per month), yet DOH figures show that in a normal year, before Covid, there are approximately 47,000 deaths per month from other causes, so why is it that the system cannot cope with a 1% rise in deaths. Is it incompetence, poor management and just plain panic, just as it is in other countries?"

‚ÄúO Lord, hear my plea for justice. Listen to my cry for help. Pay attention to my prayer, for it comes from honest lips. Declare me innocent, for you see those who do right. You have tested my thoughts and examined my heart in the night. You have scrutinized me and found nothing wrong. I am determined not to sin in what I say. I have followed your commands, which keep me from following cruel and evil people. My steps have stayed on your path; I have not wavered from following you.

By your mighty power you rescue those who seek refuge from their enemies. Guard me as you would guard your own eyes. Hide me in the shadow of your wings. Protect me from wicked people who attack me, from murderous enemies who surround me. They are without pity. Listen to their boasting! They track me down and surround me, watching for the chance to throw me to the ground. They are like hungry lions, eager to tear me apart‚Äî like young lions hiding in ambush. Arise, O Lord! Stand against them, and bring them to their knees! Rescue me from the wicked with your sword! By the power of your hand, O Lord, destroy those who look to this world for their reward.

349,xV1oR-RbOGU,"The Philippine government should be wise enough not to depend too much on China for COVID vaccines as the country does not have a good reputation for its clinical trials.  Even Brazil stopped the clinical trials of the CoronaVac produced by SinoVac Biotech on its people due to various serious side effects.

462,57wz3HuIVLA,"The person you interviewed was not giving an accurate story as it pertained to the vaccination rollout. The slow rollout is due to vaccine scarcity in the global supply (note that the country does not have any vaccine production, so all its vaccine supply is imported), and not on the lack of manpower or resource to open new vaccination centers, as indicated by your resource person. The huge droves of people that gathered to get vaccinated was observed only in some areas of the country where the local governments allowed people to show up without pre-registering, and that resulted in chaos."
463,57wz3HuIVLA,It could have been better had they also interviewed someone from the other side of the story. What the journalist said were all true but the picture he is painting is not reflective of the general situation in the Philippines as a whole.

Yung mga ofw galing Wuhan, ang tanong ko ay kinuhanan ba sila ng tests? Or kinuwarrantine lang sila ng 14 days? kapag may symptoms dun lang sila ite-test? at dahil wala naman symptoms ay pinakawalan na sila after 14 days. What if beyond 14 days lumabas ang symptoms??

     If I may recall the video in March of this year of Naftali Bennett, the Defense Minister of Israel, that video stated that the people, the senior citizens are safe to get out of quarantine once  the immunity of the community reaches to 60 percent or better.  Thus, it is safe to say that the Defense Minister is correct.
     For now, social distancing and wearing of face masks etc are observed while there is no vaccine yet."

I do not know if this order is still currently in effect. That a secondary pig shot/vaccine could be administered usually is given to swine. My prayers are with you.

719,pK6y1h0YgSU,It's really amazing how people who have the least are the ones who share the most.
720,pK6y1h0YgSU,These people have less but still willing to share....and on other side people want more and more....
721,pK6y1h0YgSU,I was in the US Navy. I remember the raining season of. The Philippines. Beautiful country!
722,pK6y1h0YgSU,Lucky for him he wasn't stranded in USA because the Americans are not so generous and friendly as the Filipinos

728,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,"No need to hype on irrelevant data - always focus on daily reports on new cases, number of asymptomatic, number of recoveries and deaths since its more significant data for us."
729,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,congrats for reaching 2million what a great milestone we had
730,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,How many people died? How many people recovered? Those are the important numbers. Just giving a tally of total cases so far is just fear mongering for clicks and views.
731,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,"ADVICE: If you have covid and is having a hard time breathing. Do a ""Belly Breathing"" - the most efficient way to breathe (you can search it up online). This is exactly what I did when I was slowly losing air to breathe. I was having a hard time inhaling through my nose so I used my mouth. Your belly should come outward as you take in air. As you exhale, your stomach will come back in. If it's hard to breathe through your nose then use your mouth. If this makes your mouth dry then try to have a glass of water and maybe a little bucket beside you where you can rinse your mouth from time to time. If it's hard to breathe when you lay down then just sit. You need to practice until your body gets use to it. Put your hand in your stomach so you can monitor your breathing. ( I tried the one where you hold your breath for a couple of times and cough at the last try but it didn't work for me. It made it even more hard for me to breathe.)"
732,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,"Pls Note: 1,840,294 ""Recovered"" of 2 Million Cases. Thanks. ... Stay clean & healthy 24/7 :)"
733,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Keep safe everyone. Sumunod sa mga patakaran na ipinatutupad.
734,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,This is good news! That means many are acquiring natural immunity without dying.
735,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Woooh go on! Record Holder! Go Philippines!
736,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Given that covid-19 especially the delta variant is highly contagious as per CDC's. 2M is 2% of our population and thankfully I lot have recovered. I remember Germany's Merkel mentioned in her speech last year that they'd expect 70% of their population being infected as per expert's data. We are nowhere as rich as Germany but 2% is considered low basing on experts data.
737,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Dapat Kung magbalita kau hwag nyo na isama ung nakarecovered na ung active case s na lng ung severe at mild cases
738,81Fj00CFmJM,"The leaders in the Phillippines should consider the efficacy of the following vaccines before they roll them out into the public:  Pfizer-BioNTech 95%, AstraZeneca 90%, Moderna 89%, Sinopharm 79%, and Sinovac 50.38%.  The promotion on the type of vaccines should be based on effectiveness and safety to the Filipino people, instead of political considerations or preferences.  Just my suggestion."

885,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,How many people died? How many people recovered? Those are the important numbers. Just giving a tally of total cases so far is just fear mongering for clicks and views.
886,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,"ADVICE: If you have covid and is having a hard time breathing. Do a ""Belly Breathing"" - the most efficient way to breathe (you can search it up online). This is exactly what I did when I was slowly losing air to breathe. I was having a hard time inhaling through my nose so I used my mouth. Your belly should come outward as you take in air. As you exhale, your stomach will come back in. If it's hard to breathe through your nose then use your mouth. If this makes your mouth dry then try to have a glass of water and maybe a little bucket beside you where you can rinse your mouth from time to time. If it's hard to breathe when you lay down then just sit. You need to practice until your body gets use to it. Put your hand in your stomach so you can monitor your breathing. ( I tried the one where you hold your breath for a couple of times and cough at the last try but it didn't work for me. It made it even more hard for me to breathe.)"

891,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Given that covid-19 especially the delta variant is highly contagious as per CDC's. 2M is 2% of our population and thankfully I lot have recovered. I remember Germany's Merkel mentioned in her speech last year that they'd expect 70% of their population being infected as per expert's data. We are nowhere as rich as Germany but 2% is considered low basing on experts data.

996,D7zMgv16cik,"A new study published on the preprint server bioRxiv assesses the antiviral activity of stenoparib against four severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs). This study also focuses on the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant by a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir.

The researchers of the current study also evaluated the inhibitory action of a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir against the Alpha variant. When combined, the drugs acted synergistically and plaque inhibition increased to over 90%

Since stenoparib inhibits a host protein, the antiviral activity of stenoparib should inhibit all variant strains. The current study explored the activity of stenoparib against four SARS-CoV-2 strains including the SARS-CoV-2 67 Germany/BavPat1/2020 wild-type strain (wt), as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma SARS-CoV-2 VOCs"

You'd think it's a very important number to show the people if they want to continue to push the vaccine to people, no?

The Philippines has only 6.3% unemployment rate - one of the lowest in Asia.  What we need is to lower the cost of living which means we need to lower costs in food, energy and housing.  But of course this is something Leni cannot address since most of her financers are those who monopolize these industries."

Imbis na puro community quarantine ang puro ginagawa nyo tapos mamimigay ng milyong milyong ayuda. Yung mga  ayuda na binibigay bakit hindi nyo idagdag na lang gamitin ang pera sa pagpapalakas ng health care system dito sa pinas, magtayo ng facilties na kaya ang hundreds to thousands na covid patient. Ibigay sa mga health care workers ang pangangailangan nila. Dagdagan ang pagbili ng bakuna. Hindi yung pinapataba nyo lang ang bulsa nyo samantalang milyon na tao ang nagdudusa."

Moreover is it not that this, the people's right to be informed about the things happening around them, does this hinge on the Constitutional Right to Information Access and Media?

1193,aw59h2FNMIQ,Why is Russia going to conduct the clinical trial of its vaccine in the Philippines first? Why don't they do it first to their Russian citizens? And why the Philippine government is going to allow it here first?

1199,aw59h2FNMIQ,FDA of the Philippines how do you think about this?
1200,aw59h2FNMIQ,not a wise decision considering how silent Russia has been through the vaccine development process! Duterte's opportunistic approach may prove fatal
1201,aw59h2FNMIQ,Philippines authority should consider Russian vaccine carefully. I watched a video clip of an American doctor and he says he doesn't question Russian vaccine validity but he questions why Russia refuses to provide scientific data of the third stage test to international organization to confirm.
1202,GUVKWAEO_hY,"here in PH, they are fast in administering vaccines but only while supply last. especially in the provinces, it takes weeks before a new batch of vaccines arrive. How can they administer vaccines if there is no supply."
1203,GUVKWAEO_hY,You will get vaccinated here in the Philippines when you get registered on local government sites. Some places in the Philippines allow people to walk in and get vaccinated as long as they have registered online. It also depends on your local government or City.
1204,GUVKWAEO_hY,"28:39 where the deck did you get that information from?? In Indonesia health workers and elderly are first and second priority to get vaccine hence why my dad  could get one in early March.
39:19 did you say fifty or fifteen?"
1205,GUVKWAEO_hY,"The Filipina interviewee‚Äôs fear on general public being left behind is not true. The vaccines of the private companies have not come in yet (not that we know of), and the poor sector are being vaccinated now through the government‚Äôs procurement and donations. They‚Äôre not last to be vaccinated. Admittedly last to be vaccinated are those from far-flung provinces but they are not in immediate danger of the pandemic."
1206,GUVKWAEO_hY,3rd world problem and the fact were both extremely populated countries. Godbless brothers and sisters in the Philippines and Indonesia. But same form of government there‚Äôs too much beaurucracy that complicates the management. We can get over this! üáÆüá©üáµüá≠
1207,GUVKWAEO_hY,"Philippines have been ramping up vaccination nowadays amidst the threat of delta variant. Schedule for vaccination has been consistent but people such as front liners, senior citizens and with pre-existing health conditions are given much priority. I just hope that we would have enough vaccines to give to all population since we need this so much to go back to our normal lives."
1208,GUVKWAEO_hY,"I personally think that it's good that countries in southeast asia are having several vaccines option.
Here in Japan we only have either Pfizer or Moderna. That's all."
1209,GUVKWAEO_hY,PH vaccination process in local government are fast enough however the Supply is Erratic why lines are always building up.. Vaccination centers sometimes finished the allotted jabs for the day by lunchtime..
1210,GUVKWAEO_hY,Supply is really the issue since the first vaccines approved in December. The report has shown that private sector will step up to supplement government effort.  But the report failed to probe into why US & G7 did not push big pharma for patent waiver in the midst of a pandemic in order to manufacture more vaccines.
1211,GUVKWAEO_hY,"The good news is Indonesia has pass the covid 19 peak, the overwhelming covid patient in the footage are in bekasi. After i check, the bekasi main public hospital is so small compare to other similar population cities in indonesia like surabaya. Im so surprised when i knew how small it is. This pandemic just open up how bad is indonesia health facility especially in bekasi."

Sabi ko naman Anak hindi tayo pwiding sumuko trust lang tayo kay God. Kami lang dalawa ng anak ko sobrang hirap piro

Humihingi sana ako ng kunting tulong pa subscribe po sa channel ko na kunting mga luto bahay ko kasi yun lang din ang kaya ko. Sabi ng anak ko, Mama  try natin to maawa ang diyos
makatulong sa atin. Hirap po kasi ako maka kuha ng mga subscriber kasi kunti lang friends namin sa facebook at relatives. Malaking tulong napo talaga sa amin kung 
mamonetize ang youtube channel ko sa tulong ninyo. May 23 plus napo subscriber ko sa channel.

1381,nO6ieff7WAA,Who is here watching after Indonesia overtook Philippines again?
1382,nO6ieff7WAA,"I think it was to be expected as the capital city is very densely populated. Because they are testing thousands by the day, they will have more confirm cases. The advantage to more testing is they can isolate and treat the active cases and trace slowly but surely as many possible infections so to help treat them. I would rather know how bad the infection is than not knowing that the virus is all over the place. At least they are transparent. The active cases should be the focus."
1383,nO6ieff7WAA,It's not a competition ffs
1384,nO6ieff7WAA,It's not the time to compete who is more and less.  Lets win this battle together to save more life.
1385,nO6ieff7WAA,"Indonesia is composed of thousands of islands, in most islands, there is no need to do a lot of testing because there are little cases there. But in the hotspots like in Jakarta and Surabaya, more than 20% of the city's total population are being tested for the virus. So it may seem like Indonesia barely does tests, but remember that Indonesia is composed of thousands of islands. They did well in the number of testing in major COVID 19 hotspots around Indonesia."

Bat ipagpipilitan pa rin na ""walang alternative"" we all know practicing doctors who recommended alternatives kahit na dinedeny sa media."

1465,O5ks3kEx724,Its easier to control people when you put fear in them.
1466,O5ks3kEx724,"kaya tumataas ang kaso ng covid dahil uso ngayon ang trangkaso dahil sa pag iiba ng klima, lalo nangayon na papasok ang taglamig simula september hanggang february ng susunod na taon , at kung nagkaroon ka ng trangkaso ay sabi nilang covid"
