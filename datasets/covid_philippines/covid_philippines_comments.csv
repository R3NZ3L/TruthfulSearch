0,aLZ85hb4wjE,Loved the calmness of Manilla.
1,aLZ85hb4wjE,"After this pandemic I think every country should have a lockdown every month to give mother nature a time to heal, with all the pollution that the earth is experiencing."
2,aLZ85hb4wjE,manila looks beautifull with less people
3,aLZ85hb4wjE,"The lockdown makes the city look like a place I want to explore.

Before the lockdown, it looked like a crowded mess filled with traffic and pollution."
4,aLZ85hb4wjE,India also same
5,aLZ85hb4wjE,The president promised that he'll do his best to ease the traffic in the metro like 5mins of travel along EDSA. Fortunately it happened but unfortunately it wasn't in the ideal way. Nature's sense of humor tho.
6,aLZ85hb4wjE,"I went up the viewing spot at antipolo, its a very beautiful, almost smog free view of the metro skyline"
7,aLZ85hb4wjE,The sad part is people around the world did not intend to heal earth but afraid of death.
8,aLZ85hb4wjE,i hope it stays like this forever its beautiful with no messy people
9,aLZ85hb4wjE,2020 is the year when nature fight back and reduce human emission dramatically.

16,DWxIvQlpJK8,Nakakamiss si tatay digs
17,DWxIvQlpJK8,Let us remember that the reason why we had such high numbers or had COVID AT ALL was because this guy was afraid of hurting China's feelings by imposing a travel ban on them.
18,DWxIvQlpJK8,"Nakakamis un lock down, nakakamis un puro boses ni tatay digong inaabangan ng mga tao during lockdown. It means, lahat ng tao, nakaagapay s desisyon ni tatay digong, salute talaga kay fprrd dahil sya ang pres during pandemic."
19,DWxIvQlpJK8,DUCHEKWA.

30,cPVE7QGS7As,"Just because our neighbour Filipina increase their covid test testing does not mean they are the worst in South East Asia. For me I admire that they try to save their people the best they can and honest with the figure too. Better than countries who have huge problem with covid, denying that they have the problem. Sending our thought and prayer to Filipina people..from Malaysia. Keep fighting spirit alive. May god protect you all."
31,cPVE7QGS7As,"Stay strong, my Filipino mates, this too shall pass"
32,cPVE7QGS7As,"Please be safe you all there. 
Well wish from Malaysia."
33,cPVE7QGS7As,"We are with you Philippines. 
Stay strong and resilient!!!
Until we meet again."
34,cPVE7QGS7As,I hope Filipino people be safe and overcome this happening. from South Korea.
35,cPVE7QGS7As,"Filipinos are very friendly, hopefully they can get this under control"
36,cPVE7QGS7As,Deaths have been low compared to other countries. The economy is the same as other countries reeling from the effects of the pandemic. We do what we can to live and survive through this and build again! We are a resilient and patient people where 4 months in a year we are visited by calamities. We have faith! We pray for this to end soon and I pray for everybody around the world who have lost family in this crisis.
37,cPVE7QGS7As,Every country is facing the same problems
38,cPVE7QGS7As,We are reaching 50k test per day now that's why cases becomes high. What's important is fatality is low and high recoveries.
39,cPVE7QGS7As,hi can i use this vid for educational purposes? it's for a school project. won't be posted in yt again
40,pMUumjHY3tw,Ask lang po san po kaya may avail na booster po sa covid ngaun po.salamat po

42,dIsaz_XlmTw,wow ! GOOD NEWS ! glad we are all safe and there is near zero cases of covid ! 🤗
43,dIsaz_XlmTw,Thanks a Lot/ DOH- Keep all Our Health Well!!!❤😊
44,dIsaz_XlmTw,sa mga nagsasabing 18 cases lang nadetect. ang sinasabi nila naka-detect sila ng 18 cases of JN.1. So sa ibang variants wala tayong balita. pero good news padin. sana mababa lang talaga cases.

53,iOE6rAY8l-k,Vietnamese here I keep philippines in my prayer. Don't give up guys we southeast Asia will win this battle. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
54,iOE6rAY8l-k,"Here in Cebu City Philippines, were exactly in that position like Manila a month ago. Government issued us an ECQ status. Our hospital are at 100% utilizations. It's really a community effort. Many people help fed covid patience.  A week a go were downgraded to GCQ, our hospital are at 45% utilization rate now. We're about to transition to MGCQ an even more lower status. So just hang in there guys, you can do it. Just follow the basic  health protocol. Stay safe, Stay home, Stay healthy and please be obedient.  ✌. For local tourist please go to Cebu it's open all ready. To help the local tourism industry.  Thanks."
55,iOE6rAY8l-k,Beautiful country with so much resources. The people? Not so much
56,iOE6rAY8l-k,Please allow me to use this for academic purposes only. Thank you!
57,iOE6rAY8l-k,"Bakit hindi gamitin ang mga eskuelahan para sa sa temporary Covit 19 facilities, wala namang klase ang mga estudyante."
58,iOE6rAY8l-k,"When people are bored and or looking for sources of income, they can't simply stay at home after 5 long months of waiting. Some don't take this disease seriously anymore after ECQ was  lifted....not properly wearing masks and don't observe physical distancing when law enforcers are not around. What can you expect?"
59,iOE6rAY8l-k,hi can i use this video for my presentation? thank you
60,iOE6rAY8l-k,It's THE Philippines.
61,iOE6rAY8l-k,"pls allow me to use this school purposes only, student. thank you!"

64,Mxf8uGFcqSE,More kupit more money 😂
65,Mxf8uGFcqSE,🥸🥸🥸🥸🥸🥸🥸🥸🥸🥸🥸🥸
66,E5F3xA_zkFc,"Many people were really hungry during the pandemic, they couldn't go to work, there was no salary, there was no way to eat, I cried in this documentary😭😭😭"
67,E5F3xA_zkFc,Very sad and disturbing.  My prayers are with all the people who are hungry and unemployed.
68,E5F3xA_zkFc,What's sad is that these are the same people who still vote for corrupt officials.
69,E5F3xA_zkFc,Very good documentary.
70,E5F3xA_zkFc,"Perfect docu , can't believe it's happening now, feels like it happened 20 yrs ago"
71,E5F3xA_zkFc,This is ridiculous! The country needs to open up to survive.
72,E5F3xA_zkFc,"As a Melbournian in Australia, I will not complain again after this."
73,E5F3xA_zkFc,"""Those who are just starting to get hungry can wait...."""
74,E5F3xA_zkFc,"Thank god i live in a defiant nation, when state ordered businesses to close down, people collectively showed them middle finger."
75,E5F3xA_zkFc,I can't fathom why the rich received any kind of aid.  Corruption is sky high in the Philippines.  May God right the wrong.

77,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"The poor gets poorer and the rich gets richer, that's how our country works... Even our farmers is not paid fairly..."
78,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"I became a Housemaid at the age of 13, so I can go to high school at night.  My parents had 9 children. I’ve experienced nothing but poverty in my childhood.  It was harder for us, the older children. I wondered, even at 4 years old, why children are considered as “blessings”, when we were all SUFFERING.  
There was no Pandemic in those days, but POVERTY was crippling us."
79,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,I was born and raised in Cebu Philippines in one of those slums. I have lived in Florida for 15 yrs now and I am so grateful to be able to help my family during these tough times. I bought my mom a duplex out in the country in 2016 so She is no longer living in the slums. It still feels like yesterday when we had to pawn Our clothes so we can buy food. I will never forget where I came from and will always be grateful for the blessings that come my way 🙏
80,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"10 children and 13 grandchildren. Sometimes you can influence how you live your life. We are a poor family too, but our lives are much better than a family with 10 children and 13 grandkids."
81,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"Even without the pandemic.. many of Filipinos have been starving, and  unemployed. They also said here that ""Hindi kami natakot mamatay sa COVID, takot kami na mamatay sa gutom"" ""Walang nakakagmot sa gutom, patay ka."" and I think that's the most painful statements i heard in this video. Many filipinos experienced hunger amid the lockdown. In fact, the hunger incidence rate is at its highest in 6 years according to the social weather station. I can say that Filipinos don't easily give up in the situation and they are still helping through good and bad times."
82,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"Even without the pandemic.. many of Filipinos have been starving, and  unemployed"
83,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"I work 12 to 13 hours a day at minimum. Sometimes I feel like complaining  but after watching this, somehow I feel grateful to have kept my job and be able to take care of my family."
84,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"As someone who is privileged enough, these are the stories most of the government officials, middle and upper class Filipinos should see to realize what's really happening when we allow poor priority/decisions and poor politics plague our land. Let us have the initiative to help, both the government and the people together from making this our ""new normal"" 🙏"
85,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"That's why Family planning is very important. Don't settle yet if you don't have your own house and stable job. Save money as much as you can, spend it wisely."
86,E56W-5xVOss,"Tandaan mo ang bilin ko: Magpakatatag ka at lakasan mo ang iyong loob. Huwag kang matatakot o mawawalan ng pag-asa sapagkat akong si Yahweh, na iyong Diyos, ay kasama mo saan ka man magpunta.”

87,E56W-5xVOss,God is the best shield to all pilipino... GOD BLESS US ALL... magpakatatag tayo... Wla tayong ibang maasahan kundi ang panginoon lamang ang syang lumikha  satin.... Sya rin ang nagbigay kagandahan dito sa mundong ito... Pag may dumi sya ang mag linis para mapanatiling malinis ang mundong ito..
88,E56W-5xVOss,grabe di ko inexpect magiging ganito ka siryoso ang covid19😭 let us pray para sa health nating lahat...
89,E56W-5xVOss,One day it will disappear! Everything  has an end!  God is Almighty .
90,E56W-5xVOss,"It will all come to pass....

91,E56W-5xVOss,Sabayan lang pagdarasal at tamang kaalaman.
92,E56W-5xVOss,"Di man tayo kasing Hi-tech Gaya NG CHINA at ibang bansa Manalig, Magtiwala at Manalanagin Lang tayo Kay God maliligtas tayo🙏🙏."
93,E56W-5xVOss,"Just remembered the time you cooked for us when we celebrated Christmas inside. You said that you're ""chef"" back then because of the business of your relative (aunt) and you really fond of cooking that's why you've been busy that day cooking the foods that we all agreed upon. And now, you're already do Vlogging here on Youtube. So proud of you Bro! May God bless you always."
94,E56W-5xVOss,Mag pray palagi tayo  God bless you all

126,8dTelszbObM,Coronavirus: Death toll rises to 427: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eavggz1suMY
127,8dTelszbObM,There's always that one person that hides there sickness and risk a whole world.
128,8dTelszbObM,This sounds serious. Hope they get it under control.
129,8dTelszbObM,I hope this Outbreak will come to an end! Be safe Everyone!
130,8dTelszbObM,"0:07 - 20,438 confirmed cases.  How long ago did you film this?"
131,8dTelszbObM,"My wife is from mainland China. Her friends are from mainland China. We live in California. My wife and her friends are stand away from places they regularly go to that gave large numbers of Chinese. Classes in the evenings and weekends that have mostly Chinese students have less people showing up. Masks are sold out everywhere. Groups on WeChat are coordinating mask purchases from whatever places they find them online, even if expensive. 

I’m not as concerned but am respecting her wishes, I don’t want to cause her extra stress. 

The fear is real. 

You may think it unjustified but it’s not just people who aren’t Asian keeping their distance. Sure, some people are being idiots, especially those making comments around Asian people buy calling people racist and xenophobic doesn’t help. 

Do what you think is right for your family. Don’t let people shame you into not protecting yourself. 

At some point I expect someone to say something to my daughter who is mixed but looks Chinese but I’ve just told her people are scared and when people are scared they sometimes say mean things. It’s not as if she hasn’t heard Chinese people say racist things about other cultures. 

I make sure she knows racism exists and isn’t acceptable. 

To date she gets far more abuse from other Chinese because her Chinese isn’t as good as others. She has been bullied by people from South America in the past. 

To date, she has never told me about being bullied by westerners, she just gets the occasional mean comment which young girls seem to make to each other. 

Racists and mean people come from all races and religions. I’ve heard from the local Chinese community things like Mexicans are stupid, black people are scary, various things about Japanese so let’s not pretend many complaining about racism may also be racist, although they may not see it that way."
132,8dTelszbObM,This was like 3 days ago lol
133,8dTelszbObM,"The quarantine didn't start until Jan 23rd. The doctor who recently died at age *34,* reported cases going back to December. This is probably worse than the media is reporting."
134,8dTelszbObM,"You can't blame people for being cautious. Especially now when there's no vaccine, cure, etc. Only thing that helps is separation. It's nothing personal."
135,8dTelszbObM,"one love guys, lets help one another no one to blame"
136,lw16DeB6zns,"To people asking why is there a discussion about South Africa, please back to 2:29. The reporter CLEARLY says ""We will now EXPAND this discussion..."" Meaning the topic will also be discussed using other countries' experiences. Philippines was just the main feature or example. It's NOT clickbait. And there's nothing wrong with the editing. Hope this helped :)"
137,lw16DeB6zns,Great insightful report from the reporter.
138,lw16DeB6zns,"Tthis was really confusing, plss fix ur news well next time,..."
139,lw16DeB6zns,Complete Lockdown is not a solution. Government must try smart lockdown and allow those people who are earning on daily bases. May Allah bless all the people Ameen
140,lw16DeB6zns,Philippines and then South Africa?
141,lw16DeB6zns,"They switched because they want to put the philippines as a title because they know they will get more views if the title has the word ""philippines"" on it"
142,lw16DeB6zns,its kinda cute to read angry Pinoy comments
143,lw16DeB6zns,Huh why South Africa? This was regarding the Philippines..the interview is irrelevant
144,lw16DeB6zns,When u choose a trike driver as president.
145,lw16DeB6zns,I don't watch the video I only find information in comment section😊
146,RhDHGgo4yZg,"Watching this makes me so grateful that I thought it my duty to help. For the past six months, I have been sending money to a family of seven. I am not a rich man but I thought I must do something to help. So I have been sending $125 pcm. I know this will be enough vegetables and rice to see them through. It will save them from starvation."
147,RhDHGgo4yZg,This is so sad and heartbreaking 🥺😢😔
148,RhDHGgo4yZg,This is so sad and to think that I always say I'm starving when I am provided with so much food. I feel ashamed
149,RhDHGgo4yZg,"It's amazing how money literally prevented people from being fed. In the old days, everyone in the tribe would work to feed everyone. Raising animals, growing crops and managing resources responsibly. I think the fact that there are non-profit organizations of volunteers proves that we have this innate desire to collaborate like we did in ancient times."
150,RhDHGgo4yZg,God bless the Philippines 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
151,RhDHGgo4yZg,"This is so heartbreaking, I want to help but I know that I can't"
152,RhDHGgo4yZg,God bless her and her family
153,RhDHGgo4yZg,"This is so heartbreaking, i know the government has its constraints but I still have a good faith in humanity, in the Filipnos, I hope that us who are blessed will be able to adopt a family esp like this mother who has that strong determination to provide for her family but due to this pandemic is unable to. I hope that if you  know someone like them within your reach, or your community, may you make a difference, change lives and fate, please share thy blessings, a small amount could make a good meal.=)"
154,RhDHGgo4yZg,"The Catholic Church should also help the poor since Catholic Church is one of the biggest stock holders and investors of Philippine banking industry, food and beverage industry, mining industry, among others. They owned big expensive hospitals, schools and universities in Philippines. Catholic Church is a trillionaire."
155,RhDHGgo4yZg,"Hi CNA Insider, do you know any legitimate links to donate to the Philippines food crisis?"
156,jEINZXA_ujo,"My Filipino friends, stay strong and stay safe."
157,jEINZXA_ujo,It's over 7100 islands many have no cases it's a smart move
158,jEINZXA_ujo,The Phillipines seem to be more on the ball than the US. Good on ya. Keep it up and good luck.:-)
159,jEINZXA_ujo,Better to act now than later than regret it when it's uncontrollable 😉
160,jEINZXA_ujo,"He is using his brain , the ones that don,t will fade away !"
161,jEINZXA_ujo,I hope my family is okay 🙏🏻
162,jEINZXA_ujo,We Filipinos will support our beloved president...Amping lang kanunay.. Love from Visayas...
163,jEINZXA_ujo,Stay safe!
164,jEINZXA_ujo,"We don't want to be another Italy,our country can't afford to accommodate all.I think this reporter didnt  emphasized a local produced test kits that will be used next week .our local scientist tried their best to invent new test kits for filipinos  ,since one test kits from other countries is very expensive.I salute our presidente for doing the right thing in order not to spread the virus in other neighboring provinces or islands."
165,jEINZXA_ujo,"here in the philippines our houses are just so close to each other, The virus here can spread with ease, it's a good thing president duterte declared the lockdown earlier, we would've been all infected by now if it wasn't for that."
166,587N9bJ5J5k,"If you look at the lower income quarters, a lot of these settlements have significant overcrowding and unacceptable environmental hygiene; it just adds to the spread and these environments are a breeding ground for disease.  The situation is very similar to the Brazilian Favelas.  Many of their outdoor marketplaces are also a breeding ground for disease without proper safe food storage.

Many people in the Philippines can't afford private hospitals and don't have health insurance."
167,587N9bJ5J5k,the philippines still managed NOT  to be like india and indonesia until now despite having the most densed population in the world.. hoping it will not get worse this time 🙏🏽
168,587N9bJ5J5k,God bless you all
169,587N9bJ5J5k,"lockdowns aren't going to deter highly social cultures. At least, not in a way Philippine infrastructure will be able to deal with."
170,587N9bJ5J5k,This is how we build back better.
171,587N9bJ5J5k,God blessed
172,587N9bJ5J5k,Public hospitals in Philippines are risky at best. Full of caring staff but...
173,587N9bJ5J5k,I hope for the people

176,nTUWK8vufOk,"As a Filipino student, online class is frustrating because our internet here sucks."
177,nTUWK8vufOk,I hope the family was paid for being interviewed. They need support more than ever.
178,nTUWK8vufOk,nothing is more heartbreaking than children forced to grow up before there time...
179,nTUWK8vufOk,"As a teacher in Malaysia I feel for these anak- anak . Be strong and be safe ,only education can change your life and your family , Praying for success from Malaysia ."
180,nTUWK8vufOk,"I was in the Philippines on a mission trip when Covid hit. After I was home in the US with my family, the worry I felt for the kids I'd met there was overwhelming. May God bless the Filipino people💙"
181,nTUWK8vufOk,"I am so glad that they also tackled the mental health of the youth right now. It is also one of the worst problems that the youth of the Philippines can experience. I know a lot of people in my classmates who suffer from depression, that is why, we must take actions to fight and solve this problem."
182,nTUWK8vufOk,"The problem in the Philippines is that there are many less privileged, challenged people. The government officials and local government unit can be corrupt and don’t do their assigned jobs properly(not saying all of them but some or maybe most of them). The less privileged people and some teens just makes more babies and say having an accidental baby is a “blessing”. It is only a blessing if it was planned and both couple/parents are ready to have their own family. That is why many people are suffering from poverty because many people do not plan making their family. Then they blame everything to the government and if there are people doing better than them they want to pull others down. #crabmentality 🦀 I feel sorry for the challenged people but some of the people just make their own problems.

Didn’t comment here to debate. Just giving my opinion ✌🏻"
183,nTUWK8vufOk,I'm here out of curiosity if they include how there are so many errors/incomplete in the modules given to students for online study. It's like it never even went to proofreading before it was released. Even our senate wants an investigation on this matter. How can we have internationally competitive students if the materials provided to them has so many errors.
184,nTUWK8vufOk,Ah bless jonathan he is so determined while my niece in the philippines her parents send her to a private school provided everything and now she did not finish school what a spoilt brat. I wish jonathan finish a degree someday he deserve to be help
185,nTUWK8vufOk,I want to sponsor Johnathan and help him finish school.
186,1psSvU1km0I,"As a foreigner who have lived in Ph for 4 years, I observe that: Wealth gap is a big problem in the Philippines; Many Filipinos have low income while the price of everything is too high."
187,1psSvU1km0I,Family planning is one of the main key to prevent poverty.
188,1psSvU1km0I,The irony is that those in the poverty are the one who lacks family planning. You’ll notice they are the one with the huge family members.
189,1psSvU1km0I,I'm from Phillipines neighbouring country. Seeing many Filipinos living in poverty makes me sad. Many Filipinos come to our country to get a better life but sadly our government cannot do anything about them since they are taking care of their own people. I hope Phillipines poverty rate may drop
190,1psSvU1km0I,"filipinos like to laugh about china, now look whos poorer, this world doesn't need people to insult others with their own nationalistic ideas."
191,1psSvU1km0I,"As a Filipino myself. One of the weakest spots of my countrymen is that we are guilible, easily manipulated and are being exploited due to lack of education. Poverty is the driving force of these corruptions because they can control the poor by providing aid to them with malicious intent. Disinformation tru social media has led to many people electing skewed and incompetent politicians. As a result, it cascaded into substandard solutions and short term provisions which aggravated the poor even more. 

EDUCATION is a lengthy investment but I believe it will put an end to the never ending cycle of ignorance and the people being exploited by it."
192,1psSvU1km0I,Praying that the Philippines can overcome many of its problem and become a country of just for rich and for poor someday.
193,1psSvU1km0I,The Philippines has a lot of potential if the right decisions are made.
194,1psSvU1km0I,its so hard too find jobs now in the PH... I'm Bachelor's degree holder and have different skill experience in many aspects but still they hire there relatives and friends in the company even they are not fully qualified instead of the one who is qualified...

214,PP3Yu-ro1tA,Nothing to worry about this figure for as long as no case of death happen to any vaccinated individuals. I am just wondering why government is so alarmed by this development of covid cases! Would you now suggest again for another kind of vaccine at the expense of government money so politicians and profit oriented individuals  could amass more wealth?
215,PP3Yu-ro1tA,Marami nagka cases sa metro Manila ay mga vaccinated kasi 90% fully vaccinated nila. Pag 52% positivity rate nila ibig sabihin halos karamihan nagka covid ay bakunado. So sila ang nagpa laganap ng virus sa metro Manila mga bakunado. Dapat cla ang huwag palabasin kasi sila ang carrier.
216,PP3Yu-ro1tA,Declare alert level 4 before it gets worst. This omicron variant has exceeded the delta variant and spreading like wildfire.

229,SEHcakm-fAc,"Levels of lockdown/quarantine in the Philippines based on how strict it is:
6. EECQ - extreme/extensive enhanced community quarantine
5. ECQ - enhanced community quarantine
        a. LECQ - localized enhanced community quarantine - is only done on small areas of the city.
4. MECQ- modified enhanced community quarantine
3. GCQ - general community quarantine
2. MGCQ - modified general community quarantine
1. New Normal"

231,SEHcakm-fAc,"In other words, we've lost the game when we're almost complete and back to zero."
232,SEHcakm-fAc,Is it timely?
233,SEHcakm-fAc,"ADVICE: If you have covid and is having a hard time breathing. Do a ""Belly Breathing"" - the most efficient way to breathe (you can search it up online). This is exactly what I did when I was slowly losing air to breathe. I was having a hard time inhaling through my nose so I used my mouth. Your belly should come outward as you take in air. As you exhale, your stomach will come back in. If it's hard to breathe through your nose then use your mouth. If this makes your mouth dry then try to have a glass of water and maybe a little bucket beside you where you can rinse your mouth from time to time. If it's hard to breathe when you lay down then just sit. You need to practice until your body gets use to it. Put your hand in your stomach so you can monitor your breathing. ( I tried the one where you hold your breath for a couple of times and cough at the last try but it didn't work for me. It made it even more hard for me to breathe.)"
234,SEHcakm-fAc,"Success is dependent on the action or steps you take to achieve it. Show me a man who doesn't have an investment and I will tell you how soon he'll go broke. Investment is building a safe haven for the future: with the right choice of investment that has at least 1% minimum risk and with an Expert guidance, profit and interest should be 💯 guaranteed."

“O Lord, hear my plea for justice. Listen to my cry for help. Pay attention to my prayer, for it comes from honest lips. Declare me innocent, for you see those who do right. You have tested my thoughts and examined my heart in the night. You have scrutinized me and found nothing wrong. I am determined not to sin in what I say. I have followed your commands, which keep me from following cruel and evil people. My steps have stayed on your path; I have not wavered from following you. I am praying to you because I know you will answer, O God. Bend down and listen as I pray. Show me your unfailing love in wonderful ways. By your mighty power you rescue those who seek refuge from their enemies. Guard me as you would guard your own eyes. Hide me in the shadow of your wings. Protect me from wicked people who attack me, from murderous enemies who surround me. They are without pity. Listen to their boasting! They track me down and surround me, watching for the chance to throw me to the ground. They are like hungry lions, eager to tear me apart— like young lions hiding in ambush. Arise, O Lord! Stand against them, and bring them to their knees! Rescue me from the wicked with your sword! By the power of your hand, O Lord, destroy those who look to this world for their reward. But satisfy the hunger of your treasured ones. May their children have plenty, leaving an inheritance for their descendants. Because I am righteous, I will see you. When I awake, I will see you face to face and be satisfied.” (Psalms‬ ‭17:1-15‬)

The whole world was a lot different then
I feel sorry for these kids now"
270,7SKGXkZKjV8,"Sadly, I just recently found out the student I was sponsoring could not answer simple math problems after starting face to face classes for grade 6. But saw that they passed grade 5 with high grades. I told them to tell me the truth, and they told me, they were using math apps on their tablets to answer math problems. They never solved the problems on their own. This is sad, because now, their math level is like the level of a grade 2 student. It is unfortunate that there is no way to place a check system wherein the teacher can find out if they are finding the answers elsewhere. Hence, it takes them a long time to answer each question."
271,7SKGXkZKjV8,Takin away  the personalisty.....
272,7SKGXkZKjV8,"If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.Romans 10. 9-10

At sigurado yung hindi naka mask yung ang pinagmumulan ng virus. At hindi hinuhuli ng mga itinalagang magbantay. Sa loob ng mga baranggay pabaya sila. Dapat paglabas pa lang ng bahay ay hulihin na ang hindi naka mask.  Kaso hindi ginagawa. Kayat kahit anong stricto magpatupad sa mga main  roads kung sa loob ng barangay ay pabaya, useless din ang mga efforts ng gobyerno. Marami talaga matitigas ang ulo."
280,o1kPskxFkQ8,"They say, health is our wealth.
But how it'll become our wealth if we don't have proper self discipline?
Come to think of it, they implemented a two-week ECQ in mega manila, yes it was a big help to prevent the wide spread of the virus, for a while. But then, after the ECQ, kanya-kanya na naman tayong labas ng bahay and worst may gumagala pa, even though hindi naman reasonable or valid  yung dahilan natin. And here comes us criticizing the government on what should they do about the issue, when it is clearly evident that we also have faults and lapses. Also, the government should always need to hear the voices of those frontliners, especially the medical professionals and staffs, because they're the ones who know what and how to prevent and avoid the wide spread of the virus. 

Just to be clear, I'm just being neutral about the issue and I just want to express my opinion. Respect is all that matters. This is for educational purpose only, and its not really in my nature to talks anything about politics. 

P.s. if you want to advice me or something, I am open for it. Have a nice day! 🙂"
281,o1kPskxFkQ8,How are covid19 patients counted if hospitals are unwilling to accept suspected patients with covid? As my mother and I experienced where we toured the entire Gen. Trias until we get to the Manila Hospital where she is also not admitted without even passing the swab test.
282,o1kPskxFkQ8,I think the thumbnail is incorrect based on what he wants to imply.  Just saying.
283,o1kPskxFkQ8,"There are a lot of things don't ad up here. In the last 5 months we have had just under 2000 deaths (an average of 400 per month), yet DOH figures show that in a normal year, before Covid, there are approximately 47,000 deaths per month from other causes, so why is it that the system cannot cope with a 1% rise in deaths. Is it incompetence, poor management and just plain panic, just as it is in other countries?"
284,o1kPskxFkQ8,"I may say that some people have  biased reasoning. While government officials are not experts on the pandemic, they are doing their best. Maybe not all, but most. Well, maybe not most, maybe some of them.  Regardless. They may not cover every facet of the strategic planning but people should also understand that it is also primarily a measure of each person's discipline.  Everyone is given a mind to think and the right to choose to do what's best for ourselves. Why blame all to the government when people are not doing their best to protect themselves? Government officials are humans, too.  They make mistakes, they get hurt, too. They get sick, they  get scared, too! They are not perfect, well so do we. Instead of blaming the government, why not do something to help them when it comes to the decisions they are making? We can start by reaching out. They have channels to do such. Why not help the government by helping others, too? At the end of the day, we should help each other instead of pulling others down by shooting their flaws or imperfections. Because believe it or not, everything gets better when we work together. So when do you plan to start? When do you plan to contribute for the good of your fellowmen?"

317,xV1oR-RbOGU,"The Philippine government should be wise enough not to depend too much on China for COVID vaccines as the country does not have a good reputation for its clinical trials.  Even Brazil stopped the clinical trials of the CoronaVac produced by SinoVac Biotech on its people due to various serious side effects.  It would be better for the country to be talking to American, Australian, or European Pharmaceutical companies (e.g. Pfizer, BioNtech, Moderna, Astra-Zeneca) that follow strict regimen for clinical trials with emphasis on safety and effectiveness of COVID vaccines."

The promotion on the type of vaccines should be based on effectiveness and safety to the Filipino people, instead of political considerations or preferences.  Just my suggestion."
321,xV1oR-RbOGU,"They just admitted that since they were being used as test subjects, they hope they get some for free."
322,aoNQUUQno00,"It's so funny because while part of me still believes we should be wary about COVID at all times hence it still exists, part of me also is doubting the numbers. I have a friend who was trying to get a doctor's certificate for back to work after a 1 day absence due to fever and sore throat he got because of the hot weather and imagine he is marked as a COVID patient by the insurance company? We were both laughing because we know very well he did not get COVID 😂🤣"
323,aoNQUUQno00,"Just like covid here in Canada, this news is meant to be spitted out to the ground. 😅"
324,aoNQUUQno00,How many deaths?  Maybe it's time to let natural immunity take it's course.

339,3ZXR2eARmuQ,"This shows the the govt of the Philippines has genuine care for its people's welfare, unlike other countries who prioritizes economy over the welfare of its citizen. The best move for a country that knows where to position it self in a certain calamity like this."

Vaccine nga naman may pera na, pahirap pa sa tao."
348,a3-AiHSyTIU,"Revelation 13:17 ""so that NO ONE could BUY or SELL unless he had the MARK— the name of the beast or the number of its name."" 

This ""snake bite/ Vac"" isn't the mark of the beast but what we're experiencing right now is a precursor of Revelation 13:17. We don't struggle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, the authorities, the powers of this world’s darkness, and spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. But fear not, Jesus Christ has overcome the world. Only by the grace of God through Christ our Lord we can win this battle. Trust Him at all cost. He's coming very soon to rule and reign!  Hallelujah."

352,-qFcO_onBdA,"Here in Armenia no signs of improvement for now and the number of coronavirus cases is increasing fast. And in some neighboring countries situation is even worth. Looks scary. But it's still much better than in EU countries. Why everyone starts to move only now? It was much easier to prevent the pandemic in early 2020 when it was just appearing, but by that time WHO saw no major risks of its spreading all over the world and mainstream media were focused on showing news from China."
353,-qFcO_onBdA,I wish we have a lockdown in AZ

358,-qFcO_onBdA,Manila doesnt have 50million or even 15m thats way too much. 50million people is the number of population for the whole Luzon island. Before the community quarantine people dispersed to their home villages. Population of Manila right now might be 5m - 10m.

388,fp9uRsmTWqg,"The unemployment rate is much higher if you consider the very low income people who are always ignored. Anyone who has friends, family or associates in the Philippines knows the truth."
389,fp9uRsmTWqg,Unemployment rate has never been under 20% in Philippines. Many Filipinos are under employed in temp jobs this is why so many Filipinos flee Philippines to work as OFW's. The best and brightest leave Philippines due to it's hopeless corrupt government.
390,fp9uRsmTWqg,In September the unemployment rate is really high because of 20k plus new cases a day but now the new cases is only 2k or 1k I think the unemployment rate will low because of lower restrictions in October or November.
391,fp9uRsmTWqg,That rate is muchhhhhh higher. Its getting worse

The director of China's National Health Commission said on Sunday that the incubation period for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is roughly 10–14 days — and the virus can be transmitted during that time, before symptoms appear. A U.S. infectious diseases expert said this means ""the infection is much more contagious than we originally thought,"" the New York Times reports."

466,ibWFsmcnefk,Great prediction from a economist. Inflation rate right now is beyond repair
467,ibWFsmcnefk,Honestly I don't think Covid is gonna be 100% over for a few years with how things are going
468,ibWFsmcnefk,The Philippines central bank has always been very safe in the way they set up and takes measures
469,ibWFsmcnefk,Why is it ok to keep drug prices high if there is inflation?  Because it has nothing to do with inflation.  It has to do with top 1% sending out lobbyists to make sure they don’t pay more taxes.  They must be sending lobbyists to news channels too.
470,ibWFsmcnefk,Honesty from the Philippines
471,ibWFsmcnefk,Why are even England's banks not rising interest rates? They are rock bottom and they even make it seem like such a bad thing to raise them to a level which is still so low historically.
472,ibWFsmcnefk,"I think inflation is worse in 1st world countries bec, in this holiday season, many want to spend but the goods are scarce due to supply chain issues. In 3rd world, spending is  not as much but inflation is more mangeable."
473,ibWFsmcnefk,philliphins people very nice love from india
474,ibWFsmcnefk,"Someone once wrote ""I think we should keep using a failed system with resource mismanagement as its key component until we have a few incredibly rich deities and 99.9% of people live in absolute poverty..."", it was me, a few moments ago, and yet it was filtered..."
475,ibWFsmcnefk,"I got a feeling when I see recovery from economic crisis, what is the recovery, is it earning sufficient money for certain period of time(calculated with normal earnings of the period) all of sudden economic crisis happens for many reasons though in straight forward lack of sufficient amount of money to maintain country sustainable growth and to met with global GDP levels I feel, due to inflation there were chances to meet treasury funds to normal may be there will be less inflation rate after recovery or if it continues there should be of funds left can invest other sectors of development."
476,e0fN7HxkIUc,"Singaporeans needs to realize that we have a very huge population, Democratic system of gov't, Free Press, limited budget, dogmatic belief, prone to natural disasters, ongoing communist/Islamic insurgencies, Drug problem, no mandatory conscription/military training for the young and high level of poverty rate. So connect the dots 😔"

479,e0fN7HxkIUc,Hopefully those horrible noisy polluting jeepneys will be replaced with better transport vehicles soon.
480,e0fN7HxkIUc,the result of obsolete public transportation. Past 6 administrations are to be blamed but current situation is blamed on Duterte's government.

508,BomdsEJjb0E,So the guy had it and was showing signs of getting better n then died within 24 hours...😳
509,BomdsEJjb0E,people are saying that even though they had fevers that they took fever reducing medications so that they could leave and not be stopped at airport checkpoints because the healthcare system was being over run and they knew that they could not get proper Healthcare they needed if their fever was being caused by the Coronavirus.

So they still let the Chinese in, until the infected got in.  Only then did they enacted the temp ban."

We don't struggle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, the authorities, the powers of this world’s darkness, and spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. But fear not, Jesus Christ has overcome the world. Only by the grace of God through Christ our Lord we can win this battle. Trust Him at all cost. He's coming very soon to rule and reign!

668,LLFcBFAuauk,"I'm Filipino and I'm not that aware of what's happening in my country. After watching this video, I just realized how hard the lives of my fellow Filipinos. I'm not against with the government but I suppose this is not the best way to help them. Giving money is not enough, for many Filipinos, it'll not last for 3 days. I reckon, instead of giving money and putting the fund of the country in this way, why not arrange mass testing? Just try to test as many as possible so the virus will stop spreading. If that happens, the economy will be back to normal, more job opportunities again and each family can make enough money for a decent life."

My Mom who is a senior (65 years old) receives 500 pesos per month. Not much but its still a big help for us poor here in Manila. I just really hope that this pandemic will end soon. We closed all our small restaurants last year because of this."

674,R0i7i80ToUM,"I'm so happy I made productive decisions about my finances that changed my life forever,hoping to retire next year... Investment should always be on any creative man's heart for success in life."
675,R0i7i80ToUM,"The covid pandemic showed how uniquely different the Philippines is from the rest of the world. I'd say the BPO industry and OFW remittances kept the Philippine economy afloat during the pandemic, both of which showed marked increases contrary to expectations. Had we depended on the manufacturing sector like most of our neighbors, we most likely would not have bounced back from the pandemic that rapidly. In a short span of 2 years, the Philippines transitioned from a contracting economy to the best-performing economy in the region. (Btw, thanks to covid vaccine donor countries that saved us billions of dollars). Edit: Thanks also to the private sector that stepped up during the pandemic; it averted further deterioration of the economy."
676,R0i7i80ToUM,Good thing the philippines economy got it's recovery from the covid. Atleast now the philippines economy is growing very fast and catching up.
677,R0i7i80ToUM,"The Philippines, according to the IMF, will be the growth leader not only in the ASEAN Region but in the entire Asian continent."

679,R0i7i80ToUM,"Thanks to the strong partnership between the government (Duterte and Marcos administrations) and the private sector, plus the repatriation of money by overseas Filipinos, the economy of the Philippines was able to bounced back quickly. That is an example of the ""bayanihan"" spirit of Filipinos both in the Philippines and abroad."
680,R0i7i80ToUM,"infrastructure is a force multiplier in terms of economic benefit. it needs to spend more in terms of more roads and bridges and high speed internet, social health care, education, and food security. it needs to develop a vertically integrated steel industry and mining industry and refining"

684,6zkba0hNiE8,".     In spite of massive demonstrations in Europe and in the US,  with no social distancing and lesser face masks, yet there is no abrupt spike of  deaths and cases as of now as everybody is projecting and watching the opposite. What happened ?
     If I may recall the video in March of this year of Naftali Bennett, the Defense Minister of Israel, that video stated that the people, the senior citizens are safe to get out of quarantine once  the immunity of the community reaches to 60 percent or better.  Thus, it is safe to say that the Defense Minister is correct.
     For now, social distancing and wearing of face masks etc are observed while there is no vaccine yet."

727,N9OQbW0YOLU,"President Duterte hoping Filipino professional nurses would have the ""spirit and the fervour to serve the Filipino people"" is one of his most insensitive and ""out of touch with reality"" statements.  It appeals to the conscience of these honorable people without recognizing the years of appeal this work force sector has been clamoring to uplift their dignity.

Excellent feature story by Channel News Asia, relevant for the times."
728,N9OQbW0YOLU,The head of department of health in the Phillipines only concerns about how much money he can make.

Philippine system is so messed up, it's basically designed to churn out professionals expecting them to work abroad and send back remittances. While those who remain will just have to settle with low wages, establishments are happy with it."

732,N9OQbW0YOLU,"I'm one of those ""lucky ones"" who got out of the Philippines to find better opportunities in nursing.

863,O06AlL8nONo,"yung first 4 confirmed cases halos isang buwan na ang nakalipas. so ibig sabihin hindi sila ang nakahawa dun sa mag asawang taga-Cainta. May iba pang carrier.


Yung mga ofw galing Wuhan, ang tanong ko ay kinuhanan ba sila ng tests? Or kinuwarrantine lang sila ng 14 days? kapag may symptoms dun lang sila ite-test? at dahil wala naman symptoms ay pinakawalan na sila after 14 days. What if beyond 14 days lumabas ang symptoms??  Diba kahit nga walang symptoms ay nakakahawa pa din?"
864,O06AlL8nONo,Tama ba ? Nag confirmed sila after nabalitaan may 2 tourist na galing dito nagkaroon ng covid19

877,HabzHfgdMNs,"In Leni's 6 year term we never heard a word from her and now she shares so much plans to make Filipinos lives better.  Filipinos don't need jobs.  The Philippines has only 6.3% unemployment rate - one of the lowest in Asia.  What we need is to lower the cost of living which means we need to lower costs in food, energy and housing.  But of course this is something Leni cannot address since most of her financers are those who monopolize these industries."

903,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,congrats for reaching 2million what a great milestone we had
904,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,"No need to hype on irrelevant data - always focus on daily reports on new cases, number of asymptomatic, number of recoveries and deaths since its more significant data for us."
905,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,How many people died? How many people recovered? Those are the important numbers. Just giving a tally of total cases so far is just fear mongering for clicks and views.
906,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Keep safe everyone. Sumunod sa mga patakaran na ipinatutupad.
907,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,"Pls Note: 1,840,294 ""Recovered"" of 2 Million Cases. Thanks. ... Stay clean & healthy 24/7 :)"
908,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,"ADVICE: If you have covid and is having a hard time breathing. Do a ""Belly Breathing"" - the most efficient way to breathe (you can search it up online). This is exactly what I did when I was slowly losing air to breathe. I was having a hard time inhaling through my nose so I used my mouth. Your belly should come outward as you take in air. As you exhale, your stomach will come back in. If it's hard to breathe through your nose then use your mouth. If this makes your mouth dry then try to have a glass of water and maybe a little bucket beside you where you can rinse your mouth from time to time. If it's hard to breathe when you lay down then just sit. You need to practice until your body gets use to it. Put your hand in your stomach so you can monitor your breathing. ( I tried the one where you hold your breath for a couple of times and cough at the last try but it didn't work for me. It made it even more hard for me to breathe.)"
909,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Given that covid-19 especially the delta variant is highly contagious as per CDC's. 2M is 2% of our population and thankfully I lot have recovered. I remember Germany's Merkel mentioned in her speech last year that they'd expect 70% of their population being infected as per expert's data. We are nowhere as rich as Germany but 2% is considered low basing on experts data.
910,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Woooh go on! Record Holder! Go Philippines!
911,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,This is good news! That means many are acquiring natural immunity without dying.

916,tq7FyWSGaD4,"he should have mentioned in the interview that one high ranked cop celebrated his birthday violating the same quarantine policies they impose upon people, whereas an old fisherman was detained by the cops for 12 days because he was looking for food for his kids and one guy had PTSD and was shot by a cop right on the checkpoint alleging the victim acted inappropriately..."

Pero yung mga nagtatrabaho sa ospital freely pwedeng umuwi o mamasyal at pumasok sa ospital. Kahit hindi sila i swab test kada pasok sa duty. In short. Do not comply and dont get jabbed.

This study also focuses on the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant by a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir.

The researchers of the current study also evaluated the inhibitory action of a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir against the Alpha variant. When combined, the drugs acted synergistically and plaque inhibition increased to over 90%

Since stenoparib inhibits a host protein, the antiviral activity of stenoparib should inhibit all variant strains. The current study explored the activity of stenoparib against four SARS-CoV-2 strains including the SARS-CoV-2 67 Germany/BavPat1/2020 wild-type strain (wt), as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma SARS-CoV-2 VOCs"
1031,D7zMgv16cik,"So... no numbers on how many of those are vaccinated/un-vaccinated? You'd think it's a very important number to show the people if they want to continue to push the vaccine to people, no? But I guess it's not an important number because it's probably either majority of cases are vaccinated, or insignificant number of un-vaccinated cases ( because most are staying at home anyway)."
1032,D7zMgv16cik,"Sa 21,819 ilan kaya dian ang fully vaccinated at non vaccinated. Sana ilabas din"
1033,D7zMgv16cik,"Same high numbers in Los Angeles County, California. Yes, thats right:  same number of new cases in entire Philippine population of 107 million people and Los Angeles County population of 10 million. That is one of the many reasons I became a permanent resident of the Philippines!"
1034,D7zMgv16cik,Why does no one ask “who does the vaccine protect? The answer should tell you exactly what to do. Stop the madness.
1035,D7zMgv16cik,Simple. Don't panic and give in to scare tactics.
1036,D7zMgv16cik,"OMG, dear God protect us please🙏"
1037,D7zMgv16cik,this is part of the show.

1070,29LXKUT0eMY,To flaten the curve just means to decline the number of new cases up to zero. When new cases become stable to 0 then the curve is flat.

Imbis na puro community quarantine ang puro ginagawa nyo tapos mamimigay ng milyong milyong ayuda. Yung mga  ayuda na binibigay bakit hindi nyo idagdag na lang gamitin ang pera sa pagpapalakas ng health care system dito sa pinas, magtayo ng facilties na kaya ang hundreds to thousands na covid patient. Ibigay sa mga health care workers ang pangangailangan nila. Dagdagan ang pagbili ng bakuna. Hindi yung pinapataba nyo lang ang bulsa nyo samantalang milyon na tao ang nagdudusa."
1077,Bo24jIb7GA8,Paano hindi mag highest mga hospital kahit hindi covid positive patients ginagawang covid positive para wala daw babayaran sa hospital. Pls Phil. Gov't intervene.
1078,Bo24jIb7GA8,"Nothing new! DOH, OCTA and mainstream media are so much excited and seemed happy and amazed to tell the nation that covid cases are getting higher!

1079,Bo24jIb7GA8,"Huwag kayo masyado padala ng emosyon dahil sa datus, bumilis ang testing capacity natin kaya ganyan.  Malay natin last year pa yan ang 20k per day, hindi nga lang natest.  What i mean, the data does not tell everything.  Kailagan lang natin mag-ingat, follow the protocols, be healthy, galaw2x din minsan.  Expose sa sunlight.  You see, ang mga media outlet na kagaya nito nananakot lang ito upang makuha ang atensyon natin at views para kikita sila ng malaki.  So just relax, be optimistic. huwag padala sa stress."

1103,GUVKWAEO_hY,"here in PH, they are fast in administering vaccines but only while supply last. especially in the provinces, it takes weeks before a new batch of vaccines arrive. How can they administer vaccines if there is no supply."
1104,GUVKWAEO_hY,You will get vaccinated here in the Philippines when you get registered on local government sites. Some places in the Philippines allow people to walk in and get vaccinated as long as they have registered online. It also depends on your local government or City.
1105,GUVKWAEO_hY,"28:39 where the deck did you get that information from?? In Indonesia health workers and elderly are first and second priority to get vaccine hence why my dad  could get one in early March.
39:19 did you say fifty or fifteen?"
1106,GUVKWAEO_hY,Thank you CNA for providing quality content day after day.
1107,GUVKWAEO_hY,3rd world problem and the fact were both extremely populated countries. Godbless brothers and sisters in the Philippines and Indonesia. But same form of government there’s too much beaurucracy that complicates the management. We can get over this! 🇮🇩🇵🇭
1108,GUVKWAEO_hY,"Philippines have been ramping up vaccination nowadays amidst the threat of delta variant. Schedule for vaccination has been consistent but people such as front liners, senior citizens and with pre-existing health conditions are given much priority. I just hope that we would have enough vaccines to give to all population since we need this so much to go back to our normal lives."
1109,GUVKWAEO_hY,"The Filipina interviewee’s fear on general public being left behind is not true. The vaccines of the private companies have not come in yet (not that we know of), and the poor sector are being vaccinated now through the government’s procurement and donations. They’re not last to be vaccinated. Admittedly last to be vaccinated are those from far-flung provinces but they are not in immediate danger of the pandemic."
1110,GUVKWAEO_hY,"Hi guys! Just asking.
 which one from these vaccines: Sinovac & Astrazeneca, you prefer and why. Thanks"
1111,GUVKWAEO_hY,"I was supposed to be vaccinated by the Moderna vaccine procured by our company. My brother was also waiting for his company's vaccine. I didn't mind waiting at first; however, the rising Delta cases made me paranoid. So we just decided to register last Friday. It's a good thing that the process in Manila was smooth. We just got our 1st dose of AstraZeneca today. My parents and sister who live in a province in Visayas already completed their 2 doses of Sinovac since May I think."
1112,GUVKWAEO_hY,Praying for the whole SEA to get vaccinated faster.
