0,aLZ85hb4wjE,Loved the calmness of Manilla.
1,aLZ85hb4wjE,"After this pandemic I think every country should have a lockdown every month to give mother nature a time to heal, with all the pollution that the earth is experiencing."
2,aLZ85hb4wjE,manila looks beautifull with less people
3,aLZ85hb4wjE,"The lockdown makes the city look like a place I want to explore.

Before the lockdown, it looked like a crowded mess filled with traffic and pollution."
4,aLZ85hb4wjE,India also same
5,aLZ85hb4wjE,The president promised that he'll do his best to ease the traffic in the metro like 5mins of travel along EDSA. Fortunately it happened but unfortunately it wasn't in the ideal way. Nature's sense of humor tho.
6,aLZ85hb4wjE,"I went up the viewing spot at antipolo, its a very beautiful, almost smog free view of the metro skyline"
7,aLZ85hb4wjE,The sad part is people around the world did not intend to heal earth but afraid of death.
8,aLZ85hb4wjE,i hope it stays like this forever its beautiful with no messy people
9,aLZ85hb4wjE,2020 is the year when nature fight back and reduce human emission dramatically.

36,DWxIvQlpJK8,Nakakamiss si tatay digs
37,DWxIvQlpJK8,Let us remember that the reason why we had such high numbers or had COVID AT ALL was because this guy was afraid of hurting China's feelings by imposing a travel ban on them.
38,DWxIvQlpJK8,"Nakakamis un lock down, nakakamis un puro boses ni tatay digong inaabangan ng mga tao during lockdown. It means, lahat ng tao, nakaagapay s desisyon ni tatay digong, salute talaga kay fprrd dahil sya ang pres during pandemic."

42,nTUWK8vufOk,"As a Filipino student, online class is frustrating because our internet here sucks."
43,nTUWK8vufOk,I hope the family was paid for being interviewed. They need support more than ever.
44,nTUWK8vufOk,nothing is more heartbreaking than children forced to grow up before there time...
45,nTUWK8vufOk,"As a teacher in Malaysia I feel for these anak- anak . Be strong and be safe ,only education can change your life and your family , Praying for success from Malaysia ."
46,nTUWK8vufOk,"I was in the Philippines on a mission trip when Covid hit. After I was home in the US with my family, the worry I felt for the kids I'd met there was overwhelming. May God bless the Filipino peopleüíô"
47,nTUWK8vufOk,"I am so glad that they also tackled the mental health of the youth right now. It is also one of the worst problems that the youth of the Philippines can experience. I know a lot of people in my classmates who suffer from depression, that is why, we must take actions to fight and solve this problem."
48,nTUWK8vufOk,"The problem in the Philippines is that there are many less privileged, challenged people. The government officials and local government unit can be corrupt and don‚Äôt do their assigned jobs properly(not saying all of them but some or maybe most of them). The less privileged people and some teens just makes more babies and say having an accidental baby is a ‚Äúblessing‚Äù. It is only a blessing if it was planned and both couple/parents are ready to have their own family. That is why many people are suffering from poverty because many people do not plan making their family. Then they blame everything to the government and if there are people doing better than them they want to pull others down. #crabmentality ü¶Ä I feel sorry for the challenged people but some of the people just make their own problems.

Didn‚Äôt comment here to debate. Just giving my opinion ‚úåüèª"
49,nTUWK8vufOk,I'm here out of curiosity if they include how there are so many errors/incomplete in the modules given to students for online study. It's like it never even went to proofreading before it was released. Even our senate wants an investigation on this matter. How can we have internationally competitive students if the materials provided to them has so many errors.
50,nTUWK8vufOk,Ah bless jonathan he is so determined while my niece in the philippines her parents send her to a private school provided everything and now she did not finish school what a spoilt brat. I wish jonathan finish a degree someday he deserve to be help
51,nTUWK8vufOk,I want to sponsor Johnathan and help him finish school.
52,cPVE7QGS7As,"Just because our neighbour Filipina increase their covid test testing does not mean they are the worst in South East Asia. For me I admire that they try to save their people the best they can and honest with the figure too. Better than countries who have huge problem with covid, denying that they have the problem. Sending our thought and prayer to Filipina people..from Malaysia. Keep fighting spirit alive. May god protect you all."
53,cPVE7QGS7As,"Stay strong, my Filipino mates, this too shall pass"
54,cPVE7QGS7As,"Please be safe you all there. 
Well wish from Malaysia."
55,cPVE7QGS7As,"We are with you Philippines. 
Stay strong and resilient!!!
Until we meet again."
56,cPVE7QGS7As,I hope Filipino people be safe and overcome this happening. from South Korea.
57,cPVE7QGS7As,"Filipinos are very friendly, hopefully they can get this under control"
58,cPVE7QGS7As,Deaths have been low compared to other countries. The economy is the same as other countries reeling from the effects of the pandemic. We do what we can to live and survive through this and build again! We are a resilient and patient people where 4 months in a year we are visited by calamities. We have faith! We pray for this to end soon and I pray for everybody around the world who have lost family in this crisis.
59,cPVE7QGS7As,Every country is facing the same problems
60,cPVE7QGS7As,We are reaching 50k test per day now that's why cases becomes high. What's important is fatality is low and high recoveries.
61,cPVE7QGS7As,hi can i use this vid for educational purposes? it's for a school project. won't be posted in yt again
62,CEIrzjA8euQ,"No more health protocol thats why,its a leadership by example"
63,lw16DeB6zns,"To people asking why is there a discussion about South Africa, please back to 2:29. The reporter CLEARLY says ""We will now EXPAND this discussion..."" Meaning the topic will also be discussed using other countries' experiences. Philippines was just the main feature or example. It's NOT clickbait. And there's nothing wrong with the editing. Hope this helped :)"
64,lw16DeB6zns,Great insightful report from the reporter.
65,lw16DeB6zns,"Tthis was really confusing, plss fix ur news well next time,..."
66,lw16DeB6zns,Complete Lockdown is not a solution. Government must try smart lockdown and allow those people who are earning on daily bases. May Allah bless all the people Ameen
67,lw16DeB6zns,Philippines and then South Africa?
68,lw16DeB6zns,"They switched because they want to put the philippines as a title because they know they will get more views if the title has the word ""philippines"" on it"
69,lw16DeB6zns,its kinda cute to read angry Pinoy comments
70,lw16DeB6zns,Huh why South Africa? This was regarding the Philippines..the interview is irrelevant

73,8dTelszbObM,Coronavirus: Death toll rises to 427: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eavggz1suMY
74,8dTelszbObM,There's always that one person that hides there sickness and risk a whole world.
75,8dTelszbObM,This sounds serious. Hope they get it under control.
76,8dTelszbObM,I hope this Outbreak will come to an end! Be safe Everyone!
77,8dTelszbObM,"0:07 - 20,438 confirmed cases.  How long ago did you film this?"
78,8dTelszbObM,"My wife is from mainland China. Her friends are from mainland China. We live in California. My wife and her friends are stand away from places they regularly go to that gave large numbers of Chinese. Classes in the evenings and weekends that have mostly Chinese students have less people showing up. Masks are sold out everywhere. Groups on WeChat are coordinating mask purchases from whatever places they find them online, even if expensive. 

I‚Äôm not as concerned but am respecting her wishes, I don‚Äôt want to cause her extra stress. 

The fear is real. 

You may think it unjustified but it‚Äôs not just people who aren‚Äôt Asian keeping their distance. Sure, some people are being idiots, especially those making comments around Asian people buy calling people racist and xenophobic doesn‚Äôt help. 

Do what you think is right for your family. Don‚Äôt let people shame you into not protecting yourself. 

At some point I expect someone to say something to my daughter who is mixed but looks Chinese but I‚Äôve just told her people are scared and when people are scared they sometimes say mean things. It‚Äôs not as if she hasn‚Äôt heard Chinese people say racist things about other cultures. 

I make sure she knows racism exists and isn‚Äôt acceptable. 

To date she gets far more abuse from other Chinese because her Chinese isn‚Äôt as good as others. She has been bullied by people from South America in the past. 

To date, she has never told me about being bullied by westerners, she just gets the occasional mean comment which young girls seem to make to each other. 

Racists and mean people come from all races and religions. I‚Äôve heard from the local Chinese community things like Mexicans are stupid, black people are scary, various things about Japanese so let‚Äôs not pretend many complaining about racism may also be racist, although they may not see it that way."
79,8dTelszbObM,This was like 3 days ago lol
80,8dTelszbObM,"The quarantine didn't start until Jan 23rd. The doctor who recently died at age *34,* reported cases going back to December. This is probably worse than the media is reporting."
81,8dTelszbObM,"You can't blame people for being cautious. Especially now when there's no vaccine, cure, etc. Only thing that helps is separation. It's nothing personal."
82,8dTelszbObM,"one love guys, lets help one another no one to blame"

87,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"The poor gets poorer and the rich gets richer, that's how our country works... Even our farmers is not paid fairly..."
88,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"I became a Housemaid at the age of 13, so I can go to high school at night.  My parents had 9 children. I‚Äôve experienced nothing but poverty in my childhood.  It was harder for us, the older children. I wondered, even at 4 years old, why children are considered as ‚Äúblessings‚Äù, when we were all SUFFERING.  
There was no Pandemic in those days, but POVERTY was crippling us."
89,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,I was born and raised in Cebu Philippines in one of those slums. I have lived in Florida for 15 yrs now and I am so grateful to be able to help my family during these tough times. I bought my mom a duplex out in the country in 2016 so She is no longer living in the slums. It still feels like yesterday when we had to pawn Our clothes so we can buy food. I will never forget where I came from and will always be grateful for the blessings that come my way üôè
90,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"10 children and 13 grandchildren. Sometimes you can influence how you live your life. We are a poor family too, but our lives are much better than a family with 10 children and 13 grandkids."
91,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"Even without the pandemic.. many of Filipinos have been starving, and  unemployed. They also said here that ""Hindi kami natakot mamatay sa COVID, takot kami na mamatay sa gutom"" ""Walang nakakagmot sa gutom, patay ka."" and I think that's the most painful statements i heard in this video. Many filipinos experienced hunger amid the lockdown. In fact, the hunger incidence rate is at its highest in 6 years according to the social weather station. I can say that Filipinos don't easily give up in the situation and they are still helping through good and bad times."
92,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"Even without the pandemic.. many of Filipinos have been starving, and  unemployed"
93,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"I work 12 to 13 hours a day at minimum. Sometimes I feel like complaining  but after watching this, somehow I feel grateful to have kept my job and be able to take care of my family."
94,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"As someone who is privileged enough, these are the stories most of the government officials, middle and upper class Filipinos should see to realize what's really happening when we allow poor priority/decisions and poor politics plague our land. Let us have the initiative to help, both the government and the people together from making this our ""new normal"" üôè"

It's really a community effort. Many people help fed covid patience.  A week a go were downgraded to GCQ, our hospital are at 45% utilization rate now. We're about to transition to MGCQ an even more lower status. So just hang in there guys, you can do it. Just follow the basic  health protocol. Stay safe, Stay home, Stay healthy and please be obedient.  ‚úå. For local tourist please go to Cebu it's open all ready. To help the local tourism industry.  Thanks."

101,iOE6rAY8l-k,"When people are bored and or looking for sources of income, they can't simply stay at home after 5 long months of waiting. Some don't take this disease seriously anymore after ECQ was  lifted....not properly wearing masks and don't observe physical distancing when law enforcers are not around. What can you expect?"

125,jEINZXA_ujo,"here in the philippines our houses are just so close to each other, The virus here can spread with ease, it's a good thing president duterte declared the lockdown earlier, we would've been all infected by now if it wasn't for that."
126,587N9bJ5J5k,"If you look at the lower income quarters, a lot of these settlements have significant overcrowding and unacceptable environmental hygiene; it just adds to the spread and these environments are a breeding ground for disease.  The situation is very similar to the Brazilian Favelas.  Many of their outdoor marketplaces are also a breeding ground for disease without proper safe food storage.

Many people in the Philippines can't afford private hospitals and don't have health insurance."

178,SEHcakm-fAc,I would like to use some parts of this news for my video presentation.. Thank you! God bless.
179,SEHcakm-fAc,"Levels of lockdown/quarantine in the Philippines based on how strict it is:
6. EECQ - extreme/extensive enhanced community quarantine
5. ECQ - enhanced community quarantine
        a. LECQ - localized enhanced community quarantine - is only done on small areas of the city.
4. MECQ- modified enhanced community quarantine
3. GCQ - general community quarantine
2. MGCQ - modified general community quarantine
1. New Normal"

181,SEHcakm-fAc,"In other words, we've lost the game when we're almost complete and back to zero."
182,SEHcakm-fAc,Is it timely?
183,SEHcakm-fAc,"ADVICE: If you have covid and is having a hard time breathing. Do a ""Belly Breathing"" - the most efficient way to breathe (you can search it up online). This is exactly what I did when I was slowly losing air to breathe. I was having a hard time inhaling through my nose so I used my mouth. Your belly should come outward as you take in air. As you exhale, your stomach will come back in. If it's hard to breathe through your nose then use your mouth. If this makes your mouth dry then try to have a glass of water and maybe a little bucket beside you where you can rinse your mouth from time to time. If it's hard to breathe when you lay down then just sit. You need to practice until your body gets use to it. Put your hand in your stomach so you can monitor your breathing. ( I tried the one where you hold your breath for a couple of times and cough at the last try but it didn't work for me. It made it even more hard for me to breathe.)"
184,SEHcakm-fAc,"Success is dependent on the action or steps you take to achieve it. Show me a man who doesn't have an investment and I will tell you how soon he'll go broke. Investment is building a safe haven for the future: with the right choice of investment that has at least 1% minimum risk and with an Expert guidance, profit and interest should be üíØ guaranteed."

188,1psSvU1km0I,"As a foreigner who have lived in Ph for 4 years, I observe that: Wealth gap is a big problem in the Philippines; Many Filipinos have low income while the price of everything is too high."
189,1psSvU1km0I,Family planning is one of the main key to prevent poverty.
190,1psSvU1km0I,The irony is that those in the poverty are the one who lacks family planning. You‚Äôll notice they are the one with the huge family members.
191,1psSvU1km0I,I'm from Phillipines neighbouring country. Seeing many Filipinos living in poverty makes me sad. Many Filipinos come to our country to get a better life but sadly our government cannot do anything about them since they are taking care of their own people. I hope Phillipines poverty rate may drop
192,1psSvU1km0I,"filipinos like to laugh about china, now look whos poorer, this world doesn't need people to insult others with their own nationalistic ideas."
193,1psSvU1km0I,"As a Filipino myself. One of the weakest spots of my countrymen is that we are guilible, easily manipulated and are being exploited due to lack of education. Poverty is the driving force of these corruptions because they can control the poor by providing aid to them with malicious intent. Disinformation tru social media has led to many people electing skewed and incompetent politicians. As a result, it cascaded into substandard solutions and short term provisions which aggravated the poor even more. 

EDUCATION is a lengthy investment but I believe it will put an end to the never ending cycle of ignorance and the people being exploited by it."
194,1psSvU1km0I,Praying that the Philippines can overcome many of its problem and become a country of just for rich and for poor someday.
195,1psSvU1km0I,The Philippines has a lot of potential if the right decisions are made.
196,1psSvU1km0I,its so hard too find jobs now in the PH... I'm Bachelor's degree holder and have different skill experience in many aspects but still they hire there relatives and friends in the company even they are not fully qualified instead of the one who is qualified...

204,PP3Yu-ro1tA,Nothing to worry about this figure for as long as no case of death happen to any vaccinated individuals. I am just wondering why government is so alarmed by this development of covid cases! Would you now suggest again for another kind of vaccine at the expense of government money so politicians and profit oriented individuals  could amass more wealth?
205,PP3Yu-ro1tA,Marami nagka cases sa metro Manila ay mga vaccinated kasi 90% fully vaccinated nila. Pag 52% positivity rate nila ibig sabihin halos karamihan nagka covid ay bakunado. So sila ang nagpa laganap ng virus sa metro Manila mga bakunado. Dapat cla ang huwag palabasin kasi sila ang carrier.
206,PP3Yu-ro1tA,Declare alert level 4 before it gets worst. This omicron variant has exceeded the delta variant and spreading like wildfire. Limit people movement and declare lock downs in places where incidence are high. Learn from what happened before and make drastic and decisive actions before it spreads further
207,PP3Yu-ro1tA,Its not the real numbers no country can declare the exact number of  cases .

240,7SKGXkZKjV8,"Sadly, I just recently found out the student I was sponsoring could not answer simple math problems after starting face to face classes for grade 6. But saw that they passed grade 5 with high grades. I told them to tell me the truth, and they told me, they were using math apps on their tablets to answer math problems. They never solved the problems on their own. This is sad, because now, their math level is like the level of a grade 2 student. It is unfortunate that there is no way to place a check system wherein the teacher can find out if they are finding the answers elsewhere. Hence, it takes them a long time to answer each question."

‚ÄúO Lord, hear my plea for justice. Listen to my cry for help. Pay attention to my prayer, for it comes from honest lips. Declare me innocent, for you see those who do right. You have tested my thoughts and examined my heart in the night. You have scrutinized me and found nothing wrong. I am determined not to sin in what I say. I have followed your commands, which keep me from following cruel and evil people. My steps have stayed on your path; I have not wavered from following you. I am praying to you because I know you will answer, O God. Bend down and listen as I pray. Show me your unfailing love in wonderful ways. By your mighty power you rescue those who seek refuge from their enemies. Guard me as you would guard your own eyes. Hide me in the shadow of your wings. Protect me from wicked people who attack me, from murderous enemies who surround me. They are without pity. Listen to their boasting! They track me down and surround me, watching for the chance to throw me to the ground. They are like hungry lions, eager to tear me apart‚Äî like young lions hiding in ambush. Arise, O Lord! Stand against them, and bring them to their knees! Rescue me from the wicked with your sword! By the power of your hand, O Lord, destroy those who look to this world for their reward. But satisfy the hunger of your treasured ones. May their children have plenty, leaving an inheritance for their descendants. Because I am righteous, I will see you. When I awake, I will see you face to face and be satisfied.‚Äù (Psalms‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠17:1-15‚Ä¨)

259,o1kPskxFkQ8,"Wag nang magsisihan, lahat tayo ay responsible  sa bawat isa. Hindi natin ito ginusto. May mga tao kasi na irresponsible  na hindi naka mask sa public places o sa kalsada. At sigurado yung hindi naka mask yung ang pinagmumulan ng virus. At hindi hinuhuli ng mga itinalagang magbantay. Sa loob ng mga baranggay pabaya sila. Dapat paglabas pa lang ng bahay ay hulihin na ang hindi naka mask.  Kaso hindi ginagawa. Kayat kahit anong stricto magpatupad sa mga main  roads kung sa loob ng barangay ay pabaya, useless din ang mga efforts ng gobyerno. Marami talaga matitigas ang ulo."
260,o1kPskxFkQ8,"They say, health is our wealth.
But how it'll become our wealth if we don't have proper self discipline?
Come to think of it, they implemented a two-week ECQ in mega manila, yes it was a big help to prevent the wide spread of the virus, for a while. But then, after the ECQ, kanya-kanya na naman tayong labas ng bahay and worst may gumagala pa, even though hindi naman reasonable or valid  yung dahilan natin. And here comes us criticizing the government on what should they do about the issue, when it is clearly evident that we also have faults and lapses. Also, the government should always need to hear the voices of those frontliners, especially the medical professionals and staffs, because they're the ones who know what and how to prevent and avoid the wide spread of the virus. 

Just to be clear, I'm just being neutral about the issue and I just want to express my opinion. Respect is all that matters. This is for educational purpose only, and its not really in my nature to talks anything about politics. 

P.s. if you want to advice me or something, I am open for it. Have a nice day! üôÇ"
261,o1kPskxFkQ8,How are covid19 patients counted if hospitals are unwilling to accept suspected patients with covid? As my mother and I experienced where we toured the entire Gen. Trias until we get to the Manila Hospital where she is also not admitted without even passing the swab test.
262,o1kPskxFkQ8,I think the thumbnail is incorrect based on what he wants to imply.  Just saying.
263,o1kPskxFkQ8,"There are a lot of things don't ad up here. In the last 5 months we have had just under 2000 deaths (an average of 400 per month), yet DOH figures show that in a normal year, before Covid, there are approximately 47,000 deaths per month from other causes, so why is it that the system cannot cope with a 1% rise in deaths. Is it incompetence, poor management and just plain panic, just as it is in other countries?"
264,o1kPskxFkQ8,"I may say that some people have  biased reasoning. While government officials are not experts on the pandemic, they are doing their best. Maybe not all, but most. Well, maybe not most, maybe some of them.  Regardless. They may not cover every facet of the strategic planning but people should also understand that it is also primarily a measure of each person's discipline.  Everyone is given a mind to think and the right to choose to do what's best for ourselves. Why blame all to the government when people are not doing their best to protect themselves? Government officials are humans, too.  They make mistakes, they get hurt, too. They get sick, they  get scared, too! They are not perfect, well so do we. Instead of blaming the government, why not do something to help them when it comes to the decisions they are making? We can start by reaching out. They have channels to do such. Why not help the government by helping others, too? At the end of the day, we should help each other instead of pulling others down by shooting their flaws or imperfections. Because believe it or not, everything gets better when we work together. So when do you plan to start? When do you plan to contribute for the good of your fellowmen?"

343,fp9uRsmTWqg,Unemployment rate has never been under 20% in Philippines. Many Filipinos are under employed in temp jobs this is why so many Filipinos flee Philippines to work as OFW's. The best and brightest leave Philippines due to it's hopeless corrupt government.
344,fp9uRsmTWqg,In September the unemployment rate is really high because of 20k plus new cases a day but now the new cases is only 2k or 1k I think the unemployment rate will low because of lower restrictions in October or November.

374,xV1oR-RbOGU,How are covid19 patients counted if hospitals are unwilling to accept suspected patients with covid? As my mother and I experienced where we toured the entire Gen. Trias until we get to the Manila Hospital where she is also not admitted without even passing the swab test.
375,xV1oR-RbOGU,"The Philipphines has been locked down strictly for quite some time, right? That's respectable and impressive by a country that still is relatively poor. Must be tough. Respect to those pulling through."

379,xV1oR-RbOGU,"The Philippine government should be wise enough not to depend too much on China for COVID vaccines as the country does not have a good reputation for its clinical trials.  Even Brazil stopped the clinical trials of the CoronaVac produced by SinoVac Biotech on its people due to various serious side effects.  It would be better for the country to be talking to American, Australian, or European Pharmaceutical companies (e.g. Pfizer, BioNtech, Moderna, Astra-Zeneca) that follow strict regimen for clinical trials with emphasis on safety and effectiveness of COVID vaccines."
380,xV1oR-RbOGU,"Philippine government strategy giving second dose vaccine isn‚Äôt a wise decision! In other  countries like in Europe and USA giving second dose of vaccine even your a front liners or vulnerable there is a certain period of time or a gap of 3-4 months as there priorities at least majority of people have a chance to have a first job to be protected, while waiting for the volume of vaccine arrival! Meanwhile countries in Europe grapple with more infectious variants, a shortages of vaccine globally while the risk of dying in a road of pandemic! The important thing is the outweighs the risk..."
381,xV1oR-RbOGU,My girlfriend is there and I pray for her and everyone there
382,xV1oR-RbOGU,"The leaders in the Phillippines should consider the efficacy of the following vaccines before they roll them out into the public:  Pfizer-BioNTech 95%, AstraZeneca 90%, Moderna 89%, Sinopharm 79%, and Sinovac 50.38%.  The promotion on the type of vaccines should be based on effectiveness and safety to the Filipino people, instead of political considerations or preferences.  Just my suggestion."
383,xV1oR-RbOGU,"They just admitted that since they were being used as test subjects, they hope they get some for free."

480,ibWFsmcnefk,Great prediction from a economist. Inflation rate right now is beyond repair
481,ibWFsmcnefk,Honestly I don't think Covid is gonna be 100% over for a few years with how things are going
482,ibWFsmcnefk,The Philippines central bank has always been very safe in the way they set up and takes measures
483,ibWFsmcnefk,Why is it ok to keep drug prices high if there is inflation?  Because it has nothing to do with inflation.  It has to do with top 1% sending out lobbyists to make sure they don‚Äôt pay more taxes.  They must be sending lobbyists to news channels too.
484,ibWFsmcnefk,Honesty from the Philippines
485,ibWFsmcnefk,Why are even England's banks not rising interest rates? They are rock bottom and they even make it seem like such a bad thing to raise them to a level which is still so low historically.
486,ibWFsmcnefk,"I think inflation is worse in 1st world countries bec, in this holiday season, many want to spend but the goods are scarce due to supply chain issues. In 3rd world, spending is  not as much but inflation is more mangeable."

641,8w61tigk0ag,"We don't hate them, we are just being cautious knowing that the health system (although our medical professionals are experts and commendable) is expensive and lacks the facilities to handle these cases."

It's called THE FLU SEASON. Yung mga nanghihingi ng reseta para sa sipon, ubo, sakit ng lalamunan, nilalagay sa mandatory testing para kayurin ang kaila-ilalim-an ng ilong. Kung binigyan na lang sana sila ng reseta, gumaling na lang sana sila ng walang dagdag na drama matapos ang ilang araw."

666,LLFcBFAuauk,"I'm Filipino and I'm not that aware of what's happening in my country. After watching this video, I just realized how hard the lives of my fellow Filipinos. I'm not against with the government but I suppose this is not the best way to help them. Giving money is not enough, for many Filipinos, it'll not last for 3 days. I reckon, instead of giving money and putting the fund of the country in this way, why not arrange mass testing? Just try to test as many as possible so the virus will stop spreading. If that happens, the economy will be back to normal, more job opportunities again and each family can make enough money for a decent life."

673,R0i7i80ToUM,"The covid pandemic showed how uniquely different the Philippines is from the rest of the world. I'd say the BPO industry and OFW remittances kept the Philippine economy afloat during the pandemic, both of which showed marked increases contrary to expectations. Had we depended on the manufacturing sector like most of our neighbors, we most likely would not have bounced back from the pandemic that rapidly. In a short span of 2 years, the Philippines transitioned from a contracting economy to the best-performing economy in the region. (Btw, thanks to covid vaccine donor countries that saved us billions of dollars). Edit: Thanks also to the private sector that stepped up during the pandemic; it averted further deterioration of the economy."
674,R0i7i80ToUM,Good thing the philippines economy got it's recovery from the covid. Atleast now the philippines economy is growing very fast and catching up.

677,R0i7i80ToUM,"Thanks to the strong partnership between the government (Duterte and Marcos administrations) and the private sector, plus the repatriation of money by overseas Filipinos, the economy of the Philippines was able to bounced back quickly. That is an example of the ""bayanihan"" spirit of Filipinos both in the Philippines and abroad."
678,R0i7i80ToUM,"infrastructure is a force multiplier in terms of economic benefit. it needs to spend more in terms of more roads and bridges and high speed internet, social health care, education, and food security. it needs to develop a vertically integrated steel industry and mining industry and refining"

682,6zkba0hNiE8,".     In spite of massive demonstrations in Europe and in the US,  with no social distancing and lesser face masks, yet there is no abrupt spike of  deaths and cases as of now as everybody is projecting and watching the opposite. What happened ?
     If I may recall the video in March of this year of Naftali Bennett, the Defense Minister of Israel, that video stated that the people, the senior citizens are safe to get out of quarantine once  the immunity of the community reaches to 60 percent or better.  Thus, it is safe to say that the Defense Minister is correct.
     For now, social distancing and wearing of face masks etc are observed while there is no vaccine yet."

Or kinuwarrantine lang sila ng 14 days? kapag may symptoms dun lang sila ite-test? at dahil wala naman symptoms ay pinakawalan na sila after 14 days. What if beyond 14 days lumabas ang symptoms??

The Philippines has only 6.3% unemployment rate - one of the lowest in Asia.  What we need is to lower the cost of living which means we need to lower costs in food, energy and housing.  But of course this is something Leni cannot address since most of her financers are those who monopolize these industries."

902,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,"No need to hype on irrelevant data - always focus on daily reports on new cases, number of asymptomatic, number of recoveries and deaths since its more significant data for us."
903,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,How many people died? How many people recovered? Those are the important numbers. Just giving a tally of total cases so far is just fear mongering for clicks and views.
904,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Keep safe everyone. Sumunod sa mga patakaran na ipinatutupad.
905,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,"Pls Note: 1,840,294 ""Recovered"" of 2 Million Cases. Thanks. ... Stay clean & healthy 24/7 :)"
906,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,"ADVICE: If you have covid and is having a hard time breathing. Do a ""Belly Breathing"" - the most efficient way to breathe (you can search it up online). This is exactly what I did when I was slowly losing air to breathe. I was having a hard time inhaling through my nose so I used my mouth. Your belly should come outward as you take in air. As you exhale, your stomach will come back in. If it's hard to breathe through your nose then use your mouth. If this makes your mouth dry then try to have a glass of water and maybe a little bucket beside you where you can rinse your mouth from time to time. If it's hard to breathe when you lay down then just sit. You need to practice until your body gets use to it. Put your hand in your stomach so you can monitor your breathing. ( I tried the one where you hold your breath for a couple of times and cough at the last try but it didn't work for me. It made it even more hard for me to breathe.)"
907,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Given that covid-19 especially the delta variant is highly contagious as per CDC's. 2M is 2% of our population and thankfully I lot have recovered. I remember Germany's Merkel mentioned in her speech last year that they'd expect 70% of their population being infected as per expert's data. We are nowhere as rich as Germany but 2% is considered low basing on experts data.
908,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Woooh go on! Record Holder! Go Philippines!
909,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,This is good news! That means many are acquiring natural immunity without dying.

Pero yung mga nagtatrabaho sa ospital freely pwedeng umuwi o mamasyal at pumasok sa ospital. Kahit hindi sila i swab test kada pasok sa duty. In short. Do not comply and dont get jabbed. This is not about science, only compliance!"

1044,D7zMgv16cik,"A new study published on the preprint server bioRxiv assesses the antiviral activity of stenoparib against four severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs). This study also focuses on the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant by a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir.

The researchers of the current study also evaluated the inhibitory action of a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir against the Alpha variant. When combined, the drugs acted synergistically and plaque inhibition increased to over 90%

Since stenoparib inhibits a host protein, the antiviral activity of stenoparib should inhibit all variant strains. The current study explored the activity of stenoparib against four SARS-CoV-2 strains including the SARS-CoV-2 67 Germany/BavPat1/2020 wild-type strain (wt), as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma SARS-CoV-2 VOCs"
1045,D7zMgv16cik,"So... no numbers on how many of those are vaccinated/un-vaccinated? You'd think it's a very important number to show the people if they want to continue to push the vaccine to people, no? But I guess it's not an important number because it's probably either majority of cases are vaccinated, or insignificant number of un-vaccinated cases ( because most are staying at home anyway)."

1173,sEjN7muHOLc,It's more fun here in the Philippines.. come and join us..
1174,sEjN7muHOLc,"lahat ng fully vaccinated wag kayo mayabang ha 
kasi parating na ang bakuna sa inyong mga anak 
5 to 11 years old sana di dumating sa point na mawalan kayo ng mahal sa buhay.
hanngat maari ipaglaban nyo  ang karapatang pantao

fully vaccinated or unvaccinated wala po panagutan ang government"
1175,sEjN7muHOLc,Unvaccinated ako pero di ako nagkakasakit. Barbero ako at kung sino sino nakaka close contact ko kaya duda na talaga ako sa bakuna nayan. Kung sino pa may bakuna sila pa nagkakasakit.
1176,sEjN7muHOLc,Totalitarianism at it worst in the Philippines.  Ripping the Filipino citizens of their freedom and their right to choose and think for themselves.
1177,sEjN7muHOLc,IN TIME OF COVID.EVERYTHING IS STUPID.
1178,sEjN7muHOLc,A lot of corruption in the country
1179,Y-xQtgvNuvA,I'm Filipino and I hope we flatten the curve of covid 19 soon. Let's keep safe Indonesian cousins.
1180,Y-xQtgvNuvA,"I‚Äôm scared, I‚Äôm living in Indonesia

Edit: Thank you all for wishing us to be safe! Stay safe and healthy from the üáÆüá©"
1181,Y-xQtgvNuvA,"In Indonesia, no body talks about covid anymore. No one even remember how much the number now."
1182,Y-xQtgvNuvA,"I love both countries; they've been my home intermittently. Let's continue to pray and be hopeful that things will eventually go well if not soon then later.This virus isn't here to stay. This, too, shall pass. Fighting."
1183,Y-xQtgvNuvA,Philippines and indonesia are brothers. Let's help each others
1184,Y-xQtgvNuvA,"Huh? We already forgot having such high cases, we pretend to live like there's no covid-19. It's completely normal"
1185,Y-xQtgvNuvA,This is so sadüòî lets pray for the both countries.üôèüôèüôè
1186,Y-xQtgvNuvA,As the video said Philippines have a high number of cases in Southeast Asia becasue they have more COVID-19 test.
1187,Y-xQtgvNuvA,"In the Philippines, mandatory faceshields and facemask are required everytime you go to public places like malls, and public transport.. this helps to flatter the infection rates. From 6k daily last 2 months, now we have 1kplus to 2k cases per day.. i guess it works.."
1188,Y-xQtgvNuvA,"Considering how there was no proper testing in Indonesia, it should always have been the first, not the Phils. Just look at the death rates."

1190,W7n2FoRinVk,"Pumunta ako sa vaccine center today for booster shot. Sabi nung nurse dun, They are still using yung 6month period protocol. Yung sinasabi dito sa video na approved na ng DOH starting Dec22 ang shortened 3months period ay only sa media. Pero sa local govt, wala pa daw silang approved memo!! DOH, magaling lang kayo pumapel sa media! Gawin nyo naman ang trabaho nyo! Kulang kayo sa coordination sa LGU!!üò°üò°"
1191,W7n2FoRinVk,alamin nyo muna sa LGU ninyo kung pwede na. sayang oras at pagod. namo rappler
1192,W7n2FoRinVk,"Lol, close to expiration date, perhaps?"
1193,W7n2FoRinVk,booster 3months para sa ano?   kailangan pa ng pondo ng malaki..
1194,W7n2FoRinVk,‚ù§Ô∏è
1195,W7n2FoRinVk,"WAG PO NINYO ITO PANIWALAAN. 6 MOS. LANG ANG TUMPAK. HINDI 3 MOS. DAHIL YAN ANG MAHIGPIT NA BILIN SA ATIN NG MGA NAGBABACUNA MULA SAPUL. PATI SA IBANG BANSA YAN DIN ANG KALAKARAN. KAYA SUNDIN NALANG NATIN. WAG PO TAYONG PABAGO BAGO. 

TANDAAN:
MARAMING NAGAGAGO

1198,Wjj__vIdew0,DOST is still unable to find patients to do their clinical trials since last year.  This is very strange and it seems that someone is not telling the truth?
1199,Wjj__vIdew0,Linggo ba ngayon Kasi ang daming gumagaling
1200,Wjj__vIdew0,Kahit umabot PA yang 1 billion Yan wala akong paki
1201,Wjj__vIdew0,Your daily dose of FEARMONGERING

1206,5DvMPgoKZmM,"Church turn into a hospital?
What a good collaboration"
1207,5DvMPgoKZmM,"It's been almost 2 years of this, and how many people do you honestly know of that really died of covid without the presence of an unrelated terminal illness?

How is it that the homeless are fine (ask any cop)?

And how many athletes/celebs/elites can you name right now that really died of covid?

Exactly"
1208,5DvMPgoKZmM,"""Cases"" mean absolutely nothing whatsoever, in reality.

Especially since it's well understood that the PCR testing still in use is highly inaccurate and often displays false positives in the presence of influenza and often for no apparent reason at all."
1209,5DvMPgoKZmM,"Honestly, I just hope things can at the very least get slightly better here in PH. Obviously debatable, but still."
1210,5DvMPgoKZmM,"please lang, if may option kayo to get vaccinated,  do it. possible pa rin magkacovid, but hindi sya ganoon ka grabe. Huwag nyong hintaying maging huli ang lahat."
1211,5DvMPgoKZmM,This covid will be a never-ending fuckery as long as the media will keep on talking about these magically-made numbers.
1212,5DvMPgoKZmM,A new variant is inevitable.
1213,5DvMPgoKZmM,The man that should resign from his office is nonetheless than the present head of state of the philippines for his gross malfeasance and misfeasance
1214,5DvMPgoKZmM,"Is that the people who got been vaccinated.,"
1215,5DvMPgoKZmM,"Ang toxic ng comments section üòÑ
Sa panahong ito, kawawa ka talaga kapag kulang ka sa kaalaman o naniwala ka sa mga haka-haka.. Sa mga hindi naniniwala sa covid, nasa sa inyo na yan.. buhay at pera niyo ang nakasalalay dito.."
