Children are kept mostly at home and classes have resumed through distance learning. But with no access to the necessary devices and uneven internet connections, many of the students have missed out on their education. 

Last year alone, around two million students dropped out of school. Poverty has also forced many of the children to take up illegal and often dangerous jobs to help their families cope with the economic impact of the health crisis.  How can these children be helped? What would it take for the Philippine government to save these children before it’s too late?

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",2021-10-20,157084,2180,1080,UC_Lnb8ZHqqgLbp-7hltuT9w," COVID-19 has left
economies around the world reeling from the fallout
of the pandemic, and the Philippines is no exception. The pandemic has forced schools
to shut down their doors and keep students at home. Last year alone, around two million students
dropped out of school. Many have taken up
illegal and often dangerous jobs to help families cope with the economic impact
of the health crisis. How can these children be helped? What would it take
for the Philippine government to save these children before it's too late? Life has come to a virtual standstill
in the Philippines. That's after the government
placed a major part of the city under strict lockdown. The once busy street in Manila
is now empty. The tight COVID-19 restrictions
have snuffed out faint signs of recovery that the people are hoping for, especially for 47-year-old Jonathan Mapa,
a bicycle taxi driver. Even more worrying for his family is the fate of his 12-year-old son,
also named Jonathan. His entire future is now at stake
in the midst of the continuing lockdown. For 1.5 years, the Philippines has been
under varying degrees of lockdown, with certain industries remaining closed while others have been partially operating
at 50% at the most. Stringent restrictions
have pulled the GDP down to its lowest in seven decades. More than four million people
have now lost their jobs. Their livelihoods have also
been left in tatters. At least two million youths
are out of school. The youths are affected
by the COVID-19 pandemic, and no one seems to talk about it. We have heard how specific sectors
or demographic groups are at a disadvantage. We've heard, for example,
how frontliners are at a disadvantage. It's true because they're the ones
at the forefront of the pandemic. We've also heard about
overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and their families. We've heard how the family members
of OFWs who have lost their jobs abroad are in a much more difficult position because they now have less remittances and may have limited savings
to depend on. But one specific demographic that I think was left behind
in these discussions was the youth. A sluggish economy,
along with slow vaccination rates, has made the country
the worst place to be during the pandemic, according to research assessing how 53 nations have been managing disruptions caused by COVID-19. Part of the problem is that we never get a clear understanding of what the reason for
one degree of lockdown over another is. There seems to be no consistent recording and transmission of information for us to understand what is going on and how we should go about the problem. The prescription is,
you follow the rules. However, the rules are sometimes incomprehensible, and then they say,
""Oh, this doesn't work. It just turns out this doesn't work. Never mind. You can forget about them."" Quarantine exacts a heavy toll, especially for daily wage earners
like Jonathan. His slum community has been
put under total lockdown thrice in the past 1.5 years for a total of four months. There's no mobility,
no passengers and no income. To compensate for the losses
during total lockdowns, the government handed out
US$78 a month on average to families like Jonathan's. But it is barely half
of what he usually makes. Twelve-year-old Jonathan
is the youngest of nine children and a beacon of hope for the family. But the health crisis has forced children
to bear the brunt of the raging pandemic. In Jonathan's village, almost every other child as young as 10
end up scavenging, unintendedly flouting the law
on child labour to help put food on the table. Eventually, these children end up
with worse, lifelong problems. Dad Jonathan is struggling
to keep his son safe when the government
ordered all schools to close. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte says he won't allow students
to go back to school until a coronavirus vaccine
is available. He says if no one graduates,
then so be it. Only 20% of the Filipino population
have been vaccinated to date. The low vaccination rate has heightened
the risk of exposure to the virus, making them vulnerable to infections. Campus closure has been extended
for the second school year in an effort to contain
the spread of the virus. The Philippines is one of the two nations
and the only Asian country to have not resumed face-to-face classes. According to the UNESCO data
on school closures, in the whole of Southeast Asia
and East Asia, the Philippines has the longest duration
of school closures, which means schools have not been open
since mid-March 2020. That is alarming
because our neighbouring countries, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam,
to some extent, have partially opened schools. And what's troubling about this is that
the Philippines is an island economy. We're composed of
many different regions and provinces, and not all regions and provinces
are affected the same way, which means that a blanket policy,
which is school closures for all, is definitely not the right approach
to go for. The country's economic managers
estimate that one year of school closure already costs the economy
about US$4.5 million. These are losses
that would most likely be felt by the Filipino youth
for the next 40 years. With a study-at-home policy, most schools in Manila
shifted to online learning. The problem is, access to the Internet,
as well as gadgets, is widely uneven. Based on the government's
rapid assessment, 6.3 million households
do not have access to the Internet while 2 million households
have no devices for learning. Even before the pandemic, Dad Jonathan could ill afford
a smartphone. Determined to continue his studies, 12-year-old Jonathan
made a painful decision on his own. But how far will he go
to achieve his dream? The Philippines is the worst place to be
in a pandemic, according to experts. And its youths are paying the price for the government's
weak response to COVID-19. Enrolment numbers are down by 2%
compared to pre-pandemic figures. That's more than two million students. And 12-year-old Jonathan Mapa
is one of them. Initially, he used his eldest sister's phone
for online lessons. Nowadays, Jonathan's father earns only US$3, or half of his pre-pandemic income. Desperate, 12-year-old Jonathan
resorted to scavenging for recyclables. It is his father's greatest fear. Jonathan's 47-year-old mother, Normelita,
suffers from arthritis that requires taking daily medication
to manage her pain. Jonathan is now trapped
in a vicious cycle, as long as his family faces hunger
and schools are closed. He also joins an estimated
160 million children worldwide who have been pushed into hazardous work
because of the pandemic. On average, 12-year-old Jonathan
earns as much as his father. The number of children
pushed into child labour by the pandemic has yet to be tracked
by the Philippine government. I don't want to sound overly pessimistic, but I think we have to recognise that we are really facing a crisis that is
not only a learning crisis but also a generational crisis that will affect
all segments of the society. It has been nine months since 12-year-old Jonathan
began scavenging. Each moment spent working
is a step further away from his dreams. Unlike Jonathan, three of the Damiar children
are carrying on with their studies, but they're struggling to cope
with distance learning. Life is a constant struggle for 56-year-old
odd job labourer dad Dionisio. Armed with just a basic education, he could only find work
in contractual, blue-collar jobs. When jobs are not readily available, he'd go into the forest
in search of forest products to sell for some cash. Fourteen-year-old Judith is the brightest
among a family of five. She aspires to be a police officer so that she could earn a decent income to help ease
the family's financial burden. The Damiar family lives in a village that has very poor
or no Internet connections, so like 80% of Filipino families, they opted for what the government calls
""modular distance learning"". Under this scheme, teachers hand out and collect
paper-based modules at least once a week. These modules lay out
detailed instructions for studying and weekly assessments. It is designed
for learning on one's own, without a teacher's help. Key subjects
like English, Maths and Science are written in English, which makes self-learning
almost impossible for students like Judith. The Damiar family
is not an isolated case. A survey of 1,000 families conducted by the Movement for Safe,
Equitable, Quality, and Relevant Education reveals a pattern. One in every five students
had no one to guide them in their studies. One in 10 students
claim to fall behind in school. 12% of the parents indicate that at least one of their children
has stopped schooling. There are repeated problems. They couldn't answer the modules. Was there learning? I would say that we have poor education quality because of how we teach our students. Alone in her struggles, Judith's final marks sank, from a pre-pandemic average of 85 down to a slightly passing grade of 79. Printed modules were certainly
the most practical way of delivering and continuing
the delivery of education, but it probably was not the optimal when it comes to ensuring that
the children are actually learning as they were when going to school. How long will
this ""learning crisis"" continue? Will the economic downturn
and continuing school closures force these children
out of school forever? Life has taken
a sudden and unexpected turn for 19-year-old undergraduate
Juriel Natividad. It happened after his mum, Alma, who worked as a massage therapist
in the United Arab Emirates, lost her job in 2020
following the outbreak, and that has caused
a deep economic hardship and financial distress to the family. Juriel would have been in the second year
of his university education, had his mum not lost her job abroad. Nowadays, they can hardly afford
high-speed Internet to help him in his studies. So, he dropped out of school. So long as Juriel is out of school
and idle, he'd remain a burden to the economy. He doesn't have the qualification
or the necessary training to be a productive member of society. The youths should be
in either one of them. To be a productive member of society, they should soak up
all the human capital they can at this point so that in the future, they get better
labour market opportunities. But they also drop out of school, which means these are idle years, and ""idle years"" in this sense
means that they're not contributing to the human capital development for future benefits, so to speak. Juriel spends time
tending to the family's small store. The income can only cover
their daily needs. That's why Juriel is desperately
seeking a job, even though the odds
are heavily stacked against him. He's competing with
nearly four million other Filipinos currently unemployed
as a result of the pandemic. What we can infer from this is that other parts of the labour force
seems to already be recovering. The recovery process is already happening, but the youths are not
recovering as quickly. The Philippines is suffering from
its worst economic recession in decades. The country's economic managers say
it will take more than 10 years to return to pre-pandemic growth. So, whether Juriel goes back to school
or lands a job in these coming years remains uncertain for now. But what we know from past evidence,
or past recessions, is that there are scarring effects, and we literally use the term ""scarring"", which means that
individuals, or the youths, who enter the labour market
during a recession suffer permanent income losses,
at least for a decade. And it only dissipates. They only earn
as much as their counterparts who entered the labour market
during normal times after a decade. Juriel, however, lays the blame
squarely on the government. He feels that the government
is not doing enough to help young people like him
get out of their predicament. There is also a mental health crisis
unfolding among children, according to Save the Children,
a child rights advocate. Mental health effects
include mental and emotional stress, anxiety, depression and panic attacks. The students share that
these mental concerns were triggered by being overwhelmed
with the class and household duties, limited or lack of social interaction and inability to understand the lessons
for distance learning or difficulty in self-directed learning. Eighteen-year-old Maica's ordeal began with a simple misunderstanding
between her classmates when she accidentally deleted
her classmate's compiled essays on a shared document. Hostile arguments online involving insults
is called ""flaming"", a form of cyberbullying. Even before the pandemic, UNICEF estimates that cyber violence affects almost half
of Filipino children aged 13 to 17. One third of these cases
involve verbal abuse over cell phones. Cyberbullying is so much more insidious than traditional bullying, because physical bullying happens in places like schools
during a particular time and only a particular group
of people saw it, but for cyberbullying,
you don't know where it goes. For three months now, eating and sleeping
have become harder for Maica. The constant harassment
has also affected her studies. You don't want
a major part of the young generation having mental problems because... unless you have a very robust system
of dealing with them, that condition is going to
persist for life, and people are living longer. The Filipino youths
are suffering in silence. Distance learning has only done
more harm than good. Returning to face-to-face schools
would help mitigate the negative impact of a physical separation
between teachers and students. A pilot programme that would shift
its students back to the classroom has been approved by the president
only a month ago, but it will only take effect next month. For now, Filipino youths are forced
to endure their struggles with long-lasting consequences. We cannot continue
keeping our schools closed. Since the pandemic began
early last year, youth unemployment in the country
has swelled to 31.6%. That's about 1 in 6 young people
currently unemployed, and 19-year-old Juriel Natividad
is one of them. He can't find a proper job to help ease
the family's financial burden. He also can't go back to school because the family is just too poor
to support his university education. One way to help people like him is to encourage companies
to hire young workers. Something that we could look into is, for example, employer subsidies. Other countries in Europe that have persistently high levels
of youth unemployment, for example, Spain or Italy, have experimented with programmes
such as employer subsidies for those hiring youth workers. I don't think we have
that sort of programme right now, but that's something
that we should definitely look into. But that can only be done
once the economy, which has been severely battered
by the pandemic, is back on track. Before the onset
of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Philippines was poised
to become the next Asian tiger economy. It posted an average growth
of more than 6% annually for 9 years, but its economy is now faltering, and it would take years to recover
to pre-pandemic growth levels. That has put limits
on the government's capacity to deal with
the crisis of this magnitude while the children suffer. The issue really is our capacity to deal with the problem. People are saying that at this stage, it no longer makes sense to differentiate between
natural and political calamities. They're the same now. The damage of natural calamities depends on the capacity
of the people in authority to deal with them. Unless the children are educated, there is no hope for them
to improve their standing in life. There have been growing calls
from many quarters, including the UN Children's Fund, for schools to be reopened
and in-person learning to be resumed. The concern is prolonged closure
would further exacerbate the education crisis in the country, leading to more school dropouts
and youth unemployment. 47-year-old Dionisio Damiar's
biggest worry is his 10-year-old, Jane. Jane had to drop out of school
in her first grade, when she had only begun
to read and write. Eldest sister Judith is barely coping
with distance learning and has little time to spare
to tutor her sister, while dad Dionisio and mum Rowena
are undereducated themselves and are incapable
of guiding their child. Nowadays, Jane is helping her mum
at a small store while taking care of the family's newborn
at the same time. She has already missed
two years of learning. Young dropouts like her
are highly likely to stay out of school for the rest of their lives, and Jane would become
a permanent liability to her family and the country
if it stays that way. We have a young population. They will be taking their place
in the labour force. They will be able to be productive. Therefore, they will be able
to support the ageing population. But that is true only if that younger generation
is prepared to address the tasks
of the employment market, and without education, that ability is going to be
severely limited. Having dropouts is a significant issue. I'm not belittling
the importance of that problem, but you've got to take it
in the context of your responsibility for the larger population
that is also at risk, because if you don't do a good job
with the 26 million, they're going to be dropouts, and you'll have
that segment of the population becoming an even bigger drag
on the society. Saving the children's future
requires investment and innovation. The city of Navotas
has one of the lowest dropout rates and highest re-enrolment rates
in the country. It invested US$2.3 million
this school year so that learners like eight-year-old Brian
would be supplied with what he needs, like mobile phones,
prepaid credits and school supplies. Volunteers are also being mobilised
to help tutor students like him at least once a week. We're going to have to go in
what has been, for the country, the default position. We're going to have to rely, again,
on the private sector. We're going to have to rely
on NGOs and civil society organisations to supplement the ability
of the government to address these basic tasks. Even in the handling of the pandemic, it's really the private sector
that has taken a very strong lead in addressing the issues. Back in Manila city, an afternoon spent scavenging has only earned 12-year-old Jonathan
40 cents. It's barely enough
to buy a kilogram of rice. In this slum community, income, as well as help,
has dwindled. COVID-19 restrictions have prevented
outsiders from coming in to provide aid
to poor people like him. COVID-19 ravaged the gains
the Philippines had made in a decade, and the government's weak response
is failing its youth, leaving a generation and a country
unable to find its way. Captions: CaptionCube"

equivalent of six us dollars a day selling food but now he says he's happy if he's able to bring home four we've been hungry since march in the first two weeks of the lockdown we finished off the very little cash we had and since we couldn't really go out to work we just borrowed money many people here are in a similar position they used to be part of what the government calls the informal sector they are either self-employed or run businesses providing goods and services but now they tell us many people here have lost their jobs and some have resorted to begging and it isn't happening in the capital manila alone local survey shows at least seven million families have experienced hunger at least once in the past three months that's a record high of more than 30 percent the highest incidence of hunger since 2014. the survey comes as the country is well into its seventh month of community quarantine one of the longest ever implemented by a government in the world the philippine government imposed a lockdown when the coronavirus pandemic broke out but it pushed the country into one of its worst economic recessions in decades the government says it is doing the best it can it has given out cash to millions of filipinos and says it hopes to give more we are saddened about this that is why we are up in the economy to restart jobs and to generate more income for those most affected but others say more could be done there has been permanent damage done to livelihood to jobs and there needs to be a more sustained response to this problem i think we need to dispel that notion that there isn't enough funding there is funding it's just not being used in the more appropriate interventions there is enough funding for infrastructure projects of local politicians this is a community inside one of the country's top business districts people here tell us life has always been difficult but now they fear it is getting worse jamel allendogen al jazeera manila we're going to expand this discussion now with isabel fry director of the studies in poverty and inequality institute on skype from johannesburg isabel thank you for joining us why don't we talk specifically about south africa first of all an african country which was hit very hard and which already had to deal with inequality and haves and have-nots how much worse has it got in your opinion thanks kamal as you point out south africa was facing dire economic inequalities uh prior to the impact of kovitz so we had we have one of the highest inequalities in terms of income and wealth our poverty levels more than one in two people were living below the poverty line one in four people with daily starvation and in addition to that our unemployment in terms of formal unemployment was uh 40 and that was in the first quarter of 2020 what we've seen since the impact of the formal lockdown from march is skyrocketing levels of poverty and unemployment in fact unemployment figures were released earlier this morning what we've seen is that the former labor market itself has shrunk so far more people are now dependent on on livelihoods that they can scrape through inco informal economic activity unfortunately as a result of the fact that there is such widespread poverty there are very few people who can support the informal economy and so you have a very negative cycle of poverty which reinforces poverty and then of course the formal sector of the economy that very small um elite formal sector um continues to to grow with the commodity export um so we've seen that sorry to interrupt isabelle do people have any it's a strange word to use here but hope is there any hope that things could start to improve return to the levels they were if not get better at least get them back on an even footing it's a really important question and i think on a day-to-day basis that hope that might have been there um start with increasingly shrinks what we saw at the beginning of lockdown was a really strong response by the state the rollout of cash transfers to people um and the hope that that would increase with time what we've seen is that fewer and fewer people are actually becoming eligible for the receipt of this and so as the unemployment grows and the impact of unemployment on um sort of family uh handouts and that kind of of indirect support increases people's hope is becoming um far less strong in terms of future recovery obviously you specialize in south africa and africa but i think the the the problems that the government faces there are replicated in many other places and the simple fact they've gone into recessions money is not being generated and the amount of government can do can long term it could end up being quite limited it is a really tough situation what we see within the sadiq region is that a lot of the income is generated by commodity exports that continues but the question is how much of that is retained by the state in terms of tax as opposed to being taken out and beneficiated by countries uh globally i think that uh for our region the global supply chain is really precarious so the exports of a number of goods um such as cut flowers for instance uh that affects people's livelihood the question is also however political will and priorities if the state is determined to spend on people's well-being that kind of financial financing can be found whether it's global international funders and and all borrowers isabelle fry joining us from johannesburg we thank you very much for your time do appreciate it thank you

11,8dTelszbObM,Coronavirus: First death outside China reported in Philippines - BBC News,"The coronavirus continues to spread at speed. This time a week ago, there were under 3000 cases in China. There are now more than 17,000 - and more than 360 people have died. Outside China, there are more than 150 confirmed cases  - and a fatality in the Philippines.



Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog",2020-02-04,436874,2769,1371,UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA," well the corona virus continues to spread at speed this time a week ago they were under 3,000 cases in China there are now more than 17,000 and more than 360 people have died outside China there are more than 150 confirmed cases and we now have a fatality in the Philippines - and in a bid to contain this virus some countries are denying entry to any people from Wuhan the city where this virus began and China's accusing some countries of overreacting and stoking panic for example it's unimpressed that the US has declared a public health emergency and it's denying entry for all foreign nationals who visited the whole of China in the past two weeks and if that's the Americans this is what the World Health Organization is saying is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade we call on all countries to implement decisions that are evidence-based and consistent well in China millions of people are going back to work after the Lunar New Year holiday we have these pictures first of all you can see people well these are public areas being disinfected and we know that there have also been fever checks at Transport Hobbs to try and spot people with raised temperatures you may have the virus workers are also trying to disinfect these public spaces and China is urging and issued an urgent appeal for more protective suits goggles and masks because it's running low most of these pictures from Manila in the Philippines there's been a rush to buy face masks they're after a man from Wuhan died and then this is Hong Kong where hospital staff are going on strike they want the border with mainland China to be completely shot well next let's focus on the experience of being in the city of Wuhan it remains on lockdown people aren't being allowed to leave or come in and those who are there are being encouraged to stay at home we spotted this one Russian man who works there and film this one around 5:00 p.m. Sunday on his 3d can see only fake people say people here eight people there and remember that new hospital that was promised in Wuhan well it's finished this is a time-lapse of it being constructed in nine days it's now admitting patients and these images have been enthusiastically distributed by a Chinese state TV it's also been showing this graphic as well a cartoon with the machinery involved in that construction being hailed as heroes there are other images circulating on Chinese social media fan art featuring these machines a lot of it created by people stuck inside cities currently locked down so here's one digger with a big love heart in front of it or you've got this one here and this one's been given a nickname the cement king now several countries are trying to get their citizens out of Wuhan let's focus on Australia these are Australian evacuees waiting for hours at we had an airport before eventually being flown out eighty nine children were among those on board that's the first plane of Australian citizens and permanent residents to be flown out and this is where the plane landed in Western Australia but before passengers were put onto those what they'd landed there they were put onto smaller planes and immediately taken here to Christmas Island it's very much known for a large immigration detention center which you can see there this will be used to house the Australians in quarantine they're expected to be there for two weeks you also have these images released by channel 7 which shows some of the medical facilities that have been put up there you can see here an inflatable room to be used for isolating any potential confirmed cases of the virus it's known as a negative pressure because it allows fresh air in but stops potentially contaminated air from getting out well since 2003 asylum thousands of asylum seekers have been detained on Christmas Island well off the mainland of Australia under Australia's refugee policy at the moment though it just houses a family of four Sri Lankans who are fighting deportation so the plan here is to house the Australians who've been taken out of Wuhan and house them on the island in the short term but there are concerns particularly whether there are adequate medical facilities indeed not all of the 600 Australians and Wuhan have chosen to leave his woman who did woman who did leave explaining why she said I got a lot of pressure from my husband he said the situation is not very good all the other countries have starts to close the borders he said if we stay over here would probably take a couple of months to get out of Wuhan so he started to get really nervous and she got on the flight four flights carrying evacuees are now scheduled for the rest of this week now two other important parts of this story are misinformation and racism we spotted this post it's been widely shared in Australia supposedly from an organization called the department of disease geology Parramatta except that it doesn't exist and the information in it advising people to stay away from suburbs with large Chinese populations is baseless I saw this from a doctor in Australia she tweeted a patient made jokes about not shaking my hand because of coronavirus in frota might my team had not left Australia this is not sensible Public Health precautions this is racism well on infamous information and conspiracy theories around the coronavirus here's will summer a tech journalist from The Daily Beast we're seeing a lot of these these fake claims you know whether it's you know drinking bleach to ward it off or the idea that this is spread from Chinese people eating bats you know these frankly you know many of these these ideas are frankly very racist that are blowing up on social media so so it's it's tricky you know we've seen some tweets from even epidemiologist people who are experts in this field get taken out of context and really blow up online by people who are you know can very concerned about coronavirus so you know the solution I think is very responsible reporting and in people really you know going to the experts on this rather than you sort of seeing what's going viral and running with that boy so this article by journalist called Angela hoy written in the metro newspaper in this article she highlights some of the media coverage she's taken exception to for instance this is the Herald Sun in Australia it has the headline Chinese virus pandemonium with the word panda highlighted and she's also written about her personal experiences here in London in particular one incident on the underground a white man about in their twenties thirties sits down next meme and then immediately shoots back up and gets up and then like mutters under his breath like oh not so next to a corona virus and then sits a croc goes across the carriage and then sits somewhere else and at the time I was just like kind of taken aback beligum that really just happened and not really thinking too much about it and didn't really say anything at the time because it's a little bit in shock and also I didn't really want to kick up a fuss about anything because is this yeah I think that's what happened and now you've shared this story have other people come to you and said well actually I've experienced something similar yeah actually like quite a few people have you know experienced the same thing the problem was when the corona virus like broke out it was around like Lunar New Year as well so a lot of people weren't allowed to go back to go back home and visit family because a lot of people were locked down and it was quite sad as well in Chinatown many people in Chinatown like London yeah a London Chinatown a lot of people didn't you know we're avoiding the area because of you know fear of Oh catching something or catching coronavirus and I never girl that I spoke to she was also on the tube and then she saw a man that she witnessed man like holding a newspaper and then there was like a group of East Asians that just got on the tube and he was just like using a newspaper tonight covered his face and like like this kind of thing getting away from them and then as soon as they got off the tube and he just kind of relaxed and it was just this I think it's just kind of really sad that everyone's being lumped together it doesn't really matter if you're East Asian Southeast Asian you know everyone's kind of lumped together it doesn't mean you know regardless maybe if you're trying to use a lot which is the sad thing I think and in your article you were just talking about your personal experience you're also highlighting some of the media coverage that you've taken issue with have you been surprised by the tone that you've seen in some newspapers I'm surprised because I feel like a lot of like East Asian like it's just nation is just not really reported on and it's always is often ignored and I think these scare mongering headlines are just you know thinking the worst and it's making everyone think and think irrationally and do irrational things and it's just you know cause I look like a frenzy where everyone's just scared and yeah I think it's just very unfairly the way that everything's been reported and there's much more information on the coronavirus via the BBC News website"

13,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,COVID-19 In Philippines: The Starving Urban Poor. What Went Wrong? | Insight | Poverty In Asia,"The people in the Philippines are suffering from one of the toughest and longest lockdowns in the world. As the government struggles to deal with the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, the ultra-strict quarantine and social distancing measures which have now stretched to more than half a year, have left the economy on its knees. The move has also left millions of people jobless and hungry. The dire situation has now pushed millions of people to the brink of starvation. Why did the pandemic hit the poorest of poor so hard? With the Philippine economy slipping into its worst recession in decades, can the poor pull themselves out from the crushing poverty? Will their cries for help be heard?

have left more than 5 million filipinos hungry [Music] more than 10 million people have lost their jobs and their livelihoods destroyed me uh why did the pandemic hit the poorest of the poor so hard when a crisis like this hits an equal society like the philippines it's like amplifying the inequality in the social divide so the poor are bearing the brunt of an equal distribution of the impacts of this crisis as the philippine economy is crashing into its worst recession in decades how can the country's poor pull themselves out of the crushing poverty [Music] manila the capital city of the philippines a business hub plagued by economic disparity as the city progresses 35 percent of its population or more than 4 million still reside in slums they are laborers who have to contend with meager incomes of less than two dollars a day and now manila has become the new epicenter for the coronavirus outbreak in southeast asia with slums considered as viral hotbeds for the transmission of the disease space is a luxury for the rich so the poor they live in small homes in crowded congested communities the vulnerability of course with any sort of infectious disease it's the enclosed space the post interaction the amount of people you're interacting with uh the poor really have it worse in in in the normal time they also have it worse i think in times of crisis right now [Music] but the country's urban poor is facing a fear far more frightening than kovid the fear of starvation [Music] as work and incomes dry up starvation is forcing the urban poor to cope in unthinkable ways midnight at one of manila's biggest slums 64 year old bernadette sablazar and her neighbor elena perena together with elena's 16 year old daughter leia breach quarantine restrictions in search of food as an elderly bernadette is required to stay at home and like her teenage leia is also not allowed to be outside of her residence yet in spite of all the restrictions they're venturing out during curfew hours and risk being caught but they're too hungry to care for rules foreign they're braving their way to divisoria manila's largest public market to scavenge for vegetable scrap or collect leftover goods freely handed out by generous sellers the lockdown has crippled elena and bernadette's ability to work and earn an income bernadette is an egg seller who used to earn 15 u.s dollars a day elena is a freelance massage therapist who could earn up to 30 us dollars on good days she was doing well enough to even put up a small store to help with the family's daily spend but everything just fell apart during the first week of the lockdown elena's family was forced to consume every foodstock they had in this small store the crisis has damaged significantly damaged the asset base of urban pool street vendors couldn't sell on the streets jeepney drivers pedicab drivers tricycle drivers couldn't operate couldn't go out and pick up passengers so it would be very difficult for them to recover economically from this crisis [Music] like bernadette and elena many filipinos experienced hunger amid the lockdown in fact the philippines hunger incidence rate is at its highest in six years according to the social weather station a non-profit research institution the poll reveals that 20.9 percent or 5.2 million filipino families have experienced involuntary hunger at least one in the past three months of the quarantine period [Music] after four hours elena bernadette and leia have collected more than enough to tide them through the next two days and are planning on giving their extras around their neighborhood the philippine government has come in with aid to help mitigate the problem of hunger among the people a week after announcing its quarantine measures philippine president rodrigo duterte signed into law a package of emergency cash subsidy to 18 million low-income families beneficiaries will receive at least 100 u.s dollars to a maximum of 165 u.s dollars each month for two months city governments and village leaders were given a month to distribute the aid and aid had to reach swiftly but many like elena didn't receive her subsidy right away even after waiting for more than a month me borrowed just enough money to purchase rice christmas depression [Music] if not for these loans as well as elena's risky venture to the market earlier today her family could have fallen very ill or worse die of starvation [Music] foreign [Music] lockdown is the government doing enough to alleviate their pain will help come in time before the situation spirals out of control [Music] so soon after announcing a nationwide lockdown president rodrigo duterte signed into law the social amelioration program or sap under the sap the government provides 18 million low-income families with a much needed emergency cash subsidy each beneficiary will receive at least 100 us dollars each month for two months city governments and village leaders were given a month to distribute the aid the distribution had to be swift so that aid gets to the more vulnerable segments of the population as an urban poor elena perena qualifies as a beneficiary for the social amelioration program she was expecting to receive the promised first month cash subsidy immediately but help didn't come along until two months after aid was not only slow but it was also very little elena received only 138 u.s dollars on her first month of subsidy equivalent to about four days of her usual daily income is the emergency cash subsidy is only about a quarter of what a family of five actually needs in a month to get by based on current estimates by economists and urban poor advocates well the thing is the subsidy was not meant to be like a cure-all it was just meant to be a a partial subsidy so and we have to recognize also that government has its own risk constraints they don't have infinite money elena's problem is even more dire that's because she has 10 children and 13 grandchildren living under the same roof except for one all of them don't earn an income after their employers had temporarily ceased their businesses the government claims it has nothing left to extend its subsidies but the harsher reality is elena's family are much better off than most other families had waited for far much longer to receive their first month emergency cash subsidies three months into the lockdown five million families are still wondering if their raid is ever going to come the majority waited so long and also the trash they got was next to nothing it is equivalent to about nine pesos per person per day over the last five months you can't do anything with that a huge cause of delay a random distribution of aid we also we've heard a lot about irregularities in the distribution some local officials were prioritizing their own relatives their own probably friends they would prioritize their friends because we have a very weak democratic system that hardly works in some areas and that of course affects the poor who are supposedly benefiting fairly from the distribution but some of them were not able to receive this assistance because they were not part of that patreon client system in their area under the law an irregularity like this is a criminal offence on the second month of the lockdown the national government received more than 2 000 complaints against village council officials for the delay in the distribution of aid currently the philippine prosecutor's office have charged 134 officials with various graft related cases 50 officers are now suspended from office but the crux of the matter is local governments are also facing systemic problems the philippines has barely begun transitioning to a national id system though a newly created law mandates it that's why city governments had to rely on an outdated list of their constituents based on a national census that was held five years ago as a result many filipinos have been excluded during the pandemic even if we wanted to have universal cash transfers we couldn't because there was no mechanism there is no way for us to locate any everybody now nearly six months after announcing provisions for emergency cash subsidies the government has given the second month subsidy to almost 95 percent of beneficiaries the original sin with the social administration program is that the government was so stingy about it you did not get a sense that they wanted to help as many people as quickly as possible elena is unsure if her second month subsidy is coming in the meantime elena's deaths are piling up she currently owes about 100 us dollars from friends on top of utility bills she has to pay salomon in elena's family has also become too poor to protect themselves against covid19 [Music] the philippines is known to have one of the most restrictive lockdowns in the world a special pass was needed to move around to buy essential goods those who violate the curfew and social distancing measures or fail to wear a mask will be punished they range from fines to detention mass gatherings like protests are banned but on the third week of the lockdown a hundred filipinos gathered at edsa a main thoroughfare where historic protests happen sixty-four-year-old caesar galamosa was one of them as an elderly he's not allowed outside of his residence but caesar is desperate he lives from paycheck to paycheck after he lost his blue-collar job foreign famished caesar decided to join his neighbors at edsa he arrived at nine in the morning there was no relief distribution in sight later a team of police arrived to disperse the crowd driven into a corner time and options are running out for the urban poor will the government be able to deliver a solution or will anger spill out into the streets [Music] three weeks into the philippine lockdown a commotion over food aid erupted at edsa one of manila's main thoroughfares a day before the incident rumors spread across the slum village of san roque that a sack of rice would be given out as aid at edsa although mass gatherings are banned about 300 people turned up the following day soon the police arrived and advised them to disperse but driven by desperation 64 year old caesar villamosa stayed on you know the pandemic really put a strain on the poor they are already the most vulnerable they put a strain on the floor because absolutely poor would not want to get sick as much as possible they don't want to be sick because they know it's going to cost money they know it's going to stop them from working the poor do not want to get sick but they will risk life and limb if they're not going to be able to money that's how caesar ended up in detention for five days together with 20 others they were charged with five cases allegedly in violation of quarantine rules and health emergencies these offences could have put them in detention for six months in the philippines violations are quite commonplace since the lockdown was implemented in mid-march more than 300 000 quarantine violators were apprehended by authorities violators were warned fined detained or charged most of these violators come from impoverished families the night of the commotion philippine president rodrigo duterte addressed the country about the incident he suspected that leftist insurgents were behind it and promised to act tough against the room among us [Music] there is no understanding there is no social consideration there is no value being given to the life that is supposed to be saved that is the most difficult part for me to understand you enforce a quarantine because you want to save lives you want to save lives by spreading by by stopping the spread of disease and yet here we are here is the government having very little consideration for that life it just goes against the grain the very green for humanity caesar and the other 20 detainees are now out on bail paid for by two influential celebrities it cost more than 6400 us dollars to release them an amount they could not have raised by themselves fortunately they also received free legal assistance if not for these caesar and his family would have no choice but to accept the punishment but caesar continues to confront his worsening poverty day by day nearly six months into the lockdown he and his daughter are still waiting for a job he also faces a pile of debts and the prospect of eviction from his rented home even as they're trying to cope with the problem of starvation [Music] ironically many urban poor come to manila in search of a better life away from rural poverty but even in the city life has been a constant struggle covet 19 has threatened to displace nearly 11 million workers from the informal sectors and erase years of progress on poverty alleviation the truth is there are not enough policies and mechanisms to help pull the poor out of their poverty but also i think because people are seeing how unequal the philippines is and how problematic our politics is i think we are in the middle of a moment people are actually asking is this the government we deserve are these economic policies we need why are people so bad off the philippines has been fighting chronic poverty since the late 1960s for decades the nation had always been dubbed as the sick man of asia but a series of economic reforms in early 2000 paved the way for growth from opening country to country international trade foreign direct investments like business process outsourcing as well as hospitality and tourism in 2013 the philippine economy finally gained strength the world bank described the philippines as asia's rising tiger with its gdp rising steadily the philippines was no longer the sick man of asia but a breakout nation with one of the most promising economies in the world philippine poverty rates were finally going down but it was just numbers these income indicators actually one don't fail to capture so many other dimensions of poverty but secondly i think it's the worst thing for us it's actually used to hide high levels of poverty we have the richest 50 filipinos having a combined wealth of 4.1 trillion pesos which is equivalent to the combined wealth the poorest 60 to 70 million filipinos that doesn't make sense a clear evidence of uneven exclusionary growth is right in the slums the urban poor have been struggling to own homes in the last 10 years caesar's informal settlement has been defying eviction and demolition about six thousand families live on this government-owned property but a part of this real estate has been sold to a private developer with no plan of resettling its slum dwellers is so while gdps have been rising job opportunities and better labor conditions among the urban poor are barely improving many of the urban poor remain as workers in the informal economy as drivers of jeepneys and brick shores street peddlers owners of small convenience stores or manual laborers in the construction industry statisticians and economists estimate that at least 62 percent of filipinos are working in the informal economy that's about 30 million informal workers suffering through decades of income inequality you also have a lot of workers who don't have legal protection of the law but they are still there they you know the street vendors the tricycle drivers the barkers of jeepneys they are workers they are contributing to the economy but they are not part of the mantle of legal environment it's no wonder the urban poor like elena bernadette and caesar are the most vulnerable during the pandemic the urban poor like them already had it worst before covert 19 as mere daily wage earners without safety nets and social protection i'm still calling this pandemic as in a way as low as a form of slow moving disaster why because disasters or crises don't exist in a vacuum in the case of the philippines we have very weak democratic institutions and for us to be able to manage this well to begin with this has reached this level this unprecedented level because i think it was poorly managed from the start the philippine government wants to recover from the pandemic by providing corporate tax breaks and loans to smes but so far they've been silent on how to help the urban poor in the informal sector or perhaps there is really none at all now the urban poor are resorting to self-help while a new sector is plunging into poverty but how much can they do to solve their financial and health worlds [Music] in manila philippines the urban poor are left on their own to survive through the pandemic [Music] in san roque an informal settlement with roughly 30 000 residents many have been jobless throughout the six month long quarantine in place of their jobs the city government helped to distribute rice to local residents [Music] m to solve hunger in their community fair sidco decided to help in a community kitchen the non-profit organizations helped to raise funds to kick-start this initiative they established 28 community kitchens throughout san roque providing breakfast to 3 000 residents aside from this kitchen the non-profit organizations helped pull together community health volunteers like jelen rossilo as most of them are under-educated volunteer doctors taught them about how to respond to the threat of covet-19 infections and what they can do to avoid falling ill but they have a more important task volunteers like gellin look out for covert 19 symptoms around the neighborhood and deliver food to those under quarantine in closed and congested places where covet virus would most likely thrive mass testing at san roque hasn't even begun the residents also claimed that government healthcare workers avoided their slum community they've been told that government frontliners lack personal protective equipment or ppe too that's why most residents feared for their lives so from the point of view of individual vulnerability the poor is already vulnerable their their immune system is low they're not they're not eating the food that they need to survive and they don't have the rest mandatory precautionary measures like safe distancing hand washing hand sanitation and mask wearing are luxuries for slum dwellers is [Music] relied on private donations to assist her community but nearly six months into quarantine help has stopped coming in foreign [Music] back in the community kitchens funds are also running out no new pledges have come in chalita's community kitchen used to feed 75 people five times a week now they are down to 35 twice a week [Music] this week's feeding will actually be the last hungry as she may be chelita had not been eating from meals they'd prepared that's because she feels others need the food more than her i know [Music] but community volunteers like faye is not giving up she decided to grow vegetables on her backyard to be a food source whenever someone asks for help at the end of the day if this community kitchens dry up and we stop providing food the government has to come in uh at the end of the day it's their responsibility to provide relief and to help the struggling urban poor in their own vicinity in their own city so if the government is not part of that it's like you are exonerating the state from its responsibility to provide the needed assistance especially of the urban people there's only so much that kellen can do to protect herself if she gets infected with covet 19 she will not receive any free treatment the national government extends help to those who contribute to estate health insurance but gellan is too poor to make the voluntary contributions [Music] foreign as many of the urban poor struggle on their own through the community quarantine another sector of society is increasingly desperate jeepney drivers are resorting to begging or protesting to go back to work jeepneys are the most popular transportation in the philippines it's known for its crowded seating so the government allows less than five percent of jeepneys to ply through the roads as a containment measure well if we're looking at their numbers there's more than i think 170 000 jeepney units nationwide so you're talking about 170 000 families nationwide relying on the jeepney industry so you multiply that by what five or six members so we're talking about close to 1 million people relying on the jeepney industry alone and if we're not serious with listening to their demand or at least hitting their appeal then it's like you're basically ignoring one [Music] section of your population now in just six months jeepney drivers have fallen into poverty [Music] chito bustamente had been driving a jeep for more than a decade to save up for his dream home now he is not only out of work chito has also no house to live in had to rely on loan sharks to help supplement his unstable income and send his seven children to school income [Music] 19 year old trisha is honorario's eldest daughter who has a year left before finishing her engineering degree all she wants is to graduate from a university be gainfully employed and help her father honorario in sending [Music] adding to their worries is a contentious government plan to phase out jeepneys they require jeepney owners like honorario and chito to upgrade to environmentally friendly vehicles but it's an investment they cannot afford they're still paying loans for the current jeepneys they own the government hasn't extended assistance to jeepney drivers like chito and honorario except for emergency cash subsidies it's also unclear if they will ever get back on the roads even when covert 19 is over we know at the end of the day gp drivers will be displaced um we do agree there is a need to modernize gps but there's a way to more than sgp's without leaving the poor and vulnerable drivers behind again it involves the government subsidizing the transition and that's the basic demand of gp drivers amidst these uncertainties honorario's children suffer the most trisha's dreams are put on hold as honorario was forced by circumstances to drop his children out of school family now sells native delicacies to enable the family to eat three times a day while cheeto has to find other ways to put food on the table the only recourse is to scavenge for junk foreign while strangers fear him chito actually has fears too he worries about getting infected from the junk he collects for this morning he traded the stash he's collected for one us dollar and 50 cents it's enough to buy him a kilo of rice the government isn't doing enough that's why they're so dismissive because they know the filipino poor have suffered so much through all the years they will survive it's not a question of them recovering even if pushing the ground they will try their best to make do with what they have poverty is a vicious cycle a self-perpetuating condition that can't simply be broken without external help caught in a daily struggle for survival before the pandemic that challenge was almost insurmountable but a crippling lockdown brought on by covert 19 has turned that challenge into a huge battle against hunger and hopelessness how long can the poor hold on to hope before starvation takes over how long more shall they wait before their cries for help give way into silence [Music] [Music] you

It’s estimated that over 10 million Filipinos lost their jobs and livelihoods to the pandemic. Many are starving, especially those living in slums. 
 
16-year-old Leia lives with her mother, 23 other siblings, nieces and nephews in a slum at Tondo, Manila. In order to feed herself and her family, she breaks quarantine restrictions to look for food scraps and leftover produce in markets. 
 
While community initiatives have tried to help the urban poor, donations are quickly drying up in this extended six-month lockdown.

32,o1kPskxFkQ8,Coronavirus: Philippines introduces stricter COVID-19 lockdown measures amid surge in cases,"Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte said Sunday his government would introduce a stricter lockdown in the capital Manila as it attempts to reign in a surge in COVID-19 cases.

Duterte said Manila and nearby provinces would be placed under a two-week enhanced community quarantine that would remain in effect until Aug. 18. Some businesses and public transit will be closed during the period and work and quarantine passes would be required as movements are restricted
.
The enhanced measures come after local groups representing some 80,000 doctors and a million nurses called for tighter controls, claiming the country was losing the battle against the novel coronavirus pandemic.

The Philippines recorded 5,032 additional COVID-19 infections on Sunday-- the country’s largest single-day increase-- bringing the total number of cases in the island nation to more than 100,000. The death toll is now above 2,000.

""You choose, vaccine or I will have you jailed,"" Duterte said in a televised address on Monday.

""You get vaccinated, or I will order all the village heads to have a tally of all the people who refuse to get vaccinated. Because if not I will inject them with Ivermectin which is intended for pigs,"" Duterte added.

Duterte's remarks contradict those of his health officials who have said that while people are urged to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, it was voluntary.

Many residents in Manila were displeased with the threat, saying it was wrong and harsh to force those who choose not to get vaccinated.

Because we have this vaccine now, we feel fully protected when we go on duty. I feel hopeful that this pandemic will end soon and that I can finally go home to my 3-year-old son and husband and hug them, kiss them. That’s the advantage I feel with this vaccine as a healthcare worker.

With this vaccine, we feel that we are protected and that we also protect our patients. As health workers, we must not be the carrier, we must be the one protecting patients. We must not get infected so that we can continue our service as healthcare workers.”

#Manila #Philippines #Covid19",2021-08-14,251701,2343,1173,UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg, the more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus has spread across the philippines bringing the death toll to a four-month high the country has seen more than 29 000 deaths and nearly 1.7 million infections in an attempt to slow the spread of covid the capital manila has been placed under the tightest quarantine curbs as residents fight for two things they badly need right now a vaccine and economic assistance for those struggling to make a living in manila direct government aid like this is a lifeline the pandemic has shattered their livelihoods each household is entitled to up to 4 000 pesos or about 68 euros with the money they hope to survive the ongoing lockdown i'll use the cash to buy food for myself because i live alone i don't have my own house and my living space is very small i work as domestic help and my daily wage is only 100 pesos that's just enough for me to eat since last week manila and several other cities have been back in lockdown as the highly contagious delta variant drives a steep rise in infections for now residents can only leave home for essential shopping some worry the curbs could damage the fragile economic recovery in the philippines every other day we are only allowed to work every other day that's why business is bad fearing even tighter restrictions thousands have flocked to vaccination centers like this in the capital many believed misinformation that supermarkets would be off limits for anyone without a jab since there was panic among the people because of fake news our mayor decided to extend the vaccination until midnight or early morning so that people would no longer congregate in the morning for others getting a job means greater health and job security this is a big help for us working in the morning we mingle with a lot of people so this vaccination is for the safety of everyone as well but there's still a way to go on that road to safety just 10 of the population has been vaccinated so far as the delta variant continues to search the philippines is digging in for a protracted battle we have journalist jc gotinga joining us jc it's great to have you back on dw news asia well it's great to be here thanks for having me melissa now you're in manila right now tell us a bit more about how it feels to be in the city well frankly it's tiring it's gotten tiring people are tired we are now in the third major lockdown and mind you we've been in some form of lockdown since march of last year when the pandemic began it's just that when the case loads stabilize then the government kind of loosens the restrictions a bit but we've always been under some form of community quarantine that's the catchphrase here and people are tired and especially because they don't see much of a new strategy or plan from the government on how to combat the pandemic and people are now getting desperate to get vaccinated of course to protect themselves and be able to go out and provide for their families and they're also desperate for government aid which doesn't cover everybody it just includes a segment of the population the poorer segment of the population and at twenty dollars per person it doesn't cover much honestly so it doesn't sound like a lot of people would rate the government highly when it comes to its performance combating the pandemic yes um well the the the general sentiment here is that the government has done quite poorly in addressing this pandemic it has hinged the approach to vaccination but there are too few shipments of vaccines coming in and those vaccines that are on hand well the rollout is rather slow because there aren't enough resources and manpower to be able to open new vaccination centers so people tend to crowd around whatever centers are available and then to add to all that are issues of politics and even corruption just the other day state auditors flagged 67 billion pesos or about 1.5 billion dollars worth of what they call deficient funds from the department of health basically what it means is these funds were either not spent or were spent but are not accounted for and they could have gone to the government's pandemic response effort it's a huge scandal here in the philippines now and the government has not been able to satisfactorily explain it now i want to talk about vaccines one of the things we've seen play out has been the struggle for developing countries to obtain vaccines good ones that work because we know that the chinese sino-vac and cynofarm once have lower efficacy rates what is the philippines using and has it been difficult to get them the huge bulk of vaccines available here is the sign of that one and like you said there is considerable hesitancy and reservation as to how effective they are especially since uh it's assumed that what's driving this current surge in new infections is that more virulent delta variant of the coronavirus uh just to illustrate that point some people delayed signing up for the job to wait for the more reputable brands like pfizer and moderna to come in and when they did come in people came out in droves and lined up causing considerable chaos in some vaccination centers so safe to say it's really hard to get a vaccine here you have to fall under certain categories either you're a health worker you're a frontline worker you're elderly or you are in firm otherwise you are not even qualified to sign up for the job yet and even when you do sign up for one you have to be you have to wait weeks or even months to get that call from your local government to go and line up sounds very very frustrating jc gotenga thank you so much for joining us you

46,xV1oR-RbOGU,Philippines: COVID-19 vaccination challenges expected,"The global rush to buy coronavirus vaccines is under way.
But while wealthier countries have already done deals with manufacturers, those with smaller budgets are struggling to secure early supplies.
The Philippine government plans to vaccinate up to 60 percent of the country’s population to achieve herd immunity. 
But in an archipelago with more than 7,000 islands and a national budget for vaccines that is barely enough, officials admit it will not be easy.

55,lczwrm68u6I,🇵🇭 COVID-19: Could the Philippines see an India-style surge? | The Stream,"The Philippines is in the throes of one of the worst Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia, topping one million total infections last week. 
 
The country now has the second-highest number of infections and deaths in Southeast Asia after Indonesia and health experts are warning of a possible ""India-style"" wave. 

Although the government has struggled to obtain vaccine supplies, vaccine hesitancy is proving a bigger challenge. According to a March survey by Pulse Asia, six out of 10 Filipinos expressed safety concerns and were therefore unwilling to get immunized. In an attempt to assuage those fears, Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte last week received his first vaccine dose live on Facebook.

Rights group Amnesty International says what it calls the government's inadequate response to the pandemic amounts to ""a serious human rights issue."" 
 
In this episode of The Stream, we talk to those on the frontline and ask them what is needed to address the surge and keep the healthcare system from crumbling.

talking about the philippines and the situation there earlier we spoke to gyorgy engelbrecht from the international crisis group and this is what he told us so the philippines is not a stranger to disasters they can be natural or human-made hazards but kobe 19 is a different type of beast the virus does not only attack the fragile health system of the country the economy was hit as well showcasing the rifts between rich and poor meanwhile higher food prices are exerting an additional strain prospects for economic recovery are uncertain with presidential elections coming next year filipinos will also cast a vote on government's performance resilience in the communities remain strong but how long can this resilience last and its continuing challenges and an uncertain future that was one analyst perspective but what is yours you can join our conversation by jumping into the youtube comments section and asking our guests your questions so let's talk to the guests let's say hello dr pauline convocal hello doctor nice to see you hello ambassador hello emmeline as well welcome to the stream dr convocal introduce yourself to our international audience tell everybody who you are and what you do good day everyone thank you family for the introduction and also i'm dr pauline conwakar i'm the immediate past president of the philippine college of emergency medicine and i am an active clinician so i'm currently going on duty as an attending emergency physician in many hospitals here in the metro and two other hospitals in the region thanks for joining us hello ambassador welcome please introduce yourself to our global audience yes i'm jose mourinhos i'm the philippine ambassador to washington d.c welcome hello emily nice to have you tell everybody who you are what you do very important for today's conversation hi and thank you femi uh my name is emerilyne hill i'm the deputy director for research of amnesty international and i'm also a filipino lawyer welcome doctor i am looking at some pictures that you sent us from earlier on you were working earlier on today and i'm just looking at these two pictures what are we seeing here how do we know this is a surge okay so it has already been really declared that there's a surge so there were really sustained um spikes in the numbers we have we're seeing increased uh trends for the past three a month even and what you're seeing here are the tents um that for patients that are waiting to be taken inside the formal emergency department so this is part of the expansion of the capacity of our hospital to take in patients and they're waiting in line to vacant beds inside the hospital you're very kind because you've obviously protected the the identity of many of these people who are really suffering this doesn't even look like a hospital this looks like a temporary setup there are now field hospitals temporary hospitals in manila because doctor oh okay so um since we've been seeing surges and increasing trends obviously we can't take them all in so we just have to make do with uh whatever it is that we have so we have to put up tents increase our capacity by expanding space um adding more beds um even if this will be only in makeshift beds or even in wheelchairs so that i will still be able to attend to these patients outside our formal emergency departments emelina i'm really curious because we've all been in this global pandemic for over a year now but when when we use the phrase or the term surge that means something cause diff is different emilyn are you seeing something different in terms of your family your friends your relatives back at home definitely so as i said earlier i am a filipino lawyer i've been working as an international human rights lawyer for years but i am still very much a filipino lawyer and i have my family and my friends are still in the philippines and for the last few two weeks at least six friends of mine have passed away um because of kovid and this is really very that's not even counting um family members of friends so this is this is really concerning for me because again this is not about people who cannot afford um health care facilities but it's really now just a matter of people cannot access healthcare facilities because there is not enough to go around ambassador i want to bring you into the conversation but first i would like to play a little clip this is rosette liquette she's a hospital director and uh we just got this comment from her a little bit earlier so we can understand what is going on in hospitals particularly in manila have a listen have a look ambassador every hospital at the ncr especially the government hospitals they are now struggling we noted an increase in the number of cases just as we note that increase in the number of health workers being positive no in the past especially in the past since march ambassador who is running the covet 19 i would say the fight for covert 19 in the philippines who is in charge of that who is doing that practically down on the ground well the task force is actually headed by secretary carnitos galvez he's the one in charge and he's the one that i've been in touch with on a regular basis basically to help in procuring the vaccines coming from the united states i totally understand the situation in the philippines i know that it is really very critical and our health care system has uh is is really and it's a very critical stage right now and to me i i can really see that obviously the only solution or the light at the end of the tunnel that we've always been hearing are the vaccines and this is exactly what we're trying to do as far as we're concerned here in washington d.c uh talking to the pharmaceutical companies we've been in touch with them for more than a year now well almost a year actually and it's unfortunate that the supplies uh for for the vaccines especially coming from here has been very very tight and it's only recently that president biden approved vaccines to be made available for the world especially specifically the pfizer that can be exported now from the united states so this is really the work that we're doing here as far as the kovite 19 response is concerned our audience wants to speak to you uh ambassador and also doctor so i'm going to put this youtube comment to you this is from dr waterforos thank you for being part of the show dr furrows dr frost says my main concern is that for how long are we going to live like this is there any light at the end of the tunnel why isn't the who responding appropriately let me start with you doctor and then go to the ambassador for a response doctor light at the end of the tunnel what are you seeing are you seeing any light yeah i i have to agree with the ambassador that um indeed the vaccines is really the hope and the light at the end of the tunnel but we have to do something right now since we have a problem right now we have long queues there's crowding really in the emergency departments and it may be a grim picture of the current situation of the philippines and that vaccine serves as hope for all of us healthcare workers and the general public that um it may it may pull us out from the situation but currently the demand really and the crisis of the people really is that what must be done right now so all of those congestion all of those inadequacies in the field so they're really asking for help um on when where to seek help for access for the hospitals emeline go ahead did i jump in very quickly um because um indeed i agree with ambassador and agree with dr konbokar that vaccines are very important but um i think it's not it's only just one part of addressing this crisis this what's happening in the philippines now actually exposes the frailty of our health care system and how neglected our health care system has been for many many years and our sense always is that it has never been a framework by the philippine government and even with previous administrations it has never been um the healthcare system has never been seen from the lens as a human right as a right to health so um you you see facilities you see healthcare workers who are underpaid and who would rather go abroad to seek a better life to get paid better so vaccines is just one point but then emeline overall system let me let me bring this to you because this is really important this is something that that a conversation that is also happening on youtube so i want to bounce it off of you so sleeping panda says i'm concerned about the lack of adequate action by the government how filipino nurses are flocking to other developed countries because they're not getting adequately compensated in the philippines does that count as a human right definitely can you explain so um why are filipino some of them are actually many of them are my friends they're watching now friends who are in the united states working as nurses so i asked them to watch this show and many of them actually flee or go to the united states or here in london because they don't get adequate um they don't get adequately paid for their services for their skills in the philippines so in order to have a comfortable life in order to be able to pay for necessities in life they have to go somewhere else and that is definitely a lot of human rights rolled into one it does not only mean um an impact on the health care system in the philippines but it also goes to the human rights of the people who are not paid well so that they have to go to other countries in order to be paid well ambassador i have seen reports of the military you're talking about the task force the kobe task force in the philippines the military being accused of overstepping their power overstepping what they should be doing during a global pandemic how did you see those stories do you feel that there's any credibility to those stories and those complaints about the military well i'm not quite sure about what are they doing but i know that the the government is at least initially when they put on the lockdowns they needed to have obviously persons in authority to be able to implement that and the military was tasked to to be one of those in the front lines to be able to implement the laptops i think for a while it was successful but in the end obviously the the economy is starting to show with signs of of really becoming again critical a critical situation especially for the for the uh for those who work every day and they they are regular day wagers so so to speak uh just to uh just to uh uh mention some of the things that emilyn said i i agree that yes the healthcare care situation in the philippines is quite critical but of course no one ever foresaw a pandemic of this type that will ever happen during our time in this century and so the healthcare is now obviously suffering from that uh i i remember my brother who was the health secretary during the time of uh former president joseph estrada uh was one of those that pushed for universal care uh as one of the cornerstones of that administration and uh i think it has been recently passed and at the same time he was also one of those that pushed for generic medicine to be sold in the philippines you know medicines in the philippines are one of the most expensive ever and for a while the major pharmaceutical companies that we are now having to deal with right now especially coming from the united states have a very strong uh i would say they had quite a lot of power in the philippines that they could not get this pass through but again that was passed recently or at least not too long ago for generic medicines to be available and then to make it much cheaper for the majority of our people in the philippines dot i want to play this clip and this is this is a tragic story just one of many tragic stories coming out of manila over the last few weeks or so this is from angelo barrera who lost one of his parents to covet 19. he was searching for a hospital bed and he couldn't find one have a listen me and my family we've moved on or are trying to move on so we don't really entertain these thoughts anymore but you know maybe if we had a clear clear plan of action maybe we if we knew that hospitals were a bust um that you know we could have just relied on ourselves more rather than spend all that time five hours you know looking for a hospital to know a veil really doctor the way that angelo puts it is like if i if we'd only known hospitals were a bust it was like what was the point of spending five hours throwing our parent around manila what's the situation like now how do how do we address that because vaccines are not the immediate uh solution for that are they if i may just quickly um just say something since the universal healthcare was mentioned but sure the good ambassador that um indeed universal healthcare is very much really needed right now but um i believe that there can really be no true universal healthcare without emergency care so all of these things just um were exposed or highlighted by kobe so i agree that we were really not prepared nobody was prepared for kobe but it's just it just exposed so many inadequacies of the philippine healthcare system and we've never invested that much for decades so um emergency care is an integral part of universal healthcare and what was just manifested by by one of the those one of the uh the one who lost the parent is that in an ideal setting it should not be the patient or the patient's families who should be looking for hospitals to take them in so the system should have looked for a place for them all we need to do is just dial a number in an ideal setting and as easy as just a three-digit number to call where you can get advice or to go to but currently it's not really here in the philippines it's not we don't have a system yet um we're getting there but there's just so many numbers to remember and um they're left on their own um their own way looking through this maze of the metro and even in their own private uh cars because we don't have really an emergency medical services with competent emergency medical services staff so there's a long long way to go for the philippines so even before they leave their homes ideally should there should be already be a plan um where the nearest competent facility or any available bed for that matter so can i jump in there it can really be heartbreaking right evelyn got to build yes just to build on what um dr pauline convocat said um yes um totally um the implementation of universal health care and also the generic medicines act was a move was a step were steps forward in terms of um improving the health care system in the philippines but those are not enough and um i completely agree with dr convakar that um emergency care is um is a is a component an integral component of universal healthcare also in the philippines right now including people i know including family members of mine um an illness would still mean severe financial hardship so um this cannot be denied and um this we cannot um this is something that i'm still seeing until now in the philippines um i'm remembering what you said right at the beginning of our conversation which is the solution is going to be vaccines right it's not going to be a meat because i'm not sure where the beds are going going to come from uh dr confirkar showed us just from her shift earlier on today how people were just closely packed together in makeshift temporary hospitals so uh i'm just looking at and i want to share with our audience a picture of president duterte getting a vaccine which i believe was over a week ago i am wondering uh it was yesterday excuse me it was even sooner than i thought even more recent than i thought i'm i'm wondering ambassador what impact does that have seeing the president getting a vaccine what's that value well i i suppose most leaders all over the world that's one of the things that they do is to show that the vaccines are supposed to be safe and i i would like to assume that that is what the president of duterte was trying to show you know here in the united states we all know the success of their vaccine rollout obviously because of the resources that they have we are now seeing the numbers really go down dramatically and i understand from many states are beginning to open their economy because of the vaccine so i'm one of those that really truly believes that this is the only way out of this now it's very unfortunate that many countries all over the world including the philippines have very little access to these supplies because obviously countries the rich countries are the ones that are getting it and you mentioned something about the wh so we've been working with them through the covax facility that they set up and even then we still can't get uh enough of the supplies that we really needed it's coming in in trickles like for instance a pfizer that we've been working on for more than uh seven months now even before they were given the eoa uh it's only now that we were able to finish off the indemnity agreement that they required us to do so all of this we're all under the gun do you think ambassador let me let me just think out the outline do you think do you think the problem is because the philippines has a reputation for a corruption and lack of transparency so do you think that is part of the problem about now when you're in a crisis where you do need international help it might be a little bit on the slow side because of that reputation do you think those two things are connected no no well i'm not uh i don't think that that's the case because in our case for instance the wh i'm sorry the world bank and the adb are those that are uh ready to uh in fact they have uh standby uh credit for not only for the philippines but for many countries in asia including indonesia and they've kept and they're the ones that directly pay the pharmaceutical companies they have representatives here in washington dc we've had a couple of meetings with them they said we have the money for you but there are no vaccine supplies so it's really that is really the problem and and we're not the only ones that are suffering from this and that's why we have to depend on donations coming from other countries like china and also from uh from what i understand now israel is coming up and ready to help us and other uh smaller countries that have offered to help the philippines want to put one more thought into our conversation this one comes from christine cebilo who's a health and science reporter who is looking at now where do we go from here in the philippines how do we make sure fewer people are dying from covert 19. this is what she told us so with the philippines reaching one million copied 19 cases the medical societies and experts i interviewed all recommended basic epidemic response proper contact tracing expanded testing and strict isolation on top of weak implementation are the gaps in the health infrastructure another challenge is local government units are not used to align in response so the national government needs to guide them there are bright spots in some cities but we need consistency as simple as having the same contact tracing app and a centralized real-time dashboard on hospital occupancy which we still don't have either the government unifies its covered response or we wait for everyone to get vaccinated but with inefficient rollout and the limited vaccine supply that will likely take a while so dr convocat i'm also seeing questions on youtube where people are asking about vaccine hesitancy in the philippines so vaccinations are the answer to how do you reduce the number of deaths and and there's vaccine hesitancy what do you do as the medical profession to help people well okay we make them understand that really the vaccine is one way out of this pandemic um unfortunately really the vaccines um are not they're not coming in fast enough to for all of this spot for for most of our population to be vaccinated so um with regards to vaccine hesitancy i think the president having been vaccinated lately is a big optic it's a it's a good picture of um you know uh that the public may trust the vaccine and that um most of the healthcare workers are are are already vaccinated and they can speak for themselves as well on the trust for the vaccines but indeed it is really part of the problem of vaccination or the vaccine hesitancy that we need to understand that we need to make the public understand i'm just looking here my laptop to see how vaccinations are doing in southeast asia covered 19 vaccination race in asia at the top singapore this is this is uh doses administered per 100 of the population in selected asian countries singapore there is right at the top china a little bit further behind them and we have to go all the way down here to the philippines and then thailand is even lower so this is going to be an ongoing problem it's an ongoing challenge for people in the philippines dealing with the search right now dr convocal thank you so much ambassador appreciate you emilyn so much to talk about really thank you very much for helping us shine a light on the surge of covert 19 the case is there the casualties there and really what you need which are vaccinations a lot of them thank you so much for joining us on the stream and thank you youtube for being part of our conversation always appreciate you i will see you next time take care [Music] are we still on youtube no they know you

Benjamin Diokno also said he believes his country's economy will return to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2022.

""We expect the economy to be back to where it was by the middle of next year, or even earlier,"" he said.

The Philippines was one of the south east Asian nations worst affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

Mr Diokno said that like many other countries as they emerge from the pandemic, price rises will be a challenge for the Philippines, even as he sees the economy recovering in the months ahead.

59,Ji47WRv2tQE,Philippines Cremate Coronavirus Victims,"Crematoriums in the Philippines cremate coronavirus victims, Sunday, May 3. 

Families of COVID-19 victims in the Philippines are being denied traditional death rites in favor of hurried, impersonal cremations, with virus restrictions often meaning they are forbidden a last look at their loved ones.

It is a painful and disorienting process for both the families and crematory workers that has upended the Philippines' intimate rituals of laying the dead to rest.

Burial is the norm in the Catholic-majority nation, and it usually follows a days-long display of the embalmed body at home or in a chapel.

But due to the pandemic authorities are encouraging rapid cremations -- though quick burials are still allowed -- of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 deaths.

Wakes are barred in these cases and hospitals must seal remains in plastic and send them directly to crematories or funeral homes.  

The number of coronavirus cases in the Philippines reached 9,223 with 607 deaths according to figures from the Johns Hopkins University.

the first thing i want to say that i assume that everyone has good
intentions and the government for sure usually wants what's best for
uh the people but so far mass testing hasn't helped very much in the philippines or
in many other countries i think very few success stories
uh i'm not sure how more testing will help, but let's see if if you'd ask me for a refreshed
approach maybe better change the paradigm not
only also the philippines but i suggest that everywhere
stop obsessing about or over the number of COVID 19
cases and maybe start focusing on minimizing other indicators or focusing
on other indicators maybe minimizing fatalities 
if you have scarce resources or limited resources like what we have here in the
philippines it may be better to invest it in
improving and boosting the healthcare system capacity
maybe that would be a little bit of a different approach maybe
more ICU beds, more hospitals, better working conditions and 
better pay for the healthcare workers maybe more medical supplies and access to health services this should help minimize fatalities i
think and maybe more effective than just doing more and more testing because
we've been doing testing so far. well you mentioned paradigm changes are
needed in containing the spread of the COVID 19.
could you elaborate on these indicators that you were talking about Dr. Atif
yeah well first as i said we can stop obsessing not only the Philippines but
everywhere else please about the number of cases they may not be the 
best reliable indicator i'm speaking as a health
professional in the scenario of COVID 19 i'm not saying this is applicable to other
diseases, we should focus on the number of fatalities that's an indicator
the number of cases requiring hospitalization that's another indicator
and very good indicator also is the positivity rate of tests if you'd like
to to look at cases rather than just piling up number of
cases or trying to count number of cases. yeah and president duterte also says
there is a need to reopen the economy as smaller companies are barely surviving
and i guess this is the question facing governments around the world how can
they balance economic and health needs? yeah i totally agree i think this is
already a bit too late As we don't have clear schedule when exactly this pandemic will end
even with a vaccine, we must now learn how to
start to learn how to manage it and and live with it as an acceptable risk at this point in the same way, we live with many other diseases and risks everyday. i like to elaborate on that for example in the
field of safety or health and safety at work
we study something very important called risk acceptability
and what we do in risk accessibility is a common practice of judgment of the
balance of risks and societal benefits this means that in
in real life sometimes the management or the
government in that case will decide to accept risks
even if they may not be very low and what we do is that we
weigh the benefits so we check the benefits of the control measures for
example in this case the lockdown against other factors
like economic cost or convenience or time or
mental well-being etc, and the management or the government then takes this
information and decides whether to accept the risk so this is risk acceptability
if we believe that they have minimized the risk
to what we call as low as reasonably practicable
then this means as low as reasonable enough
for life to continue and for work and production will go on we cannot just
stop business over risks, so lockdown has negative
impacts not only on the economy but also on mental and social well-being for sure
and i think it is now time that we open our economy
uh not only in the philippines but with all precautions, of course, we talk about
masks, proper ventilation, hand washing, and keep the task force after one target: zero fatalities. sorry to interrupt you but we gotta go
thank you so much Dr. Wessam Atif for your insights."

The virus has now spread to India and Philippines. Thousands of people have been infected worldwide, the vast majority of them in China. Hundreds of foreign nationals are being evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Japan has begun repatriating its citizens, and the US and South Korea are working to move their citizens out of China. More cases of the virus have been confirmed in China. Australia says its citizens who are being brought home from China will be quarantined offshore on Christmas Island at first. Some airlines, including British Airways, have suspended all flights to and from China. In Germany, three new cases have been reported.

#Coronavirus #India #ChinaCoronavirus",2020-01-30,1256290,8797,3144,UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg, in many parts of China this is the new normal very few people on the streets and the usually crowded public transport system Albert empty like here in Shanghai every passenger has stopped and every passenger screened for signs of the coronavirus it's fine our temperature was taken both getting on and off the train everyone has a mask on I feel relieved it may look like a country grinding to a halt but this is China's response to a mass public health emergency one week after these drastic measures were introduced the numbers of infected still keep climbing up people are anxious they prefer to stay at home and not to go out on the streets or wear a mask when they go out on the streets this here is a major tourist destination usually this area is quite busy with people walking around having snacks sightseeing now people prefer staying at home nobody really knows whether the measures the government has taken will be able to contain the virus so people are taking their own measures of precaution and that means minimizing social contact as much as they can elsewhere a lack of basic necessities and information are eroding confidence in the authorities in Hong Kong people have been queuing since 2:00 a.m. hoping to buy face masks the Hong Kong government should do like Macau's and say every resident can only buy ten pieces that way every single Hong Kong person could have a face mask to wear right as the second plane load of repatriated Japanese nationals touched down in Tokyo it caused some to wonder what this type of outbreak could look like if it happened during the Olympics here in July I take it as a wake-up call for us to take precautions against an outbreak like this especially towards the Olympics yes Japan is naive I think Japan should step up measures in South Korea the government is building a containment facility for those infected people here fear for their safety the governor and Minister should come here and try to find a point of compromise what are they doing bringing troops here are we in a battle this is such nonsense they're really creating a mood of fear in South Korea as in many other countries some residents feel the government's response to the crisis has lacked the apparent intensity and clarity of China's all right let's get some analysis on this story now we can speak to virologist Ian Jones from the University of Reading in England hi Ian good to have you here on DW I would ask you about the raft of measures that we've seen countries take to try to contain this outbreak multiple countries evacuating their citizens from affected areas we've seen China shutting down or locking down entire cities is this the right approach to stop this from spreading it's the right approach at the current time time will tell whether or not it's been effective in either stopping or slowing the progress of the virus I think as the numbers continue to rise it looks increasingly likely likely that this will become a pandemic and will eventually spread around the world we've seen as you said this is spreading and we see in first cases reported in the Philippines in India these are densely populated countries in how worrying is that you if we look at the efforts now to try to contain the spread yes it is worrying for two distinct reasons one is as you say these are very dense populations so the opportunity for transmission among people is much higher than it would be in a low population density country but in addition to that these are areas of the world which also have quite a hide burden of respiratory disease particularly things like TB and until the virus gets there we really don't know what to expect in terms of the severity of the infection in those target populations and you said this could become a pandemic how dangerous is this virus in comparison to other diseases other outbreaks we've seen like SARS in 2003 for example it certainly lost much less in serious than SARS the case fatality rate for SARS was around about 10 percent currently this is running around 2 percent that is still pretty high it would at that number it would be almost like the Spanish influenza at the early part of last century however if it's true that there are many more infected people than the confirmed cases then the actual fatality rate is somewhat lower than that and more like a seasonal influenza which perhaps could be coped with more easily by the existing health resources the World Health Organization is set to decide today whether they should declare this a global health emergency should they do so I mean what would that change or whether they should do so or not depends on them and the data that they have at hand which I don't have I would guess perhaps that on this occasion they didn't on the last occasion but on this occasion they will consider it a global health emergency there's been sufficient spread internationally I think and what that would do was just mobilize more resources with alerts barriers up country boundaries and maybe alert healthcare systems that they need to put mitigation processes in place all right Ian Jones speaking to us from the University of Reading in England thank you for your insight

67,254GdlKEz5I,Philippines Opens Borders to Vaccinated Travelers as Covid-19 Eases,"The Philippines has reopened its doors to travelers from more than 150 countries with visa-free privileges, lifting entry restrictions for foreign tourists and businesspeople after nearly two years. It's a move to revive the battered tourism industry as the latest coronavirus outbreak started to ease. Foreign travelers will no longer be required to quarantine in government-designated centers upon arrival if they have been fully vaccinated and tested negative prior to arrival, officials said.

The government had initially planned to lift the ban on Dec. 1 but indefinitely postponed it as the more contagious omicron variant spread, which also prompted authorities to reimpose tighter restrictions.

President Rodrigo Duterte warned that unvaccinated Filipinos who defy orders to stay at home could face arrest. Commuters who have not been immunized were also prohibited from public transport in the capital region of more than 13 million people unless on urgent errands, for at least up to the end of the month. The decision has sparking protests from human rights and labor groups. 

“We’re done with border control,” Health Undersecretary Rosario Vergeire told a news conference in January, adding that government focus has shifted to preventing community transmission of the omicron variant

The number of tourists dropped by more than 6 million, and more than a million Filipinos lost their jobs in tourism businesses and destinations in the first year of the pandemic alone, according to government statistics. Tourism destinations, including popular beach and island resorts, resembled ghost towns at the height of pandemic lockdowns.

speculation that it could be linked to a SARS virus that killed hundreds of people in 2003 a mysterious pneumonia has gripped China with scores hospitalized by the illness Chinese authorities first notified the World Health Organization on January 11th that they had discovered a novel coronavirus SARS Kove - and that it had already infected 41 people in the who Bay province that had caused one death due to the disease that it causes called Koba 19 On January 12 the who came out with a statement and they decided that pending more investigations there is no big threat and there is no need to impose any travel restrictions on China the next week saw cases appear from Thailand Japan all the way to Nepal in the USA On January 22nd the death toll in China was at 17 with more than 550 infections and finally on January 3rd Wuhan was placed under quarantine On January 30th the who declared Koba 19 a global emergency for all of these reasons I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern over the global outbreak of novel coronavirus the sobering fact is that it took 19 days to go from 41 cases to more than 7,000 bringing us to today March 22 2020 a total of three hundred six thousand cases thirteen thousand deaths and eighty six thousand recoveries in 181 countries 110 countries have reported confirmed cases of the total deaths and the UK is now eight de piel casamento PFF asada propagation reviews have we been able to eradicate the virus despite our best efforts we have therefore made the assessment that kovat 19 can be characterized as a pandemic earlier this year people were downplaying the seriousness of the virus saying that it couldn't compare to the 2009 swine flu or even the seasonal flu however a couple of months down the line it's alarming rate of growth and its impact everyday life are painting a very somber picture if history is to be believed this is far from over and we're looking at at least one year of getting it under control in the Philippines it seems like we have just begun what are the pyramid Ola for sick people sokovia die T the number of Filipinos testing positive for the corona virus is rising by the day horrid its second case of the disease and the country's first novel coronavirus related death community quarantine is hereby imposed entire of Metro Manila on January 30th the Department of Health announced the first case in the country on March 5 and 6 the fourth and fifth cases are confirmed on March 16 that number rose to 142 cases and then the next two days saw 50 more people added to that list as of March 22 we have 380 confirmed cases this is what makes the virus so frightening experts have said that the virus has a 2 to 14 days incubation period on average this means that it can take as long as 14 days for you to show symptoms finally realize that you're sick 80% of these cases are considered mild as we're so in the midst of it there seems to be a new study coming out about its transmission every day but it's safe to say that person-to-person contact is the main method of transmission tonight authorities confirm it is being spread from human to human but what does that actually mean well if you're sitting next to someone who has the infection and suddenly he sneezes coughs or spits they could potentially spray you at respiratory droplets that contain the virus unfortunately these droplets can also be found on a hand before reaching out for a handshake or on a surface that was touched not everyone has hit the same way by the disease the most at-risk being the elderly people would a compromised immunity system and anyone would prior health conditions that being said a lot of people can carry the virus only have mild symptoms and still infect other people wreaking havoc and potentially infecting people at risk the most vulnerable population are those actually aged 50 and above their cases are much worse they have comorbidities such as diabetes hypertension and as such also those patients in the younger age groups who have comorbidities are also greatly affected this is why people have been wearing protective masks hoarding alcohol and washing their hands all the time since its seen as the first way to avoid getting the virus washing your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds with soap not touching your eyes mouth and nose with dirty hands and covering your cough or droplets with a mask back to those numbers whatever official count is given at any point you can be sure that the actual number of cases is much higher since the only way to confirm if someone has coded 19 is to test them meaning if testing is slow the number of confirmations will be as well unless mass testing is carried out we will never truly know how many people are carrying the virus most experts are saying that you should take the number of cases you have in your country and multiply it by 10 unless mass testing is currently being done to have a more realistic figure whatever number you find will then continue to grow exponentially every day this will only get worse as the infection spread from Metro Manila to all the other provinces in the country where they might not be as well equipped it can reach that peak polska and seventy-five thousand unwitting microRNA infection South Korean Singapore focus on mass testing from the onset their number one priority was to test as many people as they could so that they could proceed to contact tracing meaning identifying every person that potentially came in contact with someone who had the disease and testing them as well this would then help their agencies identify hotspots places where a high concentration of people had the virus and control those areas as best they could forcing the confirmed cases to go to the hospitals and placing persons under investigation in home quarantine that's an ideal situation but even with that the infection continued spreading but is now doing so at a slower rate some of the have been coming in because of fever most of them have having cuffs and coats for the past couple of days already and some would go to the emergency room because of difficulty of breathing if you have the following symptoms make sure to contact the proper authorities [Music] while waiting for mass testing to be possible the other option is a lockdown and the Philippines is not the only place in the world where this is happening officials have suspended public transport outgoing flights to be cancelled and train service is shut down we're in travellers coming from the UK and Ireland have been banned from entering the United States and northern Italy locked down but unlike Asia Europe has open borders if a lockdown seems to be the most effective way as proven in China to flatten the curve the curve people refer to is basically a graph that shows how exponential the rate of infection can be if people are left to still go out to concerts use public transport or attend mass gatherings and the country already has a high rate of infected people then logically more people will get infected take the example of Italy they went from about 150 cases to 5,000 cases in only two weeks now if you lessen the number of people in a certain location tell them to stay away from each other and then eventually seclude them the virus will still spread however it'll do so at a much slower pace this is called social distancing basically staying away from other people and trying to stay home as much as possible experts say social distancing is a way to prevent spreading kovat 19 malignant supermarket pero Hangang cashier my de stanza Amba wat Kost America not only does this help reduce the rate of infection but it also allows the hospitals that are currently being flooded with cases to be able to accommodate people and help them recover before being flooded with another wave of patients the last thing we need is a choke point in the hospitals because the less people they can treat the more people will be getting sick and not getting the proper treatment possibly infecting other people and making the death toll rise because of a lack of beds and hospitals and the proper equipment to treat extreme cases of a particular kind of pneumonia this is already starting to happen some of the hospitals have been calling in donations for PPE and I think it's the best thing that the hospitals need right now because it's the most important gear a frontline ER should have this is what flattening the curve is all about and this buys time for people around the world to help patients recover and eventually try and find a vaccine or a proven method of treatment regardless of where you are social distancing shouldn't practice as much as possible avoid going out the safest place right now is actually in your homes as lockdowns and travel bans become the norm worldwide from China to Spain Italy Germany Paris to New York there's more and more talk about the economic impact of this lockdown do not travel abroad do not go overseas in lockdown with us our g7 countries basically some of the most developed in the world now as the Philippines is a developing nation this becomes even more burdensome not only are we at risk of higher infection rates because of living conditions in lower-income communities but since a majority of the population needs to work daily to be able to afford housing food stopping work completely will create even more hardships for them [Music] at my hospital and Poggenpohl really sanitation is also a luxury that isn't found in most urban poor areas in the metro so the virus could spread in those communities even faster the lockdown was very abrupt like the complete shutdown of public transport and no one was really ready for it creating a confusing wave of panic from March 11th onwards note Allah Karim Allah coming bounnam kadamba every day the national government and LG News are starting to come out with solutions to help workers with no pay the casual workforce and people who not be able to afford the basics during this lockdown there even talks of a stimulus package we tapped will likewise to go to rehabilitation for those displaced in their jobs for example due to this month-long suspension of mass transportation suspension of work as well while waiting for longer-term solutions to be put in place by the national government I think there is hope and that's all of us we should support our LG use in communities in any way that we can every day the private sector is also starting to do its part the private sectors involvement will hopefully avoid businesses having to close and in turn not being able to pay their employees and just creating a vicious cycle that will take months if not years to recover from if we stop the spread of the virus now the economic impact will be less important so what can you do first stop the spread of fake news and don't add to the noise it might confuse people on this time of information fatigue only get your news from verified sources second practice proper hygiene wherever you are clean your hands constantly and properly avoid touching any unnecessary surfaces use soap water alcohols aerosols whatever you have at your disposal to try and stay as clean as possible third if you have to go out for food runs and to acquire basic amenities practice strict social distancing and inform the people around you to do the same finally understand that if you're at home and have access to food know that you are part of the privileged few to try and help out the less fortunate communities where you can we should all stay at home but that doesn't mean it'll be as easy or as simple for everyone else around you the lack of income and food for the urban poor would lead to widespread hunger and frustration I hope that video kind of helped just condense all the information that's coming out because it's it's crazy like each time we turn on the news now it is that's all we hear and rightly so you know it's a worldwide pandemic it's affecting each and every one of our lives in various ways but I'm a hundred percent sure of one thing is that after this the world will be a very very different place after this little spiel that I'm gonna do to you right now or to put a bunch of information in terms of how you can help and donate if you do have the capacity to donate please do so I think would be very useful we're also going to be putting a bunch of links in the description box below where you can try and get some more information on either organizations or nonprofits or just people in general who are trying to help and who need cash to do so if you want to kind of donate things for front liners for food and protective equipment to PPE for frontline front liners you can check out Rach Edie relief they've been doing this for a long long time gang leads it and she's been absolutely wonderful each time there's a crisis in the Philippines so she can be trusted a hundred percent there's one called PAGASA ph that go into communities and see how much people actually need and help them get the groceries or whatever they need for that week and i think that's really great and create this Manila does one as well we'll put their information in the bottom me because we're currently well I'm stuck in Australia because supporters of both Australia and the Philippines are currently closed so I don't know how long I'm gonna be staying here for those of you who are stuck like me and can't return to the Philippines I'm currently stuck in Australia both borders in both countries are closed there's one that was put up by liners I've been working with minders for a long long time called one voice for peanuts and it's great because you can actually donate through a credit card which is the only thing I can do because I can't do bank transfers or anything like that up as of the moment so I'll be doing the cash from this video if it makes anything to that to one voice for the peanuts if it doesn't I'll be also donating my personal cash to one voice through the peanuts as well because I think they will know exactly what to do with it what's important these times is you try to help out where you can and everyone should stay positive even though that's something that's very tough to do but that's one way to stay mentally healthy is just to be positive to be a voice of change to be helpful to your neighbors the community everyone who's around you and just not fall into this spiral of just negativity because it's never going to be putting you in a good place so if you're in a good space mentally then you're gonna be able to provide positive and affect positive change in other people and I think that is kind of like the purpose of you know being human it's being humane to other humans if that makes sense so thanks for watching I know it's kind of a gloomy video we're gonna be doing more cooking videos because we're all pretty much stuck at home so if you guys want to see any types of recipes or any way to be counter fifty and crafty let me know in the comments below and we get to work on those [Music]"

In the capital Manila, residents have been queuing to collect their subsidies, worth 1,000 pesos (US$20) for every individual or a maximum of 4,000 pesos (US$79) per family.

Inquiries: behindasian@gmail.com
Brought to you by the Behind Asian Team.",2023-04-22,17253,400,131,UCz2MlDYRidHyyubC4r7dQcA," When Covid-19 took over the world in 2020, 
many economies collapsed. From the world’s   most developed countries to the poverty-stricken 
nations. Each of them experienced hardship after   hardship. In the region of Southeast Asia, 
however, there was one country that contracted   the most in its economy; The Philippines. 
The archipelago country in 2020 incurred   a GDP contraction of about 9.5 percent, 
which was the worst in the entire region,   and one of the worst in the entire world. The 
cause for such downfall as suggested by economists   and analysts was simply a lack of government 
support and proper interventionist policies.   It was reported that consumption spending had 
fallen dramatically due to undeterred lockdowns,   which was followed by a fall in investment 
spending and most importantly a small economic   intervention aid. For a clear understanding, data 
published by the Asian Development Bank compared   Covid-Response spending in the big economies 
of Southeast Asia stretching until November   2020. They found that Malaysia had spent about 
22.7 percent of its GDP in response spending,   which is about $2,562 dollars per capita. Followed 
by Thailand at 15.9 percent, or about $1,211   dollars and Indonesia at 10.9 percent, or 432 
dollars per capita. The Philippines, however,   was the weakest of all, which could explain 
the big contraction. The government had only   spent 5.88 percent in terms of GDP or only 202 
dollars per capita. Hence, such a small government   response immediately resulted in the worst 
contraction in the entire Southeast Asian region. Such poor government planning would make it easy 
for people to blame the policymakers. However,   we are way past the issues constraining 
the Philippines' economy now. In fact,   the Philippines economy, based on macroeconomic 
data, had already jumped back up. Data from the   Central Bank of the Philippines sees that 
in 2019, the gross domestic product of the   Philippines was about 19.5 trillion pesos 
or about 376 billion US dollars. By 2022,   it has registered over 22 trillion pesos or 404 
billion US dollars. While it may in numbers show   the Philippines is in a better position even 
pre-covid, the most important question, however,   is better off in addressing the bounce of the 
Philippines' economy. How did the Philippines   beat the worst health and economic crisis it has 
experienced since the Pacific war? How did the   Philippines bounce back from one of the worst in 
the entire region in 2020 to becoming one of the   best performers in 2022. Indeed, the Philippines 
in 2022 posted GDP growth of over 7.6 percent,   which was also the fastest in four decades. 
So how did the Philippines beat Covid-19? Well, we can first start with what truly 
went wrong in 2020. To summarize this as   we noted earlier, it was simply due to a lack 
of government response. The government just did   not push enough stimulus to help the falling 
economy. With little help from its citizens,   Filipinos had no choice but to spend less and less 
as their incomes, savings, and others continued   to deplete. As consumer spending drops, so does 
economic activity. The reason for such, however,   is often a critical point of the government’s 
inaction. Many policymakers and analysts have   pointed out that the government even was 
very slow in responding to the crisis. A   failure in planning and communication 
as one article pointed out in 2021. Government response and spending, however, are 
important as we understand just exactly how and   why we believe that the Philippines beat covid-19. 
The economy immediately bounced back, in fact,   in 2021, when the same data from the Central Bank 
showed that the gross domestic product was already   close to the levels in 2019. And here, the answers 
are obviously mixed again. People would state   that it is all but due to what people suggest as 
“revenge spending”, a concept that simply means   the lockdown is over and people are now spending 
more and more. Well, that could truly be an   answer, but it is very much lacking. Consumer 
spending was not the only source of growth in   2021 and 2022. The strong answer on our basis is 
government spending. Indeed, what was once lacking   in 2020, continued to be a strong indicator 
in the Philippines for 2021, 2022, and beyond. Government spending has slowly increased since 
2016, the year when former president Rodrigo   Duterte took office. Data from the World 
Bank shows the general government's final   consumption expenditure as a percentage of GDP, 
which shows that in 2015 it was only 10.9 percent,   but by 2021, it rose to over 15.6 percent. 
While data has not been published yet,   the Government's final consumption expenditure 
from the central bank has likewise shown an   increase of over 10 percent from 2021 to 2022. 
What we are getting here is that the government   of the Philippines has continued to increase 
its spending during Covid-19, but much more   after Covid-19. This way many analysts have 
then stated that it is now due to the strong   government spending that is propping up growth 
in the economy. One paper from the First Metro   Investment Corporation of Metrobank Group has 
stated that “consumption, services and government   spending has driven growth for 2022”. Indeed, a 
separate article in 2021 from the Philippine News   Agency also stated that “Government spending 
contributes more to economic recovery”. But one may ask how this constitutes economic 
growth. What is the government doing? Are they   giving money to the people to spend? Well, both 
yes and no. The most important part of government   spending in the Philippines since the entrance 
of Rodrigo Duterte is due to infrastructure.   The construction of infrastructures after 
infrastructures has impacted the Philippine   economy massively. It is not just about the 
impacts and financial effects of these built   infrastructures, but rather, the continued 
effects of employing labor while constructing   these infrastructures. Over the past few 
months, we have seen unemployment in the   Philippines continue to drop, which on top of 
that a rise in consumer spending. This was in   part because of the private sector, but also 
because the government has continued to spend   on its infrastructure and economy which boosted 
job demand in the labor market. One cannot simply   ignore this fact as it has been shown in several 
budgets across Rodrigo Duterte’s tenure, on the   notion that government spending must increase. 
The government itself, which poured over to the   succeeding administration of President Marcos 
has too favored a strong government. President   Marcos’ first national budget of 2023 saw a big 
deficit of spending of about 6.1 percent of GDP,   which means they are seeking to spend over 5 
trillion pesos but only make 3.6 trillion pesos   in revenue. Which may at first glance seem like 
they are also ambitious, it may, however, also   mean that they would need to borrow more money to 
fund operations, or else print them in their own   central bank. But this topic is not the highlight 
of today’s video, so we will leave it at that. What one needs to understand, however, is that the 
government in both cases of Duterte and Marcos,   despite underspending during Covid-19 for the 
former, is continuously spending more and more,   to the point that it helped the latter. The 
miraculous GDP growth of 2022 was not solely   due to the impact of revenge spending, as 
resulted in a low unemployment rate. The   labor market was strong, some have suggested 
that the private sector enabled unemployment   to drop to such levels. However, one too cannot 
ignore the fact that the government has been   spending rapidly throughout the economy. A 
fiscal deficit of about 7.6 percent in 2022,   was in fact, experienced. Much higher than the 
projected deficit for the year 2023. But anyway,   as we look forward into the future, the Marcos 
administration which favors a strong fiscal   deficit in its national budget may continue 
to show the strong hand of the government in   the economy. Do let us know what you think. Do 
you think that the government is on the right   track to spend more money than it makes? Or 
do you think that this is a crazy notion due   to the possible issues it may bring? A strong 
government with its expenditures, after all,   is also not something that some economists favor. 
Some have coined its inefficiency. Nevertheless,   it was all but necessary at a time of 
unprecedented economic and health disruption,   and a time when the Philippines was truly 
lagging behind its neighboring countries   when it comes to government spending. Let 
us know down below, Thanks for watching!"

86,N9OQbW0YOLU,Nurses in the Philippines: Underpaid and unprotected from COVID-19 while saving lives,"In April 2020, the Philippines government imposed a deployment ban on nurses, blocking them from taking on jobs overseas. The labour minister, Silvestre Bello, explained that the country cannot lose the “services of our nurses” at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. Thousands of ‘prisonurses’ (coined from the term, prisoners) have appealed for the lifting of the ban. 

For almost two decades, nurses in the Philippines have been fighting for fair compensation. A public law guarantees a starting salary of US$680 in public hospitals. In this episode of #UndercoverAsia, we spoke to a nurse who earns US$13 a day, barely US$3 above minimum wage in Manila. 

In comparison, a nurse earns about US$2,400 in Germany, between US$2,700 and US$3,000 in the UK and about US$4,000 to US$8,000 in the US with overtime pay. 

The Philippines government also promised that there’d be sufficient protection and introduced a hazard pay of US$10 a day for work during the pandemic. 

Nurse Maria Theresa Cruz, 47, worked in Cainta Municipal Hospital. She had to purchase her own Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). When she showed signs of COVID-19, she was only given rapid tests that came back negative, despite a government memo stating that rapid tests “should not be used to definitively rule out COVID-19”. 

Theresa was later given a swab test which came back positive. By then, it was too late, she had already passed away. On top of her salary, she’d posthumously receive only US$1.26 a day in hazard pay. 

As of November 2020, over 16,000 healthcare workers have yet to receive their hazard pay.

anti-terror law voiding a killer qualifier that would have exempted dissent from the definition of terror only if it has no intent to cause harm with the intent qualifier removed the phrase now says dissent is not terrorism some lawyers and petitioners call it a win but virginia suarez lawyer for women's groups says otherwise we do not deserve mere conservation from the supreme court we deserve more than that we deserve protection from the supreme court [Music] it's like we are all mistaken giving all those arguments suarez says the exception on dissent is not true because they've seen how

disinformation and how social media platforms have been used to spread lies and spew hate she has since sounded the alarm on how tech giants favor lies laced with anger and hate that spread faster and further than facts what's changed is that what kept it objective in the past was the entire process of the news group a reporter an editor a sub editor a managing editor right a very expensive process in the age of the internet that expensive process gets distilled to a page view what happens to us when the distribution of lies outpaces the distribution of these expensive evidence-based stories she

in self quarantine whether it be voluntary or by government recommendation some countries however are on a strict authorisation to stay at home or face arrest one of the strictest lock downs is taking place right now in the Philippines where there are police patrolling every corner and rumors of martial law there has been a lot of international media attention on the Philippines with reports saying somebody even got shot for breaking the quarantine rules to get to the bottom of how Street departed politics are we wanted to talk to someone from the Filipino governments and the deputy chief for operations of the Philippine National Police who's the third highest ranked officer within the National Police agreed to be interviewed by Asian boss this is the first time that anyone from the Filipino national police talked to a foreign media so we hope you watch the video till the end to get a different perspective you would be able to get elsewhere this is how the interview wins maraming salamat PO sign you or examine you menu and salami the reason why I wanted to talk to you two things because you understand that the Philippines is still under lockdown as we speak and that you have one of the most important and highest positions at the Philippine National Police is that right thank you for this opportunity Marie but we just like to point out that we are not using the word lap down here in the Philippines to contain the spread of the corona virus since it connotes something that is hard and with only still fear among our people the Filipinos are already scared of this pandemic so the government is cautious in using words and terminology so we prefer to use this as community quarantine una una Posada hat wit upon a new epoch American unabomb Union position admin responsibility Savion P well I am the deputy chief for operations of the Philippine National Police I am the number three in the hierarchy of the Philippine National Police at at the same time the commander of the Joint Task Force code shield which is the government's enforcement arm in the fight against kovat 1980 Task Force commander I am in charge of supervising the implementation of Streak health protocols crafted by our experts assess mandatory wearing a face mask whenever people go out of their homes observance of physical distancing and restricting there is a sorry travel of our people now we have at least well around 110 million Filipinos nationwide and we have 200 5000 police fest fidelity you took the helm as deputy chief of operations on January 20 2020 which is only a few months ago right so when you came on board did you ever anticipate anything like covered 19 happening in the Philippines assessing the current situation across the globe nobody seems to expect this to happen discrete but when yous about of this was happening in Wuhan China already making headlines our commander in chief president Duterte has already instructed us to prepare for the worst-case scenarios noting the proximity of the Philippines to China this is the reason why police and military personnel were rapidly and widely deployed to man the quarantine control points in Metro Manila on March 15 and they loose on the following two days and across the country in the succeeding days sign you open an appeal on hiring the PNP officer how did covert 19 actually impact the Philippines if you look to look into this socio-economic perspective I believe that this is worse than the combined nearly natural calamities but regular hit our country most of our people suddenly found themselves jobless income less and well totally dependent from the government's food and cash assistance but if you were look into this in the standpoint of peace and order there has been a significant decrease in the crime volume or sixty percent reduction in more than 22 months on the implementation of this quarantine rule if were to going to compare this with the last two months before the implementation of the community quarantine it is not worthy to mention however that despite the financial hardship that our people have been experiencing we have not recorded any single case of looping and we attribute this to the planning and foresight of our crisis managers as well as the cooperation as an understanding of our people marabunta on global audience watching right now who's very curious about how the Philippine is actually handling the quarantine in response to the corporate ninety so it's really great to hear from someone like you directly to get the first-hand account so could you explain to us what exactly are the current lockdown restrictions that are in place well we started actually with the ecq in the Mertzes March 17 gcq is the enhanced a community quarantine and any CQ is modified enhance community quarantine but the difference between the acq and the modified easy Chris that in ecq there are only few establishments are permitted to operate but the modified easy few a we loosened a bit and more establishments were a la were allowed so which means that it is more challenging for the Philippine National Police considering that more establishments are now operating and consequently more persons or vehicles are now outside and these are the things that we have to check in order to ensure that only authorized persons are allowed to be outside of the residents what was the direction and exact orders you receive from resident or charity on how to actually implement the lockdown well basically we we are implementing the guidelines given to us by the interagency task force through the conduct of our quarantine control points or checkpoints so first we have to know which subbasements are permitted to operate then who are the people who are members of the workforce of this establishment and through our checkpoint we have to find out whether those who are passing to our checkpoints are authorized or not and aside from that we have police visibility on areas which are a how to operate and one significant interventions that we have implemented is through the implementation of curfew which are initiated by the different local government units a nationwide so what does this mean for the average citizens of Manila are they allowed to go outside what if they have to buy essential items like food groceries or what have to have to go to the hospital is there any system you implement it to help people in this situation our national and local government officials also issued quarantine passes in order for one member of the household to be allowed to buy food and other essential items for their family but strictly during a particular period of time and place well most of this quarantine passes are fully are limited to the place where they are given so we discourage quantum pass holders to cross borders and in say they're advised to buy the essential items only and within the respected communities Anupam when apena come a-knockin challenge palace police force when it comes to enforcing this lockdown well hopefully the our main challenge is actually to prevent the spread of that the virus to save as many Filipinos from being infected and very strict there as a sari movement of these people and forcing them to follow the health and community quarantine protocols as you have seen since the start of our enforcement it started from around 8,000 violations but recently with the more police personnel and soldiers being deployed in the different areas prone to be to be violated on physical distancing it reduced to less than 1,000 violations so right now what we're doing is to accost them but most of them are just being warned and for those who are hard-headed and resisting and it's obeying our police personnel they're the one being arrested and the appropriate charges are being filed against them and it's the dense population also one of the challenges that their police yes of course that is true the population is one of the challenges but we have to work with it all of these constraints and other limitations are being considered but still we have that objective to attain that is why we have to enforce what what needs to be to be implemented so us for us not to waste what we have started for the past two months or so what's the police protocol an official response supposed to be if you see someone disobeying the quarantine well well the implementation of the Kuantan measures release that street but you see we really have to be compassionate so in most of cases we leave this up to our ground commanders to deal with the violators in case to case basis for example nobody is right mind would arrest a senior citizen who just wants to buy his maintenance medicine so or you know to go out to buy a meal for a hungry baby so are you allowed to use force if ever well the use of principle force is always the last resort depending on the situation on the ground at the course of deployment ation of the quarantine rules we come up with basic percepts or protocols which constantly remind to both our men in the public to avoid a desired computation for the public the rule is that one you should obey the quarantine rules and to obey the power of the people or respect the authorities enforcing them and for our men the rule is that for them to exercise maximum tolerance and respect human rights at all cost recently they're still in use that someone actually got shot by the police are you in a position to explain what exactly happened there or what actually led to that situation well there was an incident that happened and one of the checkpoints implementing our what have been guidelines but please understand that I cannot discuss it with you since the matter was already referred to our judicial authorities I see so you're just not allowed to talk about it or well since this is now being investigated I believe that here in the Philippines so we cannot just stop the of the case since it is not being investigated the numbers we have are that over 180,000 people have been cited for warranty violations and that over 50,000 people have been arrested are these numbers correct based on Auburn last latest data as of May 25 or on the 70th bay since the community quarantine has started there are more than hundred eighty two thousand violators recorded from March 17 of the speaker more than 107 thousands were one around 20 thousands were fine and almost 55 thousands were arrested these numbers are actually believed to be the highest in the world setting in Newport rocketboom arrived in Moscow and arrested us wealthy number of Paris only represents 30 percent of the number of recorded violators most of those arrested are repeat offenders those who they respect our officers in the ground and those who went out for the house just for the fun of it this arrests are necessary in order to send Stern's statement to the public that national government is determined to enforce the law because what is a stake is the public health which is serious issue of course other countries have their own laws but you see in this kind of pandemic we have to be strict on the laws pertaining to quarantine regulations otherwise it is our life me to stay that is why we really have to do this you know the economy is hurting we have sacrificed a lot so it is just but proper that we should implement to the strictest sense the law so that we can invade objective of what we are doing we don't sacrifice a that we are experiencing I didn't Tudor to repeatedly mentioned that he would enforce martial law in the country if necessary something in your motto by Metallica ito martial law subpoenas you know I believe that you have to understand the context and why the person 10 to 30 mentioned that during that time the number of editors continues to rise despite our repeated appeal despite our repeated explanation on how serious the threat of coral virus is and despite the repeated warnings well as the father of the nation we all feel the frustration and the piety of our president and we understand why he had to say and do something as a way of imposing discipline his children and it worked before the daily abrasive quality violators is as high as 3,800 but when more soldiers and members of the police elite force were deployed in the streets of the areas with high number of violators there was a steep drop recorded of quarantine believers since April 23 for one or two days after deployment and the number of returns just never reached the 2000 mark or even much less our president is smart he certainly knows below so from the start we do not believe that he would declare martial law with regard to this matter I think would be yours outside might be very curious about this they may be in their countries they have different they might have lockdown situation as well but it's not like there's a lot of soldiers military people on the streets or patrolling but why does it have to be so strict in the Philippines in particular in comparison to other countries you know other countries have their own way of doing things and the Philippines it is the life of the Filipinos that is a state so well we are sacrificing you know this quarantine is not good for everyone but we have to do this in order for for us not to have this pandemic come to worse that is why in in our minds in the law enforcement side it has to be implemented strictly so it will be followed and the goals and objectives of this program will be attained so I think what everyone is kind of in the same boat because other countries also pretty much have the same problem with the COBE 19 so I think there's still a difference in how different countries reacted and I'm so like curious why the Philippines is stricter in comparison to the other countries if it's the same problem yet well if we let the stricter probably we we have also cost casualties going to thousands you see so right now we have well it is around 800 something like that but if we were not stick on the implementation probably it would be tens of thousands that are already dead because of this pandemic do you actually know how bad the corner of our situation is in the Philippines right now well all right now we have I believe some 14,000 were infected and around the 800 if not mistaken died but if we did that implement district 1 pin procedures probably that that could be higher so that is why we have to do this and we have to continue doing this in order not to waste the sacrifices and difficulties hardships that we have we have been doing for this a quarantine the program critics and some Western media often accuse the Filipino government of being too highly militarized and excessive in their quarantine restrictions how do you respond to these accusations as someone who's actually on the ground enforcing these laws well a few days ago experts from the Philippines top university released the result of a study which states that this trick implementation of this enhance community quarantine has been critical in reducing transmission and deaths due to the karana virus we believe that this is a vindication the part of the president and his crisis managers a vindication on the part of law enforcers and a solid testament that we did the right thing amid unfair Precision's of militarized approach in fighting this virus the Ireland is unfair legations with the Western media is that it is the West where cases of coronavirus infection are high and here in the Philippines we are doing this because you want to save lives you want to save people so I believe that all what we're doing here is in consonance with the objective of this government to save people and we will continue on doing this as long as that we believe is appropriate to attain our goals and objectives in the end what's your biggest priority as one of the key people at the Philippine National Police and what is your long-term mission well the biggest priority of the government which I'm part of is to contain the spread of the carotids virus and save many Filipinos for infection especially now that we are gradually reopening our economy and gradually shifts to the so-called new normal so in terms of the long term mission our commander in chief our president is committed to defend the country from this unforeseen enemy and determined to save as many Pilipinas from being infected by this fatal disease our party will continue to focus on our mission by acting as if it is always the day one of the pandemic in the country until such time that the vaccine is discovered and everything is normalized there anything you want to tell the Western audience or maybe even Western media who portray the way of the how the Philippines is tackling this situation is there any message you want to tell them well it's not very easy for our government you know to plan all of these things that we're doing right now so it's a balancing up on the economy versus the health of the Philippine people and that's why we have this crisis management through the interagency task force to to plan for it and make Marisa recommendation and as long as they've come up with a decision based on science and based on the data that we have for the past days weeks and months we will pull support this one in order to implement this one and now will it really be cooperation support of it's in every Filipinos are here in the Philippines in order for us to heal as one and win this world so we need each and everyone's cooperation and support on this fight is there anything else you would like to get out there where you think the Philippine National Police might be misunderstood and you just want to clarify two things because I think on social media a lot of people are actually blaming the police but what's your response to that I think that the bill must know that the the law enforcement officers particularly Filipino priests is just implementing the guidelines being given by the policy makers or the interagency task force on the management of the emerging infectious disease here in the Philippines the Philippine actual police being the front line of this campaign is actually very much bull narrable on the infection we are not exempted in fact in our organization so far more than 270 among our personnel are infected and uh four died with this a corona virus but still while it is true that we cannot just see our family and we are most of us have been out in the field and cannot go home but feel we have to do this job and that is the essence of public service and what we need from the public is you know not really the recognition but for you too for all of us to cooperate and support each other so that we can attain the objective of this quarantine and other program being implemented by our government international viewers they would only get their news from big international news corporations but they actually never hear from the law and forces directly just like you and I think we are also the first international yet to be able to interview you so that's why we really appreciate that you were able to talk with us today and share your perspective thank you money for having me we want to thank for Tennant general eliazar for sharing his insight for us it was interesting to hear directly from one of the highest government officials on this issue but what did you guys think let us know your thoughts in the comments for more than take insight

Webinar #47 
April 9, 2021 
“COVID-19 in the Philippines: What are the Scenarios for the next 12 Months?”  Special Topic 
Rising cases, crowded hospitals, new restrictions on movement, higher levels of fear and  frustration --- a month ago, it looked like things were improving, and then suddenly it feels like  we are back to square one. 
What does trend data tell us about the pandemic? What do we know about the spread of  SARSCoV2 at national and local levels? Will it get worse before it gets better? What about the  economy? What can we expect in the coming months? How should families prepare for what is  ahead? How should health workers prepare for what is ahead? 
Some of the assumptions will change because of the advances in the health sciences and  medicine. The vaccines will have an impact on disease transmission. Newer drugs are being  studied for treatment of moderate and severe COVID. People are slowly adapting and modifying  their behavior to protect themselves and survive. 
In the next episode of STOP COVID DEATHS, UP Professor of Economics, Dr. Toby Melissa  Monsod, opens the webinar with a perspective on the economy. The main presenter is Dr. John Q.  Wong, lead epidemiologist of the IATF and reactors are infectious disease specialist Dr. Cybele  Lara Abad from UP-PGH and pulmonologist Dr Aileen David Wang of the UP College of  Medicine. 
While we cannot gaze into a crystal ball, we can look up the data and see where we are-- and move  toward where we want to be in the coming year, together.

know recently we have been inviting people who are not medical doctors who had mahara lagmai the other day was actually a geologist today we have uh an expert in economics and a professor of the up school of economics i'd like to welcome um professor tobi melissa hi toby welcome hi excuse me hi everyone thank you for inviting me yeah so you know i'm not exactly an expert i'm an economist you're an expert okay you're not talking i go back a long long long week long many lives ago many lives ago and and i think you know it's very interesting we we were working together on disasters uh when we were in our late 20s is this correct yeah okay so about yeah so we were working together on disasters and uh she was working with caritas manila is working with the kapohomko foundation and i remember we we went to flooded areas in uh eastern summer you know yeah northern summer yeah so we were together on the ground in some of those times when people were stuck on top of roofs and we couldn't pass through roads because of uh landslides because of the earthquake and so on but i i can't imagine toby that we would be working together again now because of this unthinkable disaster that we're in i mean you know at least i think in the past those were kind of localized right of the country are spared so that help can be given to very local areas but now but i i think you're gonna talk about this now that the philippines is not i mean that the coving situation is not uniform around the country i'm not gonna preempt what you're going to talk about but anyway thank you for joining us and um you know guys toby has uh today's been publishing some some uh some some articles on the economic side of of kovid19 and she's been talking about health and economics and i think we should not let this opportunity pass that our country does not put in the proper investments in public health so [Music] anyway enough enough of that but welcome toby and please give your opening remarks go ahead thank you okay good afternoon everyone um this is taken from publication we did have some time in november last year myself and a colleague okay at the onset of the kovit 19 crisis it was thought that strong macroeconomic fundamentals would carry the day for the country we were coming from about a decade of high and robust growth our credit credit ratings were at their highest ever our fourth quarter gdp growth in 2019 was second only to china in the assay m3 plus three thus in mid-march but march 16 2020 that i was saying do you have a power do you have a presentation no no they said no no slides okay no no no no no yeah go ahead look at this one you get slices yeah i don't know sorry sorry to interrupt okay go ahead sorry yeah okay um so uh yeah so in mid-march in mid-march last year economic managers reassured us that economic fundamentals are on our side and that even under the worst possible scenario the philippines will grow in 2020 and in the medium term by about six percent so this is when the lockdown happened so that's like the famous last words right this this has clearly not happened by the second quarter of 2020 we had a contraction of about 16 percent which is our lowest uh quarterly growth in four decades since 1981 and the second lowest in the asean plus three we were also predicted to have the worst projected economic growth outcome in 2020 of the sharpest reversal from country performance in 2019 among our neighbors so the question was why why despite strong economic fundamentals did the country do so poorly are managers largely blamed or accounted for this by describing the strict community quarantine imposed in march 2020 that was extended until the third quarter however this is a somewhat circuitous argument because the lockdown precisely suspended economic activity it restricted mobility of people we couldn't go out people couldn't work etc in order to hold the pandemic at bay and buy time for the health system to organize itself in other words the lockdown did not cause the economy to contract rather the economy was contracted it was activity was suspended as a response to the virus rather than blame the lockdown person a colleague and i had a different thesis we noted that the philippines version of the lockdown was seemed to be the longest and most stringent in the assay and plus 3 region other countries vietnam and even singapore south korea south korea or china did not use such an extreme measure nor use lockdowns for prolonged periods and so we post the hypothesis rather than the timing intensity or length of a country's lockdown per se do the different capacities to detect and respond to the covid19 outbreak account significantly for the different economic outcomes among countries in the region sadly we found the answer was yes implementing a cross-country model we found that stronger national capacities to detect and respond to emerging outbreaks are associated with better short-term economic outcomes for the philippines better prepared laboratory systems coming into the crisis could have saved up to 3.6 percentage points in lost gdp growth forecasted in 2020. what does this mean this is equivalent to about 700 billion pesos so if we had just been a little if we had just done our homework when uh you know everyone was doing that homework in the early 2000s and if we had listened to our own experts that we had to be better prepared for emerging outbreaks perhaps we would not have suffered such a contraction in the economy we also found evidence that the traditional channels via government spending to increase output and stabilize the economy are overshadowed by the importance of having specific core capacities precisely to detect and decisively respond to the covet 19 pandemic put another way if kovid 19 is not first well contained then government spending aimed at other things may not matter for economic recovery and could even make things worse the implication is clear health system capacity must be prioritized over and above other types of spending including build build build spending unfortunately the budget for 2021 does not quite reflect this if i'm not mistaken the 2021 budget decreases the budget of the doh and other related items by about 25 that may not be as accurate as before and increases allocations to dpwh and dotpr for infrastructure spending and now we see ncr again in an ecq but this time without allocations for any sort of ayuda to households in other words we're back at the relief stage and we don't even have that we don't even have recovery budget much less relief budget what is our challenge today we need to convince officials and stakeholders who are concerned for the economy and for economic recovery to focus on capacitating public health systems so that we can get out of this hole this is a big ask because they're just not accustomed to thinking in that way right but it would help to identify more precisely what capacities to invest in as a matter of priority in what sequence and where and at what level of the public health system national provincial city municipal clearly the crisis has proceeded at different speeds and intensities across the archipelago and so it may not make economic sense for all regions or cities to invest in the same capacities at the same time in the same sequence everywhere in other words a one-size-fits-all solution doesn't make sense so given budget and time constraints for instance should all provinces and cities be investing in a vaccination rollout now would it be more efficient and effective for instance for some regions and provinces to focus on developing better contact tracing infrastructure precisely to avoid what has happened in ncr i hope this webinar can help us answer these questions thank you okay thank you very much that's that's professor tobi monsaad of the school of economics of the university of the philippines and um we're going to keep toby you can stay right so toby will be with us in the panel and um we have a q a a q a box over there which you know you can put in questions there and we're actually going to ask our our panelists to answer questions that that come up so thank you so much toby for that uh that framing i think uh you know in this webinar we usually talk about more of the medical and the health and the public health side of stuff and uh occasionally we have had speakers like you we had professor pernia also speak at some time um on on the economics of it and um i think in the future we have to do more of it so thank you so much for for those opening remarks all right so um we have a uh we have a person on the street set of interviews that tvup prepares for us on the topic and our topic is um you know kovid is what are the scenarios for the next 12 months and i think we are all it's a good thing to be forward-looking so that we don't we don't get um mired in the difficult situation we are in right now so tvup has done some interviews so tvup please take the platform [Music] more than a year [Music] you know give it to science actually uh you you what is happening now give it to science data analytics maintain the the health protocol such as social physical distancing uh frequent washing of hands face shield face masks [Music] to prevent or to to minimize the increasing uh the increase of the the virus the spread of virus no padding related support 19 [Music] [Music] vaccination should be sped up [Music] improved procedures improved protocols improved testing and treating [Music] [Music] m [Music] thank you very much tvp and uh those who participated in in those short interviews we're going to the main part of our program which is uh we have our main presenter our topic is hovid19 what are the scenarios for the next 12 months and it is my pleasure to introduce um someone who is actually has actually been working very quietly behind the scenes throughout this whole pandemic but his work has been so powerful and he's an epidemiologist he's currently professor of the ateneo school of medicine and public health and he's the co-founder and senior technical advisor of epimetrics so dr john wong is a expert in many government panels when it comes to epidemiology and even in the assessment of medications or drugs that are used in the country so i'm very pleased to welcome uh john welcome to the webinar all right thank you susie for that kind introduction time there's a short version and then a long version that i will uh present later okay my short version is how are you doing i mean are you even able to sleep with all the work that you have to do all the analytics that you have to do all right since last year i found that my my quality of sleep fluctuates up and down with the level of quarantine so you mean more more quarantined more sleep no more quarantine less sleep i think raymond that's a common thing well for those of us who are working in public health and our frontliners you know there's rest but it's not really rest no so anyway john go ahead with your go ahead with your presentation everyone's waiting for you okay thank you i'll share my screen can you see my screen yes sir go ahead okay so uh i'll talk about pandemic uh alternative futures for for the philippines in terms of the pandemic so this is how i'm going to structure my talk now where are we now how did we get here where do we want to go and how do we get there uh so just briefly you know because i think everybody knows what's happening uh so here we are now now it's uh more than twice uh the august peak that we had last year and it seems to be peaking now but we have to wait with a few more days now uh before uh we say that it's good news now uh but i also want you to i want to draw your attention also to the pre-peak period uh after the august peak we sold the plateau during this period no uh it was lower than the august peak but it never never really got down no below maybe 500 cases now and we we were sort of uh happy with this with this low level of uh cases now so uh just remember this i'll talk about i'll come back to it later and this is the the curve for our cases also uh as cases have gone up no deaths have also uh started to go up uh hasn't reached the the peak of last year but it's past the 75th percentile which is a significant length [Music] okay so how did we get here no this is a search we started in february so um one way to understand uh the pandemic is to look at it as a as a system um so if we look at it holistically you know uh we know uh what states what health states people are in and uh how do they flow no from one health state to another now so for example um we can divide uh the philippine population into five or six uh compartments no or buckets no so uh most of the population is here no we're susceptible we're not sick you know um people who have to go out now in spite of the quarantine uh have to have to travel you know have to go to the workplace now they will be exposed because they're they're mixing with people from other family bubbles you know uh some of most of these people will not be infected but some will be infected and they become infectious um so these people know some will be high risks [Music] some will be admitted to hospitals you know most will recover but also some will die okay so if we look at this uh system system diagram of the pandemic now it becomes easier to understand how how we got to where we are you know so for example now uh susceptible uh can become exposed no so if we want to reduce that we have to reduce exposure you know so we have to do things that reduce the transmission rate no um this is something that we cannot influence like i said it's the incubation period this is a characteristic of the disease but this is where we can influence things though uh how do we increase recovery rate how we how do we reduce the death rate no um if you look at the other direction the more active cases we have no the more susceptible people can be exposed okay but there's also a silver lining there's another bucket in our compartment which is immunization which we have now so the objective one objective would be to drain the susceptibles so the more you immunize and then fewer become exposed um let's let's talk next about our no i mean i think a lot of you have read about this in the papers now or the basic reproduction number no which is a which is a number which measures transmission okay so uh i mean we see this in the papers uh every day you know uh uh rt you know or the time to time dependent reproduction number no uh but more important than the number um as i said the number uh it's actually just an estimator no it fluctuates up or down but it doesn't tell you give us much information what is more actionable is to understand what contributes to reproduction or transmission so is the transmission rate of the virus uh it's how many people we have contact with let's say in a week and if we're infected no uh how long we are in the community you know inspecting other people not infecting uh our household or infecting people in the workplace before we're isolated okay so um these are the things which have contributed to the increase in reproduction number no uh the variance uh low compliance to the non-pharmaceutical interventions uh we had a couple of super spreader events now starting last december uh there's increased mobility because of the opening of the economy and poor indoor in the ventilation now they've begun to understand that uh erdosa's mission uh is a significant uh driver now of infections in fact it was in the newspaper today that cdc finally reversed itself and said that for my transmission or transmission through uh objects no it's not a significant uh uh or a major driver of transmission and then uh this one the duration of infectiousness is influenced by uh if we're sick no if we're symptomatic how long no before we go for testing no and then how long before uh we're isolated the quarantine and how long it takes contact tracers to trace other contacts and have them quarantined no all of these can either increase or decrease the duration of infectiousness so let's look at this now let's start with variance now so this is just a simple analysis now comparing cities uh with the variance and those without the variance though this was early early march the data from early march now so at that time no some some metro mandercities had variants the others did not no um so of the patients with variance no their symptoms set data media median date was around here not me made february now in cities with the b117 varian now uh also known as the uk variant although we shouldn't be using country names now those with the b117 variant at the fastest outbreak now this is incident three the number of cases not per day no uh they had the fastest rates now since mid-february those with b135 or with both variants no had the second to the fastest increase in infections whereas those that did not have variance at the lowest increase so we know that variance did contribute a little not to uh to the to the search but we also notice here that even cities without variance uh had the search now so we know that there are also also other factors not involved let's look at those other factors so this is uh uh uh effectiveness of face covering stuffed face shields and face masks now uh so face face masks have an effectiveness of about 70 um if you have good compliance to it no the effectiveness in the population is about that much also you know 65 to 70 percent uh face shields also have the same level of effectiveness that used properly however uh unfortunately our compliance to the various patients that they loan about 30 so that at the population level the effectiveness is also very low um so combine uh the combined population of effectiveness of this is about maybe 69 no um the target of the uh is for ninety percent of the population to be wearing face master patients so if we're able to achieve that now uh we can actually increase the effectiveness of uh these non-pharmaceutical interventions to eighty percent you know uh eighty four and eighty percent is quite a high level of production and it's actually even higher under some of the vaccines you know so as you're waiting for your turn no procrastination just these these two things can protect you to the same degree uh let's look at super spreader events now so uh these are graphs of uh google google mobility trends if you own an android phone now google's tracking your movement from place to place now uh and it can tell us you know at the population level uh the amount of time now people spend in in certain areas also if you look back at christmas eve no there was an increase in time spent in groceries and also in retail recreation this includes include restaurants um later uh later in the um in the next month now uh for the translation um event there was also an increase in mobility for groceries and also for retail and recreation but also in parks and transport transport stations in contrast no we didn't see the same uh mobility no or rate of people going out for chinese new year and valentine's day so did this increase mobility contribute to cases um so this is for christmas eve now so uh so this was christmas eve and we know that mobility increased now when we look five to 14 days later no there was an increase no in the production number so we know that there was a pos holiday search about for translation uh the increased mobility did not uh result in uh an increase in reproduction number no and i think this is because this was mostly an outdoor activity you know so uh the even there was crowding on the the spread and was mitigated by uh open the open space okay how about the duration of infectiousness how did that contribute to the search now so uh from last year's data you know um when people get symptoms no they usually wait three days before they go to the health center or to see their doctor and get tested and it takes two days another two days to get their lab results now the current protocol is that when they're already symptomatic but before the test results come out you know are they already asked to quarantine so this is the probably the more significant period but we we know that the infectious period of coving is two days before symptoms and five days before symptoms so we know that in these three days uh they're infecting their colleagues at work or their household members and there's also some evidence that um a quarantine is also a bit leaky not everyone stays in quarantine or is quarantined early no or if contact racing is not completed uh soon enough no now you also have these people who are out in the open uh for their possible infections uh what about testing uh if we're able to do enough testing you know we can isolate inquiry and quality in people earlier and shorten the duration of infectiousness uh this is our positive cases we have now uh in our in our positivity rate is about 20 or so what that means is that to achieve a five percent positivity rate which is the standard set by who uh signifying good control of the outbreak now we need to be doing 200 000 cases at 200 000 tests instead so we need to do five times more than what we're doing now so if we can't find them no we can isolate or guarantee that uh where are the clusters coming from now most of them are still community clusters no people [Music] found in the household or spreading it in the household now but for this february search now we've seen that the number of workplace infections are also increasing also this was this december to january for hospitals uh government offices and workplaces now so in general oil workplaces now and then by far before very much now this had doubled or quadrupled uh so workplace clusters now are also contributing significantly okay so so that's how that's probably how the search now uh occurred you know uh it's not the virus uh alone it's multifactorial you know and each of these factors none that they uh identified or contributed to so from where do we go from here now or where do we go from here no uh first short term uh in the short term uh what will the ecq accomplish now again if we use the august search as a benchmark uh the number of cases will peak 10 days no into the lockdown so yesterday was the 10th day you know so in the next few days no uh we should watch uh carefully what's what's going to happen in the next few days uh however hospitalizations will peak two days at two weeks later you know because uh it would take time for people to to recover and be discharged from hospitals and we there's already a wave of cases now coming uh even i mean even if the cases come down here there's already we have cases that need to be admitted so in the short term that's what we're going to expect in the next two or three weeks uh how about in the long term no uh what goals should we set of ourselves um if this were baseline so let's say this was january uh and this is where we are now you know uh the varying because it increases stress there's visibility by about 56 percent so if it becomes a dominant stream no uh right now we don't we don't know yet whether it's a dominant strain now because we haven't done enough uh sampling now we've done that we've done a lot of testing of the genome or the virus no uh but the sampling has been an event uh but if it becomes a dominant strain this is where we will be you know a month after it becomes a dominant strain so we can probably set targets now so uh the rationale is that uh once the ecq is able to bring the number of cases down to the pre research baseline uh this is we we shouldn't be complacent at 500 or 1000 cases a day we should continue to drive them down and set successive uh goals now so that our baseline cases uh will be lower you know and if uh they're lower you know even with the variant we will not have the search that we have we're experiencing now so that that can be a long-term goal so how do we get there uh again it's useful to um [Music] it's useful to look to go back at the go back to the system model um and look at this now and we that right away we're able to identify several uh intervention points how do we decrease death rate how how do we reduce the number of active cases reduce transmission or speed up the the pace of vaccination um from the equation for r you know again we we find several ways now that we can we can do no uh to reduce the reduction number or reduce transmission improving compliance to the minimum public health standards now uh improving indoor ventilation also um those recently released guidelines now for improving ventilation in workplaces now but it will take time now for businesses no to install these avoiding mass gatherings now so this is uh individual behavior you know this is where the public community and business cycle can contribute but this is for government to do [Music] since uh people are delaying health seeking uh there should be active case finding like what they did in the arabi in india they did community community based testing now this is not mass testing now but this is bringing the the laboratories to the communities you know uh where we have a lot of cases uh it's difficult to do contact tracing now at the scale of the pandemic now uh but we have to prepare that capacity so that when the cases come down no we're able to do it better and prevent another search and we have to uh be able to measure now how efficient are we in isolation and quarantine um so um so if we look at the pandemic as a system no uh there's this uh systems uh one of the founders of systems thinking of the data meadows he said she said that there are about nine to 12 no ways we can intervene in a system to bring it into balance so i'll go through uh some of them uh i've color coded them in terms of effectiveness now so these are uh actually they're they're they're numbered in reverse order of effectiveness so these are the disaffected and these are the most effective so let's start with the the bottom three now so one way to influence systems is to manipulate constants parameters and numbers so these are uh providing subsidies taxes or setting standards no so for example we can set performance targets now for isolation and quality inefficiency meaning what percent of your positive cases or your symptomatic patients know do you isolate in 24 hours um but the reason that this is no i mean we we use indicators a lot in in the public sector and private sector but the reason this is one of the least effective ways to influence systems is numbers alone do that change behavior you need other interventions uh second you can second thing you can do is to change the structure of material stocks and flows not for example changing building new roads not changing the transport networks so if you remember a while ago now the exposed lead to infectiousness but if we improve indoor ventilation no not all of the exposed will become infected and some will some would become exposed but not infected so this that's one one way of changing the structure of the of the model no however you know facilities take time to revise and improve now um installing new filters no new fans will take time uh third no uh we can try to weaken uh or strengthen negative feedback loops now for example uh one loop no that's driving the pademic is that as i appointed a while ago more active cases uh increased transmission uh because uh there's uh more susceptibles are becoming exposed to these infectious cases so a negative loop that can counteract this uh growth in cases is to increase and maintain public health capacity to test trace and isolate no uh however um negative feedback loops you know i said they're usually uh backup loops no backup or reserve capacity no when they're not in use or when they're not needed no like uh when we had uh fewer cases when we had the two last year you know they're frequently dismantled when they're not used so such that when we have when we need it uh again uh they're no longer there for us to use uh so these are some of the things that intervention can accomplish now uh so sometimes simply opening windows and doors improves ventilation or installing fans but this will take time for for the the standards not to uh be disseminated across uh business sectors uh you can also improve air conditioning by installing this high quality filters now merge 13. uh and we have evidence that ventilation actually works so there was this case of a gym where a tray in their head was positive for colvin but none of the [Music] gym clients were infected because that prevented by improving ventilation and using a carbon dioxide monitor to monitor uh ventilation so this these monitors are actually available and you can you can buy them online um so i showed this a while ago now we have we also have to uh multiply by five times the number of tests that we're doing uh but it all this also presumes that we're able to find this cases so active case finding is also necessary uh so while we're in lockdown we have to uh ramp up again our contact racing ability now so uh last december now we uh disc this discontinued the contracts of uh most of the contact a lot of the contact tracers that were that were nationally hired now uh and because we ran out of money now to to pay for them now so we started the year you know with decreased contact raising ability and then i encourage you to read this article from raptlerno it's a very interesting and very detailed story of how when the search started no [Music] we lost control of the number of cases because we were not able to quattac trace isolate and quarantine you know and reduce the duration of infectiousness uh the second set also decide moderate effectiveness now [Music] so another way to intervene is to reduce the positive feedback loops so a positive feedback loop is as i said the more infectious cases uh more transmission leading to more infectious cases and yeah it continues to drive itself now uh so the way to break that is to reduce infectious cases uh by isolating them yeah um again that's difficult to do now uh but what's a better intervention is to uh reduce the um uh the number of cases or the number of exposed people that are feeding this uh positive loop no so you reduce exposure of the susceptibles uh so that it doesn't see the positive feedback loop anymore uh another way to intervene is to provide uh more information and this is actually a very effective way our efficient way of doing it like i say improving information does not cause a lot so for example what what we've tried to do now uh is to provide some barangay level maps that are visible to the public now unfortunately uh that website on uh uh on by the doi is that it's not very much uh use no public's not very well aware of it though but they could see the level of the outbreak in their barangay you know it it can change their behavior in terms of uh not just staying at home but also wearing masks and being more careful or all around so this requires data to be open and it requires uh innovation um so we're we're approaching the more effective interventions now so one powerful way is to uh reset you know or change the rules of the system no providing incentives punishments or constraints now for example um so as as toby mentioned a while ago now we don't have a single epidemic or outbreak no we don't have a national outbreak now we have what we have are uh different outbreaks now at different phases no or levels no the of the outbreak now some are just at the low level some are at the peak nor are accelerating some are slowing down and some are just have gone through a search and are waiting for the next one so uh we need to provide incentives and this is this incentive for each lg uh to rate them in terms of their performance for outbreak control but also to provide incentives uh for them for this incentives if they uh perform poorly no so right now jose although we do trap the the levels uh of the epidemic in each lg uh because of lg autonomy no uh there are no rules as to or consequences no for for different levels of performance so accountability is very important so for example just so this is from the voice faster website no it's called the faster website now f a triple s s s d e r you when you sign in or when you register you can actually zoom down to your own data and it can show this so for example red are uh marine guys with high level of transmission but also surrounded by other branded guys so these are uh hot spots no and then you also have uh but then guys with no cases no but also button guys for they don't have a lot of cases but they're also surrounded by modern guys with high levels of cases so if you're a resident of this banang and you have this information it can change your behavior so as i said so this is the uh the framework that we use uh to escalate or this as de-escalate as juice in terms of uh the severity of their outbreak or epidemic so before we allow lg us to de-escalate now we make sure that they have sufficient public health capacity and their customs case transmission is already at very low levels now before they are allowed to sort of pass through again you know and assume a low level lower level of humility quality status but this is voluntary now there are no rules no uh that will first of all even require lgs to submit their their data you know much less no consequences if they don't meet not their the standards uh and then the last set uh of leverage points now uh this power to i change evolve or self-organize now in short now this is the ability to innovate so for example after more than a year of the pandemic people have been experiencing pandemic fatigue they've been lost in compliance now they forget no it's more difficult to get yourself to do yourself to do it but design thinking is a process for uh we can uh rethink know or reinvent the way we communicate these messages or we motivate people to adhere you know to these public health standards but what what's necessary is in the decision-making process now uh we have to incorporate more diversity you know not just a hold of government but a host of society approach now we need other sectors to be involved in um decision making uh and we also need to allow experimentation and innovation to uh to come up with uh better fresher ideas so that we're we're not stuck in uh what we're doing now uh so again one of the more effective ways is uh rethinking what are the goals of the system no uh control they can control the outbreak or save the economy no um it's it's it's uh it's sort of strange also that uh some people think that we have to balance uh health with the economy as if now they're opposing opposing forces but actually public health or good public health uh also translate into a better economy you know so they're not conflicting forces now uh one of the former uh economic advisors in the obama administration uh said this very early in the epidemic now the number one rule of virus economics is that you have to stop the virus before you can do anything about economics and then finally the most effective way of changing or intervening in the system is to change your paradigm so once you change the paradigm everything downstream no changes no goals structures rules no incentives so we need to be looking upstream now and looking at the factors which uh may not directly have caused a pandemic but made it much worse than comparable countries so in equity housing transport working conditions so for example under ecq some people have been allowed to work because they're frontline essential workers but they're these are usually lower income uh workers also and then they have to take public transport now which is also unsafe you know uh they have they live in crowded housing so social justice is not really something that they can do and they report to workplaces now that may not have uh good safety protocols so we need to address not just the social determinants of health but also the political and commercial determinants of health so this is a study done on oecd countries now it shows how how econ economy and uh public health are related so these are four four countries that did a hammer and dance approach um but what's what's noticeable is that as debts started to go down they already opened up the economy now without waiting for it to come down at the to very very low levels now so this was a premature opening of the economy so so that's stayed low for a while the economy improved no but since they never really eliminated the viruses it was still there no they had the second third or uh as in the us now not a fourth surge and by the end of the year you know uh their economy uh had negative growth versus uh four other again developed countries um that uh uh try to or aim for elimination and not just mitigation so uh again they they knocked down except maybe in japan and is an outlier you know so uh this is this is a country that has a culture of wearing masks even before the pandemic also uh they actually were at the safety protocols pre-installed but when they what these four countries had in common was uh they drove the cases or the deaths very very low you know before they opened up um and all of these countries ended the year with positive bills except except for japan no not as bad as for the other countries so good public health also translate into good economics so again it matters no what what what is the goal of our system no um so this is the rate now the cur so if we look at the vaccination program which is the the sixth compartment in our pandemic system model this is the rate at which we're vaccinating [Music] after a year now we could probably get get up to about 10 million this is the goal that government has set no uh hurd immunity which is about 70 percent of the population uh the third immunity is an unrealistic goal no for several reasons no the duration of immunity given by the vastness is unknown some variants have already escaped no the protection of vaccines now a lot of the vaccines have decreased protection against the variants and the efficacy numbers that are reported for vaccines is israeli efficacy against being susceptible to the virus and effectiveness against progression of the disease meaning they're good at preventing mild and they're even better at preventing severe and severe disease and death no but we still don't know whether the vaccines are affected in preventing onward transmission meaning preventing transmission from the vaccine not the vaccine recipient to people who are not vaccinated so because of that no herd immunity may not be realistic at this moment so what what we should be aiming for is prevention of deaths and prevention of severe disease now which is what we know not that uh vaccination can do you know and uh we also know that variants are affecting the younger population now you know so even the younger population can be at risk for death now so we need to aim for 100 percent uh vaccination or full vaccination so this is the rate that which we should be doing it no so again this is an example of how uh setting a resetting that goes to the system uh will affect how the system operates uh and then this is a diagram or a framework of how we can look at uh covet 19 in terms of its uh upstream you know process this is just one part now social determinants but you can see that these are things these are weaknesses uh that we have now before the pandemic now and this is these are things that we need to fix you know um at the same time that we're uh trying to control the outbreak no or eliminate eliminate the uh the virus uh and this is my last slide now so we have seen that uh the problems are systemic now so it requires system solutions and not solutions that are done in isolation from each other thank you thank you very much uh thank you very much john um i'm sure our audience truly appreciates all all the things that you have said and presented and uh you know our the number of participants has been increasing over the past few minutes i think so john thank you so much uh there are a lot of questions in the chat box so i encourage you to continue to put your questions in there and we're going to ask our our resource persons to try to answer them while they're not talking or they have a break and um we have two reactors to this to this presentation um i'm going to turn over to raymond to introduce our next speaker thank you thank you for that excellent presentation as always dr john i miss going to your house so i hope we could get together soon thereafter sir um anyway i will go on to the to our reactors but before that let me give a quick shout out to uh the youtube college of medicine dean uh dean charlotte chong is in the call also as well as the director for the up manila community health development program and all the member spot now you p manila chdp uh together with director anthony herron anyway uh may we call on the very first speaker who will talk about from a clinical perspective pono she is an infectious disease specialist trained in the united states pono and is currently a political associate professor at the u.p philippine general hospital may we call on dr sibel lara abad dr sibel uh please go ahead with your reaction man hello thank you so much for the invitation today and let me just share my screen can you see my screen yes go ahead all right so thank you so much for having me today and i have the job of trying to digest dr wong's excellent talk but i was asked to focus mainly on the variance and why we should be concerned about these variants given everything that dr wong talked about so some reflection points that i i had to digest as a physician and as a filipino a member of society as dr wong has mentioned the b1 variant has shown an increased capacity to transmit the virus and because there's a lot of transmission so it's the nature of viruses to mutate to go forth and prosper uh to multiply other variants are sure to follow so we have to do something about that before we come up with a super variant and we'll talk about that in a bit the increased rates of transmission and the surge so to speak of our kovid is really overwhelming it's overwhelmed the physicians the healthcare workers and the hospitals and it's been very heartbreaking because we've had to turn down you know patients we know our own families uh or relatives because the hospitals are full and so kind of the flip side to that as mentioned by dr wong what what can we do to solve that you know as individuals now perhaps there has been inconsistency or laxity in the following protocols if you were here at the first part of this webinar there were people on the street saying following all these protocols because it's been a year and that is totally understandable and for some it's actually not doable right we always ask people to physically distance but sometimes there's just no space to do the distancing so we have to correct this and as dr wong mentioned it has to be a systems change and then finally you know as a clinician and as a doctor i'm always thinking with the emergence of these variants do our current strategy still work and will our vaccines work and this has been also alluded to by dr wong so let's try to answer some of these reflection points just so everybody's on the same page the variants also have some definitions so there's a variant of interest there's a variant of concern and a variant of high consequence so simply put a variant of interest is simply a variant that has changed enough that it is associated with perhaps reduction in neutralizing antibodies perhaps reducing the efficacy of treatments but this is kind of just anecdotal evidence not just an association it's not yet proven so there are actually many variants of interest at the moment but we want to focus our attention on the variant of concern because these variants have shown evidence already that there is increase in transmissibility such as the b1 variant right with an increase of more than 50 in terms of transmission it can cause more severe disease right such as increased hospitalizations or deaths so this is what we are concerned about as the label uh suggests but there is also a variant of high consequence and thankfully we do not have yet any variant that meets this criteria we will be in grave danger by the whole world if we have a variant of high consequence because this will show that the current preventive measures or medical counter measures are no longer effective so at the moment again we do not have yet any variant of high consequence so let's focus on the variance of concern now there are actually three variants of concern the b1 variant which was first discovered in the uk that dr wong discussed there's a b351 variant out of south africa and there's the p1 variant out of brazil right and these smaller notations here are the number of people in the philippines known to carry this variant already this is as of march 20. so these variants are here and so as shown by dr wong this is in part responsible for part of the search but as you saw in the graphs earlier there's also a surge in errors without the variant so there must be other things we're doing wrong or not correctly no so what can we do so as individuals and as members of society we can do little things that will amount to big things so perhaps we cannot do a system change by ourselves but we can do these little things no it just means going back to the basics so hand hygiene physical distancing frequent disinfection you know wearing our mask and our shields properly and now we have a fifth dimension so someone has to think of a catchy phrase now so lima bisa or something like that now we have vaccination in addition to this armamentarium and the way you think about these uh methods is you want to think about them in layers so the more layers you have the more we protect ourselves and others uh so that we will we don't transmit the virus forward so the way to think about it is to think about in terms of the swiss cheese model of prevention i always show this picture when i do lay for uh because they seem to get it when when now i show this picture so this is the swiss cheese slices so there are holes right and you want to plug as many holes as you can so when you have many layers you can plug all these holes such as the virus will not come across and infect this person to the right but note here and i want to emphasize this as well there are personal responsibilities in a pandemic this is what we're all doing already you know and this is what we're all tired of doing but we have to hang tight now but there are also shared responsibilities in a pandemic so you don't think only of yourself you think of your neighbor you think of the people around you so you have to follow or we all have to follow quarantine and isolation protocols we can't escape or jump ship and escape quarantine for example we have to abide and be tested or be contact trace and then finally we added on this layer here in the last slice of chase is vaccines and we'll talk about that in a second now here in the middle if you notice there is a mouse munching at the cheese so this is who you call the misinformation mouse and dr susan pineda mercado earlier mentioned that so there's a lot of noise and this is all coming from the misinformation mouse you know so i think i want to also emphasize that people should follow the science just as dr wong presented there's really a lot of science behind kovid 19 and we should stop listening to these rats so i'll just call them a rat or the misinformation nice so yeah we have to be very careful and be discerning in terms of the things we forward on viber or the things we forward on facebook is it true is it fake or is it a half truth so we have to contribute as well in terms of trying not to forward misinformation pieces so what else can we do to slow transmission and this in my mind is how i envision the virus mutating or the variance so viral replication is in the order of thousands per day or even millions sometimes depending on the virus so the more it multiplies again the more chances it can form a variant which are these in different colors so what you want to do is you want to slow down transmission so that you can prevent emergence of these variants and you can do it just by doing things that we're doing already so hand hygiene wearing your ppe's your mask and your shield properly physically distancing if you can and of course vaccines so here's my two cents on vaccinations so vaccines still work okay and again as mentioned it will decrease the number or the end of the susceptible population and it will also modify illness right so what we want to happen is we want to get vaccinated so that if we get covered 19 we will not get severe illness we will just get mild over 19 a very mild cold for example or flu-like illness so that we can also help decongest the hospitals for example and in terms of vaccination we also want to think about prioritization which we're already doing right we're vaccinating the healthcare workers first the frontliners and then the seniors who are at risk of very severe clothing 19. so there is some speed or there's some urgency to getting vaccinated and there's also equity because i think we have to think about it in terms of the whole philippines everybody will eventually and should eventually be vaccinated because we want to avoid what i like to think of as a vaccination gradient again this is kind of the picture in my mind so if we have two areas with covid19 for example and they both have a lot of viral transmission but area one is a bit more successful than area two in stopping the transmission of virus so let's say they've been able to curb or flatten their surge eventually because the economy will open up or because of the laws of physics or the loss of science there's actually diffusion or osmosis or travel right of people from area two to area one so because area two is not very successful in curbing the virus then eventually area one will again be reinfected and perhaps even be infected with the emergence of a super variant or a variant of high consequence which is what we really want to avoid at this point so kind of some take-home thoughts for you to think about in the next few months or the next few days even with the variants our current minimum health protocols still work so please try and hang in there and wear your masks and wear your shields and remember to layer up so if you have to go out because you know you have to a job to do you have to feed your family then just wear your mask and wear your shield the more layers you do the more likely you are to stop the transmission of the virus and the less likely you are to be infected yourself in terms of urgency to vaccinate we have to vaccinate a lot as dr wong showed you in the graph what we have to do it the right way because we want to also avoid the emergence of a super variant or a variant of high consequence and as everybody put in the chat box i also like this line now there's also virus economics if you control the virus that we control the economy and i think that's my last slide i just want everybody to be safe and if we are safe only if everyone else is safe thank you very much thank you very much uh that was dr sebia lara abbad again another excellent presentation thank you so much for that very clear uh on the variance and i'm sure i can already see in the chat box or a lot of a lot of questions so i'm gonna ask our doctors to continue to try to answer on the q a in the q a box okay so we're going now to another reactor and um just a little bit of a backstory when we started this last april so our webinars theory started lasting the person who helped put together the first set of speakers for the stockholm death webinars that's webinar is dr eileen david um we talked a bit about who do you put who do we put in the webinar first if we want to have clarity on clinical management of kovid remember at that time we didn't know you know we had very little information but pgh plunged into research right away and was as they were going along modifying protocols and so on and in this webinar we did talk about for the first time cytofine storms proning uh using not not ventilating to intubating too early and so on and so forth and the person who worked on getting those speakers in the early days was none other than dr david one so we're very happy to welcome her back she's professor of medicine at the university of the philippines and is uh one of the leading pulmonologists in the country eileen welcome thank you very much susie so now before you start eileen um give us a give us an idea of what the situation is like right now uh at the philippine general hospital yes allow me to include that this uh reaction course we'll see later so again thank you for this kind uh invitation again susie and raymond and the stop kovid team and i would like to share this first infographic now benign pgh group naming it's been a year since this horror started and we still haven't awakened from this nightmare and indeed frontliners they really rose to the occasion and i think over and beyond what is expected of them over and beyond their call of duty and as mentioned by susie she invited me to speak at the very first stop kovid webinar and can you imagine number 47 and susie actually asked me to talk about conducting research during this pandemic how visible it is and i think at the from the beginning we already saw the importance and the need for unavailable indisputable evidence so that it can help us in caring for our patients and at that beginning at that outset we already talked about how we can possibly conduct research and i think we are fortunate that we have scientists like john who the legal ignores the strong opinions and strong emotions and just sift through all the noise and just gives us he analyzes he looks at uh what figures and numbers and trends that do not lie so that we know what we can do so i was asked to give my reaction one as a clinical researcher and two as a clinician pulmonologist and it young how i feel about john stock first each of his slides i think gave uh acaring so i think he opened our eyes to the sobering reality of our current situation and formerly at least for me i really couldn't see the forest for the trees so if you look at all the social media and all the news with all these things and but we don't really know what's happening and i think for today so and i also found solace despite being confronted by the results of his big data analysis and that we we did see the big picture and now at least we know now how to move forward and to quote aristotle or probably misquote him knowing ourselves is the beginning of all wisdom and i have another favorite adage this time from george santayana those who cannot remember the past i condemn to repeat it and we're right there right one step forward two steps backwards so what do we do next for the next year so how how do we stop this so i thought that john's presentation was factual it was incisive it was succinct it was pretty compelling to me he was informative you can really tell that he the presentation was well thought out and there was extensive prior preparation and i think the most important thing as i've mentioned he provided clarity amidst this chaos of all the background noise and misinformation going around and pero hindi long negative or doomsday scenario he did propose solutions and they are science based he emphasized the need for systems change and i think for us even for the layman we need to think along this way and if there's one take home message for me it's that we need to trust science and hard statistics which brings me allow me to make another last adage passable from adam smith science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition so let's talk science just to share with you and i thank nina berba for sharing these slides with me she's the head of our hiko control so pgh just to show you that what's hap what happened or what's happening in the in our hospital mimics what happened to in the community just what john presented so in pgh in march 66 of our health care workers got their infections not from the hospital but from the community or household and as you can see it from all of these and a new young definition of activities from community community spread and if you will actually see how it affects our work in pgh those infected co-workers who still work and expose others they produce the greatest disruption to our operations so young called liga isolate yourself i remember nina sharing one info graphic for every healthcare worker was infected the infection of four to five others so what happened in pgh the same as in the community microcosm within the macrocosm so as a clinician and as a researcher what evidence convinces us to prescribe a new drug for our patients so let me share with you one study that came out early in the pandemic march last year 80 admitted patients with covid19 they were given drugs a and b and look nice results 83 negativeness viral load clearance by day seven 93 by day eight and 97.5 showed clinical improvement with the mean hospital stay of five percent and only one death that makes it one percent really nice results right so this was actually one of those studies that were released in march talking about the beauty or the uh effectiveness coat and coat of hydroxychloroquine this time combined with acetomycin and this and similar studies moved politicians uh donald trump to telegun uh try to to brasso the arms of the cdc to put c hydroxychloroquine there in the guidelines and actually in our clinical pathways we actually put it there as well but many months later the huge recovery trial came out it's a uk multi-center it's a randomized controlled trial obviously you've noticed that the original one did not have a controlled arm so these were huge numbers comparing hydroxychloroquine with usual care and what did this study find so hindi one percent the debts at least within 28 days 27 much much higher for the hydroxychloroquine group and although it did not show overall a difference in the usual care but what they found the patients given hydroxychloroquine were less likely to be discharged from the hospital alive and if they were not incubated at baseline they had a higher frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation and eventual deaths and there was some concern about some excess of cardiac deaths so this was published in a high impact peer-reviewed journal new england journal of medicine so take note of the difference between a cohort study with no control and a randomized controlled trial then let's look at the natural history of kovid so as of yesterday 23 million of active cases 99.6 of them have a milder disease and i would like to quote who country representative uh see rabbindra and as seen as a natural history nancovid for those patients have recovered actually more than 95 percent of them recovered without specific treatment so if you give that patient a certain drug that's mainly now you'd think that that drug actually cured them and dr abbey has said this is not science this is not evidence so in god we trust all others must show data but what kind of data do clinicians trust and i know that there are laymen in the group so let me just share with you how we oh sorry how we look at evidence-based medicine we actually have a what we call a hierarchy of research design and based on this we assign levels of scientific evidence at the very bottom are the animal and laboratory studies which we call mechanistic studies and then next human testimonials from a series of cases that show a good outcome or poor outcome and expert opinions and then the observational studies case control uh retrospective studies prospective studies and at the top of the pyramid they're not as many but they're the most important are the robust well-conducted randomized control trials and the pulling of those results of those rcts which we call meta-analysis only rcts can actually or have the ability to control bias and therefore will have more valid results and can truly demonstrate cause and effects in humans in the indubitably so this is how we look at it and unproblemat all that noise and all those uh misinformations going on and let me quote again dr abbayya singh here the fight against the info demi has been even more difficult than the fight against the pandemic so just to show you how it is in my village um one of our residents actually posted this uh facebook group naming comparing mrna vaccine with a controversial drug i'm not going to mention what it is yeah for effectivity it's proven to kill kovid in laboratory experiments positive from positive trends from retroactive studies and widespread anecdotal evidence and effectivity and if you remember from my pyramid those are way way at the bottom of our levels of evidence although young resident one acknowledge that there are conclusive data inconclusive data rather or still lack of data from well-controlled prospective human studies pero since highly effective against parasites you can give it and in case you have that you hit two birds with one stone so potassico with but i didn't see parasite but this is the problem that we have now and i really think we need to address this by uh sibel has actually given all those beautiful steps how we can do this try not to share fake news or have truth news so how is it like in the in up in manila what are we doing in our group so in april of last year i presented the proposals or the studies that we were planning to do and what is the scenario for the next 12 months i would expect that we will be able to share already the results of these studies so these are all sponsored by pchrd and what you can actually look at from our study group we try to see all the salient disease aspects so that we'll be able to understand the disease further and we will know what works so as you can see we looked at epidemiology clinical profiles outcomes predictors of mortality lab-based studies and then separate very important this is transmission and infection control i put in yellow the project leaders for each of these studies and then we all we're also looking at impact of covid19 families and patients miss more i included here the rapid leaving reviews of our very own nih institute of clinical epidemiology in coordination with the philippine society of microbiology and infectious disease so there and then we're doing predictive models we're trying to validate them and also addressing ethical issues so the ethical guidelines on call with 19 crisis level has actually been published already by dr lenny fernandez and finally the most important studies looking at diagnostics the utility of the various biomarkers to detect cytokine storm and predicting hospital mortality and also coagulation parameters and the randomized control trials those important studies in our very own population so hopefully by end of next year we'll have an answer for you on convalescent plasma therapy ibitosilisma virgin coconut oil oil wh we are part of the wh o solidarity trial and we've actually already published uh the interim results last year and nina bear was doing the avignon trial she's the country investigator for this i did not include here the vaccine studies were also involved in them and finally among the studies as we speak we're actually also developing the program from for what comes after kovid so we're looking at long long or long haul covered or what we should now call the was task and to try and understand and address this and plan for it to help our patients and finally i think this is my last slide in the hospital what are we doing so in march april we formed clinical pathways to try and to make uh standardized how we manage our patients at the pgh and in april of this year or early this year rather we actually updated this we've been updating this continually throughout the past year and you'll expect that in the next 12 months we'll still do this depending on what new data appears so what you will see here in the clinical pathway we've put here those that have been shown to work by solidarity and all the other trials including steroids or dexamethasone for the more severe patients an oxamarine or anticoagulation that works and then umbrella de severe for a certain group of patients so usually those patients were moderate to severe in character and then all the other trial of all the other interventions hemoperfusion you will see here and dosilisumab so studies also now coming from the recovery trial showing that tosylisumab will be effective for patients with high inflammatory markers like crp so that is what we've been doing in at the pgh and you'll expect that we'll still be doing that and finally as a last slide we've had some doomsday scenario my vote of confidence and let me quote one of my favorite ideas aside from sibel of course dr edsel how good are filipino doctors and healthcare workers during the covid19 pandemic world-class better than world-class our death rate of 1.8 percent is lower in many countries so out of the top 30 countries with the highest number we actually have the second lowest so at least some hope and some confidence in with with our frontliners and i think that's my last slide thank you very much susie back to you all right thank you very much that was dr eileen uh david another excellent presentation and you'll see in the chat box uh i lean all of the uh also for also for uh for john and for sibel okay we're going to call everybody back now um toby uh sibel john um and um aileen and i understand that uh dean charlotte trump of the u.p college of medicine is around charlotte you're most welcome to join the panel if if if you can okay so we're going to now go into our panel our panel discussion but before before we go into the panel um raymond is going to inform our panelists of who the audience is so raymond please go ahead thank you dr susie and thank you to mom aileen i i particularly like the suspense but i was actually trying to wait for um the naming of that controversial drug next week nothing in my entire manner we have five questions we'll start with the demographics 54 of those who inputted their locations are located in metro manila next up are those from northern and southern luzon and then also central luzon with one percent comprising of attendees from outside of the philippines as always majority and 56 of those who are attending our webinar are from the medical and nursing sectors [Music] very much excited to tease that out we have um three questions i'll try we'll probably try to answer this later dr seuss he will go to the panel discussion uh before we try to answer these questions thank you okay thanks a lot okay so um for our panel discussion i thought what i'd like to do is uh because toby's toby started us off on on um on economic side of it and how uh the investments in public health are actually good for the economy so i'm going to ask toby to have a reaction and maybe to ask a question to our to our panelists so i hope i'm not putting you in this on the spot i'm sure there are questions you know that come out of what you heard so uh toby let me turn it over to you no i'm i'm i i have i'm happy i heard the same thing from john you know he calls it virus economics for me it's it's uh really quite simple right it's not about controlling the outbreak versus growing the economy or even in a sequence it's not the first is a necessary condition for the second case and i think what um and i think we're seeing that now because we're going you know back and forth and back and forth on on all these things um i think what uh what what what what the questions i had actually um to john and the rest were were things like this no um for example with with respect to john because i'm thinking about okay so what does this mean operationally right what are we talking about and i got many messages from john and from an economic viewpoint we are into we need to prioritize because of budget and time constraints we cannot just say vaccinate all we cannot do that right and so it's not helpful to policy to say things like that um what is what what for me it's like i'm happy you said something about you know testing and you need the point that our testing must be five times more than what we're doing now that's really important to me however i'll also still ask because the debate in april last year was are we talking about diagnostic testing or surveillance testing because that was the big debate the oh did not want to do surveillance which is what we thought as economists was necessary in order to track the dynamics of the of the of the um of the pandemic of the virus right not so much for clinical or diagnostic purposes and honestly i think that's what we're missing now we don't have that right because we never did it so it's important that we define um what you mean by five times more right so it could be a combination um i'm happy also that you're saying contact tracing mainly because this group is across the country right what's happening in ncr is not happening in other in other places and like i said before i do believe obviously that nci needs to get its act together and roll out but with the national government um but that as a priority may not be the same as somewhere in the visayas right so the question to everyone i think from a regional viewpoint or provincial viewpoint if you had one more peso where would you put it would you put it in vaccinations would you put it somewhere else that's the economic question for me right and i think that if um the doh for instance now and i'm not quite clear how they're allocating vaccines i'm not you know is it equal because typically that's what they did before if i don't divide by n everyone gets everyone gets something even if the level of priority is so different across the country and now if you're saying that you want to uh vax you know vaccinate a good percentage in order to optimize that measure right the instrument is vaccinations where would you put that would you distribute it across the country from an economic viewpoint that doesn't make sense right um and so i think you need to do that and from from the health uh public health uh people it would help if you if you say that uh this is the general rule but you know you have to apply um some sort of cost effectiveness or uh efficiency analysis to say what where when and when right um that's my i know and i think uh the stuff that john was talking about and others nika it's like yes systems thinking but systems thinking itself must be unbundled some is short term some is medium some is long term whenever you make um recommendations not only do you disaggregate by geography because we are just as john said we are different pandemics happen epidemics happening all over the place but also short long uh medium and long term so that we don't get overwhelmed right so from what i understand from susie in our previous discussion maybe in ncr is vaccinations because because it's happening in congested urban areas how can you even isolate right so maybe that that thing in ncr is so different from um i don't know uh you know the rest of cebu province and so forth so if we can if we can have that then economists can help you know um uh you know can help parse that i had that there was a comment in the chat box about um you know how do you deal with the no work no pay right because of pandemic my only answer is well government has to provide ayuda if there's going to be a government imposed lockdown such that people cannot work they have to come in the other question was can we print money to give printing money guys is a is a phrase we use um it's one way to raise funds right um from the from the bank essential viewpoint there's a technical thing with that you don't just you know print money and then give it away though you can um but i think the issue here is um our economic managers don't seem to get and i'm sorry if anyone's in the room don't seem to get that yes we prepared for a rainy day we were strong before the pandemic so now you borrow to the hilt your country is suffering what are you doing trying to monitor you know this is the time that you use you leverage those fundamentals to to borrow to the health etc so that the country does not die and households do not die and in in from an economist viewpoint remember for as long as you use the borrowed money wisely then it will all pay back later on the issue is if you don't use that borrowed money wisely then you won't get the returns later on so that's you know that's what we need to do right um i i do i i agree that if we are in a lockdown stage we're not we shouldn't even talking about recovery it's relief it's relief and then you set up uh for um for recovery the way everyone's been talking about thank you thanks toby john you want to respond to that yeah i i feel like i was in my master at this defense [Laughter] you're kind of starved it's john i want your slides the testing i mentioned was uh diagnostic testing so these are people who are symptomatic who need to be tested now so that the the decision could be me to isolate or quarantine them let's say we also don't want to indiscriminately isolate people no even though they're negative no but i i agree that surveillance testing is also necessary one study by the cdc said that in the u.s for every person that was that tested positive they missed about 4.5 other people no uh i think here in the philippines it it would be it'd be much larger you know so uh we uh well we might be closer to our immunity than we actually think no because of those uh undiagnosed people um regards to vaccination uh i i also did the uh the the modeling that uh toby mentioned what if we just focus on ncr uh because that's where most of the cases are and most of the deaths are and i i didn't look at the economic side no but just from uh epidemiologic side though uh we actually do see more deaths now uh uh focusing just on on ncr but the problem is and we're supply constrained also no so uh if we had unlimited supply now we could do that and say uh i don't remember how many lives we we would save though but i also looked at the the timing of the delivery of the the vast seas now we we we won't be getting it in time not to be able to do it at that scale and i agree with you the in systems approach that has to be both prioritized in terms of person place and also time just to um john so if there's a supply constraint the more so it shouldn't be just distributed across the country yeah if there's a supply constraint so it's it's you have to sequence it and it's not only and i i understand about seniors but you know i remember susie bringing this up um you're talking about this earlier right after seniors we should really think about the working age population right i mean it's like if you really wanted to to do that shouldn't that be next right so my point with the ncr which you share right there is a supply constraint so the more you have to prioritize who gets it first the more so and yeah that's all thanks yeah so uh the government does have prioritization and they did prioritize uh saving lives first now so these are seniors uh but also persons with comorbidity now they have on the average 1.5 times the risk of death and then uh the the next two goal would be in frontline essential workers no so i think this this group have a lower risk of death but the higher risk of infection because they're they're the people out there you know um so yeah i think that's uh yeah thank you is it is it seniors across the country or is it is it at least geographically um sequence right right now it's across the country yeah well that's what i mean i mean i i'm being very cold it may come out very cold right but the risk honestly the risk of someone who's not senior may be higher in ncr than someone who's senior outside that's my point right so you that's the that's what i mean that the national if we cannot just apply national analysis we've got to go down right because we don't have enough money we don't have enough supply and we don't have time that's a resource allocation issue when i did that exercise my experience was that it's not just an epidemiological economic issue it's it's also ethical not uh you're also already deciding who who's likes to save first person when you prioritize ncr no uh some lives will will be lost also in other regions so but it needs a bet a wider discussion across a broader group of stakeholders no i agree john but you you just said in your slide that you know masks and shields can give you almost equal protection i i'm just saying you know can you you know we i'm i'm not suggesting that someone is saved saved first because there as you said there are other measures that could maybe um [Music] be at you know approximate the vaccine the vaccination right so as you it was in your slide so i'm wondering right if you know given the spillovers and given everything else some hard choices have to be made but that doesn't mean that you're you're condemning someone to die it just means that in the meantime right in other places can we make sure that masks and and are available for seniors in rural areas right i mean that's all we're we're saying can you use that first while the supply comes on stream yeah i think i think i i think you know and that's why we entitled this webinar what to expect in the next 12 months no yeah but an ideal world we would like you know everything everyone to have access to everything ideally but that but that's not that's not the situation and in fact let's ask our clinicians i was gonna ask um both eileen and uh sybil um because they're seeing it on the front line right uh to describe to us a little bit what they're seeing and what they think the effect is going to be on on the system because um well okay so i get it that that we we actually know what the trends are so john has given that to us i think toby you're talking about what the consequences are of not shifting our prioritization or going more more localized but i think from the point of view of of the front line which i'm going to ask id now and ask sybil um where earlier we were talking about nurses are leaving hospitals or you know patients are dying in the emergency room so let me turn over to eileen and maybe to civil and just talk a little bit about because because there's a short term right there's the long term and the ideal that we want to do but there's this right now we are in a crisis so what are you seeing and how do you think we're going to mitigate that so let's go to eileen first allow me to ask sibel first because she's a frontliner she's right there okay she's good yes but so so in the front line visually it's really it's a war zone um the ers look like a mess there's too many people in the er inside and outside of the er this is both in the private and the public health setting so pgh looks the same as the medical city in terms of volume of people and by the way they're just waiting outside distinction between private and public hospitals just to paint the picture um and it's the the recent surge has really stressed the capacity of all hospitals now in the ncr the big hospitals uh to accommodate the sicker patients so it's been very stressful because it's getting closer and closer to home i know parents apparent seven degrees of separation now it's closer and closer to home i know relatives now and colleagues now we're admitting them or not being able to admit them is even more stressful because you know they call you and they you know you try to look for a bed for them and almost certainly indicate successful no so that's very stressful and um so maybe a hospital for example right now i am in the pgh icu it's just virtual rounds but we have to triage there's about 22 people lined up for the icu just to get in the icu but it's full and so a lot of them unfortunately either get too sick or die outside of the icu or wherever they are in the er or in the pila no so that's how it is a private hospital um people are spending five days in the er where they should just be spending hours there and some of them die in the er while waiting for their room so but i understand that because shebrey if you have a loved one you want to get into a hospital but without having choice because incoming we're always about trying to find solutions so part of the solutions we're trying to uh hopefully uh we're talking some people are talking to um the government and other lgu's company may be recovering patients maybe they can just step down to a facility somewhere paramount open up in rooms something like that uh some have even maybe said open up field tents for the uh for those who can do that um and also home care now um is home care where people who have the means or people who have at least some people to take care of them or help them but these sicker people who should be admitted we're trying to help at home so this is how it looks like in the field um it's really quite a mess um so we really need all the help we can get mama eileen thank you thank you sorry what do you think where are we going where are we going now in addition to what sibel has mentioned um we'll need to consider also with all those increased number of cases the worry particularly among us great care people the lack of medications important medications that are starting to run out and i think we're still fortunate in pgh we have a very proactive supportive leadership who see these things and at least we're more better prepared in pgh but i've seen small hospitals in outside of metro manila not having not even having the basic needs and uh something for me which was a shock they should have had at least a year to prepare for this and you find out they don't even have high flow nasal cannula etc so at least for the next 12 months this has to be addressed the problems of the variants i don't think is going to go away we can try i think the most important still is to kill the source of those viruses so we really need to isolate the hosts it's still very important i think the priority should be in contact tracing and community isolation i think we should have those sign hospitals like in china those huge tent hospitals if we can set those up at least to relieve the tertiary hospitals so that we can really just take care of the moderate to severe patients so um that's my additional take on what sibel has mentioned yeah i mean john also said that you know the the the peak and you will see a peak in hospital hospitalizations in two weeks so what do we need to do to prepare for that i don't know who wants to answer that john maybe you should answer that question not your your uh what what what are the what's being put in place for this we already know we already anticipating a huge number of hospitalizations and you know we've got 3 000 people who are listening to us right now from all over the country what kind of preparations need to be put in place whether it's in metro manila or the outskirts of metro manila so see i think let's also ask john when do we expect to see the benefits of the is of the lockdown okay do we start doing it now and where where is that is that ncr sorry yeah so uh if we if this this current search follows the pattern of the previous search now and just looking at ncr uh the the the peak should have been yesterday 10 days after the lockdown and then hospitalization will be two weeks after uh after yesterday uh two weeks after the peak of the cases well with regards to uh susie's question of uh i think you phrase it correctly now how do we prepare for the next search because i think it's already too late not to uh uh to do anything about the the way the hospital system has been overwhelmed and we we should have prepared for this search during the interim no between august and now uh one one of the things we realized is that uh we'll be measuring beds and ventilators no but now we realize that uh healthcare workers are actually a scarcer resource now they're more difficult to to increase in number and they're more difficult to replace especially now that they're also uh hospital clusters uh that's that's that's uh that's that's all i can say then i i hope i wish i had better news wow okay riemann uh rama did you want to ask a question or do we have a question from the audience well we have uh mom maria cecilia cecilia polido uh coming in from uh our live audience uh mom me uh may we ask you to unmute and ask your question but it's the most upvoted question in the q a yeah we can hear you now go ahead good afternoon uh my question is uh our government is also pointing out that pasawise are the main reasons for this search but i believe that we citizens are not given the means and measures to cope against a massive community transmission uh there is poor mass transportation ventilation and capacity no safety net for our daily wage earners in our administration uh what do we do what we ask our administration to increase the compliance to health standards and be trustful in reporting possible contacts without being stigmatized that's all thank you very much wow okay who wants to answer the question i've heard him answer this question before [Laughter] i've answered some some of the questions though so uh i i don't uh i disagree that i know poor compliance is the main factor you know it's one of it's one of many factors though uh variance uh for contact tracing isolation quarantine so it's multiple and i don't think it's uh it's the main factor uh second i i also believe that uh we should have uh lockdowns with equity meaning it shouldn't just be a lockdown no but there should be economic relief also enough for uh for people who need it the question of your last question of how do we improve better uh how do we how do we improve compliance i think this is where uh we need more more more innovation more design thinking processes uh [Music] initially it uh it was it worked when uh people were people were afraid people were cooperative but uh i said as it dragged on now you know uh their other concerns uh became uh a stronger factor in uh influencing their compliance so i i don't have a good answer for that but uh i think uh we need to do uh more or introduce more design thinking processes in the decision making but uh we have more uh more answers for this but one one one easy maybe not easy no but but one one way we can do it is uh the more effective mass are are the surgical mass and the uh in 95 ps94 no uh if we can if government can can pay for that no at least for people who cannot afford it though that's one way to increase the protection right away yeah um i think that i agree with john and that first of all you cannot ask people to stay home uh without without providing uh subsidies of some sort right in cash or any kind it's just it's just not feasible i mean sorry it just it makes no sense you know uh the risk of getting um the risk of infection is much smaller than the you know the fear of you know is much more than the fear of going hungry or or something right so you have to provide so it's not possible to have a la it should not be done that a lockdown is imposed without that and if they do without ayudar of some sort and if they do that you already know that there's some i don't know a flaky decision making going on right um it's like i think one of the officials early in the lockdown last year remember remember he said something like that and so um it was ridiculous so we can't have that okay um uh second i i know what you're talking about you're saying that how can we really uh comply with um non-pharmaceutical you know instructions like social distancing if they do not provide if mass transportation is not uh adequate right so yes okay you have you allow work now but if they're all crowded in buses or whatever there's not enough they have to line up line up for hours to get there then you know that's that that's why we have you know that could also lead to another surge right um so the answer to that is straightforward then there must be some sort of public um intervention with respect to providing more buses or subsidizing private um you know the private sector to mobilize vehicles for that matter if it's an annoying um you you you must solve the problem directly because if you go around in circles right you may not get there now if they cannot do that right it's effectively a partial knock down for people who can't get to work right and so you go back to the enough um uh household subsidies right so i think um [Music] you know maybe we can't do anything about this surge and i'm not sure that but certainly can we now do figure out the next search right so if we already know that this search did not we had infrastructure was bad health workers were were in short supply etc then what okay you know what is it do we now you know all those quarantine facilities that were built can they be remobilized or repurposed for um i don't know intensive care something you know is there a is there a uh is there a program sana better than the contact racing program you know that you know you can really uh mobilize people who may not be who may be out of work now right um and repurpose them to be some sort of supplement health worker in some capacity you know what i'm saying in other words you you um i don't know what or repurpose some parts of your labor force that are now finding themselves without work because the tourism industry is dead and so forth can they be somehow used to help relieve uh the health system you have we have to think out of the box yeah i know i know i'm not supposed to do this and i rarely do it but i'd like to answer the question too because toby's very provocative i mean i think to help compliance one of the things the government should do it should make testing all testing free if all testing is free then people will know they will know if they have to stay home not stay home they will do their own contact racing okay so short of having an improved contact racing system if you do one thing you make all testing free and actually testing is not that expensive it's expensive because it's in the hands of the commercial sector but if you find a way to test everybody to make testing available to everyone people will go for testing they're going to do that now the other thing is john is correct when you go you know make make masks and shields free make that available for everybody and the third one of course is every time you lock down you should receive something in your bank or your paypal or whatever it is there is it is there is no reason to not give people money during a lockdown because if you tell people to stay home and they have no money are they gonna stay home they're not going to stay home they're not pass away they're hungry they have no they have no food and we you know toby just reminds me of many years back like we were saying distribution distribution of relief food is very expensive because logistics in unlucky if you just put cash you you give people direct cash okay they will comply i don't think our man is they need to be capacitated so i'm sorry i'm giving an opinion but testing should be 100 free and i don't know people are going to get mad at me but and we have the money for that right so you see we have i mean phil health has a whole whatever stack of money that there are okay let's not go into that right yeah i gotta get started on that right but i know that i know that but i guess our point is we can do it yes it can be done so yeah yeah you know on the cash i i i agree with you i think there are certain circumstances where i think in the beginning of the um lockdown last year where the supply chains themselves were disrupted and therefore when you have cash and no supply then it doesn't you know what i mean that could be a a situation where it should be in kind right so there are certain circumstances maybe that's not the case anymore yeah so um anyway rather than rather than putting money to building highways or something give people okay we're we are past the top of the hour all right sorry everybody we got excited we're getting a little emotional yeah yeah we have some i know we have some uh we want to answer the questions to the opinion poll so raymond let's go to that so that and then we're going to close i mean i know we could talk about this for a long time but we're you know we're we want to honor everybody's time and raymond let's go to the questions and let's ask our guests to to answer them thank you dr susie um for the first question well actually it's the third question in the poll how much more transmissible is the b117 variant is it 26 56 or 76 percent dr john 56 56 thank you sir uh so for those of you regular people will appreciate thank you sir um number four is for professor toby monsoon the economy can only recover if the public health crisis is contained true or false ma'am okay absolutely yeah okay and then uh finally uh so this is how it goes we they have to hear it from the expert themselves okay okay yeah then the the fifth question would be which variant of concern was first discovered in the philippines let me call uh uh it's the b1 the uk variant was first discovered here uh but the one that from here or the new variant here is the p3 variant but the first variant in general is the b1 vary thank you thank you dr sibel uh may we call on all of our panelists back and then let's let's probably ask for their final reminders or messages for address to our attendees yeah everyone i think are we doing the evaluation also raymond i'm seeing it on myself oh yes okay okay so while we're while they are going through their messages phone or we maybe asked also our attendees to please fill out or key in your answers for the panel discussion assessment uh there are five questions uh but in the interest of time just in a nutshell it's mostly about how much you have learned and how it was delivered to you with regards to the topic what are the scenarios for the next 12 months for call with 19 here in the philippines over to you dr susie thanks raymond okay so we're about to close but we'd like to ask um everyone to just uh give a very short a very short message and i think uh the question the question we want to ask is um what's your advice what's your advice to all these doctors nurses who are listening to us right now what's your advice for the next year for this coming year so we'll start with eileen yeah i i think coming talking uh coming from all the lectures that we heard today um let us not let us try not to make gatum young disinformation and misinformation so and i think let's leverage young social media by sukuru going to the advocacy groups about proper use of masks what kind of masks are effective and how do you clean face shields etc and you know friends not then let's try to get drives how to give free masks and free face shields to our less fortunate co-citizens thank you very much eileen very very positive message and something that we can all we can all do okay so uh 7 yes um thank you again for inviting me here and to all the fellow healthcare workers the doctors the nurses especially uh so today is anonymous today is we probably don't say it enough to all of you especially the nurses who have stayed and who are still with us throughout this pandemic and just hang in there i'm with you in the front lines so we just take it day to day uh we can do this this will end so hang in there great thanks uh john well i think the first thing to do is uh continue protecting yourselves now because uh there are a lot more clusters now in hospitals so get uh get your vaccine if you haven't yet no uh i think only half of the health workers have gone to take the vaccine and then second i'll try to uh observe you in health protocols like i say a lot of the clusters also come from uh i mean health workers coming back to eat together again but uh i think i know maybe the more important message is uh we need to uh get our political leaders to to do more and to do better and i think health workers have a lot of social and political capital that they can use but have not you have not yet maximized though uh i think we we need to all speak up no and get government to the same thank you thank you very much toby um same as everyone else i all i can say is please keep keep safe we need you thank you um i wish we did a better job um in terms of resource allocation and prioritizing and and and i hope we can do um and i hope we can push um so that you know moving forward investments are in in the public health system led by you um will will really will really be made rather than in anything else so i think you know from an economic viewpoint it's it's our economic managers i think that have to come around um in that sense as well sorry but uh we'll we'll keep on trying we'll keep trying yeah thank you very much toby okay so um we have a uh closing statement and a bit of a summary coming from our executive vice president uh for up tender bossa ted over to you thank you very much susie and it's you know you guys always amaze me it's the 47th episode of this and the first one was a blockbuster and each one continues to be blockbuster on top of the other one and for all the people that are here in this webinar you know these guys that work for this they prepare a lot they think about this they choose who to bring in and every week every friday i am impressed with the level of information that you have been able to deliver today is no different and uh today is more auspicious and cyber already talked about it it's something that happened on april 9 1940 1942 that was 79 years ago and what happened then there were 78 000 soldiers that were fighting for this country 66 000 of them were filipinos 12 000 of them were americans and they were fighting and the filipinos what did the filipinos say no we're not going to surrender and they were ready to fight to the death the filipinos wanted to fight to the death but the americans couldn't take the number of deaths that would happen so the americans decided that they surrender and they indeed surrendered and we commemorate that day of surrender but that surrender saved many lives although what followed was a death march uh the the lieutenant general of the japanese invading force lieutenant general houma masaharu he didn't know what to do with 78 000 prisoners so he walked them all the way to kappas and people that were weak or sick or tried to escape were killed or bionetted and it's amazing how many people died 600 uh american soldiers died on that that march and 5 000 filipinos died almost the same as the number of deaths probably we have here in kovi but the interesting thing is uh eventually they were able to execute this lieutenant general for war crimes i'm not saying we should execute our government officials but definitely there is a lesson to be learned here filipinos never give up filipinos always keep fighting to the death and i'd like to thank all the speakers led by our economists our epidemiologists our infectious disease specialists our evidence-based medicine pulmonologists who described everything to us uh professor toby monsoon gave us all the points of view from the economist i will counter by saying my rebuttal as a health professional well the economist never invested in our health system we've been fighting for a higher investments in health system and we work we as doctors i worked in pgh for many years as head of an er that is very similar to the situation most ers are actually having today and we try to work it out with the meager budget that we we have uh i i think what's important is a lot of what she said i agree capacitate the health system the way to fight this pandemic is really the to capacitate the health system and i heard this as well from professor pernia he said health and economics we shouldn't be afraid to spend for health care and we should invest we shouldn't spend for it it's not an expenditure help is an investment and it is not an expenditure john wong professor john wong talked a lot about data and epidemiology he has been guiding the iatf with this uh with his epimetrics group and without his analytics of all the data we probably will be in the panzitan but i think all his analytics are on point and uh describes exactly where we are and he contributed three things he said where are we how did we get here and where are we going and he gave a lot of suggestions like me in the national task force i give plenty of advice but i don't know if the advice although it falls to death years and here's some of the advice that i say has been actually echoed by our experts here in this particular period so thank you john wong for those uh nice contributions about how to really fight an epidemic and we value that we value your your comment on systems thinking that said if you have a problem again very similar to what uh professor toby said it's you need systems thinking to solve a systems problem and it's not so different from what our economy is actually said then there's tribal who's in the front lines in the critical care and infectious disease front lines and talked about uh how it is really out there and i i can commensurate with her i'm glad i'm not doing any more clinical practice because i'd be shouting my head off in an emergency department that was exactly how she described but she described several things that are important to me the swiss cheese model that solutions to us must be layered and that we must continue to to have all those layers in place to protect us and that misinformation and science are very important espec and she coined the term that's very uh the cut cut on the virus economics i think that's something that needs to be written about eileen in the end actually impressed me with her coach i didn't realize eileen was a wise woman with all these codes she started with the calendar of brutal that she didn't know how to translate looking at the forest instead of the trees uh she looked at the solace at the big picture that january was able to show and uh quotes like knowing yourself is the beginning of true knowledge quotes like science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and what's the other one of enthusiasm and and uh superstition superstition correct and she demolished a current uh conversation uh some some politicians want to give away a current drug and she demolished the evidence for why these politicians are so passionate about that and she said in god with trust in all the rest we need data uh in the end i'll talk and say my favorite thought because people was were throwing on their favorite was my favorite quote when i was studying abroad was i studied disaster medicine and uh and what what was told to me was that we are in the information age we are swimming in ocean's day of data and the data needs to be organized to become information so that you can flow to rivers of information so that the rivers of information can be used in lakes of knowledge where we get our droplets of wisdom thank you very much for joining us this afternoon thank you very much it's dr tederbosa the executive vice president of uh university of the philippines and also special adviser to the national task force for complete making okay so next week next friday uh we have an exciting discussion and the topic is facts and fiction on covid19 prevention and treatment and we actually might talk about some drugs that we are not mentioning right now because we feel like if we talk about it we give it more you know it's it's like you're you're you're you're giving more attention to it but we will talk about facts and fiction and so we're going to address misinformation and we're going to have dr issa alejandria who again is the uh the president of chris smith the philippine society for microbiology and infectious disease and we're going to have a couple of infectious disease specialists hopefully we also have somebody from the department of health and i've seen this uh in the chat they're going you know should be invite some from the department okay we will but i can't announce yet where who because i might get into trouble again but i'm not saying i don't know if confirmed yet but we do have uh somebody invited from huh i can i can it's confirmed okay so we will have them we will have beverly hall from the department of ed okay so uh raymond over to you thank you and uh thank you for that uh well it was a way what a way to wrap it up evp uh i will not give my code because uh we'd like to thank everyone who is watching us in the live streaming links youtube facebook who are still with us here in the zoom webinar for those who want to again retest their knowledge and try to understand we are sharing the poll results as you are seeing here and the answers to the questions for us relayed by our experts so again next week facts and fiction on covet 19 prevention and treatment hope we could see you uh next week for friday 12 00 to 2 p.m it's a day okay together let us stop convince so keep safe keep healthy and see you online the enemy remains unseen i'll keep your hand in mind [Music] until the coast is there [Music] i look into myself and ask do i have strength to carry on my god all along i need you here to keep me strong i'm here to hold the line [Music] it's fine to be afraid just hold on to the word he gave this time will come to pass cause

The highly transmissible variant has also started to spread in the Philippines. But with global vaccine distribution skewed towards richer nations, both countries face the same dire lack of vaccines, stymying the roll-out of their vaccination programmes. Together, there are now more than 100,000 deaths in both nations and their health systems are overwhelmed. 

What led to this situation? What can both Indonesia and the Philippines do now to face down the crisis?

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",2021-08-11,92533,692,435,UC_Lnb8ZHqqgLbp-7hltuT9w," Indonesia has been overwhelmed by a 
second wave of COVID-19 infections   since June 2021 the country is now 
the epicenter of the pandemic in   Asia and the crisis is being fueled by 
the highly transmissible Delta variant the situation right now in 
Indonesia is particularly worrying.   If the vaccines were available earlier 
Indonesia will not see a high fatality rate over in the Philippines a delta variant is now 
a looming threat. Worryingly the country is   facing the same lack of vaccines we still have the 
threat of the Delta variant and while we haven't   fully vaccinated our people, yet we have to 
manage the pandemic without the vaccine so far Across the globe vaccine distribution has been 
hugely unequal. 75% of the world's vaccine now   is being accessed by developed countries and 
countries in Asia have five to ten percent access This inequitable access to vaccines has led 
to devastating consequences it has created   an opportunity for the virus to freely transmit 
in countries where there is lower coverage What   has led to this situation? What are both Indonesia 
and the Philippines doing to face down the crisis? Indonesia has become the epicenter of the COVID-19 
pandemic in Asia, overtaking India since mid-July   2021. Every day we receive bad news that we 
have lost our friends, families, close relatives   many more people heavily suffered from this second 
wave so if the vaccines were available earlier   Indonesia will not see a high fatality rate even 
though right now the country is fighting against   the second wave of the pandemic. Many would 
have agreed even before the second wave hit   Anastasia retinol pujastuti trains 
caregivers and babysitters in Jakarta.   Until early this year, the single mother 
lived with her 12- year old twins and her   aged parents in bakassi 30 minutes away from 
central jakarta her neighborhood had not been   spared by the coronavirus but anastasia and her 
family took all precautions then in february yeah anastasia's parents got so ill they had 
to be hospitalized due to the lack of beds at   the intensive care units they ended up in separate 
hospitals where they tested positive for covet 19.   two weeks later they were put on 
ventilators and the condition deteriorated but even as she was burying her parents 
anastasia herself was falling sick but when anastasia's ordeal first started in february   indonesia had inoculated less than one percent 
of its population of more than 276 million people   in comparison the us had vaccinated 15 of 
its 330 million people by that time but for   people like anastasia and her parents there just 
hadn't been enough vaccine doses in indonesia to eat the hour hour um the slow rollout was further held back when the 
second wave hit with the delta variant driving   daily cases to more than 50 000 at one point 
movement restrictions had to be implemented um unfortunately low vaccination numbers are not 
unique to indonesia poorer countries around the   world have all faced a severe lack of vaccines the 
imbalance has its roots in how vaccine development   started rich countries like the us the uk and 
even singapore could invest billions in the   pharmaceutical companies working our vaccines 
supercharging the process but that also meant   that they were entitled to the vaccines for 
their own populations ahead of other nations   many developing countries around the world do 
not have the same capability do not have the same   capacity to provide such funds that's why they 
they also do not have equal access to vaccines   taxi negotiations was not an easy process and 
not so many vaccine manufacturers from developed   world provided favorable response to indonesia and 
the fact since manufacturers prioritize those who   support them so the impact is poorer countries 
will not be prioritized in vaccine supply in response to this problematic vaccine 
nationalism the global alliance for   vaccines and immunization the coalition 
for epidemic preparedness innovations   and the world health organization set up the 
covet 19 vaccines global access also known   as kovacs for the second week it aims to 
coordinate international resources to enable   low to middle income countries more equitable 
access to covert 19 tests therapies and vaccines   the effort is funded by rich countries 
together with private sector and philanthropic   contributions a total of 92 countries are 
eligible to receive covet 19 vaccines through   the kovacs mechanism including but as singapore 
has secured sufficient doses for its population   it has announced that it will donate its share of 
covax vaccines to other countries if there is a   very strong nationalism without 
taking care of other countries   the main goal of no one is safe until everyone is 
safe will not be achieved the main issue of the   the new balance especially because they transmit 
very frequently so the disease could spread more   more faster so if people could not be protected by 
vaccine so the problem will become bigger bigger   in in the country or area without a faxing 
cover but at the end of the day we are an   interconnected world we cannot separate 
one country to the other so it has to be   everybody here at 675 million people southeast 
asia has a percent of the world's population   but its average gdp per capita 
of around 13 000 us dollars   is far below other parts of the world like 
u.s at 68 000 and europe at 41 000 us dollars   the two most populous nations indonesia and 
the philippines have a combined number of   over 5 million covet 19 infections they have 
fully vaccinated less than 10 of their people the impact of vaccine nationalism has also 
been significant in the philippines with the   delta variant and impending threat to date just 
over seven percent of his 108 million people   are fully vaccinated so that is the injustice you 
know some countries have a lot and restore a lot   and yet some of their citizens kind of the luxury 
of not wanting to but in the philippines you see a   reversal of that many people now would like to be 
vaccinated and yet we don't have that much supply as an economic frontliner now in apon is 
one of those desperate for okova 19 vaccine   he's a tricycle driver in malalas an 
hour's drive from metro manila good morning the country's lack of access to vaccines 
have been made worse by bureaucracy well   the philippines initially hesitant to negotiate 
purchase agreements with pharmaceutical companies   first it was avoiding to sign 
non-disclosure agreements with   these companies secondly it was avoiding 
to protect pharmaceutical companies for   any liabilities and thirdly there are existing 
philippine laws that prevent the government from   prepayment of orders in the end the philippines 
complied with all these conditions however   it was too late for the the 30 administration 
when it finally made up its mind so the   philippines was relegated at the bottom of the 
priority list of pharmaceutical companies and   therefore other countries got the available 
slots for early delivery of the vaccine in manila tricycle drivers are starting to 
get their vaccines but the city of malolos   is still only giving out doses to health workers 
senior citizens and patients with co-morbidities driver nauen and others like him have good 
reason to worry besides the risk of   infection there's also the risk of long 
covet in indonesia anastasia is still not like many lower to middle income countries   the philippines did not have the public funds to 
pay for vaccines in the early development stages   during president duterte's state of the nation 
address in july 2020 he asked china for help four   days ago i made a plea to president xi jinping 
that if they have the vaccine can they allow us   to be one of the first so that we can normalize 
as fast as possible we were talking to diplomatic   routes so that we can actually connect with the 
government so that they can order their vaccine   manufacturers to supply us the necessary vaccines 
that our country needed at the earliest possible   time first delivery that was scheduled to us was 
going to be pfizer and astrazeneca but eventually   got delayed cynoback so far has actually been 
delivering on the dates they scheduled we also   asked for an increase in delivery but they 
acceded to that and they're delivering more since the start of this administration 
duterte has relied heavily on china   when the philippines face issues or 
problems for example national disasters   its war on drugs and the marawi siege it really 
relied on china for help so it is no wonder that   the duterte administration asking for china 
for its vaccines china donated over a million   doses of vaccines to the philippines and 
china also pledged to make the philippines at   its on top of its priority list of its 
shipments abroad for their vaccines   indonesia also turned to china in august 
last year but early in 2020 the government   was already trying to secure deals with 
the pharmaceutical companies in the west   one was with astrazeneca for 100 million 
doses of its vaccine the british swedish   company vowed to sell the vaccine at cost making 
it cheaper than other western-made vaccines aside from pricia we have to also take into 
consideration the logistic issue the distributions   of isa and modern vaccine must be supported by 
some specific good infrastructure that not so many   regions in indonesia can provide i think 
indonesia was taking a chance to procure   astrazeneca vaccines at that time indonesia was 
also uncertain about the efficacy of the vaccine   indonesia was not in the position to choose 
indonesia was more in the situations that we have to make any deals as soon as possible   but indonesia does own one of the world's 
oldest vaccine production company pt biopharma   biopharma had collaborated with synovac on 
the development of other vaccines before   and so in december 2020 the two state-owned 
enterprises launched a human trial of samavax   vaccine in west java involving more 
than one thousand six hundred patients   yes dynavac engaged biopharma and vegetarian 
university in bandung west java to conduct a   stage three clinical trial and in west gerber and 
at the time kovid was prevalent in west java so   it made for the appropriate conditions 
for a successful clinical trial because   at that time china is already under control 
indonesia has high prevalence of coffee 90   that's for the main reason the second this 
vaccine will be also given to the indonesian   so it will also raise more confidence if 
the result come from within the country   when they released the result they found these 
65 percent of the effi cassie of the senate uh uh china was then already the largest investor 
and trading partner for both indonesia and the   philippines turning to the asian superpower for 
vaccines created controversy in both countries   the indonesian governments claimed that 
one of the dimensions of synoffex biopharma   vaccine corporations is transfer technology 
it's not that really significant because we   only receive a faxing bulk from china and 
then indonesia just put it in a battle so   and indonesia make the vaccine bulk into finnish 
product we haven't seen any direct pressure given   by the chinese sites for for for the indonesian 
side so the indirect pressures could be manifested   into a feeling of indebtedness that somehow we 
need to pay back during the pandemic indonesia had   already organized at least three or four bilateral 
meetings of our foreign minister visited china   and even state councilor wang e also visited 
indonesia so we can see an intensifications of   bilateral interactions the dirty administration's 
reliance on chinese vaccines would make the   philippines more vulnerable to chinese pressures 
on issues in the bilateral relation this   might make the philippines weaker 
in its negotiations with china in   matters related to west philippine sea the 
philippines will get more dependent on china   this is not a good situation for the philippines 
but this is the reality because we also need china   to help our countrymen to get 
vaccinated through their vaccines but despite getting the 
vaccines from china neither   indonesia nor philippines had enough 
vaccine doses for its population so both turned to their private sectors for help 
for the philippines it was a public private effort led by secretary joey concepcion 
actually gambled because they signed   an agreement and paid for the deliveries of 
astrazeneca for a 2.5 million doses initially   even before the eua the emergency use 
authorization by our philippine fda was given   the philippine government honored that 
particular arrangement the tripartite   agreement was the first in the world so after 
the first 2.5 million there were subsequent   uh consolidation of companies that want to procure 
vaccines for their employees and the dependents   of their employees so this is public and private 
sector helping each other to achieve a vaccination   of the population faster flexible innovative 
thinking there because the government is looking   at how they can use private sector finance 
increase the number of people protected   innovative perhaps but it has its limitations 
the general public might be feeling left out   because the people who work in multinational 
car companies or large corporations have   a better chance at getting vaccinated earlier 
than other workers filipino workers especially   those working in the informal sector and small 
medium enterprises so unfortunately they have   limited chances of getting vaccinated and it's 
the vast majority of citizens who will miss out   citizens like joy pulta joy like many 
others work in the informal sector the mother of two supports her family by reselling   beauty products for two to ten us 
dollars per day in her neighborhood her family have already had 
their brush with covert 19   and having no access to vaccines 
is a cause of great anxiety high joy's mother-in-law was admitted to 
the hospital and died eight days later   joy didn't get to say goodbye 
as she was under quarantine foreign despite the pitfalls associated 
with turning to the private sector   indonesia took that route too the government 
announced in february this year that they were   drafting regulations for a private 
vaccination scheme named goto royo uh initiative ostensibly the program is designed to enable the 
employees of companies to obtain vaccines as a   way to restart economic roles but in fact you know 
the beneficiaries also include the directors and   executives so there's a lot of self-interest 
involved it's unseemly because you have a   situation where more well-connected individuals 
have basically preferential access to vaccination   vis-a-vis regular citizens who 
are not corporate employees   the government since the beginning of fundamental 
focus on economy first also they want to recover   their economic sector and that's why 
they do under this uh scheme they want to   vaccinate their workers this scheme 
against the public health strategy   with the pandemic wrong moves can cost lives what 
else went wrong in indonesia and the philippines bringing vaccines into the country is one thing   getting the vaccines into the population 
is another after inoculating its health   and essential workers indonesia had planned 
to target the younger working population   before the elderly i do not see any problem with 
that logic indonesia's working populations right   now is around 130 million so it's quite big so 
it's very important for the government to ensure   that this large proportion of the people receive 
vaccinations to support the economic recovery   but it was a controversial decision going against 
who recommendations there is a document from   the scientific advisory group of experts on 
epidemiology back in november and it details   several options that countries can take when they 
distribute the vaccines they go to the length of   mapping out who are the vulnerable population 
who must get first what other options can you   exercise i think that approach should have been 
taken rather than the approach of the productive   population must be first i think rather than going 
to directly to the the healthy population first   the equity principle must be uphold and 
you go to the ones who need the help most   and plants especially controversial 
ones needed to be communicated well   indonesia's population is very heterogeneous and 
those who live in cities those with different   levels of education those with different exposures 
to science facts those with different exposures   to policy making and then those who live in 
rural areas i think the first principle is to   understand that we are actually not communicating 
to singular group and then thereby not only in   languages but also in approaches in in materials 
um whether you go through radio or through social   media or through television or to flyers i think 
those types of continuous approach in different   angles of communication needs to be strengthened 
in bakassi anastasia was eager to get the vaccine in the philippines communication is a challenge 
too as each city has its own vaccine regulations joy encountered difficulties when trying to book 
a vaccination appointment in her city malabon in some areas we have horror stories 
of people waiting for eight hours   just to get complete an appointment and then 
after that you have to wait for months to   become but in my case i did not experience that 
in my case it's very easy seamless so i think   it depends i think on the local government 
unit but the fact that it is erratic means   it's an even meaning that it's still it's 
in a problem because it's a standardized   there is still pockets of inefficiency and 
then actually efficiency which is not good   my thinking is that the national government gave 
too much leeway to the local government eunice or   probably put the burden on the city government 
to inoculate their citizens and i think that the   slow progress of the immunization program 
shows that there's some miscommunication   or there's some things that are not sorted 
out when there's a vaccine roll out in a city   and there's no organization between 
the national and the local government communication and organization issues aside 
both indonesia and the philippines were still   in dire need of vaccine doses early this 
year both governments had registered to get   vaccines for 20 percent of their populations 
from kovacs 54.1 million people indonesia   and 21.6 million in the philippines but kovacs 
itself had problems getting the doses it needed   one of the key challenges of gofax to getting the 
commitment and pledges or concrete donations and   support from countries because it's basically 
the whole world with needs of vaccination but   not enough supplies you're competing for the 
same pool of vaccines that can be produced by   the same limited number of manufacturers it's 
been challenging for the companies that are   producing because these are biological processes 
that cannot be scaled up very quickly you need   to ensure that the products are safe they are 
efficacious and they follow good manufacturing   practices what they did was that it created 
a supply bottleneck for the provax deliveries and this year a bottleneck grew into a serious 
problem the serum institute of india the world's   largest vaccine manufacturer had pledged 
200 million doses of astrazeneca to kovacs   but when india faced a devastating 
wave of covert 19 infections in april   largely due to the new highly 
transmissible delta variant   its officials restricted the export of 
vaccines in order to protect its own population   this meant that the philippines for one 
had to lower its vaccination targets   from 70 to 50 percent this year and indonesia too 
experienced a significant drop in vaccine supply stocks and to make things worse the delta 
variant has now caused the largest spike   in covert knighting infections in the country 
the delta farian has become a newfound epidemic   within the pandemic so many countries 
now has a new wave new suitcase   because of this delta variant if we put this 
context in term of vaccination the country who has   less vaccinated person or people is the country 
who more vulnerable due to this delta variant   with the covet 19 virus continually mutating 
and new variants surfacing the key to protecting   everyone is still vaccines the emergence of 
variants creates added pressure to see how we can   accelerate vaccine deliveries tomorrow we may have 
a variant that is even more transmissible or maybe   is capable of causing even more severe disease 
and that is why we have been emphasizing that   whether be it alpha beta or delta yes you 
need to increase your response capacities but even as poorer countries like indonesia 
and the philippines race to vaccinate their   populations there's light at the end of the tunnel in mid-2021 only one percent of people in low 
and middle income countries around the world   have received at least one 
dose of covert 19 vaccine indeed me the good news for poorer countries is that 
after inoculating most of their own populations   richer nations have stepped up their assistance at the g7 summit in june world leaders 
committed 817 million vaccine donations both indonesia and the philippines have also inked   deals with pfizer bioentech and are 
finally getting deliveries from august   the vaccine maker is sending 15 million doses 
to indonesia enough for around 10 percent of its   population and 40 million doses to the philippines 
for around 20 percent of their people orders from   other vaccine makers are also starting to arrive 
and more is being done on other fronts too in the philippines authorities have 
started trials on mixing vaccines based on the data that we have the 
efficacy is still high or maybe even higher   when we mix different brands together 
so sometimes we can use cyanobac for   example and get the second dose of moderna or 
pfizer it has been studied in other countries   what they're seeing is that it looks like it's 
okay the efficacy is still high i think it   would be an acceptable strategy especially 
if we have a limited number of vaccines on the ground organizations like the philippine 
red cross are supplementing the government's   distribution of vaccines they are bringing the 
doses to the public in special vaccine buses   well the kona bus will go to a particular area   where people are not aware of the program 
of the government that they can get it free   and that's that's why it's effective you 
go right to the doorstep of the people   local governments usually should welcome these 
buses because they can intensify the vaccination   in their area because if you rely on the centers 
or the vaccinations of the lg you are people will   tend to line a line up long which means that 
they can get the disease from each other right the tondo community initiative is also 
rolling up its sleeves to help residents   with no internet access to book 
their vaccination appointments we know that this community being poorest 
of the poor may not have the courage to   to be active in demanding for their 
rights to have access we found out that   even if there are vaccination registration that 
they cannot afford because most of them have no   cell phone they don't have internet access 
so tondo community initiative decided that   we will focus on helping the government on 
the online registration so we personally   each of the social workers goes to this community 
and encourage people to do online registrations over in indonesia vaccine manufacturer 
biopharma has started talking with china   about producing the synovic scene from scratch uh three school alumni associations have also 
come together to form centra vaccinasi serbium   an independent vaccination center run by 
volunteers to help inoculate the community financially decided to come here for her vaccinations with vaccine supplies increasing 
both indonesia and the philippines   can afford to be slightly more optimistic was to vaccinate 70 million people fully 
vaccinated by november 28th of this year   the country's vaccination centers we have about 
three thousand seven hundred i think almost four   thousand already that's vaccinating and we're 
able to churn out uh almost 350 000 a day   and the goal is to reach our target we should 
be vaccinating 500 000 a day so our only problem   now is really the supply delivery as long as the 
supplies are steady and every month we get about   15 million doses we will be able to reach our 
target plus or minus one to two weeks the supplies   will come and it will it will be enough to supply 
and inoculate the whole world perhaps sooner than   we think because now manufacturers are ramping 
up their capacity and the sooner that the supply   can cover the whole population the sooner we have 
a real hope that the pandemic will end the sooner   the world come together um to distribute vaccines 
uh equitably and make uh production available   in different parts of the world i think that 
will be our our light at the end of the tunnel you"
