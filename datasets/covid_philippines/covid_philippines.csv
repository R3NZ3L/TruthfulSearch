About 2.3 million more people in the Philippines have been pushed into poverty between 2018 and 2021, largely due to the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the country’s statistics agency. Recently inaugurated President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr aims to slash the poverty rate to nine per cent by 2028 by focusing on fully reopening the economy, investing in human capital and social protection, and transforming production sectors to generate more quality jobs and competitive products.

30,liEUC1_l8e8,"Philippines’ Duterte threatens citizens who refuse COVID-19 vaccine with jail, shots meant for pigs","Philippines' President Rodrigo Duterte is threatening to jail any citizen who refuses to get a COVID-19 vaccine as the country grapples with low vaccination rates and one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in Asia.

""You choose, vaccine or I will have you jailed,"" Duterte said in a televised address on Monday.

""You get vaccinated, or I will order all the village heads to have a tally of all the people who refuse to get vaccinated. Because if not I will inject them with Ivermectin which is intended for pigs,"" Duterte added.

Duterte's remarks contradict those of his health officials who have said that while people are urged to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, it was voluntary.

Many residents in Manila were displeased with the threat, saying it was wrong and harsh to force those who choose not to get vaccinated.

There are 16 cities in the region, and there has been widespread criticism on the way the restrictions on people's movements were announced on March 12. They were announced much later than scheduled and without clear mechanisms as to how exactly they would be enforced. Philippines Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said there will still be a free flow of goods to and from Metro Manila. He assured the public that there will be supplies of food and essential items.

35,o1kPskxFkQ8,Coronavirus: Philippines introduces stricter COVID-19 lockdown measures amid surge in cases,"Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte said Sunday his government would introduce a stricter lockdown in the capital Manila as it attempts to reign in a surge in COVID-19 cases.

Duterte said Manila and nearby provinces would be placed under a two-week enhanced community quarantine that would remain in effect until Aug. 18. Some businesses and public transit will be closed during the period and work and quarantine passes would be required as movements are restricted
.
The enhanced measures come after local groups representing some 80,000 doctors and a million nurses called for tighter controls, claiming the country was losing the battle against the novel coronavirus pandemic.

The Philippines recorded 5,032 additional COVID-19 infections on Sunday-- the country’s largest single-day increase-- bringing the total number of cases in the island nation to more than 100,000. The death toll is now above 2,000.

Jose Fabella is a national maternal and newborn tertiary hospital recognized by WHO as a role model in the Western Pacific Region for its essential newborn care programs proven to reduce infant morbidity and mortality.

“Let’s set aside our fear because at least, with this vaccine, we have hope that COVID-19 will end. It might not be totally eradicated but it will help get us closer to what we knew as normal.

Because we have this vaccine now, we feel fully protected when we go on duty. I feel hopeful that this pandemic will end soon and that I can finally go home to my 3-year-old son and husband and hug them, kiss them. That’s the advantage I feel with this vaccine as a healthcare worker.

With this vaccine, we feel that we are protected and that we also protect our patients. As health workers, we must not be the carrier, we must be the one protecting patients. We must not get infected so that we can continue our service as healthcare workers.”

54,fp9uRsmTWqg,Philippines: COVID curbs push unemployment rate to 8.9% in September,"The coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult to find jobs for many people across the Philippines, and they are increasingly looking for opportunities abroad.
The Philippines imposed one of the world’s longest lockdowns when the pandemic broke out, which led to one of the country’s worst economic recessions in decades.
Unemployment is now at 8.9 percent, its highest so far this year.
Thousands of small and medium businesses have also shut down, and communities dependent on tourism are facing the greatest difficulties.
 
Al Jazeera’s Jamela Alindogan reports from Manila on how Filipinos are being affected.

55,lczwrm68u6I,🇵🇭 COVID-19: Could the Philippines see an India-style surge? | The Stream,"The Philippines is in the throes of one of the worst Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia, topping one million total infections last week. 
 
The country now has the second-highest number of infections and deaths in Southeast Asia after Indonesia and health experts are warning of a possible ""India-style"" wave. 

Although the government has struggled to obtain vaccine supplies, vaccine hesitancy is proving a bigger challenge. According to a March survey by Pulse Asia, six out of 10 Filipinos expressed safety concerns and were therefore unwilling to get immunized. In an attempt to assuage those fears, Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte last week received his first vaccine dose live on Facebook.

Rights group Amnesty International says what it calls the government's inadequate response to the pandemic amounts to ""a serious human rights issue."" 
 
In this episode of The Stream, we talk to those on the frontline and ask them what is needed to address the surge and keep the healthcare system from crumbling.

56,ibWFsmcnefk,"Inflation bigger challenge than Covid in 2022, Philippines bank boss says - BBC News","Inflation will be a bigger threat to economies next year than Covid-19, the head of the Philippines central bank has told the BBC.

Benjamin Diokno also said he believes his country's economy will return to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2022.

""We expect the economy to be back to where it was by the middle of next year, or even earlier,"" he said.

The Philippines was one of the south east Asian nations worst affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

Mr Diokno said that like many other countries as they emerge from the pandemic, price rises will be a challenge for the Philippines, even as he sees the economy recovering in the months ahead.

April 9, 2021 
“COVID-19 in the Philippines: What are the Scenarios for the next 12 Months?”  Special Topic 
Rising cases, crowded hospitals, new restrictions on movement, higher levels of fear and  frustration --- a month ago, it looked like things were improving, and then suddenly it feels like  we are back to square one. 
What does trend data tell us about the pandemic? What do we know about the spread of  SARSCoV2 at national and local levels? Will it get worse before it gets better? What about the  economy? What can we expect in the coming months? How should families prepare for what is  ahead? How should health workers prepare for what is ahead? 
Some of the assumptions will change because of the advances in the health sciences and  medicine. The vaccines will have an impact on disease transmission. Newer drugs are being  studied for treatment of moderate and severe COVID. People are slowly adapting and modifying  their behavior to protect themselves and survive. 
In the next episode of STOP COVID DEATHS, UP Professor of Economics, Dr. Toby Melissa  Monsod, opens the webinar with a perspective on the economy. The main presenter is Dr. John Q.  Wong, lead epidemiologist of the IATF and reactors are infectious disease specialist Dr. Cybele  Lara Abad from UP-PGH and pulmonologist Dr Aileen David Wang of the UP College of  Medicine. 
While we cannot gaze into a crystal ball, we can look up the data and see where we are-- and move  toward where we want to be in the coming year, together. 
Stay Safe. Stay Healthy. Stay Connected.

66,Ji47WRv2tQE,Philippines Cremate Coronavirus Victims,"Crematoriums in the Philippines cremate coronavirus victims, Sunday, May 3. 

Families of COVID-19 victims in the Philippines are being denied traditional death rites in favor of hurried, impersonal cremations, with virus restrictions often meaning they are forbidden a last look at their loved ones.

It is a painful and disorienting process for both the families and crematory workers that has upended the Philippines' intimate rituals of laying the dead to rest.

Burial is the norm in the Catholic-majority nation, and it usually follows a days-long display of the embalmed body at home or in a chapel.

But due to the pandemic authorities are encouraging rapid cremations -- though quick burials are still allowed -- of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 deaths.

Wakes are barred in these cases and hospitals must seal remains in plastic and send them directly to crematories or funeral homes.  

The number of coronavirus cases in the Philippines reached 9,223 with 607 deaths according to figures from the Johns Hopkins University. 

(AFP)",2020-05-03,1362717,2905,230,UCVSNOxehfALut52NbkfRBaA,Voice of America,2008-03-14,3170000,46722
67,254GdlKEz5I,Philippines Opens Borders to Vaccinated Travelers as Covid-19 Eases,"The Philippines has reopened its doors to travelers from more than 150 countries with visa-free privileges, lifting entry restrictions for foreign tourists and businesspeople after nearly two years. It's a move to revive the battered tourism industry as the latest coronavirus outbreak started to ease. Foreign travelers will no longer be required to quarantine in government-designated centers upon arrival if they have been fully vaccinated and tested negative prior to arrival, officials said.

The government had initially planned to lift the ban on Dec. 1 but indefinitely postponed it as the more contagious omicron variant spread, which also prompted authorities to reimpose tighter restrictions.

President Rodrigo Duterte warned that unvaccinated Filipinos who defy orders to stay at home could face arrest. Commuters who have not been immunized were also prohibited from public transport in the capital region of more than 13 million people unless on urgent errands, for at least up to the end of the month. The decision has sparking protests from human rights and labor groups. 

“We’re done with border control,” Health Undersecretary Rosario Vergeire told a news conference in January, adding that government focus has shifted to preventing community transmission of the omicron variant

The number of tourists dropped by more than 6 million, and more than a million Filipinos lost their jobs in tourism businesses and destinations in the first year of the pandemic alone, according to government statistics. Tourism destinations, including popular beach and island resorts, resembled ghost towns at the height of pandemic lockdowns.

93,N9OQbW0YOLU,Nurses in the Philippines: Underpaid and unprotected from COVID-19 while saving lives,"In April 2020, the Philippines government imposed a deployment ban on nurses, blocking them from taking on jobs overseas. The labour minister, Silvestre Bello, explained that the country cannot lose the “services of our nurses” at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. Thousands of ‘prisonurses’ (coined from the term, prisoners) have appealed for the lifting of the ban. 

For almost two decades, nurses in the Philippines have been fighting for fair compensation. A public law guarantees a starting salary of US$680 in public hospitals. In this episode of #UndercoverAsia, we spoke to a nurse who earns US$13 a day, barely US$3 above minimum wage in Manila. 

In comparison, a nurse earns about US$2,400 in Germany, between US$2,700 and US$3,000 in the UK and about US$4,000 to US$8,000 in the US with overtime pay. 

The Philippines government also promised that there’d be sufficient protection and introduced a hazard pay of US$10 a day for work during the pandemic. 

Nurse Maria Theresa Cruz, 47, worked in Cainta Municipal Hospital. She had to purchase her own Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). When she showed signs of COVID-19, she was only given rapid tests that came back negative, despite a government memo stating that rapid tests “should not be used to definitively rule out COVID-19”. 

Theresa was later given a swab test which came back positive. By then, it was too late, she had already passed away. On top of her salary, she’d posthumously receive only US$1.26 a day in hazard pay. 

As of November 2020, over 16,000 healthcare workers have yet to receive their hazard pay.

List of countries in 2022 with no testing, no quarantines, no countries banned, and no vaccine requirements. Latest Update for Philippines: PRES MARCOS ORDERS LIFTING OF STRINGENT PROTOCOLS ACCORDING TO TOURISM SECRETARY by end of 2022.

We grouped the countries into 6 categories, starting with number one as the most restricted countries, until number 6 for the countries that have removed all covid restrictions. Let's find out where your country belongs to.

Number 1, countries closed for travel, except for returning citizens and some special cases. Yes, believe it or not, there are still countries closed to any kind of tourism, almost 3 years after the pandemic began.

Number 2, countries where unvaccinated foreigners are not allowed to enter except for citizens and some special cases.

Number 3, countries where unvaccinated foreigners are allowed, but are required to present a negative covid test result.

Number 4, countries where covid test is required from all passengers, regardless of vaccination status.

Number 5, countries that have opened their borders for fully-vaccinated. No test or quarantine for the fully vaccinated.

Last but not the least is number 6. These countries have scrapped all of their covid related restrictions. It means these countries are back to normal, like the pre-pandemic times. No test, no quarantine, whether you are vaccinated or not.

To make it on this list, the countries must meet the below criteria:

Ma. Delta S. Aguilar
SPMC Pediatric Infectious Disease Specialist
June 26, 2020 (Friday) 12nn

How has the pandemic impacted on children?  Children may be hidden victims of COVID-19 as lockdowns have made it difficult for mothers to bring their children for regular check-ups or vaccination. Food may be scarce leading to malnutrition. Globally, child abuse has been reported as an effect of being kept at home under stressful conditions. Children may develop anxiety and not know how to express their fears and concerns.  Children may be afraid for the people who care for them, especially if their parents are health workers.

Children can also get COVID-19.  How do we care for children who get the infection? What should doctors watch out for in children who are exposed to adults with COVID-19?
The literature states that most children who get COVID-19 have a mild or even asymptomatic illness, there are new reports that some children may have a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)  can lead to life-threatening problems with the heart and other organs in the body. Early reports compared it to Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory illness that can lead to heart problems and cause severe illness

On the other hand, the symptoms of COVID-19 can mimic other types of infections.  How can we differentiate COVID-19 in children from other infectious diseases?
How about children with other types of diseases like cancer or rheumatoid arthritis who may be at risk for getting COVID-19?  How can we protect them?

COVID-19 and children will focus on how to protect and care for children during the pandemic.",2020-06-26,1296,12,1,UCgHMBsUeTBqZyG8dkGbbVKQ,TVUP,2016-10-27,28700,926

The Philippines rolled out its long-stalled coronavirus vaccination programme on March 1, 2021, the day after Manila took delivery of its first batch of free jabs from China. Health care workers, police and military personnel were the first to receive the Sinovac shots, prompting thanks from Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Manila’s Food and Drug Administration approved the vaccine for emergency use on people aged 18-59, but 75-year-old Duterte has ruled out taking it himself because of his age. Authorities also advised against use of the Chinese vaccine for health care workers, citing its low efficacy rate. The Chinese vaccine has not been popular among Filipino hospital staff, with one survey indicating that 94 per cent would prefer jabs from Pfizer or AstraZeneca.

288,aUbzL6YapYA,COVID -19 VACCINATION PROCESS (TAGALOG) in PHILIPPINES | Doc Fate Cunanan 👩🏻‍⚕️,"1:00 Proseso ng Pagbabakuna Para COVID-19

Ang mga sumusunod ang proseso para sa vaccination. Bago mabakunahan para sa 1st dose, alamin kung kasama ka sa priority group from DOH, dumaan sa pre vaccination screening at mag register sa local government unit. Fill out ang registration form at maghintay sa vaccination schedule. Wag kalimutan magsuot ng face mask, face shield, proper social distancing, magdala ng sariling ballpen and valid ID.

Sa araw ng vaccination, confirm with the registration mula sa vaccination schedule and time na naibigay. Check your persnal information and sagutin ang mga kaukulang tanong sa registration at health screening. After vaccination, obserbahan muna ang sarili ng 15-30 minutes sa site at patuloy na obserbahan hanggang bahay. Dito rin patuloy na oobserbahan ang bawat indibidwal na nakareceive ng vaccine para sa mga adverse events pagkatapos mabakunahan ng indibidwal.

Itago ang mga dokumentong binigay lalo na ang vaccination card para sa 2nd dose. Bago ang pangalawng dose, icheck ang time at schedule para sa slot na nabigay at i-follow ang same process sa unang dose. Sa anumang unusual na sintomas or karamdaman pagkatapos mabakunahan, kumunsulta sa doctor, ireport sa LGU o nearest health facility.

Lahat ng bakuna ay dumaan sa clinical trial at ang best na vaccine para sa iyo ay iyong AVAILABLE for you. Receiving vaccine versus none at all gives a big leap of protection from the virus. Hindi natin alam kailan ulit magkakaroon ng slot or bakuna para sayo, anumang brand ang meron, kung eligible at qualified for it… say YES to bakuna.

Protecting ourselves and our family through vaccination, wearing mask and social distancing is already a big help for our country. We can help and work together in the community through these simple acts that we make for this pandemic. This is a collective effort for us all citizens of the world. Our little effort will create a bigger impact altogether.

https://sc.mp/subscribe-youtube

Mass circumcisions resumed in the Philippines after “circumcision season” was cancelled last year by the coronavirus pandemic. Seen as a rite of passage in the Philippines, hundreds of boys undergo the procedure daily to remove the foreskin. It’s also regularly practised in Muslim and Jewish populations, but around 90 per cent of Filipino males are circumcised for non-religious reasons, according to the World Health Organization. But as the practice has come under greater scrutiny worldwide, there is still strong social pressure for boys to undergo the procedure in the Philippines.

About the CCI-Hub:

The CCI-Hub is one of the main components of the “Global Partnership for improving the Food Cold Chain in the Philippines"" project, implemented by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) together with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines (DENR).

The Philippines’ Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) has been selected as an official partner of the project and as the national entity to host the CCI-Hub at its central office located in Metro Manila.

The CCI-Hub serves as the project's main platform providing an ecosystem of technical resources, training, knowledge sharing and stakeholder collaboration. Its main objective is to increase adoption of best practice refrigeration and related services as well as communication throughout the food cold chain and to ensure a long-term impact of the project.

About the “Global Partnership for improving the Food Cold Chain in the Philippines"":

One of the most pressing issues in developing countries is a faulty food cold chain, which results in massive food loss and underserved communities.

To address that problem in the Philippines, the project aims to identify, develop and stimulate the application of low-carbon, energy efficient refrigeration innovation technologies and business practices for use throughout the food cold chain (CC) to increase food safety and food security.   

It is funded by US$2 million from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), with US$25 million in co-financing (in-kind, grants and loans).

393,y1TdgODyfok,Helping the Philippines Save Lives through COVID-19 Vaccination,"The Philippines was the first recipient of financing support under the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) $9 billion Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX). A $400 million loan was approved in March 2021 to help the country purchase safe and effective vaccines against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

The project is supported by $300 million in cofinancing from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The ADB and AIIB loans will together fund the procurement of up to 110 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines for as many as 50 million Filipinos.

In June 2021, shipments of ADB-AIIB-procured vaccines from Sinovac Biotech Ltd. started to arrive in the country, followed by Pfizer-BioNTech doses in July. The contract with Pfizer under APVAX is the biggest vaccine supply deal for the country so far. The vaccine deliveries are helping the government to ramp up its national COVID-19 immunization program.

ADB will continue to support the Philippine government as it seeks to end the COVID-19 pandemic in the country and achieve universal health care.
