2,qERZgLv3MKg,,"About the problem of covid. If you like, barila, no, no. You want a knife. I will not hesitate. My orders are in the police as well as the military, as well as the barangays, who are betraying and having an occasion to fight and your life has been in doubt. Shoot them dead! There are many problems that are in trouble because they are in trouble, no order, no distribution. It happens, because it is kidnapped, it hurts. So I'm forced to say, don't do that because I won't hesitate to order to shoot you. So let this be a warning to all. Follow the government at this time because it is really critical that we have order."
3,sYI97jv-pZg,,"The daily average of the Philippines new COVID cases in the past seven days is up 50% from the previous week. There are also more cases of influenza-like illnesses compared to the same period last year. Ara Perez reports. Fruit and vegetable vendor Roy continues to work even though he's feeling under the weather. Vitamins and enough sleep are Roy's defense against sickness along with following a number of health protocols. Social distancing is gone now. But if you sanitize your hands and face mask, it's still there. Based on the monitoring of the Epidemiology Bureau and surveillance units of DOH, more than 193,000 influenza-like illnesses have been reported in the country since December 2. This is 33% higher compared to the same period last year. Influenza-like illnesses include different diseases with fever, cough, colds, which are caused by different viruses including COVID-19. So it's not the actual number, it's the trend. Is it going up? Is it bigger than last year in the same time? Fatalities due to the said illnesses have decreased to almost half. Her boss explained most patients recover. I.L.I. are mostly self-limiting and people usually recover, especially if it's viral. 2023 trends in the recent three to four weeks, October 29 to November 11, there were 11% lower to the reported cases two weeks prior. So it cycles up and down depending on the number of incidents. The DOH continues to monitor COVID-19 cases in the country, which saw a slight uptick. 2,725 new COVID cases in the country have been recorded from December 12 to 18, which rose by half compared to last week. With this, daily average cases also climbed to 389 from 260 last week. In NCR, as of December 15, new COVID cases are at 1,528 in the last 14 days by date of onset of illness. COVID spreads by respiratory infection and it will really increase if there are many parties and gatherings or family reunions. So the same warning to everybody for influenza-like illness, acute respiratory infection and COVID-19. As long as it's even TB, even TB spreads by respiratory tract, the face mask is still the best prevention. Public health standards, good ventilation, open windows and in open air if there's a party. There's a slight increase so it's up to other people but it's still manageable. The UHNCR is also not alarmed by the increase in COVID cases given that the region is at low-risk case classification with low-risk health systems capacity. There's a lot of people with cough, cough, it's possible to just stay in the house or if you have to go out, we still wear a mask. DOA is coordinating with GoVax and GAVI to be granted a new batch of COVID vaccine donations. Here in the COVID-19 vaccine, currently we are not anymore implementing the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. All the vaccines that we have before cannot be used anymore. We've submitted our appeal there and we've also given our preference for the newer types of vaccines to be developed. So if that is something that will be granted to the Philippines, we will again continue to provide that to the most vulnerable populations. DOH earlier said it will not require the wearing of face masks for all as it appealed to the public to take care of oneself since we know our individual health risks. Ara PÃ©rez, ABS-CBN News. Thank you."
4,pMUumjHY3tw,,"The COVID wards of several Philippine hospitals are again fully occupied as the country experiences an uptick in cases. But the Philippine Health Chief says this is still not a cause for concern. Ara Perez tells us why. Nearly 2,000 COVID-19 cases have been recorded from December 5 to 11, raising the daily average case to 260, up from last week's 191. Meanwhile, case fatality rate is at 0.33%. Since August, the Philippine Health Department has reported an average of one death due to COVID per day, mostly those with comorbidity and high risk. This is still considered low compared to the situation at the height of the Delta variant, when fatality rate reached 5%. Still, Health Secretary Ted Herbosa assures the public there is nothing to worry about. But Herbosa is quick to add, this does not mean COVID is any less dangerous. The health secretary also confirmed that some hospitals have reported full bed capacity for COVID cases, but this is only because of lower bed allocation for the disease. Nationwide, COVID bed utilization remains low at 16% as of December 11, while ICU bed utilization is at 14%. Herbosa revealed there is no longer a budget allocation for COVID vaccines next year, but says the country has been offered one million doses of a new vaccine formulation called monovalent XBB. 74 million Filipinos have already been vaccinated with COVID vaccines and booster. For the Philippine Health Department, aside from vaccines, following minimum health standards is an effective protection against COVID-19. These can be easily followed, as we have been doing for years now, and we are aware of our personal risks. At this time, the DOH says there is only a slight optic of cases. The agency also sees no reason to bring back mandatory mask wearing for all, as it continues monitoring of cases and hospitals nationwide."
5,DWxIvQlpJK8,,"Community quality is needed throughout Manila Metro. And in other areas, LGUS is advised to avoid subsequent rules, avoiding the quality of the community in the area. For Manila, we don't want to use the rules, because we are afraid because we are given a lockdown. But it's a lockdown. There are no rules or rules here. There are no rules or rules here. It's just a problem protecting and protecting you from Covid-19. That's about it. It is not related to the military or police force, or my strength and these people next to me. In fact, it is not an issue, it is just an issue of protecting the interests and interests of society. That's all."

The World Health Organization recently classified JN.1 variant as a variant of interest, but the DOH noted that there is still no evidence of increased severity in the variant. The DOH explained that JN.1 was classified as a variant of interest because it still needs to be closely observed and studied by epidemiologists and researchers worldwide.

8,8dTelszbObM," well the corona virus continues to spread at speed this time a week ago they were under 3,000 cases in China there are now more than 17,000 and more than 360 people have died outside China there are more than 150 confirmed cases and we now have a fatality in the Philippines - and in a bid to contain this virus some countries are denying entry to any people from Wuhan the city where this virus began and China's accusing some countries of overreacting and stoking panic for example it's unimpressed that the US has declared a public health emergency and it's denying entry for all foreign nationals who visited the whole of China in the past two weeks and if that's the Americans this is what the World Health Organization is saying is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade we call on all countries to implement decisions that are evidence-based and consistent well in China millions of people are going back to work after the Lunar New Year holiday we have these pictures first of all you can see people well these are public areas being disinfected and we know that there have also been fever checks at Transport Hobbs to try and spot people with raised temperatures you may have the virus workers are also trying to disinfect these public spaces and China is urging and issued an urgent appeal for more protective suits goggles and masks because it's running low most of these pictures from Manila in the Philippines there's been a rush to buy face masks they're after a man from Wuhan died and then this is Hong Kong where hospital staff are going on strike they want the border with mainland China to be completely shot well next let's focus on the experience of being in the city of Wuhan it remains on lockdown people aren't being allowed to leave or come in and those who are there are being encouraged to stay at home we spotted this one Russian man who works there and film this one around 5:00 p.m. Sunday on his 3d can see only fake people say people here eight people there and remember that new hospital that was promised in Wuhan well it's finished this is a time-lapse of it being constructed in nine days it's now admitting patients and these images have been enthusiastically distributed by a Chinese state TV it's also been showing this graphic as well a cartoon with the machinery involved in that construction being hailed as heroes there are other images circulating on Chinese social media fan art featuring these machines a lot of it created by people stuck inside cities currently locked down so here's one digger with a big love heart in front of it or you've got this one here and this one's been given a nickname the cement king now several countries are trying to get their citizens out of Wuhan let's focus on Australia these are Australian evacuees waiting for hours at we had an airport before eventually being flown out eighty nine children were among those on board that's the first plane of Australian citizens and permanent residents to be flown out and this is where the plane landed in Western Australia but before passengers were put onto those what they'd landed there they were put onto smaller planes and immediately taken here to Christmas Island it's very much known for a large immigration detention center which you can see there this will be used to house the Australians in quarantine they're expected to be there for two weeks you also have these images released by channel 7 which shows some of the medical facilities that have been put up there you can see here an inflatable room to be used for isolating any potential confirmed cases of the virus it's known as a negative pressure because it allows fresh air in but stops potentially contaminated air from getting out well since 2003 asylum thousands of asylum seekers have been detained on Christmas Island well off the mainland of Australia under Australia's refugee policy at the moment though it just houses a family of four Sri Lankans who are fighting deportation so the plan here is to house the Australians who've been taken out of Wuhan and house them on the island in the short term but there are concerns particularly whether there are adequate medical facilities indeed not all of the 600 Australians and Wuhan have chosen to leave his woman who did woman who did leave explaining why she said I got a lot of pressure from my husband he said the situation is not very good all the other countries have starts to close the borders he said if we stay over here would probably take a couple of months to get out of Wuhan so he started to get really nervous and she got on the flight four flights carrying evacuees are now scheduled for the rest of this week now two other important parts of this story are misinformation and racism we spotted this post it's been widely shared in Australia supposedly from an organization called the department of disease geology Parramatta except that it doesn't exist and the information in it advising people to stay away from suburbs with large Chinese populations is baseless I saw this from a doctor in Australia she tweeted a patient made jokes about not shaking my hand because of coronavirus in frota might my team had not left Australia this is not sensible Public Health precautions this is racism well on infamous information and conspiracy theories around the coronavirus here's will summer a tech journalist from The Daily Beast we're seeing a lot of these these fake claims you know whether it's you know drinking bleach to ward it off or the idea that this is spread from Chinese people eating bats you know these frankly you know many of these these ideas are frankly very racist that are blowing up on social media so so it's it's tricky you know we've seen some tweets from even epidemiologist people who are experts in this field get taken out of context and really blow up online by people who are you know can very concerned about coronavirus so you know the solution I think is very responsible reporting and in people really you know going to the experts on this rather than you sort of seeing what's going viral and running with that boy so this article by journalist called Angela hoy written in the metro newspaper in this article she highlights some of the media coverage she's taken exception to for instance this is the Herald Sun in Australia it has the headline Chinese virus pandemonium with the word panda highlighted and she's also written about her personal experiences here in London in particular one incident on the underground a white man about in their twenties thirties sits down next meme and then immediately shoots back up and gets up and then like mutters under his breath like oh not so next to a corona virus and then sits a croc goes across the carriage and then sits somewhere else and at the time I was just like kind of taken aback beligum that really just happened and not really thinking too much about it and didn't really say anything at the time because it's a little bit in shock and also I didn't really want to kick up a fuss about anything because is this yeah I think that's what happened and now you've shared this story have other people come to you and said well actually I've experienced something similar yeah actually like quite a few people have you know experienced the same thing the problem was when the corona virus like broke out it was around like Lunar New Year as well so a lot of people weren't allowed to go back to go back home and visit family because a lot of people were locked down and it was quite sad as well in Chinatown many people in Chinatown like London yeah a London Chinatown a lot of people didn't you know we're avoiding the area because of you know fear of Oh catching something or catching coronavirus and I never girl that I spoke to she was also on the tube and then she saw a man that she witnessed man like holding a newspaper and then there was like a group of East Asians that just got on the tube and he was just like using a newspaper tonight covered his face and like like this kind of thing getting away from them and then as soon as they got off the tube and he just kind of relaxed and it was just this I think it's just kind of really sad that everyone's being lumped together it doesn't really matter if you're East Asian Southeast Asian you know everyone's kind of lumped together it doesn't mean you know regardless maybe if you're trying to use a lot which is the sad thing I think and in your article you were just talking about your personal experience you're also highlighting some of the media coverage that you've taken issue with have you been surprised by the tone that you've seen in some newspapers I'm surprised because I feel like a lot of like East Asian like it's just nation is just not really reported on and it's always is often ignored and I think these scare mongering headlines are just you know thinking the worst and it's making everyone think and think irrationally and do irrational things and it's just you know cause I look like a frenzy where everyone's just scared and

they're braving their way to divisoria manila's largest public market to scavenge for vegetable scrap or collect leftover goods freely handed out by generous sellers the lockdown has crippled elena and bernadette's ability to work and earn an income bernadette is an egg seller who used to earn 15 u.s dollars a day elena is a freelance massage therapist who could earn up to 30 us dollars on good days she was doing well enough to even put up a small store to help with the family's daily spend but everything just fell apart during the first week of the lockdown elena's family was forced to consume every foodstock they had in this small store the crisis has damaged significantly damaged the asset base of urban pool street vendors couldn't sell on the streets jeepney drivers pedicab drivers tricycle drivers couldn't operate couldn't go out and pick up passengers so it would be very difficult for them to recover economically from this crisis [Music] like bernadette and elena many filipinos experienced hunger amid the lockdown in fact the philippines hunger incidence rate is at its highest in six years according to the social weather station a non-profit research institution the poll reveals that 20.9 percent or 5.2 million filipino families have experienced involuntary hunger at least one in the past three months of the quarantine period [Music] after four hours elena bernadette and leia have collected more than enough to tide them through the next two days and are planning on giving their extras around their neighborhood the philippine government has come in with aid to help mitigate the problem of hunger among the people a week after announcing its quarantine measures philippine president rodrigo duterte signed into law a package of emergency cash subsidy to 18 million low-income families beneficiaries will receive at least 100 u.s dollars to a maximum of 165 u.s dollars each month for two months city governments and village leaders were given a month to distribute the aid and aid had to reach swiftly but many like elena didn't receive her subsidy right away even after waiting for more than a month me borrowed just enough money to purchase rice christmas depression [Music] if not for these loans as well as elena's risky venture to the market earlier today her family could have fallen very ill or worse die of starvation [Music] foreign [Music] lockdown is the government doing enough to alleviate their pain will help come in time before the situation spirals out of control [Music] so soon after announcing a nationwide lockdown president rodrigo duterte signed into law the social amelioration program or sap under the sap the government provides 18 million low-income families with a much needed emergency cash subsidy each beneficiary will receive at least 100 us dollars each month for two months city governments and village leaders were given a month to distribute the aid the distribution had to be swift so that aid gets to the more vulnerable segments of the population as an urban poor elena perena qualifies as a beneficiary for the social amelioration program she was expecting to receive the promised first month cash subsidy immediately but help didn't come along until two months after aid was not only slow but it was also very little elena received only 138 u.s dollars on her first month of subsidy equivalent to about four days of her usual daily income is the emergency cash subsidy is only about a quarter of what a family of five actually needs in a month to get by based on current estimates by economists and urban poor advocates well the thing is the subsidy was not meant to be like a cure-all it was just meant to be a a partial subsidy so and we have to recognize also that government has its own risk constraints they don't have infinite money elena's problem is even more dire that's because she has 10 children and 13 grandchildren living under the same roof except for one all of them don't earn an income after their employers had temporarily ceased their businesses the government claims it has nothing left to extend its subsidies but the harsher reality is elena's family are much better off than most other families had waited for far much longer to receive their first month emergency cash subsidies three months into the lockdown five million families are still wondering if their raid is ever going to come the majority waited so long and also the trash they got was next to nothing it is equivalent to about nine pesos per person per day over the last five months you can't do anything with that a huge cause of delay a random distribution of aid we also we've heard a lot about irregularities in the distribution some local officials were prioritizing their own relatives their own probably friends they would prioritize their friends because we have a very weak democratic system that hardly works in some areas and that of course affects the poor who are supposedly benefiting fairly from the distribution but some of them were not able to receive this assistance because they were not part of that patreon client system in their area under the law an irregularity like this is a criminal offence on the second month of the lockdown the national government received more than 2 000 complaints against village council officials for the delay in the distribution of aid currently the philippine prosecutor's office have charged 134 officials with various graft related cases 50 officers are now suspended from office but the crux of the matter is local governments are also facing systemic problems the philippines has barely begun transitioning to a national id system though a newly created law mandates it that's why city governments had to rely on an outdated list of their constituents based on a national census that was held five years ago as a result many filipinos have been excluded during the pandemic even if we wanted to have universal cash transfers we couldn't because there was no mechanism there is no way for us to locate any everybody now nearly six months after announcing provisions for emergency cash subsidies the government has given the second month subsidy to almost 95 percent of beneficiaries the original sin with the social administration program is that the government was so stingy about it you did not get a sense that they wanted to help as many people as quickly as possible elena is unsure if her second month subsidy is coming in the meantime elena's deaths are piling up she currently owes about 100 us dollars from friends on top of utility bills she has to pay salomon in elena's family has also become too poor to protect themselves against covid19 [Music] the philippines is known to have one of the most restrictive lockdowns in the world a special pass was needed to move around to buy essential goods those who violate the curfew and social distancing measures or fail to wear a mask will be punished they range from fines to detention mass gatherings like protests are banned but on the third week of the lockdown a hundred filipinos gathered at edsa a main thoroughfare where historic protests happen sixty-four-year-old caesar galamosa was one of them as an elderly he's not allowed outside of his residence but caesar is desperate he lives from paycheck to paycheck after he lost his blue-collar job foreign famished caesar decided to join his neighbors at edsa he arrived at nine in the morning there was no relief distribution in sight later a team of police arrived to disperse the crowd driven into a corner time and options are running out for the urban poor will the government be able to deliver a solution or will anger spill out into the streets [Music] three weeks into the philippine lockdown a commotion over food aid erupted at edsa one of manila's main thoroughfares a day before the incident rumors spread across the slum village of san roque that a sack of rice would be given out as aid at edsa although mass gatherings are banned about 300 people turned up the following day soon the police arrived and advised them to disperse but driven by desperation 64 year old caesar villamosa stayed on you know the pandemic really put a strain on the poor they are already the most vulnerable they put a strain on the floor because absolutely poor would not want to get sick as much as possible they don't want to be sick because they know it's going to cost money they know it's going to stop them from working the poor do not want to get sick but they will risk life and limb if they're not going to be able to money that's how caesar ended up in detention for five days together with 20 others they were charged with five cases allegedly in violation of quarantine rules and health emergencies these offences could have put them in detention for six months in the philippines violations are quite commonplace since the lockdown was implemented in mid-march more than 300 000 quarantine violators were apprehended by authorities violators were warned fined detained or charged most of these violators come from impoverished families the night of the commotion philippine president rodrigo duterte addressed the country about the incident he suspected that leftist insurgents were behind it and promised to act tough against the room among us [Music] there is no understanding there is no social consideration there is no value being given to the life that is supposed to be saved that is the most difficult part for me to understand you enforce a quarantine because you want to save lives you want to save lives by spreading by by stopping the spread of disease and yet here we are here is the government having very little consideration for that life it just goes against the grain the very green for humanity caesar and the other 20 detainees are now out on bail paid for by two influential celebrities it cost more than 6400 us dollars to release them an amount they could not have raised by themselves fortunately they also received free legal assistance if not for these caesar and his family would have no choice but to accept the punishment but caesar continues to confront his worsening poverty day by day nearly six months into the lockdown he and his daughter are still waiting for a job he also faces a pile of debts and the prospect of eviction from his rented home even as they're trying to cope with the problem of starvation [Music] ironically many urban poor come to manila in search of a better life away from rural poverty but even in the city life has been a constant struggle covet 19 has threatened to displace nearly 11 million workers from the informal sectors and erase years of progress on poverty alleviation the truth is there are not enough policies and mechanisms to help pull the poor out of their poverty but also i think because people are seeing how unequal the philippines is and how problematic our politics is i think we are in the middle of a moment people are actually asking is this the government we deserve are these economic policies we need why are people so bad off the philippines has been fighting chronic poverty since the late 1960s for decades the nation had always been dubbed as the sick man of asia but a series of economic reforms in early 2000 paved the way for growth from opening country to country international trade foreign direct investments like business process outsourcing as well as hospitality and tourism in 2013 the philippine economy finally gained strength the world bank described the philippines as asia's rising tiger with its gdp rising steadily the philippines was no longer the sick man of asia but a breakout nation with one of the most promising economies in the world philippine poverty rates were finally going down but it was just numbers these income indicators actually one don't fail to capture so many other dimensions of poverty but secondly i think it's the worst thing for us it's actually used to hide high levels of poverty we have the richest 50 filipinos having a combined wealth of 4.1 trillion pesos which is equivalent to the combined wealth the poorest 60 to 70 million filipinos that doesn't make sense a clear evidence of uneven exclusionary growth is right in the slums the urban poor have been struggling to own homes in the last 10 years caesar's informal settlement has been defying eviction and demolition about six thousand families live on this government-owned property but a part of this real estate has been sold to a private developer with no plan of resettling its slum dwellers is so while gdps have been rising job opportunities and better labor conditions among the urban poor are barely improving many of the urban poor remain as workers in the informal economy as drivers of jeepneys and brick shores street peddlers owners of small convenience stores or manual laborers in the construction industry statisticians and economists estimate that at least 62 percent of filipinos are working in the informal economy that's about 30 million informal workers suffering through decades of income inequality you also have a lot of workers who don't have legal protection of the law but they are still there they you know the street vendors the tricycle drivers the barkers of jeepneys they are workers they are contributing to the economy but they are not part of the mantle of legal environment it's no wonder the urban poor like elena bernadette and caesar are the most vulnerable during the pandemic the urban poor like them already had it worst before covert 19 as mere daily wage earners without safety nets and social protection i'm still calling this pandemic as in a way as low as a form of slow moving disaster why because disasters or crises don't exist in a vacuum in the case of the philippines we have very weak democratic institutions and for us to be able to manage this well to begin with this has reached this level this unprecedented level because i think it was poorly managed from the start the philippine government wants to recover from the pandemic by providing corporate tax breaks and loans to smes but so far they've been silent on how to help the urban poor in the informal sector or perhaps there is really none at all now the urban poor are resorting to self-help while a new sector is plunging into poverty but how much can they do to solve their financial and health worlds [Music] in manila philippines the urban poor are left on their own to survive through the pandemic [Music] in san roque an informal settlement with roughly 30 000 residents many have been jobless throughout the six month long quarantine in place of their jobs the city government helped to distribute rice to local residents [Music] m to solve hunger in their community fair sidco decided to help in a community kitchen the non-profit organizations helped to raise funds to kick-start this initiative they established 28 community kitchens throughout san roque providing breakfast to 3 000 residents aside from this kitchen the non-profit organizations helped pull together community health volunteers like jelen rossilo as most of them are under-educated volunteer doctors taught them about how to respond to the threat of covet-19 infections and what they can do to avoid falling ill but they have a more important task volunteers like gellin look out for covert 19 symptoms around the neighborhood and deliver food to those under quarantine in closed and congested places where covet virus would most likely thrive mass testing at san roque hasn't even begun the residents also claimed that government healthcare workers avoided their slum community they've been told that government frontliners lack personal protective equipment or ppe too that's why most residents feared for their lives so from the point of view of individual vulnerability the poor is already vulnerable their their immune system is low they're not they're not eating the food that they need to survive and they don't have the rest mandatory precautionary measures like safe distancing hand washing hand sanitation and mask wearing are luxuries for slum dwellers is [Music] relied on private donations to assist her community but nearly six months into quarantine help has stopped coming in foreign [Music] back in the community kitchens funds are also running out no new pledges have come in chalita's community kitchen used to feed 75 people five times a week now they are down to 35 twice a week [Music] this week's feeding will actually be the last hungry as she may be chelita had not been eating from meals they'd prepared that's because she feels others need the food more than her i know [Music] but community volunteers like faye is not giving up she decided to grow vegetables on her backyard to be a food source whenever someone asks for help at the end of the day if this community kitchens dry up and we stop providing food the government has to come in uh at the end of the day it's their responsibility to provide relief and to help the struggling urban poor in their own vicinity in their own city so if the government is not part of that it's like you are exonerating the state from its responsibility to provide the needed assistance especially of the urban people there's only so much that kellen can do to protect herself if she gets infected with covet 19 she will not receive any free treatment the national government extends help to those who contribute to estate health insurance but gellan is too poor to make the voluntary contributions [Music] foreign as many of the urban poor struggle on their own through the community quarantine another sector of society is increasingly desperate jeepney drivers are resorting to begging or protesting to go back to work jeepneys are the most popular transportation in the philippines it's known for its crowded seating so the government allows less than five percent of jeepneys to ply through the roads as a containment measure well if we're looking at their numbers there's more than i think 170 000 jeepney units nationwide so you're talking about 170 000 families nationwide relying on the jeepney industry so you multiply that by what five or six members so we're talking about close to 1 million people relying on the jeepney industry alone and if we're not serious with listening to their demand or at least hitting their appeal then it's like you're basically ignoring one [Music] section of your population now in just six months jeepney drivers have fallen into poverty [Music] chito bustamente had been driving a jeep for more than a decade to save up for his dream home now he is not only out of work chito has also no house to live in had to rely on loan sharks to help supplement his unstable income and send his seven children to school income [Music] 19 year old trisha is honorario's eldest daughter who has a year left before finishing her engineering degree all she wants is to graduate from a university be gainfully employed and help her father honorario in sending [Music] adding to their worries is a contentious government plan to phase out jeepneys they require jeepney owners like honorario and chito to upgrade to environmentally friendly vehicles but it's an investment they cannot afford they're still paying loans for the current jeepneys they own the government hasn't extended assistance to jeepney drivers like chito and honorario except for emergency cash subsidies it's also unclear if they will ever get back on the roads even when covert 19 is over we know at the end of the day gp drivers will be displaced um we do agree there is a need to modernize gps but there's a way to more than sgp's without leaving the poor and vulnerable drivers behind again it involves the government subsidizing the transition and that's the basic demand of gp drivers amidst these uncertainties honorario's children suffer the most trisha's dreams are put on hold as honorario was forced by circumstances to drop his children out of school family now sells native delicacies to enable the family to eat three times a day while cheeto has to find other ways to put food on the table the only recourse is to scavenge for junk foreign while strangers fear him chito actually has fears too he worries about getting infected from the junk he collects for this morning he traded the stash he's collected for one us dollar and 50 cents it's enough to buy him a kilo of rice the government isn't doing enough that's why they're so dismissive because they know the filipino poor have suffered so much through all the years they will survive it's not a question of them recovering even if pushing the ground they will try their best to make do with what they have poverty is a vicious cycle a self-perpetuating condition that can't simply be broken without external help caught in a daily struggle for survival before the pandemic that challenge was almost insurmountable but a crippling lockdown brought on by covert 19 has turned that challenge into a huge battle against hunger and hopelessness how long can the poor hold on to hope before starvation takes over how long more shall they wait before their cries for help give way into silence [Music] [Music] you, it has one of the toughest and longest lockdowns in the world but the ultra-strict quarantine measures have left more than 5 million filipinos hungry [Music] more than 10 million people have lost their jobs and their livelihoods destroyed me uh why did the pandemic hit the poorest of the poor so hard when a crisis like this hits an equal society like the philippines it's like amplifying the inequality in the social divide so the poor are bearing the brunt of an equal distribution of the impacts of this crisis as the philippine economy is crashing into its worst recession in decades how can the country's poor pull themselves out of the crushing poverty [Music] manila the capital city of the philippines a business hub plagued by economic disparity as the city progresses 35 percent of its population or more than 4 million still reside in slums they are laborers who have to contend with meager incomes of less than two dollars a day and now manila has become the new epicenter for the coronavirus outbreak in southeast asia with slums considered as viral hotbeds for the transmission of the disease space is a luxury for the rich so the poor they live in small homes in crowded congested communities the vulnerability of course with any sort of infectious disease it's the enclosed space the post interaction the amount of people you're interacting with uh the poor really have it worse in in in the normal time they also have it worse i think in times of crisis right now [Music] but the country's urban poor is facing a fear far more frightening than kovid the fear of starvation [Music] as work and incomes dry up starvation is forcing the urban poor to cope in unthinkable ways midnight at one of manila's biggest slums 64 year old bernadette sablazar and her neighbor elena perena together with elena's 16 year old daughter leia breach quarantine restrictions in search of food as an elderly bernadette is required to stay at home and like her teenage leia is also not allowed to be outside

about 170 000 families nationwide relying on the jeepney industry so you multiply that by what five or six members so we're talking about close to 1 million people relying on the jeepney industry

ever get back on the roads even when covert 19 is over we know at the end of the day gp drivers will be displaced um we do agree there is a need to modernize gps but there's a way to more than sgp's without leaving the poor and vulnerable drivers behind again it involves the government subsidizing the transition and that's the basic demand of gp drivers amidst these uncertainties honorario's children suffer the most trisha's dreams are put on hold as honorario was forced by circumstances to drop his children out of school family now sells native delicacies to enable the family to eat

13,nTUWK8vufOk," COVID-19 has left
economies around the world reeling from the fallout
of the pandemic, and the Philippines is no exception. The pandemic has forced schools
to shut down their doors and keep students at home. Last year alone, around two million students
dropped out of school. Many have taken up
illegal and often dangerous jobs to help families cope with the economic impact
of the health crisis. How can these children be helped? What would it take
for the Philippine government to save these children before it's too late? Life has come to a virtual standstill
in the Philippines. That's after the government
placed a major part of the city under strict lockdown. The once busy street in Manila
is now empty. The tight COVID-19 restrictions
have snuffed out faint signs of recovery that the people are hoping for, especially for 47-year-old Jonathan Mapa,
a bicycle taxi driver. Even more worrying for his family is the fate of his 12-year-old son,
also named Jonathan. His entire future is now at stake
in the midst of the continuing lockdown. For 1.5 years, the Philippines has been
under varying degrees of lockdown, with certain industries remaining closed while others have been partially operating
at 50% at the most. Stringent restrictions
have pulled the GDP down to its lowest in seven decades. More than four million people
have now lost their jobs. Their livelihoods have also
been left in tatters. At least two million youths
are out of school. The youths are affected
by the COVID-19 pandemic, and no one seems to talk about it. We have heard how specific sectors
or demographic groups are at a disadvantage. We've heard, for example,
how frontliners are at a disadvantage. It's true because they're the ones
at the forefront of the pandemic. We've also heard about
overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and their families. We've heard how the family members
of OFWs who have lost their jobs abroad are in a much more difficult position because they now have less remittances and may have limited savings
to depend on. But one specific demographic that I think was left behind
in these discussions was the youth. A sluggish economy,
along with slow vaccination rates, has made the country
the worst place to be during the pandemic, according to research assessing how 53 nations have been managing disruptions caused by COVID-19. Part of the problem is that we never get a clear understanding of what the reason for
one degree of lockdown over another is. There seems to be no consistent recording and transmission of information for us to understand what is going on and how we should go about the problem. The prescription is,
you follow the rules. However, the rules are sometimes incomprehensible, and then they say,
""Oh, this doesn't work. It just turns out this doesn't work. Never mind. You can forget about them."" Quarantine exacts a heavy toll, especially for daily wage earners
like Jonathan. His slum community has been
put under total lockdown thrice in the past 1.5 years for a total of four months. There's no mobility,
no passengers and no income. To compensate for the losses
during total lockdowns, the government handed out
US$78 a month on average to families like Jonathan's. But it is barely half
of what he usually makes. Twelve-year-old Jonathan
is the youngest of nine children and a beacon of hope for the family. But the health crisis has forced children
to bear the brunt of the raging pandemic. In Jonathan's village, almost every other child as young as 10
end up scavenging, unintendedly flouting the law
on child labour to help put food on the table. Eventually, these children end up
with worse, lifelong problems. Dad Jonathan is struggling
to keep his son safe when the government
ordered all schools to close. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte says he won't allow students
to go back to school until a coronavirus vaccine
is available. He says if no one graduates,
then so be it. Only 20% of the Filipino population
have been vaccinated to date. The low vaccination rate has heightened
the risk of exposure to the virus, making them vulnerable to infections. Campus closure has been extended
for the second school year in an effort to contain
the spread of the virus. The Philippines is one of the two nations
and the only Asian country to have not resumed face-to-face classes. According to the UNESCO data
on school closures, in the whole of Southeast Asia
and East Asia, the Philippines has the longest duration
of school closures, which means schools have not been open
since mid-March 2020. That is alarming
because our neighbouring countries, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam,
to some extent, have partially opened schools. And what's troubling about this is that
the Philippines is an island economy. We're composed of
many different regions and provinces, and not all regions and provinces
are affected the same way, which means that a blanket policy,
which is school closures for all, is definitely not the right approach
to go for. The country's economic managers
estimate that one year of school closure already costs the economy
about US$4.5 million. These are losses
that would most likely be felt by the Filipino youth
for the next 40 years. With a study-at-home policy, most schools in Manila
shifted to online learning. The problem is, access to the Internet,
as well as gadgets, is widely uneven. Based on the government's
rapid assessment, 6.3 million households
do not have access to the Internet while 2 million households
have no devices for learning. Even before the pandemic, Dad Jonathan could ill afford
a smartphone. Determined to continue his studies, 12-year-old Jonathan
made a painful decision on his own. But how far will he go
to achieve his dream? The Philippines is the worst place to be
in a pandemic, according to experts. And its youths are paying the price for the government's
weak response to COVID-19. Enrolment numbers are down by 2%
compared to pre-pandemic figures. That's more than two million students. And 12-year-old Jonathan Mapa
is one of them. Initially, he used his eldest sister's phone
for online lessons. Nowadays, Jonathan's father earns only US$3, or half of his pre-pandemic income. Desperate, 12-year-old Jonathan
resorted to scavenging for recyclables. It is his father's greatest fear. Jonathan's 47-year-old mother, Normelita,
suffers from arthritis that requires taking daily medication
to manage her pain. Jonathan is now trapped
in a vicious cycle, as long as his family faces hunger
and schools are closed. He also joins an estimated
160 million children worldwide who have been pushed into hazardous work
because of the pandemic. On average, 12-year-old Jonathan
earns as much as his father. The number of children
pushed into child labour by the pandemic has yet to be tracked
by the Philippine government. I don't want to sound overly pessimistic, but I think we have to recognise that we are really facing a crisis that is
not only a learning crisis but also a generational crisis that will affect
all segments of the society. It has been nine months since 12-year-old Jonathan
began scavenging. Each moment spent working
is a step further away from his dreams. Unlike Jonathan, three of the Damiar children
are carrying on with their studies, but they're struggling to cope
with distance learning. Life is a constant struggle for 56-year-old
odd job labourer dad Dionisio. Armed with just a basic education, he could only find work
in contractual, blue-collar jobs. When jobs are not readily available, he'd go into the forest
in search of forest products to sell for some cash. Fourteen-year-old Judith is the brightest
among a family of five. She aspires to be a police officer so that she could earn a decent income to help ease
the family's financial burden. The Damiar family lives in a village that has very poor
or no Internet connections, so like 80% of Filipino families, they opted for what the government calls
""modular distance learning"". Under this scheme, teachers hand out and collect
paper-based modules at least once a week. These modules lay out
detailed instructions for studying and weekly assessments. It is designed
for learning on one's own, without a teacher's help. Key subjects
like English, Maths and Science are written in English, which makes self-learning
almost impossible for students like Judith. The Damiar family
is not an isolated case. A survey of 1,000 families conducted by the Movement for Safe,
Equitable, Quality, and Relevant Education reveals a pattern. One in every five students
had no one to guide them in their studies. One in 10 students
claim to fall behind in school. 12% of the parents indicate that at least one of their children
has stopped schooling. There are repeated problems. They couldn't answer the modules. Was there learning? I would say that we have poor education quality because of how we teach our students. Alone in her struggles, Judith's final marks sank, from a pre-pandemic average of 85 down to a slightly passing grade of 79. Printed modules were certainly
the most practical way of delivering and continuing
the delivery of education, but it probably was not the optimal when it comes to ensuring that
the children are actually learning as they were when going to school. How long will
this ""learning crisis"" continue? Will the economic downturn
and continuing school closures force these children
out of school forever? Life has taken
a sudden and unexpected turn for 19-year-old undergraduate
Juriel Natividad. It happened after his mum, Alma, who worked as a massage therapist
in the United Arab Emirates, lost her job in 2020
following the outbreak, and that has caused
a deep economic hardship and financial distress to the family. Juriel would have been in the second year
of his university education, had his mum not lost her job abroad. Nowadays, they can hardly afford
high-speed Internet to help him in his studies. So, he dropped out of school. So long as Juriel is out of school
and idle, he'd remain a burden to the economy. He doesn't have the qualification
or the necessary training to be a productive member of society. The youths should be
in either one of them. To be a productive member of society, they should soak up
all the human capital they can at this point so that in the future, they get better
labour market opportunities. But they also drop out of school, which means these are idle years, and ""idle years"" in this sense
means that they're not contributing to the human capital development for future benefits, so to speak. Juriel spends time
tending to the family's small store. The income can only cover
their daily needs. That's why Juriel is desperately
seeking a job, even though the odds
are heavily stacked against him. He's competing with
nearly four million other Filipinos currently unemployed
as a result of the pandemic. What we can infer from this is that other parts of the labour force
seems to already be recovering. The recovery process is already happening, but the youths are not
recovering as quickly. The Philippines is suffering from
its worst economic recession in decades. The country's economic managers say
it will take more than 10 years to return to pre-pandemic growth. So, whether Juriel goes back to school
or lands a job in these coming years remains uncertain for now. But what we know from past evidence,
or past recessions, is that there are scarring effects, and we literally use the term ""scarring"", which means that
individuals, or the youths, who enter the labour market
during a recession suffer permanent income losses,
at least for a decade. And it only dissipates. They only earn
as much as their counterparts who entered the labour market
during normal times after a decade. Juriel, however, lays the blame
squarely on the government. He feels that the government
is not doing enough to help young people like him
get out of their predicament. There is also a mental health crisis
unfolding among children, according to Save the Children,
a child rights advocate. Mental health effects
include mental and emotional stress, anxiety, depression and panic attacks. The students share that
these mental concerns were triggered by being overwhelmed
with the class and household duties, limited or lack of social interaction and inability to understand the lessons
for distance learning or difficulty in self-directed learning. Eighteen-year-old Maica's ordeal began with a simple misunderstanding
between her classmates when she accidentally deleted
her classmate's compiled essays on a shared document. Hostile arguments online involving insults
is called ""flaming"", a form of cyberbullying. Even before the pandemic, UNICEF estimates that cyber violence affects almost half
of Filipino children aged 13 to 17. One third of these cases
involve verbal abuse over cell phones. Cyberbullying is so much more insidious than traditional bullying, because physical bullying happens in places like schools
during a particular time and only a particular group
of people saw it, but for cyberbullying,
you don't know where it goes. For three months now, eating and sleeping
have become harder for Maica. The constant harassment
has also affected her studies. You don't want
a major part of the young generation having mental problems because... unless you have a very robust system
of dealing with them, that condition is going to
persist for life, and people are living longer. The Filipino youths
are suffering in silence. Distance learning has only done
more harm than good. Returning to face-to-face schools
would help mitigate the negative impact of a physical separation
between teachers and students. A pilot programme that would shift
its students back to the classroom has been approved by the president
only a month ago, but it will only take effect next month. For now, Filipino youths are forced
to endure their struggles with long-lasting consequences. We cannot continue
keeping our schools closed. Since the pandemic began
early last year, youth unemployment in the country
has swelled to 31.6%. That's about 1 in 6 young people
currently unemployed, and 19-year-old Juriel Natividad
is one of them. He can't find a proper job to help ease
the family's financial burden. He also can't go back to school because the family is just too poor
to support his university education. One way to help people like him is to encourage companies
to hire young workers. Something that we could look into is, for example, employer subsidies. Other countries in Europe that have persistently high levels
of youth unemployment, for example, Spain or Italy, have experimented with programmes
such as employer subsidies for those hiring youth workers. I don't think we have
that sort of programme right now, but that's something
that we should definitely look into. But that can only be done
once the economy, which has been severely battered
by the pandemic, is back on track. Before the onset
of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Philippines was poised
to become the next Asian tiger economy. It posted an average growth
of more than 6% annually for 9 years, but its economy is now faltering, and it would take years to recover
to pre-pandemic growth levels. That has put limits
on the government's capacity to deal with
the crisis of this magnitude while the children suffer. The issue really is our capacity to deal with the problem. People are saying that at this stage, it no longer makes sense to differentiate between
natural and political calamities. They're the same now. The damage of natural calamities depends on the capacity
of the people in authority to deal with them. Unless the children are educated, there is no hope for them
to improve their standing in life. There have been growing calls
from many quarters, including the UN Children's Fund, for schools to be reopened
and in-person learning to be resumed. The concern is prolonged closure
would further exacerbate the education crisis in the country, leading to more school dropouts
and youth unemployment. 47-year-old Dionisio Damiar's
biggest worry is his 10-year-old, Jane. Jane had to drop out of school
in her first grade, when she had only begun
to read and write. Eldest sister Judith is barely coping
with distance learning and has little time to spare
to tutor her sister, while dad Dionisio and mum Rowena
are undereducated themselves and are incapable
of guiding their child. Nowadays, Jane is helping her mum
at a small store while taking care of the family's newborn
at the same time. She has already missed
two years of learning. Young dropouts like her
are highly likely to stay out of school for the rest of their lives, and Jane would become
a permanent liability to her family and the country
if it stays that way. We have a young population. They will be taking their place
in the labour force. They will be able to be productive. Therefore, they will be able
to support the ageing population. But that is true only if that younger generation
is prepared to address the tasks
of the employment market, and without education, that ability is going to be
severely limited. Having dropouts is a significant issue. I'm not belittling
the importance of that problem, but you've got to take it
in the context of your responsibility for the larger population
that is also at risk, because if you don't do a good job
with the 26 million, they're going to be dropouts, and you'll have
that segment of the population becoming an even bigger drag
on the society. Saving the children's future
requires investment and innovation. The city of Navotas
has one of the lowest dropout rates and highest re-enrolment rates
in the country. It invested US$2.3 million
this school year so that learners like eight-year-old Brian
would be supplied with what he needs, like mobile phones,
prepaid credits and school supplies. Volunteers are also being mobilised
to help tutor students like him at least once a week. We're going to have to go in
what has been, for the country, the default position. We're going to have to rely, again,
on the private sector. We're going to have to rely
on NGOs and civil society organisations to supplement the ability
of the government to address these basic tasks. Even in the handling of the pandemic, it's really the private sector
that has taken a very strong lead in addressing the issues. Back in Manila city, an afternoon spent scavenging has only earned 12-year-old Jonathan
40 cents. It's barely enough
to buy a kilogram of rice. In this slum community, income, as well as help,
has dwindled. COVID-19 restrictions have prevented
outsiders from coming in to provide aid
to poor people like him. COVID-19 ravaged the gains
the Philippines had made in a decade, and the government's weak response
is failing its youth, leaving a generation and a country
unable to find its way. Captions: CaptionCube"," COVID-19 has left

because of the pandemic. On average, 12-year-old Jonathan
earns as much as his father. The number of children
pushed into child labour by the pandemic has yet to be tracked
by the Philippine government. I don't want to sound overly pessimistic, but I think we have to recognise that we are really facing a crisis that is
not only a learning crisis but also a generational crisis that will affect
all segments of the society. It has been nine months since 12-year-old Jonathan
began scavenging. Each moment spent working
is a step further away from his dreams. Unlike Jonathan, three of the Damiar children
are carrying on with their studies, but they're struggling to cope
with distance learning. Life is a constant struggle for 56-year-old
odd job labourer dad Dionisio. Armed with just a basic education, he could only find work
in contractual, blue-collar jobs. When jobs are not readily available, he'd go into the forest
in search of forest products to sell for some cash. Fourteen-year-old Judith is the brightest
among a family of five. She aspires to be a police officer so that she could earn a decent income to help ease
the family's financial burden. The Damiar family lives in a village that has very poor
or no Internet connections, so like 80% of Filipino families, they opted for what the government calls
""modular distance learning"". Under this scheme, teachers hand out and collect
paper-based modules at least once a week. These modules lay out
detailed instructions for studying and weekly assessments. It is designed
for learning on one's own, without a teacher's help. Key subjects
like English, Maths and Science are written in English, which makes self-learning
almost impossible for students like Judith. The Damiar family
is not an isolated case. A survey of 1,000 families conducted by the Movement for Safe,
Equitable, Quality, and Relevant Education reveals a pattern. One in every five students
had no one to guide them in their studies. One in 10 students
claim to fall behind in school. 12% of the parents indicate that at least one of their children
has stopped schooling. There are repeated problems. They couldn't answer the modules. Was there learning? I would say that we have poor education quality because of how we teach our students. Alone in her struggles, Judith's final marks sank, from a pre-pandemic average of 85 down to a slightly passing grade of 79. Printed modules were certainly
the most practical way of delivering and continuing
the delivery of education, but it probably was not the optimal when it comes to ensuring that
the children are actually learning as they were when going to school. How long will
this ""learning crisis"" continue? Will the economic downturn
and continuing school closures force these children
out of school forever? Life has taken
a sudden and unexpected turn for 19-year-old undergraduate
Juriel Natividad. It happened after his mum, Alma, who worked as a massage therapist
in the United Arab Emirates, lost her job in 2020
following the outbreak, and that has caused
a deep economic hardship and financial distress to the family. Juriel would have been in the second year
of his university education, had his mum not lost her job abroad. Nowadays, they can hardly afford
high-speed Internet to help him in his studies. So, he dropped out of school. So long as Juriel is out of school
and idle, he'd remain a burden to the economy. He doesn't have the qualification
or the necessary training to be a productive member of society. The youths should be
in either one of them. To be a productive member of society, they should soak up
all the human capital they can at this point so that in the future, they get better
labour market opportunities. But they also drop out of school, which means these are idle years, and ""idle years"" in this sense
means that they're not contributing to the human capital development for future benefits, so to speak. Juriel spends time
tending to the family's small store. The income can only cover
their daily needs. That's why Juriel is desperately
seeking a job, even though the odds
are heavily stacked against him. He's competing with
nearly four million other Filipinos currently unemployed
as a result of the pandemic. What we can infer from this is that other parts of the labour force
seems to already be recovering. The recovery process is already happening, but the youths are not
recovering as quickly. The Philippines is suffering from
its worst economic recession in decades. The country's economic managers say
it will take more than 10 years to return to pre-pandemic growth. So, whether Juriel goes back to school
or lands a job in these coming years remains uncertain for now. But what we know from past evidence,
or past recessions, is that there are scarring effects, and we literally use the term ""scarring"", which means that
individuals, or the youths, who enter the labour market
during a recession suffer permanent income losses,
at least for a decade. And it only dissipates. They only earn
as much as their counterparts who entered the labour market
during normal times after a decade. Juriel, however, lays the blame
squarely on the government. He feels that the government
is not doing enough to help young people like him
get out of their predicament. There is also a mental health crisis
unfolding among children, according to Save the Children,
a child rights advocate. Mental health effects
include mental and emotional stress, anxiety, depression and panic attacks. The students share that
these mental concerns were triggered by being overwhelmed
with the class and household duties, limited or lack of social interaction and inability to understand the lessons
for distance learning or difficulty in self-directed learning. Eighteen-year-old Maica's ordeal began with a simple misunderstanding
between her classmates when she accidentally deleted
her classmate's compiled essays on a shared document. Hostile arguments online involving insults
is called ""flaming"", a form of cyberbullying. Even before the pandemic, UNICEF estimates that cyber violence affects almost half
of Filipino children aged 13 to 17. One third of these cases
involve verbal abuse over cell phones. Cyberbullying is so much more insidious than traditional bullying, because physical bullying happens in places like schools
during a particular time and only a particular group
of people saw it, but for cyberbullying,
you don't know where it goes. For three months now, eating and sleeping
have become harder for Maica. The constant harassment
has also affected her studies. You don't want
a major part of the young generation having mental problems because... unless you have a very robust system
of dealing with them, that condition is going to
persist for life, and people are living longer. The Filipino youths
are suffering in silence. Distance learning has only done
more harm than good. Returning to face-to-face schools
would help mitigate the negative impact of a physical separation
between teachers and students. A pilot programme that would shift
its students back to the classroom has been approved by the president
only a month ago, but it will only take effect next month. For now, Filipino youths are forced
to endure their struggles with long-lasting consequences. We cannot continue
keeping our schools closed. Since the pandemic began
early last year, youth unemployment in the country
has swelled to 31.6%. That's about 1 in 6 young people
currently unemployed, and 19-year-old Juriel Natividad
is one of them. He can't find a proper job to help ease
the family's financial burden. He also can't go back to school because the family is just too poor
to support his university education. One way to help people like him is to encourage companies
to hire young workers. Something that we could look into is, for example, employer subsidies. Other countries in Europe that have persistently high levels
of youth unemployment, for example, Spain or Italy, have experimented with programmes
such as employer subsidies for those hiring youth workers. I don't think we have
that sort of programme right now, but that's something
that we should definitely look into. But that can only be done
once the economy, which has been severely battered
by the pandemic, is back on track. Before the onset
of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Philippines was poised
to become the next Asian tiger economy. It posted an average growth
of more than 6% annually for 9 years, but its economy is now faltering, and it would take years to recover
to pre-pandemic growth levels. That has put limits
on the government's capacity to deal with
the crisis of this magnitude while the children suffer. The issue really is our capacity to deal with the problem. People are saying that at this stage, it no longer makes sense to differentiate between
natural and political calamities. They're the same now. The damage of natural calamities depends on the capacity
of the people in authority to deal with them. Unless the children are educated, there is no hope for them
to improve their standing in life. There have been growing calls
from many quarters, including the UN Children's Fund, for schools to be reopened
and in-person learning to be resumed. The concern is prolonged closure
would further exacerbate the education crisis in the country, leading to more school dropouts
and youth unemployment. 47-year-old Dionisio Damiar's
biggest worry is his 10-year-old, Jane. Jane had to drop out of school
in her first grade, when she had only begun
to read and write. Eldest sister Judith is barely coping
with distance learning and has little time to spare
to tutor her sister, while dad Dionisio and mum Rowena
are undereducated themselves and are incapable
of guiding their child. Nowadays, Jane is helping her mum
at a small store while taking care of the family's newborn
at the same time. She has already missed
two years of learning. Young dropouts like her
are highly likely to stay out of school for the rest of their lives, and Jane would become
a permanent liability to her family and the country
if it stays that way. We have a young population. They will be taking their place
in the labour force. They will be able to be productive. Therefore, they will be able
to support the ageing population. But that is true only if that younger generation
is prepared to address the tasks
of the employment market, and without education, that ability is going to be
severely limited. Having dropouts is a significant issue. I'm not belittling
the importance of that problem, but you've got to take it
in the context of your responsibility for the larger population
that is also at risk, because if you don't do a good job
with the 26 million, they're going to be dropouts, and you'll have
that segment of the population becoming an even bigger drag
on the society. Saving the children's future
requires investment and innovation. The city of Navotas
has one of the lowest dropout rates and highest re-enrolment rates
in the country. It invested US$2.3 million
this school year so that learners like eight-year-old Brian
would be supplied with what he needs, like mobile phones,
prepaid credits and school supplies. Volunteers are also being mobilised
to help tutor students like him at least once a week. We're going to have to go in
what has been, for the country, the default position. We're going to have to rely, again,
on the private sector. We're going to have to rely
on NGOs and civil society organisations to supplement the ability
of the government to address these basic tasks. Even in the handling of the pandemic, it's really the private sector
that has taken a very strong lead in addressing the issues. Back in Manila city, an afternoon spent scavenging has only earned 12-year-old Jonathan
40 cents. It's barely enough
to buy a kilogram of rice. In this slum community, income, as well as help,
has dwindled. COVID-19 restrictions have prevented
outsiders from coming in to provide aid
to poor people like him. COVID-19 ravaged the gains
the Philippines had made in a decade, and the government's weak response
is failing its youth, leaving a generation and a country
unable to find its way. Captions: CaptionCube"

done to livelihood to jobs and there needs to be a more sustained response to this problem i think we need to dispel that notion that there isn't enough funding there is funding it's just not being

and which already had to deal with inequality and haves and have-nots how much worse has it got in your opinion thanks kamal as you point out south africa was facing dire economic inequalities uh prior to the impact of kovitz so we had we have one of the highest inequalities in terms of income and wealth our poverty levels more than one in two people were living below the poverty line one in four people with daily starvation and in addition to that our unemployment in terms of formal unemployment was uh 40 and that was in the first quarter of 2020 what we've seen since the impact of the formal lockdown from march is skyrocketing levels of poverty and unemployment in fact unemployment figures were released earlier this morning what we've seen is that the former labor market itself has shrunk so far more people are now dependent on on livelihoods that they can scrape through inco informal economic activity unfortunately as a result of the fact that there is such widespread poverty there are very few people who can support the informal economy and so you have a very negative cycle of poverty which reinforces poverty and then of course the formal sector of the economy that very small um elite formal sector um continues to to grow with the commodity export um so we've seen that sorry to interrupt isabelle do people have any it's a strange word to use here but hope is there any hope that things could start to improve return to the levels they were if not get better at least get them back on an even footing it's a really important question and i think on a day-to-day basis that hope that might have been there um start with increasingly shrinks what we saw at the beginning of lockdown was a really strong response by the state the rollout of cash transfers to people um and the hope that that would increase with time what we've seen is that fewer and fewer people are actually becoming eligible for the receipt of this and so as the unemployment grows and the impact of unemployment on um sort of family uh handouts and that kind of of indirect support increases people's hope is becoming um far less strong in terms of future recovery obviously you specialize in south africa and africa but i think the the the problems that the government faces there are replicated in many other places and the simple fact they've gone into recessions money is not being generated and the amount of government can do can long term it could end up being quite limited it is a really tough situation what we see within the sadiq region is that a lot of the income is generated by commodity exports that continues but the question is how much of that is retained by the state in terms of tax as opposed to being taken out and beneficiated by countries uh globally i think that uh for our region the global supply chain is really precarious so the exports of a number of goods um such as cut flowers for instance uh that affects people's livelihood the question is

Yen, zero. He owns Cafe 80s in one of the most popular districts in Manila. But the restaurant bar has been empty for almost four months because of the coronavirus pandemic. It's like a ghost bar. No income before this bar was packed. My staff has been here for six years, so it's very hard to tell them that we will be shutting down if nothing happens until December. It's a familiar scene all across the Philippines. Businesses are closing at a pace unseen in recent years. The Philippine government imposed one of the world's strongest, strictest lockdowns, which lasted from March till June. More than 50 million Filipinos were forced to stay at home in the entire region of Luzon. But the soaring number of coronavirus infections last month forced the government to announce another lockdown two weeks ago. We want to ensure the safety of our people. However, some sectors in our economy, especially the MSMEs, are barely surviving. The Philippine government admits it is forced to open the economy despite the growing number of coronavirus infections. That is because the country is now in one of its worst periods of recession in recent decades. Millions of Filipinos have lost their jobs and more communities are expected to sink deeper in poverty in the coming months. But there's evidence the impact may be worse than the government says. Polster's social weather station reports close to half of the 27.3 workforce have lost their jobs largely because of economic ripple effects and the closure of businesses. The government says it sees the economy rebounding in 2021 and 2022. Look at our situation here. We line up for hours just to go to work. We are under the sun and then we go to work only to end up getting paid half of our day rate. Although the outlook is bleak, government restrictions start easing again on Wednesday. Selected businesses are being allowed to open for two weeks. Joey is preparing to reopen the restaurant. He hopes that better days are here again. Jemela Alindogan, Al Jazeera, Manila."

25,oChS6LbuluU,,"Filipinos are urged to mask up once again as the start of the holiday season sees a rise in the Philippines COVID cases. Rafael Bosano reports. Based on the Philippine Health Department's data, COVID-19 infection still persists. In the past couple of weeks, there has been a gradual increase in the number of infections. The rise in infections are believed to be driven by EG.5, a variant of interest circulating in the country, and more people attending to social gatherings during the holidays. This variant of interest has been reported in almost 90 countries. We have a double-digit daily average. Our daily average is less than 10. Three or four. Based on our experience in previous years, during December, Christmas season, holidays, there are a lot of gatherings. That's why we saw the S. In Metro Manila, Quezon City has already raised the red warning status after the number of average daily cases doubled. The villages of Bagong Pagasa, Bahaitoro, Bagong Silangan, and Batasan Hills are the areas identified as having a high number of infections. Based on 2020 census, these areas have a high population. A spike in COVID-19 cases has also been observed in the cities of Pasig and Manila. For infectious diseases specialist Dr. Ron G. Solante, while infections are trending upward, it's not enough to warrant reimposing COVID restrictions. The ability to cause severe COVID is really very low. It can be a cost circulation or could be a different number of viruses that will be causing this influenza-like illness. That includes COVID, but I don't think it will be a number that we will be concerned of in terms of we need lockdowns or a drastic measure. Experts are advising the public to mask up and follow minimum health protocols to avoid getting infected or raise the chance of getting sick. We're seeing now that, I think, even with a very low number of cases, people are still wearing masks. And I think that will continue as long as we'll be reporting COVID. It's important. Surveillance is very important. That's something that will keep people aware. Oh, there's more. Oh, the Red Alert declared the case on city. Rafael Bosano, ABS-CBC News."

He spent weeks in hospital in a critical condition. And he says he spent his life savings, a few hundred dollars, on medicines. He's now without a job and despite reports a vaccine against coronavirus will be available early next year, he's not confident his family will get access to them. You know, I didn't even get any cash aid this entire time. So I don't even think a vaccine is something we'll get either. I just worry about my children. That's all I care about. The Salvadorans live in Payatas, one of the poorest communities in Manila, the center of the pandemic in the Philippines. There are some people here, however, who don't share Geruel's pessimism and are hopeful the vaccines will signal a return to normality. Our residents belong to the poorest sector of society. We, the government workers, are looking forward to this vaccine, hoping we'll be made a priority. The government aims to vaccinate at least 60 percent of the country's population in order to achieve herd immunity. But in an archipelago of more than 7,100 islands and a national budget that's barely enough, even officials here admit it won't be easy. For weeks now, countries around the world have been trying to secure deals to buy vaccines when they become available. Wealthier countries are bidding for a huge share of supplies, hoping to vaccinate their entire populations. But the United Nations says two-thirds of the global populations will not get enough. And many countries, including the Philippines, do not have the logistical support to establish an adequate vaccination program. They also don't have the capacity to produce their own vaccines. Officials here say they hope that by taking part in phase three trials and joining initiatives with other less developed countries, they may be able to procure enough doses. The priorities are our frontliners. The 50 percent that will be dedicated for the government will be given to the priority sectors, and particularly our health workers and our poor and vulnerable communities. While 50 percent that will be given to the private sector will also be given to their frontliners, low-income laborers to give fair access. In its ability to contain the virus in Southeast Asia over the past few months, the Philippines is seen as the worst performing country. And many here fear it will also find itself on the bottom of the list for the vaccine. Jemela Lindogan, Algezira, Manila."

To tell us more, John Eric Mendoza is reporting live. Eric? The Department of Health officer in charge, Maria Rosario Verherri, announced Tuesday that the Philippines recorded 81 XBB omicron subvariant of COVID-19. Verherri, in a press briefing, said this is based on a later sequence in the run over the Philippine Renome Center. Of the 81 cases, 70 were recovered. Eight are still ongoing isolation, while the rest of the three remaining cases are still being determined. The new XBB coronavirus subvariant is believed to be highly immune-invasive as people with antibodies against COVID-19 could still acquire it. The XBB is also said to cause the case search in Singapore. Verherri further said the symptoms, the XBB subvariant, is also similar to that of other omicron subvariants. Singapore Ministry of Health said there is no evidence that the subvariant caused no severe infections. In a related development, Verherri said the country likewise detected 193 XBC omicron subvariant in 11 regions. Of the 193 cases, the DOH officials said 176 were target recovered. Three remains on isolation, five are reported to have died, while the status of the remaining cases are yet to be determined. Verherri said the United Kingdom Health Security Agency is classifying XBC as a variant under monitoring of the investigation. Neil? Eric, I was reading the news earlier this morning and I know that this particular subvariant is a spread in Singapore. So what do we know so far about the XBB omicron subvariant? Is this more transmissible and what is the degree of effect of the vaccines and the booster against this subvariant? Yes, Neil, the XBB subvariant is said to be highly immune-invasive, that could still infect people with antibodies against COVID-19. However, there's no evidence that it leads to more severe infections of the present. But the Singapore experience pays surges due to the subvariant. As health experts noted, the health care facilities of the country is not yet overwhelmed. Neil? Eric, I'm also curious about the policy side of this story. Has DOH said anything about recommending the possibility of closing borders or maybe the possibility of implementing another lockdown? Yes, Neil, for that we would have to refer to President Bobong Wai-kos' previous pronouncements that it will not impose lockdowns due to the pandemic and it seems that these XBB subvariants will not rigor such measures because medical experts in Singapore said the XBB is not more serious than other omicrons of variants. And it's worth pointing out that Singapore lifted its mask mandate in August and now their government said that they're not ruling out the imposition of mask mandate indoors. As for the Philippine Department of Health, where Hera said the IATF does not yet see any indications to tighten the country's border inspections from travelers and she also emphasized that the country already has safeguards like the high number of Filipinos who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and the public behavior of wearing face masks among other contingent factors. Neil? Okay, that's John Eric Mendoza reporting live."

Matt Bunyi is taking a call from a prospective employer at a shipping company. Go ahead, go ahead. Yes, ship with Bunyi, sir. I've been interviewed one company and then after that, then another company came to me. That's today, I came there, the company which is I applied. This is the first time I have been standby with the nine months. Matt says he sends his resume to at least 20 companies each week. But he hasn't found any work. The story of Matt Bunyi is a story that is repeated a thousand times over. People here tell us there are more and more job applicants here desperate to find a job overseas. They tell us their situation has been worsened by the coronavirus pandemic. Keith Blancaflore and Darwin Evangelista work for agencies that recruit seafarers and they keep a waiting list. They say with so few jobs around, it's getting longer. The Philippines imposed one of the world's longest lockdowns when the pandemic broke out. But it led to one of the country's worst economic recessions in decades. Unemployment is now at 8.9 percent, its highest so far this year. Thousands of small and medium businesses have also shut down and communities dependent on tourism are facing the greatest difficulties. There will be an easing of restrictions. And with that, we hope that means an upstart on our economy again. We understand people are not going to agree to be locked down again. So with this reopening, we hope it will be a better Christmas for everyone. But some analysts say it's not that simple. Without putting more money and purchasing power in poor families, without more support for maximum-wage enterprises, I think it will be a long, slow recovery, at least until the end of next year. That will be early, perhaps even until 2023. Many Filipinos say they've always faced hardship. But the pandemic, coupled with the lack of government assistance, is making it worse.

The unprecedented move is to ensure the safety of traders. And the Philippines stock exchange is closed until further notice, while currency and bond trading, that too has been suspended. But the exchange is hoping to reopen on Thursday. Our global markets have slumped as the coronavirus spreads and the Philippines, well, it hasn't been exempt from any of that turmoil. Its benchmark index is down 20% for the month so far. That's the worst performance since 2008. Now this comes as half the country's population remains locked down, with the whole of Luzon placed under enhanced community quarantine. All those on the island must stay home and avoid unnecessary travel. Work and transport services have also been halted, although essential services are still operating. All international flights meantime to and from the island are going to stop from Friday. The Philippines has reported 140 COVID-19 cases and a dozen deaths. Buena Brunel joins us live now from Manila for more. Buena, the Philippines has declared a state of calamity just this past hour. What does this mean for the country? Well, the declaration will allow government expedited access to funds that will support the containment effort. That proclamation signed by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea says that those funds will likewise be used to provide basic necessities to the affected population. And this is in line with the messaging employed by Philippines Cabinet Secretary Carlo Nobreda during that Monday late night press conference after President Rodrigo Duterte addressed the nation when he said, trying to assuage the public's negative sentiments over the quarantine. He said that they could just treat this like a calamity. But of course, that is a bitter pill to swallow for many Filipinos. Now, the country experiences an average of 20 typhoons each year. So localities are very familiar with natural disasters that disrupts daily lives, lead to economic losses. But there has been concern over the staggered communication of these rules of the quarantine that has led to confusion and also susceptibility to misinformation. Local reports, for example, are saying that health workers were forced to walk long distances because of that lack of public transportation, same experience for business process, outsourcing industry workers because their operations remain amid this quarantine. The same experiences by some of the informal sector workers who were stranded and who were planning to go back to their provinces outside of Metro Manila. Of course, the government has since said that they will continue to review and consider revising those guidelines. For example, the government said it has partnered with a transportation organization to ferry stranded passengers. Likewise, the vice president said she will be providing transportation for health workers. But these nuances, realities on the ground seem to have not been anticipated. There's that criticism on the lack of foresight. So, Bonel, you mentioned there about this confusion. How have people been reacting to this enhanced community quarantine then? Well, there's been concern because this enhanced community quarantine will likewise be for the rest of the month. And the declaration of a state of calamity, according to the proclamation released Tuesday, was that it will last for six months unless lifted or extended. That means that the funds that will be tapped will likewise go to rehabilitation for those displaced in their jobs, for example, due to this month-long suspension of mass transportation, suspension of work as well. All right. Thanks for that update. Bonel, speaking to us from Manila."

great to be here thanks for having me melissa now you're in manila right now tell us a bit more about how it feels to be in the city well frankly it's tiring it's gotten tiring people are tired we are now in the third major lockdown and mind you we've been in some form of lockdown since march of last year when the pandemic began it's just that when the case loads stabilize then the government kind of loosens the restrictions a bit but we've always been under some form of community quarantine that's the catchphrase here and people are tired and especially because they don't see much of a new strategy or plan from the government on how to combat the pandemic and people are now getting desperate to get vaccinated of course to protect themselves and be able to go out and provide for their families and they're also desperate for government aid which doesn't cover everybody it just includes a segment of the population the poorer segment of the population and at twenty dollars per person it doesn't cover much honestly so it doesn't sound like a lot of people would rate the government highly when it comes to its performance combating the pandemic yes um well the the the general sentiment here is that the government has done quite poorly in addressing this pandemic it has hinged the approach to vaccination but there are too few shipments of vaccines coming in and those vaccines that are on hand well the rollout is rather slow because there aren't enough resources and manpower to be able to open new vaccination centers so people tend to crowd around whatever centers are available and then to add to all that are issues of politics and even corruption just the other day state auditors flagged 67 billion pesos or about 1.5 billion dollars worth of what they call deficient funds from the department of health basically what it means is these funds were either not spent or were spent but are not accounted for and they could have gone to the government's pandemic response effort it's a huge scandal here in the philippines now and the government has not been able to satisfactorily explain it now i want to talk about vaccines one of the things we've seen play out has been the struggle for developing countries to obtain vaccines good ones that work because we know that the chinese sino-vac and cynofarm once have lower efficacy rates what is the philippines using and has it been difficult to get them the huge bulk of vaccines available here is the sign of that one and like you said there is considerable hesitancy and reservation as to how effective they are especially since uh it's assumed that what's driving this current surge in new infections is that more virulent delta variant of the coronavirus uh just to illustrate that point some people delayed signing up for the job to wait for the more reputable brands like pfizer and moderna to come in and when they did come in people came out in droves and lined up causing considerable chaos in some vaccination centers so safe to say it's really hard to get a vaccine here you have to fall under certain categories either you're a health worker you're a frontline worker you're elderly or you are in firm otherwise you are not even qualified to sign up for the job yet and even when you do sign up for one you have to be you have to wait weeks or even months to get that call from your local government to go and line up sounds very very frustrating jc gotenga thank you so much for joining us you, the more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus has spread across the philippines

like you said there is considerable hesitancy and reservation as to how effective they are especially since uh it's assumed that what's driving this current surge in new infections is that more virulent delta variant of the coronavirus uh just to illustrate that point some people delayed signing up for the job to wait for the more reputable brands like pfizer and moderna to come in and when they did come in people came out in droves and lined up causing considerable chaos in some vaccination centers so safe to say it's really hard to get a vaccine here you have to fall under certain categories either you're a health worker you're a frontline worker you're elderly or you are in firm otherwise you are not even qualified to sign up for the job yet and even when you do sign up for one you have to be you have to wait weeks or even months to get that call from your local government to go and line up sounds very very frustrating jc gotenga thank you so much for joining us you
52,kn6DKdInYXk, there's been no let-up in the Philippines either seven more people have died taking the death toll their 278 there are also almost 130 new infections it's been two weeks since the main island of Luzon was placed under lockdown many are speculating that the enhanced community quarantine could be extended beyond the 12th of April president rodrigo duterte is meeting government officials right now and will address the nation later this evening Chery regalado joins us for more on this from Manila a cherry two weeks on we're nearly at the halfway mark of the lockdown in Luzon now as the quarantine helped to curb the spread of the virus well it's too early to tell if the thing in thus winning the war against forbid 19 this was the statement of health secretary Francisco bouquet of lead up to days ago he said it was too premature to say if they enhanced when acquiring or used to be q is significantly lowering the transmission of the virus within communities just today the health secretary stressed that's it's too early to determine if the e key in CQ should be lifted or extended beyond April 14 he cited the case of one city in China where the lockdown has not been completely lifted two months after it took effect but Interior Secretary Eduardo and you have a different thing he says extending the ec2 is not advisable as it would negatively impact the local economy the secretary adds that he is confident the government can lift the ec2 if everyone cooperates missing at home how a hospital's coping with it influx of cases well several hospitals in Metro Manila as early as last week have already closed their doors on Kubik 19 patients saying that they are already operating at full capacity loss we are also dealing with shortage of medical workers as hundreds of their doctors and nurses are already employed in many hospitals both private and public on hospitals are running out of heat and subtypes and they have been asking for donations as well two weeks ago private hospital sign a manifesto asking the Health Department to designate repair of Austin to look after with 19 cases they warned that the health care system will break down if Norris referendum hospitals can take care of the influx of the food bank in cases in response the government has already designated three public hospitals which are now being retrofitted and are transitioning to handle cope with making patient alright many thanks for that chair Gallardo speaking to us from Manila,"There's been no let up in the Philippines either. Seven more people have died, taking the death toll there to 78. There are also almost 130 new infections. It's been two weeks since the main island of Luzon was placed under lockdown. Many are speculating that the enhanced community quarantine could be extended beyond the 12th of April. President Rodrigo Duterte is meeting government officials right now and will address the nation later this evening. Aceri Regalado joins us for more on this from Manila. Aceri, two weeks on, we're nearly at the halfway mark of the lockdown in Luzon now. Has the quarantine helped to curb the spread of the virus? Well, it's too early to tell if the Philippines is winning the war against COVID-19. This was the statement of House Secretary Francisco Duque a few days ago. He said it was too premature to say if the enhanced community quarantine or PCQ is significantly lowering the transmission of the virus within communities. Just today, the health secretary stressed that it's too early to determine if the ECQ should be lifted or extended beyond April 14. He cited the case of Wuhan City in China, where the lockdown has not been completely lifted two months after it took effect. But Interior Secretary Eduardo Agnew has a different take. He says extending the ECQ is not advisable as it would negatively impact the local economy. The secretary adds that he is confident that the government can lift the ECQ if everyone cooperates by staying at home. How are hospitals coping with the influx of cases? Well, several hospitals in Metro Manila as early as last week have already closed their COVID-19 patients, saying that they are already operating on full capacity. Plus, they are also dealing with shortage of medical workers as hundreds of their doctors and nurses are already in quarantine. Many hospitals, both private and public hospitals, are running out of PPEs and supplies, and they have been asking for donations as well. Two weeks ago, private hospitals signed a manifesto asking the health department to designate referral hospitals to look after COVID-19 cases. They warned that the health care system will break down if no referral hospitals can take care of the influx of the COVID-19 cases. In response, the government has already designated three public hospitals which are now being retrofitted and are transitioning to handle COVID-19 patients. For the H.R.R., speaking to us from Manila."

They've accused the government of neglecting them, as hospitals come under more strain because of the Delta variant. Wearing protective medical gear, protesters gathered at the health department to demand more benefits. Today is the deadline set by President Rodrigo Duterte for the government to pay medical staff their risk allowances. But the government has said it needs more time. Nurses have threatened to resign and unions are warning of more strikes. The national tally of COVID-19 infections has breached 2 million. Some have not yet received the SRA, especially from the LGUs in remote areas. They promised to give it today, but until now, they haven't given it. We are really sorry for ourselves. The SRA should continue to give to the workers of the health department. No one should be elected. No one should be listened to. The virus is for everyone."
54,lczwrm68u6I, [Music] hi i'm femi okay i don't need to tell you how many countries around the world are struggling with the coronavirus today on the stream we focus on the philippines have a look here on my laptop covered 19 mortality rate by country in south east asia this is the philippines look at where that bar goes that line on the graph grows making the philippines the second highest in terms of covert 19 infections and casualties in southeast asia that is the graph this is what the surge looks like in reality we are going to be talking about the philippines and the situation there earlier we spoke to gyorgy engelbrecht from the international crisis group and this is what he told us so the philippines is not a stranger to disasters they can be natural or human-made hazards but kobe 19 is a different type of beast the virus does not only attack the fragile health system of the country the economy was hit as well showcasing the rifts between rich and poor meanwhile higher food prices are exerting an additional strain prospects for economic recovery are uncertain with presidential elections coming next year filipinos will also cast a vote on government's performance resilience in the communities remain strong but how long can this resilience last and its continuing challenges and an uncertain future that was one analyst perspective but what is yours you can join our conversation by jumping into the youtube comments section and asking our guests your questions so let's talk to the guests let's say hello dr pauline convocal hello doctor nice to see you hello ambassador hello emmeline as well welcome to the stream dr convocal introduce yourself to our international audience tell everybody who you are and what you do good day everyone thank you family for the introduction and also i'm dr pauline conwakar i'm the immediate past president of the philippine college of emergency medicine and i am an active clinician so i'm currently going on duty as an attending emergency physician in many hospitals here in the metro and two other hospitals in the region thanks for joining us hello ambassador welcome please introduce yourself to our global audience yes i'm jose mourinhos i'm the philippine ambassador to washington d.c welcome hello emily nice to have you tell everybody who you are what you do very important for today's conversation hi and thank you femi uh my name is emerilyne hill i'm the deputy director for research of amnesty international and i'm also a filipino lawyer welcome doctor i am looking at some pictures that you sent us from earlier on you were working earlier on today and i'm just looking at these two pictures what are we seeing here how do we know this is a surge okay so it has already been really declared that there's a surge so there were really sustained um spikes in the numbers we have we're seeing increased uh trends for the past three a month even and what you're seeing here are the tents um that for patients that are waiting to be taken inside the formal emergency department so this is part of the expansion of the capacity of our hospital to take in patients and they're waiting in line to vacant beds inside the hospital you're very kind because you've obviously protected the the identity of many of these people who are really suffering this doesn't even look like a hospital this looks like a temporary setup there are now field hospitals temporary hospitals in manila because doctor oh okay so um since we've been seeing surges and increasing trends obviously we can't take them all in so we just have to make do with uh whatever it is that we have so we have to put up tents increase our capacity by expanding space um adding more beds um even if this will be only in makeshift beds or even in wheelchairs so that i will still be able to attend to these patients outside our formal emergency departments emelina i'm really curious because we've all been in this global pandemic for over a year now but when when we use the phrase or the term surge that means something cause diff is different emilyn are you seeing something different in terms of your family your friends your relatives back at home definitely so as i said earlier i am a filipino lawyer i've been working as an international human rights lawyer for years but i am still very much a filipino lawyer and i have my family and my friends are still in the philippines and for the last few two weeks at least six friends of mine have passed away um because of kovid and this is really very that's not even counting um family members of friends so this is this is really concerning for me because again this is not about people who cannot afford um health care facilities but it's really now just a matter of people cannot access healthcare facilities because there is not enough to go around ambassador i want to bring you into the conversation but first i would like to play a little clip this is rosette liquette she's a hospital director and uh we just got this comment from her a little bit earlier so we can understand what is going on in hospitals particularly in manila have a listen have a look ambassador every hospital at the ncr especially the government hospitals they are now struggling we noted an increase in the number of cases just as we note that increase in the number of health workers being positive no in the past especially in the past since march ambassador who is running the covet 19 i would say the fight for covert 19 in the philippines who is in charge of that who is doing that practically down on the ground well the task force is actually headed by secretary carnitos galvez he's the one in charge and he's the one that i've been in touch with on a regular basis basically to help in procuring the vaccines coming from the united states i totally understand the situation in the philippines i know that it is really very critical and our health care system has uh is is really and it's a very critical stage right now and to me i i can really see that obviously the only solution or the light at the end of the tunnel that we've always been hearing are the vaccines and this is exactly what we're trying to do as far as we're concerned here in washington d.c uh talking to the pharmaceutical companies we've been in touch with them for more than a year now well almost a year actually and it's unfortunate that the supplies uh for for the vaccines especially coming from here has been very very tight and it's only recently that president biden approved vaccines to be made available for the world especially specifically the pfizer that can be exported now from the united states so this is really the work that we're doing here as far as the kovite 19 response is concerned our audience wants to speak to you uh ambassador and also doctor so i'm going to put this youtube comment to you this is from dr waterforos thank you for being part of the show dr furrows dr frost says my main concern is that for how long are we going to live like this is there any light at the end of the tunnel why isn't the who responding appropriately let me start with you doctor and then go to the ambassador for a response doctor light at the end of the tunnel what are you seeing are you seeing any light yeah i i have to agree with the ambassador that um indeed the vaccines is really the hope and the light at the end of the tunnel but we have to do something right now since we have a problem right now we have long queues there's crowding really in the emergency departments and it may be a grim picture of the current situation of the philippines and that vaccine serves as hope for all of us healthcare workers and the general public that um it may it may pull us out from the situation but currently the demand really and the crisis of the people really is that what must be done right now so all of those congestion all of those inadequacies in the field so they're really asking for help um on when where to seek help for access for the hospitals emeline go ahead did i jump in very quickly um because um indeed i agree with ambassador and agree with dr konbokar that vaccines are very important but um i think it's not it's only just one part of addressing this crisis this what's happening in the philippines now actually exposes the frailty of our health care system and how neglected our health care system has been for many many years and our sense always is that it has never been a framework by the philippine government and even with previous administrations it has never been um the healthcare system has never been seen from the lens as a human right as a right to health so um you you see facilities you see healthcare workers who are underpaid and who would rather go abroad to seek a better life to get paid better so vaccines is just one point but then emeline overall system let me let me bring this to you because this is really important this is something that that a conversation that is also happening on youtube so i want to bounce it off of you so sleeping panda says i'm concerned about the lack of adequate action by the government how filipino nurses are flocking to other developed countries because they're not getting adequately compensated in the philippines does that count as a human right definitely can you explain so um why are filipino some of them are actually many of them are my friends they're watching now friends who are in the united states working as nurses so i asked them to watch this show and many of them actually flee or go to the united states or here in london because they don't get adequate um they don't get adequately paid for their services for their skills in the philippines so in order to have a comfortable life in order to be able to pay for necessities in life they have to go somewhere else and that is definitely a lot of human rights rolled into one it does not only mean um an impact on the health care system in the philippines but it also goes to the human rights of the people who are not paid well so that they have to go to other countries in order to be paid well ambassador i have seen reports of the military you're talking about the task force the kobe task force in the philippines the military being accused of overstepping their power overstepping what they should be doing during a global pandemic how did you see those stories do you feel that there's any credibility to those stories and those complaints about the military well i'm not quite sure about what are they doing but i know that the the government is at least initially when they put on the lockdowns they needed to have obviously persons in authority to be able to implement that and the military was tasked to to be one of those in the front lines to be able to implement the laptops i think for a while it was successful but in the end obviously the the economy is starting to show with signs of of really becoming again critical a critical situation especially for the for the uh for those who work every day and they they are regular day wagers so so to speak uh just to uh just to uh uh mention some of the things that emilyn said i i agree that yes the healthcare care situation in the philippines is quite critical but of course no one ever foresaw a pandemic of this type that will ever happen during our time in this century and so the healthcare is now obviously suffering from that uh i i remember my brother who was the health secretary during the time of uh former president joseph estrada uh was one of those that pushed for universal care uh as one of the cornerstones of that administration and uh i think it has been recently passed and at the same time he was also one of those that pushed for generic medicine to be sold in the philippines you know medicines in the philippines are one of the most expensive ever and for a while the major pharmaceutical companies that we are now having to deal with right now especially coming from the united states have a very strong uh i would say they had quite a lot of power in the philippines that they could not get this pass through but again that was passed recently or at least not too long ago for generic medicines to be available and then to make it much cheaper for the majority of our people in the philippines dot i want to play this clip and this is this is a tragic story just one of many tragic stories coming out of manila over the last few weeks or so this is from angelo barrera who lost one of his parents to covet 19. he was searching for a hospital bed and he couldn't find one have a listen me and my family we've moved on or are trying to move on so we don't really entertain these thoughts anymore but you know maybe if we had a clear clear plan of action maybe we if we knew that hospitals were a bust um that you know we could have just relied on ourselves more rather than spend all that time five hours you know looking for a hospital to know a veil really doctor the way that angelo puts it is like if i if we'd only known hospitals were a bust it was like what was the point of spending five hours throwing our parent around manila what's the situation like now how do how do we address that because vaccines are not the immediate uh solution for that are they if i may just quickly um just say something since the universal healthcare was mentioned but sure the good ambassador that um indeed universal healthcare is very much really needed right now but um i believe that there can really be no true universal healthcare without emergency care so all of these things just um were exposed or highlighted by kobe so i agree that we were really not prepared nobody was prepared for kobe but it's just it just exposed so many inadequacies of the philippine healthcare system and we've never invested that much for decades so um emergency care is an integral part of universal healthcare and what was just manifested by by one of the those one of the uh the one who lost the parent is that in an ideal setting it should not be the patient or the patient's families who should be looking for hospitals to take them in so the system should have looked for a place for them all we need to do is just dial a number in an ideal setting and as easy as just a three-digit number to call where you can get advice or to go to but currently it's not really here in the philippines it's not we don't have a system yet um we're getting there but there's just so many numbers to remember and um they're left on their own um their own way looking through this maze of the metro and even in their own private uh cars because we don't have really an emergency medical services with competent emergency medical services staff so there's a long long way to go for the philippines so even before they leave their homes ideally should there should be already be a plan um where the nearest competent facility or any available bed for that matter so can i jump in there it can really be heartbreaking right evelyn got to build yes just to build on what um dr pauline convocat said um yes um totally um the implementation of universal health care and also the generic medicines act was a move was a step were steps forward in terms of um improving the health care system in the philippines but those are not enough and um i completely agree with dr convakar that um emergency care is um is a is a component an integral component of universal healthcare also in the philippines right now including people i know including family members of mine um an illness would still mean severe financial hardship so um this cannot be denied and um this we cannot um this is something that i'm still seeing until now in the philippines um i'm remembering what you said right at the beginning of our conversation which is the solution is going to be vaccines right it's not going to be a meat because i'm not sure where the beds are going going to come from uh dr confirkar showed us just from her shift earlier on today how people were just closely packed together in makeshift temporary hospitals so uh i'm just looking at and i want to share with our audience a picture of president duterte getting a vaccine which i believe was over a week ago i am wondering uh it was yesterday excuse me it was even sooner than i thought even more recent than i thought i'm i'm wondering ambassador what impact does that have seeing the president getting a vaccine what's that value well i i suppose most leaders all over the world that's one of the things that they do is to show that the vaccines are supposed to be safe and i i would like to assume that that is what the president of duterte was trying to show you know here in the united states we all know the success of their vaccine rollout obviously because of the resources that they have we are now seeing the numbers really go down dramatically and i understand from many states are beginning to open their economy because of the vaccine so i'm one of those that really truly believes that this is the only way out of this now it's very unfortunate that many countries all over the world including the philippines have very little access to these supplies because obviously countries the rich countries are the ones that are getting it and you mentioned something about the wh so we've been working with them through the covax facility that they set up and even then we still can't get uh enough of the supplies that we really needed it's coming in in trickles like for instance a pfizer that we've been working on for more than uh seven months now even before they were given the eoa uh it's only now that we were able to finish off the indemnity agreement that they required us to do so all of this we're all under the gun do you think ambassador let me let me just think out the outline do you think do you think the problem is because the philippines has a reputation for a corruption and lack of transparency so do you think that is part of the problem about now when you're in a crisis where you do need international help it might be a little bit on the slow side because of that reputation do you think those two things are connected no no well i'm not uh i don't think that that's the case because in our case for instance the wh i'm sorry the world bank and the adb are those that are uh ready to uh in fact they have uh standby uh credit for not only for the philippines but for many countries in asia including indonesia and they've kept and they're the ones that directly pay the pharmaceutical companies they have representatives here in washington dc we've had a couple of meetings with them they said we have the money for you but there are no vaccine supplies so it's really that is really the problem and and we're not the only ones that are suffering from this and that's why we have to depend on donations coming from other countries like china and also from uh from what i understand now israel is coming up and ready to help us and other uh smaller countries that have offered to help the philippines want to put one more thought into our conversation this one comes from christine cebilo who's a health and science reporter who is looking at now where do we go from here in the philippines how do we make sure fewer people are dying from covert 19. this is what she told us so with the philippines reaching one million copied 19 cases the medical societies and experts i interviewed all recommended basic epidemic response proper contact tracing expanded testing and strict isolation on top of weak implementation are the gaps in the health infrastructure another challenge is local government units are not used to align in response so the national government needs to guide them there are bright spots in some cities but we need consistency as simple as having the same contact tracing app and a centralized real-time dashboard on hospital occupancy which we still don't have either the government unifies its covered response or we wait for everyone to get vaccinated but with inefficient rollout and the limited vaccine supply that will likely take a while so dr convocat i'm also seeing questions on youtube where people are asking about vaccine hesitancy in the philippines so vaccinations are the answer to how do you reduce the number of deaths and and there's vaccine hesitancy what do you do as the medical profession to help people well okay we make them understand that really the vaccine is one way out of this pandemic um unfortunately really the vaccines um are not they're not coming in fast enough to for all of this spot for for most of our population to be vaccinated so um with regards to vaccine hesitancy i think the president having been vaccinated lately is a big optic it's a it's a good picture of um you know uh that the public may trust the vaccine and that um most of the healthcare workers are are are already vaccinated and they can speak for themselves as well on the trust for the vaccines but indeed it is really part of the problem of vaccination or the vaccine hesitancy that we need to understand that we need to make the public understand i'm just looking here my laptop to see how vaccinations are doing in southeast asia covered 19 vaccination race in asia at the top singapore this is this is uh doses administered per 100 of the population in selected asian countries singapore there is right at the top china a little bit further behind them and we have to go all the way down here to the philippines and then thailand is even lower so this is going to be an ongoing problem it's an ongoing challenge for people in the philippines dealing with the search right now dr convocal thank you so much ambassador appreciate you emilyn so much to talk about really thank you very much for helping us shine a light on the surge of covert 19 the case is there the casualties there and really what you need which are vaccinations a lot of them thank you so much for joining us on the stream and thank you youtube for being part of our conversation always appreciate you i will see you next time take care [Music] are we still on youtube no they know you, [Music] hi i'm femi okay i don't need to tell you how many countries around

overall system let me let me bring this to you because this is really important this is something that that a conversation that is also happening on youtube so i want to bounce it off of you so sleeping panda says i'm concerned about the lack of adequate action by the government how filipino nurses are flocking to other developed countries because they're not getting adequately compensated in the philippines does that count as a human right definitely can you explain so um why are filipino some of them are actually many of them are my friends they're watching now friends who are in the united states working as nurses so i asked them to watch this show and many of them actually flee or go to the united states or here in london because they don't get adequate um they don't get adequately paid for their services for their skills in the philippines so in order to have a comfortable life in order to be able to pay for necessities in life they have to go somewhere else and that is definitely a lot of human rights rolled into one it does not only mean um an impact on the health care system in the philippines but it also goes to the human rights of the people who are not paid well so that they have to go to other countries in order to be paid well ambassador i have seen reports of the military you're talking about the task force the kobe task force in the philippines the military being accused of overstepping their power overstepping what they should be doing during a global pandemic how did you see those stories do you feel that there's any credibility to those stories and those complaints about the military well i'm not quite sure about what are they doing but i know that the the government is at least initially when they put on the lockdowns they needed to have obviously persons in authority to be able to implement that and the military was tasked to to be one of those in the front lines to be able to implement the laptops i think for a while it was successful but in the end obviously the the economy is starting to show with signs of of really becoming again critical a critical situation especially for the for the uh for those who work every day and they they are regular day wagers so so to speak uh just to uh just to uh uh mention some of the things that emilyn said i i agree that yes the healthcare care situation in the philippines is quite critical but of course no one ever foresaw a pandemic of this type that will ever happen during our time in this century and so the healthcare is now obviously suffering from that uh i i remember my brother who was the health secretary during the time of uh former president joseph estrada uh was one of those that pushed for universal care uh as one of the cornerstones of that administration and uh i think it has been recently passed and at the same time he was also one of those that pushed for generic medicine to be sold in the philippines you know medicines in the philippines are one of the most expensive ever and for a while the major pharmaceutical companies that we are now having to deal with right now especially coming from the united states have a very strong uh i would say they had quite a lot of power in the philippines that they could not get this pass through but again that was passed recently or at least not too long ago for generic medicines to be available and then to make it much cheaper for the majority of our people in the philippines dot i want to play this clip and this is this is a tragic story just one of many tragic stories coming out of manila over the last few weeks or so this is from angelo barrera who lost one of his parents to covet 19. he was searching for a hospital bed and he couldn't find one have a listen me and my family we've moved on or are trying to move on so we don't really entertain these thoughts anymore but you know maybe if we had a clear clear plan of action maybe we if we knew that hospitals were a bust um that you know we could have just relied on ourselves more rather than spend all that time five hours you know looking for a hospital to know a veil really doctor the way that angelo puts it is like if i if we'd only known hospitals were a bust it was like what was the point of spending five hours throwing our parent around manila what's the situation like now how do how do we address that because vaccines are not the immediate uh solution for that are they if i may just quickly um just say something since the universal healthcare was mentioned but sure the good ambassador that um indeed universal healthcare is very much really needed right now but um i believe that there can really be no true universal healthcare without emergency care so all of these things just um were exposed or highlighted by kobe so i agree that we were really not prepared nobody was prepared for kobe but it's just it just exposed so many inadequacies of the philippine healthcare system and we've never invested that much for decades so um emergency care is an integral part of universal healthcare and what was just manifested by by one of the those one of the uh the one who lost the parent is that in an ideal setting it should not be the patient or the patient's families who should be looking for hospitals to take them in so the system should have looked for a place for them all we need to do is just dial a number in an ideal setting and as easy as just a three-digit number to call where you can get advice or to go to but currently it's not really here in the philippines it's not we don't have a system yet um we're getting there but there's just so many numbers to remember and um they're left on their own um their own way looking through this maze of the metro and even in their own private uh cars because we don't have really an emergency medical services with competent emergency medical services staff so there's a long long way to go for the philippines so even before they leave their homes ideally should there should be already be a plan um where the nearest competent facility or any available bed for that matter so can i jump in there it can really be heartbreaking right evelyn got to build yes just to build on what um dr pauline convocat said um yes um totally um the implementation of universal health care and also the generic medicines act was a move was a step were steps forward in terms of um improving the health care system in the philippines but those are not enough and um i completely agree with dr convakar that um emergency care is um is a is a component an integral component of universal healthcare also in the philippines right now including people i know including family members of mine um an illness would still mean severe financial hardship so um this cannot be denied and um this we cannot um this is something that i'm still seeing until now in the philippines um i'm remembering what you said right at the beginning of our conversation which is the solution is going to be vaccines right it's not going to be a meat because i'm not sure where the beds are going going to come from uh dr confirkar showed us just from her shift earlier on today how people were just closely packed together in makeshift temporary hospitals so uh i'm just looking at and i want to share with our audience a picture of president duterte getting a vaccine which i believe was over a week ago i am wondering uh it was yesterday excuse me it was even sooner than i thought even more recent than i thought i'm i'm wondering ambassador what impact does that have seeing the president getting a vaccine what's that value well i i suppose most leaders all over the world that's one of the things that they do is to show that the vaccines are supposed to be safe and i i would like to assume that that is what the president of duterte was trying to show you know here in the united states we all know the success of their vaccine rollout obviously because of the resources that they have we are now seeing the numbers really go down dramatically and i understand from many states are beginning to open their economy because of the vaccine so i'm one of those that really truly believes that this is the only way out of this now it's very unfortunate that many countries all over the world including the philippines have very little access to these supplies because obviously countries the rich countries are the ones that are getting it and you mentioned something about the wh so we've been working with them through the covax facility that they set up and even then we still can't get uh enough of the supplies that we really needed it's coming in in trickles like for instance a pfizer that we've been working on for more than uh seven months now even before they were given the eoa uh it's only now that we were able to finish off the indemnity agreement that they required us to do so all of this we're all under the gun do you think ambassador let me let me just think out the outline do you think do you think the problem is because the philippines has a reputation for a corruption and lack of transparency so do you think that is part of the problem about now when you're in a crisis where you do need international help it might be a little bit on the slow side because of that reputation do you think those two things are connected no no well i'm not uh i don't think that that's the case because in our case for instance the wh i'm sorry the world bank and the adb are those that are uh ready to uh in fact they have uh standby uh credit for not only for the philippines but for many countries in asia including indonesia and they've kept and they're the ones that directly pay the pharmaceutical companies they have representatives here in washington dc we've had a couple of meetings with them they said we have the money for you but there are no vaccine supplies so it's really that is really the problem and and we're not the only ones that are suffering from this and that's why we have to depend on donations coming from other countries like china and also from uh from what i understand now israel is coming up and ready to help us and other uh smaller countries that have offered to help the philippines want to put one more thought into our conversation this one comes from christine cebilo who's a health and science reporter who is looking at now where do we go from here in the philippines how do we make sure fewer people are dying from covert 19. this is what she told us so with the philippines reaching one million copied 19 cases the medical societies and experts i interviewed all recommended basic epidemic response proper contact tracing expanded testing and strict isolation on top of weak implementation are the gaps in the health infrastructure another challenge is local government units are not used to align in response so the national government needs to guide them there are bright spots in some cities but we need consistency as simple as having the same contact tracing app and a centralized real-time dashboard on hospital occupancy which we still don't have either the government unifies its covered response or we wait for everyone to get vaccinated but with inefficient rollout and the limited vaccine supply that will likely take a while so dr convocat i'm also seeing questions on youtube where people are asking about vaccine hesitancy in the philippines so vaccinations are the answer to how do you reduce the number of deaths and and there's vaccine hesitancy what do you do as the medical profession to help people well okay we make them understand that really the vaccine is one way out of this pandemic um unfortunately really the vaccines um are not they're not coming in fast enough to for all of this spot for for most of our population to be vaccinated so um with regards to vaccine hesitancy i think the president having been vaccinated lately is a big optic it's a it's a good picture of um you know uh that the public may trust the vaccine and that um most of the healthcare workers are are are already vaccinated and they can speak for themselves as well on the trust for the vaccines but indeed it is really part of the problem of vaccination or the vaccine hesitancy that we need to understand that we need to make the public understand i'm just looking here my laptop to see how vaccinations are doing in southeast asia covered 19 vaccination race in asia at the top singapore this is this is uh doses administered per 100 of the population in selected asian countries singapore there is right at the top china a little bit further behind them and we have to go all the way down here to the philippines and then thailand is even lower so this is going to be an ongoing problem it's an ongoing challenge for people in the philippines dealing with the search right now dr convocal thank you so much ambassador appreciate you emilyn so much to talk about really thank you very much for helping us shine a light on the surge of covert 19 the case is there the casualties there and really what you need which are vaccinations a lot of them thank you so much for joining us on the stream and thank you youtube for being part of our conversation always appreciate you i will see you next time take care [Music] are we still on youtube no they know you
55,FJEMcVK0MWI," Chinese authorities say they're investigating a viral pneumonia outbreak and there's speculation that it could be linked to a SARS virus that killed hundreds of people in 2003 a mysterious pneumonia has gripped China with scores hospitalized by the illness Chinese authorities first notified the World Health Organization on January 11th that they had discovered a novel coronavirus SARS Kove - and that it had already infected 41 people in the who Bay province that had caused one death due to the disease that it causes called Koba 19 On January 12 the who came out with a statement and they decided that pending more investigations there is no big threat and there is no need to impose any travel restrictions on China the next week saw cases appear from Thailand Japan all the way to Nepal in the USA On January 22nd the death toll in China was at 17 with more than 550 infections and finally on January 3rd Wuhan was placed under quarantine On January 30th the who declared Koba 19 a global emergency for all of these reasons I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern over the global outbreak of novel coronavirus the sobering fact is that it took 19 days to go from 41 cases to more than 7,000 bringing us to today March 22 2020 a total of three hundred six thousand cases thirteen thousand deaths and eighty six thousand recoveries in 181 countries 110 countries have reported confirmed cases of the total deaths and the UK is now eight de piel casamento PFF asada propagation reviews have we been able to eradicate the virus despite our best efforts we have therefore made the assessment that kovat 19 can be characterized as a pandemic earlier this year people were downplaying the seriousness of the virus saying that it couldn't compare to the 2009 swine flu or even the seasonal flu however a couple of months down the line it's alarming rate of growth and its impact everyday life are painting a very somber picture if history is to be believed this is far from over and we're looking at at least one year of getting it under control in the Philippines it seems like we have just begun what are the pyramid Ola for sick people sokovia die T the number of Filipinos testing positive for the corona virus is rising by the day horrid its second case of the disease and the country's first novel coronavirus related death community quarantine is hereby imposed entire of Metro Manila on January 30th the Department of Health announced the first case in the country on March 5 and 6 the fourth and fifth cases are confirmed on March 16 that number rose to 142 cases and then the next two days saw 50 more people added to that list as of March 22 we have 380 confirmed cases this is what makes the virus so frightening experts have said that the virus has a 2 to 14 days incubation period on average this means that it can take as long as 14 days for you to show symptoms finally realize that you're sick 80% of these cases are considered mild as we're so in the midst of it there seems to be a new study coming out about its transmission every day but it's safe to say that person-to-person contact is the main method of transmission tonight authorities confirm it is being spread from human to human but what does that actually mean well if you're sitting next to someone who has the infection and suddenly he sneezes coughs or spits they could potentially spray you at respiratory droplets that contain the virus unfortunately these droplets can also be found on a hand before reaching out for a handshake or on a surface that was touched not everyone has hit the same way by the disease the most at-risk being the elderly people would a compromised immunity system and anyone would prior health conditions that being said a lot of people can carry the virus only have mild symptoms and still infect other people wreaking havoc and potentially infecting people at risk the most vulnerable population are those actually aged 50 and above their cases are much worse they have comorbidities such as diabetes hypertension and as such also those patients in the younger age groups who have comorbidities are also greatly affected this is why people have been wearing protective masks hoarding alcohol and washing their hands all the time since its seen as the first way to avoid getting the virus washing your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds with soap not touching your eyes mouth and nose with dirty hands and covering your cough or droplets with a mask back to those numbers whatever official count is given at any point you can be sure that the actual number of cases is much higher since the only way to confirm if someone has coded 19 is to test them meaning if testing is slow the number of confirmations will be as well unless mass testing is carried out we will never truly know how many people are carrying the virus most experts are saying that you should take the number of cases you have in your country and multiply it by 10 unless mass testing is currently being done to have a more realistic figure whatever number you find will then continue to grow exponentially every day this will only get worse as the infection spread from Metro Manila to all the other provinces in the country where they might not be as well equipped it can reach that peak polska and seventy-five thousand unwitting microRNA infection South Korean Singapore focus on mass testing from the onset their number one priority was to test as many people as they could so that they could proceed to contact tracing meaning identifying every person that potentially came in contact with someone who had the disease and testing them as well this would then help their agencies identify hotspots places where a high concentration of people had the virus and control those areas as best they could forcing the confirmed cases to go to the hospitals and placing persons under investigation in home quarantine that's an ideal situation but even with that the infection continued spreading but is now doing so at a slower rate some of the have been coming in because of fever most of them have having cuffs and coats for the past couple of days already and some would go to the emergency room because of difficulty of breathing if you have the following symptoms make sure to contact the proper authorities [Music] while waiting for mass testing to be possible the other option is a lockdown and the Philippines is not the only place in the world where this is happening officials have suspended public transport outgoing flights to be cancelled and train service is shut down we're in travellers coming from the UK and Ireland have been banned from entering the United States and northern Italy locked down but unlike Asia Europe has open borders if a lockdown seems to be the most effective way as proven in China to flatten the curve the curve people refer to is basically a graph that shows how exponential the rate of infection can be if people are left to still go out to concerts use public transport or attend mass gatherings and the country already has a high rate of infected people then logically more people will get infected take the example of Italy they went from about 150 cases to 5,000 cases in only two weeks now if you lessen the number of people in a certain location tell them to stay away from each other and then eventually seclude them the virus will still spread however it'll do so at a much slower pace this is called social distancing basically staying away from other people and trying to stay home as much as possible experts say social distancing is a way to prevent spreading kovat 19 malignant supermarket pero Hangang cashier my de stanza Amba wat Kost America not only does this help reduce the rate of infection but it also allows the hospitals that are currently being flooded with cases to be able to accommodate people and help them recover before being flooded with another wave of patients the last thing we need is a choke point in the hospitals because the less people they can treat the more people will be getting sick and not getting the proper treatment possibly infecting other people and making the death toll rise because of a lack of beds and hospitals and the proper equipment to treat extreme cases of a particular kind of pneumonia this

of treatment regardless of where you are social distancing shouldn't practice as much as possible avoid going out the safest place right now is actually in your homes as lockdowns and travel bans become the norm worldwide from China to Spain Italy Germany Paris to New York there's more and more talk about the economic impact of this lockdown do not travel abroad do not go overseas in lockdown with us our g7 countries basically some of the most developed in the world now as the Philippines is a developing nation this becomes even more burdensome not only are we at risk of higher infection rates because of living conditions in lower-income communities but since a majority of the population needs to work daily to be able to afford housing food stopping work completely will create even more hardships for them [Music] at my hospital and Poggenpohl really sanitation is also a luxury that isn't found in most urban poor areas in the metro so the virus could spread in those communities even faster the lockdown was very abrupt like the complete shutdown of public transport and no one was really ready for it creating a confusing wave of panic from March 11th onwards note Allah Karim Allah coming bounnam kadamba every day the national government and LG News are starting to come out with solutions to help workers with no pay the casual workforce and people who not be able to afford the basics during this lockdown there even talks of a stimulus package we tapped will likewise to go to rehabilitation for those displaced in their jobs for example due to this month-long suspension of mass transportation suspension of work as well while waiting for longer-term solutions to be put in place by the national government I think there is hope and that's all of us we should support our LG use in communities in any way that we can every day the private sector is also starting to do its part the private sectors involvement will hopefully avoid businesses having to close and in turn not being able to pay their employees and just creating a vicious cycle that will take months if not years to recover from if we stop the spread of the virus now the economic impact will be less important so what can you do first stop the spread of fake news and don't add to the noise it might confuse people on this time of information fatigue only get your news from verified sources second practice proper hygiene wherever you are clean your hands constantly and properly avoid touching any unnecessary surfaces use soap water alcohols aerosols whatever you have at your disposal to try and stay as clean as possible third if you have to go out for food runs and to acquire basic amenities practice strict social distancing and inform the people around you to do the same finally understand that if you're at home and have access to food know that you are part of the privileged few to try and help out the less fortunate communities where you can we should all stay at home but that doesn't mean it'll be as easy or as simple for everyone else around you the lack of income and food for the urban poor would lead to widespread hunger and frustration I hope that video kind of helped just condense all the information that's coming out because it's it's crazy like each time we turn on the news now it is that's all we hear and rightly so you know it's a worldwide pandemic it's affecting each and every one of our lives in various ways but I'm a hundred percent sure of one thing is that after this the world will be a very very different place after this little spiel that I'm gonna do to you right now or to put a bunch of information in terms of how you can help and donate if you do have the capacity to donate please do so I think would be very useful we're also going to be putting a bunch of links in the description box below where you can try and get some more information on either organizations or nonprofits or just people in general who are trying to help and who need cash to do so if you want to kind of donate things for front liners for food and protective equipment to PPE for frontline front liners you can check out Rach Edie relief they've been doing this for a long long time gang leads it and she's been absolutely wonderful each time there's a crisis in the Philippines so she can be trusted a hundred percent there's one called PAGASA ph that go into communities and see how much people actually need and help them get the groceries or whatever they need for that week and i think that's really great and create this Manila does one as well we'll put their information in the bottom me because we're currently well I'm stuck in Australia because supporters of both Australia and the Philippines are currently closed so I don't know how long I'm gonna be staying here for those of you who are stuck like me and can't return to the Philippines I'm currently stuck in Australia both borders in both countries are closed there's one that was put up by liners I've been working with minders for a long long time called one voice for peanuts and it's great because you can actually donate through a credit card which is the only thing I can do because I can't do bank transfers or anything like that up as of the moment so I'll be doing the cash from this video if it makes anything to that to one voice for the peanuts if it doesn't I'll be also donating my personal cash to one voice through the peanuts as well because I think they will know exactly what to do with it what's important these times is you try to help out where you can and everyone should stay positive even though that's something that's very tough to do but that's one way to stay mentally healthy is just to be positive to be a voice of change to be helpful to your neighbors the community everyone who's around you and just not fall into this spiral of just negativity because it's never going to be putting you in a good place so if you're in a good space mentally then you're gonna be able to provide positive and affect positive change in other people and I think that is kind of like the purpose of you know being human it's being humane to other humans if that makes sense so thanks for watching I know it's kind of a gloomy video we're gonna be doing more cooking videos because we're all pretty much stuck at home so if you guys want to see any types of recipes or any way to be counter fifty and crafty let me know in the comments below and we get to work on those [Music]"," Chinese authorities say they're investigating a viral pneumonia outbreak and there's

place by the national government I think there is hope and that's all of us we should support our LG use in communities in any way that we can every day the private sector is also starting to do its part the private sectors involvement will hopefully avoid businesses having to close and in turn not being able to pay their employees and just creating a vicious cycle that will take months if not years to recover from if we stop the spread of the virus now the economic impact will be less important so what can you do first stop the spread of fake news and don't add to the noise it might confuse people on this time of information fatigue only get your news from verified sources second practice proper hygiene wherever you are clean your hands constantly and properly avoid touching any unnecessary surfaces use soap water alcohols aerosols whatever you have at your disposal to try and stay as clean as possible third if you have to go out for food runs and to acquire basic amenities practice strict social distancing and inform the people around you to do the same finally understand that if you're at home and have access to food know that you are part of the privileged few to try and help out the less fortunate communities where you can we should all stay at home but that doesn't mean it'll be as easy or as simple for everyone else around you the lack of income and food for the urban poor would lead to widespread hunger and frustration I hope that video kind of helped just condense all the information that's coming out because it's it's crazy like each time we turn on the news now it is that's all we hear and rightly so you know it's a worldwide pandemic it's affecting each and every one of our lives in various ways but I'm a hundred percent sure of one thing is that after this the world will be a very very different place after this little spiel that I'm gonna do to you right now or to put a bunch of information in terms of how you can help and donate if you do have the capacity to donate please do so I think would be very useful we're also going to be putting a bunch of links in the description box below where you can try and get some more information on either organizations or nonprofits or just people in general who are trying to help and who need cash to do so if you want to kind of donate things for front liners for food and protective equipment to PPE for frontline front liners you can check out Rach Edie relief they've been doing this for a long long time gang leads it and she's been absolutely wonderful each time there's a crisis in the Philippines so she can be trusted a hundred percent there's one called PAGASA ph that go into communities and see how much people actually need and help them get the groceries or whatever they need for that week and i think that's really great and create this Manila does one as well we'll put their information in the bottom me because we're currently well I'm stuck in Australia because supporters of both Australia and the Philippines are currently closed so I don't know how long I'm gonna be staying here for those of you who are stuck like me and can't return to the Philippines I'm currently stuck in Australia both borders in both countries are closed there's one that was put up by liners I've been working with minders for a long long time called one voice for peanuts and it's great because you can actually donate through a credit card which is the only thing I can do because I can't do bank transfers or anything like that up as of the moment so I'll be doing the cash from this video if it makes anything to that to one voice for the peanuts if it doesn't I'll be also donating my personal cash to one voice through the peanuts as well because I think they will know exactly what to do with it what's important these times is you try to help out where you can and everyone should stay positive even though that's something that's very tough to do but that's one way to stay mentally healthy is just to be positive to be a voice of change to be helpful to your neighbors the community everyone who's around you and just not fall into this spiral of just negativity because it's never going to be putting you in a good place so if you're in a good space mentally then you're gonna be able to provide positive and affect positive change in other people and I think that is kind of like the purpose of you know being human it's being humane to other humans if that makes sense so thanks for watching I know it's kind of a gloomy video we're gonna be doing more cooking videos because we're all pretty much stuck at home so if you guys want to see any types of recipes or any way to be counter fifty and crafty let me know in the comments below and we get to work on those [Music]"

59,ibWFsmcnefk, now let's go to the philippines where its central bank will meet on thursday it's unlikely to raise rates this week as the country looks to keep its economic recovery from the pandemic on track however the governor has been talking exclusively to my colleague karishma vazwani and world's inflation may replace kovid as the most pressing issue next year right now the inflation is elevated because of uh food prices and that's a result of the recent weather disturbances and of course partly also because of the international price of crude oil or oil rather which has of course affected the whole the whole world but other than that we so it's it's supply driven and so there's we feel that there's no need for monetary policy to to correct the current inflation and when you look ahead again to next year sir what are your main concerns about the philippines economy you you talk about the fact that it is recovering it's back on track but the pandemic has left deep scars on people's incomes as well as the economy by the second half of next year the covet 19 will will be behind us so the the most important uh issue at that time will be inflation still and of course unemployment i think the impact of the pro the profit 19 is on our our youth because they lost one one full year of studies but you know the youth are very resilient and so we can easily catch up on that you know the philippines has a very young population it's medium age is 25 so investment in infrastructure and investment in human capital i think those two items will be should be the concern of the next government,"Now let's go to the Philippines, where its central bank will meet on Thursday. It's unlikely to raise rates this week as the country looks to keep its economic recovery from the pandemic on track. However, the governor has been talking exclusively to my colleague, Karishma Vazwani, and world's inflation may replace Covid as the most pressing issue next year. Right now, the inflation is elevated because of the food prices, and that's a result of the recent weather disturbances, and of course, partly also because of the international price of crude oil, or oil rather, which has of course affected the whole world. But other than that, it's supply-driven, and so we feel that there's no need for monetary policy to correct the current inflation. And when you look ahead again to next year, sir, what are your main concerns about the Philippines economy? You talk about the fact that it is recovering, it's back on track, but the pandemic has left deep scars on people's incomes as well as the economy. By the second half of next year, the Covid-19 will be behind us. So the most important issue at that time will be inflation still, and of course, unemployment. I think the impact of the Covid-19 is on our youth because they lost one full year of studies, but the youth are very resilient, and so we can easily catch up on that. The Philippines has a very young population. Its median age is 25, so investment in infrastructure and investment in human capital. I think those two items should be the concern of the next government."

Now, the move is to curb the surge of cases which have risen from just three 10 days ago to 140 now. Under the new measures, all citizens must stay at home and avoid unnecessary travel. All work and transport services, they'll be suspended immediately, except for essential services. Now, the community quarantine began yesterday in Metro Manila, but there has been criticism over how it's been implemented, as Buena Brunel reports. We're here at one of the five major checkpoints of the Southern Police District of the regional capital, Metro Manila. And what we're seeing are enforcement challenges on the ground, including the lack of thermal scanners. So the required thermal checks are not being done. There's also the disproportionate ratio between manpower and the volume of private vehicles that need to be checked. You have to understand Metro Manila houses, the major commercial and business districts where the jobs are, and the surrounding areas are mostly residential with lower housing costs. So you can just imagine the number of both private and public vehicles that pass through hallways and other entry points to the regions like this. Now, there's also the perception that transportation will be limited due to the community quarantine. So passengers are forced to cram themselves in public utility vehicles, so they're also unable to comply with that one meter physical distance prescribed by the government. Of course, authorities are saying we're still at the initial stages of the quarantine, and therefore these logistical mishaps can still be sorted out. But without correcting these, it actually defeats the purpose of the community quarantine. Commuters, we've spoken to say it's been easy for public utility vehicles from outside Metro Manila to enter the region and pass through those border checkpoints. But they said it's been difficult to hail a ride if your route is just within the urban center. Authorities have warned public transport franchise folders that suspending their operations requires government approval, and doing so without that approval is tantamount to abandoning one's franchise. Now, if you can see these vehicles behind me, they're called jeepneys, a type of public transport in the Philippines. And some jeepney drivers, in an effort to abide by that social distancing advice of authorities, have found ways to limit the number of their passengers. The community quarantine on Metro Manila will end on April 14, and classes are suspended across the region until April 12. Buena Bernal, the CNA, Manila."

stopped and every passenger screened for signs of the coronavirus it's fine our temperature was taken both getting on and off the train everyone has a mask on I feel relieved it may look like a country grinding to a halt but this is China's response to a mass public health emergency one week after these drastic measures were introduced the numbers of infected still keep climbing up people are anxious they prefer to stay at home and not to go out on the streets or wear a mask when they go out on the streets this here is a major tourist destination usually this area is quite busy with people walking around having snacks sightseeing now people prefer staying at home nobody really knows whether the measures the government has taken will be able to contain the virus so people are taking their own measures of precaution and that means minimizing social contact as much as they can elsewhere a lack of basic necessities and information are eroding confidence in the authorities in

it happened during the Olympics here in July I take it as a wake-up call for us to take precautions against an outbreak like this especially towards the Olympics yes Japan is naive I think Japan should step up measures in South Korea the government is building a containment facility for those infected people here fear for their safety the governor and Minister should come here and try to find a point of compromise what are they doing bringing troops here are we in a battle this is such nonsense they're really creating a mood of fear in South Korea as in many other countries some residents feel the government's response to the crisis has lacked the apparent intensity and clarity of China's all right let's get some analysis on this story now we can speak to virologist Ian Jones from the University of Reading in England hi Ian good to have you here on DW I would ask you about the raft of measures that we've seen countries take to try to contain this outbreak multiple countries evacuating their citizens from affected areas we've seen China shutting down or locking down entire cities is this the right approach to stop this from spreading it's the right approach at the current time time will tell whether or not it's been effective in either stopping or slowing the progress of the virus I think as the numbers continue to rise it looks increasingly likely likely that this will become a pandemic and will eventually spread around the world we've seen as you said this is spreading and we see in first cases reported in the Philippines in India these are densely populated countries in how worrying is that you if we look at the efforts now to try to contain the spread yes it is worrying for two distinct reasons one is as you say these are very dense populations so the opportunity for transmission among people is much higher than it would be in a low population density country but in addition to that these are areas of the world which also have quite a hide burden of respiratory disease particularly things like TB and until the virus gets there we really don't know what to expect in terms of the severity of the infection in those target populations and you said this could become a pandemic how dangerous is this virus in comparison to other diseases other outbreaks we've seen like SARS in 2003 for example it certainly lost much less in serious than SARS the case fatality rate for SARS was around about 10 percent currently this is running around 2 percent that is still pretty high it would at that number it would be almost like the Spanish influenza at the early part of last century however if it's true that there are many more infected people than the confirmed cases then the actual fatality rate is somewhat lower than that and more like a seasonal influenza which perhaps could be coped with more easily by the existing health resources the World Health Organization is set to decide today whether they should declare this a global health emergency should they do so I mean what would that change or whether they should do so or not depends on them and the data that they have at hand which I don't have I would guess perhaps that on this occasion they didn't on the last occasion but on this occasion they will consider it a global health emergency there's been sufficient spread internationally I think and what that would do was just mobilize more resources with alerts barriers up country boundaries and maybe alert healthcare systems that they need to put mitigation processes in place all right Ian Jones speaking to us from the University

64,SLrKdYsNbSo,,"The Philippines logs its highest single-day increase in COVID-19 deaths. Health officials on Friday reported 401 additional fatalities, pushing the overall death toll past 14,500. More than 12,000 new COVID-19 infections were also reported. The Philippines now has over 178,000 active cases, the highest for any Southeast Asian country since the pandemic began. The government can opt for an MECQ after the ECQ. The important thing is although the reproduction is lower, the cases are still high. We're still averaging 5,000 cases a day in the NCR and the hospitals are full. When we relax to a JCQ, even the strict JCQ bubble is like the one implemented by the national government a few weeks ago. In the first nine days of April alone, over 93,000 new COVID-19 infections were recorded by the Philippine Health Department. While this is without a doubt high compared to monthly records in the past, the Okta Research Group continues to observe a decline in the reproduction number. On Friday, the group says the reproduction number has further slid to 1.24. But because laboratories which did not operate during the Holy Week break are back in business, remains fluid. What is clear, improvements have been observed since the national capital region and nearby provinces were placed under the most restrictive enhanced community quarantine. It may increase slightly. But as we can see, it will not increase far. I mean at worst, maybe it will increase to 1.3. There's a significant improvement in the reproduction number. We will not see this without an ECQ. It will only decrease to 1.24 in two weeks. Meanwhile, the Labor Department wants to hire some 5,000 contact tracers to strengthen the country's response against the COVID-19 surge. The Philippines is only able to trace around three close contacts per every confirmed case, far from the ideal ratio of one is to 30. Rafael Bosano, ABS-CB News."

Thirteen cities in Metro Manila are affected by variants of concern or the UK and South Africa variants. More than a hundred cases have been detected in Metro Manila, most in the country. Along with the NCR, five regions were found by the B.1.1.7 or UK variant. Three regies have B.1.351 or South Africa variant. In Zamboanga del Sur, their first case of the UK variant has been detected by a female returning OFW from Kuwait. In Baliwag, Bulacan, two relatives were found by the UK variant. They are not leaving the country. Based on reviews, variants of concern are not yet dominant or most cases in the country. Of the more than 4,000 samples, the VOCS saw only 7%. But the DOH warns that they are time to dominate. The number of cases will be 28 times. Of the 1.95 reproduction number of covid in the country, 195 could be infected with 100 covids. Now the name has reached the peak or best level of new cases in July 2020. According to the DOH today, 4,387 new covid cases. If we had only reported only the beginning of January around 1,000 pieces, it would have been average on average we were reporting 3,000 pieces a day. So what we were reporting in the first two weeks of March were 2.5 times higher than what we reported in January. In January, we are starting to rise. If it is not quick to act, it is possible to survive the peak in the year. This is an additional problem for hospitals, such as the Makati Hospital of 90% of the occupation. Metro Lipa Medical Center in Lipa, Batangas, is no longer able to receive covid patients. In the course of today's vaccination, do not expect this to stop the covid surge in Metro Manila. Unfortunately, that number that we're receiving will not be enough to make a significant effect on the numbers that we're seeing on the model. We probably will see some effect at about 30% of population. Octoatic suggestion, Metro Manila first prioritizing vaccinations where covid cases and the weighing areas are increasing. According to Octa, the case will slow down if LGUs continue to implement localized lockdowns, curfews and strict implementation of health protocols. Leigh Aldiz, GMA News."
69,hlh47Rfs6ZY,,"The Philippines is now at moderate risk case classification. We used to be high and critical risk but now it's just moderate. We show a negative 1-week and 2-week growth rate. Our average daily attack rate is still at high risk but he drops to 19.43 cases for every 100,000 individuals. Our National Health Systems capacity, total beds and ICU are both at low risk. We are really trying to get this decline towards this decline. So we're politically."

The last thing he wanted to add into the mix was COVID-19. But working as a nurse meant that was always going to be a possibility. I was afraid my family would get sick if I got sick because I had direct exposure to employees and patients who were COVID positive. His fears came true. He became a patient at the government hospital where he works. His father then tested positive for COVID-19 and his mother and grandmother showed symptoms. I'm a health worker, so I'm pretty sure I'm the one who brought the virus home. I blamed myself at the time. Almost 6,500 nurses in the Philippines have contracted coronavirus. In the United States, a report last September said a third of 200 nurses there who died of COVID-19 were Filipino. Yet many Filipinos still choose to work overseas. Filipino nurses are some of the most in demand in the world, but here in the Philippines, they're overworked, they're underpaid and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, they've had to beg for the risk, pay and benefits. DJ was one of a handful of nurses who joined the May Day labor rights demonstrations. Not the first time nurses have taken to the streets to air their grievances. Our nurses and health workers are already exhausted, severely exhausted and we are demoralized because we feel that even though the government refer to us as the heroes in this pandemic, they do not really show genuine compassion and care to us. The difficulty of claiming COVID-19 benefits has weighed on DJ's mind. He could find work in another country, but that would mean leaving his family behind. Barnabillo Aljazeera, Manila."

Restrictions have since eased but the country's commission on population is warning that one unintended consequence will be a baby boom. Our correspondent in Manila, Howard Johnson explains. 41-year-old Rovalli from Baseco, Manila is expecting her tenth child, conceived shortly after the city went under lockdown. The pregnancy was unplanned, contraception wasn't used, and the father of the child has since left Rovalli. Even now that I'm pregnant, we sometimes only eat once or none at all on a day. It's really hard because even though you're hungry and you want to eat, you have no money. Rovalli's baby will be one of an estimated two million lockdown babies delivered next year, according to a recent study by the University of the Philippines. The country continues to have one of the highest fertility rates in Southeast Asia, despite a law eight years ago that provided state funding to make contraception more readily available. But even with continued opposition from the Catholic Church, the policy has been partially successful in bringing down the birth rate, but now experts are warning that those early gains will be all but wiped out. We will lose four years that we have been working on the program. We will have more unplanned pregnancies. Right now it's at a rate of three out of every 10 are unplanned. It could be as high as probably half of the pregnancies next year. So far in the bed as you can see. At Dr. Jose Fabeli, a hospital, Dr. Diana Cajipe inspects one of the world's busiest maternity wards. Before the Reproductive Health Act, up to 120 babies were born here every day, earning the hospital the title the baby factory. And we're seeing, as you said, four to two beds at the moment. What do you foresee when the baby boom hits? Well, during busy times, it can even reach five, six, seven patients in two beds put together. Five, six, seven per double bed? Yes, because the maximum capacity, bed capacity of this hospital is just 408. Just for this year, we reached more than 600. Back in Baseco, people scatter as a police patrol enters the area. They're looking for a drug dealer. One of the only ways to escape poverty, says Rovali. That's my number one worry, if I can still support their education. Sometimes when I get angry and lose my temper, I tell them, what if I just put them up for adoption for rich people so that they'll be able to have proper schooling? The pandemic has driven the Philippine economy into recession. And opportunities for those born at the bottom are bleaker than ever. Howard Johnson, BBC News, Manila."

This is Manila's Chinatown, bustling on almost any day of the year. But recent days have been anything but normal. Fear has gripped the city's Chinese community as the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread. The community itself has now become a target of discrimination. On Facebook, photos of Chinese businessmen distributing face masks were met with offensive comments. This one reads, you can keep those face masks, go home to China. Wan University was criticized for a memo requiring isolation for all its Chinese students, regardless of travel history. A number of Chinese schools, however, took it a step further by suspending classes altogether for two weeks. The feeling of the community is that we have exposure to those who are coming from China. And I think xenophobia in this case is not only coming from the Filipino community. It's also coming from the Filipino-Chinese community who are not treating the mainland people the same. And it's not just in the Philippines. Elsewhere in Asia, there are examples on social media of growing hostility against those with Chinese ethnicity. Leaders of the Chinese Filipino community, however, say the issue of racism has been blown out of proportion. They're not discriminating the Chinese, but what they are discriminating is the coronavirus now. If you tell them that, oh, these Filipinos came from Wuhan and he's coughing, even if he's Filipinos, would you take him? Community leaders and health department officials have nonetheless come together to address the allegations of racism and to find ways to help each other in preventing the further spread of the virus. As recently as last week, hundreds of tourists from China and even Wuhan, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak, were being allowed into the Philippines. That seems to have fed into the alarm we're seeing now. And to some extent, what many are saying is xenophobia. The Philippine government has also barred entry of foreigners with recent travel history to China and its autonomous regions. But with the country having been the first to record the death outside China, some worry the move may be too late. Barnaby Low, Al Jazeera, Manila."

They are Metro Manila, the province of Laguna and Cebu City, which have been classified by health authorities as areas with a high infection rate. These areas will be placed under what's known as Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine until the end of May. Quentin Bernal with the details. There will be varying degrees of restrictions in different areas of the Philippines. Areas will remain in some form of a so-called community quarantine, while restrictions will be eased in others. It is in the epicenter where restrictions are tightest, that is in the capital region, Metro Manila, and the same set of restrictions will apply on two other areas with high infection rates. That's in Cebu City in central Philippines and in Laguna province south of Manila. Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeres says a big chunk of cases in Cebu are enclosed institutions like jails with clusters of cases. Now current restrictions under the so-called Enhanced Community Quarantine in the capital region will largely remain after the current phase ends on May 15. What will happen after that is what is now called a Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine. That's from May 16 to May 31. And the main difference of that from the current measure in place is that the operation of selected manufacturing and processing plants up to a maximum of 50% of the workforce will be in place. There will also be limited transport for essential goods and services. In other words, there were added industries exempted to the strict stay-home rule in those areas with the most extreme form of the lockdown including Metro Manila. Now among those already exempted and will continue to be exempted from the stay-home rule are those working in the healthcare industry, the cargo and food delivery, groceries and pharmacies, garbage collection and funeral services, capital markets among others."

This is a time when we realize that these groups of professions we've undervalued, we actually really, really need them. But the question is, will they actually institute long-term change?"

The government had eased most restrictions ahead one of the busiest seasons, but experts warned there was no room for complacency. Starting December 19, we somehow had an alarm, an alert that there's already like a switch of trend, you know, and the increase in the positivity rate is very, very fast. And in terms of patterns, we see that most of the cases currently are asymptomatic and mild and they are coming from the 20s, 30s age group. So somehow, somehow we can correlate this, this kind of dynamics to mobility of people because of the holidays. More Omicron patients had been identified this week by the health department, while a traveler from the United States who tested positive had reached quarantine regulations in order to party. At least a dozen of her close contacts now have the virus. The Omicron variant is driving COVID-19 cases to record numbers in many countries. The Philippines has largely been spared, but daily infections are on the rise. And while it's possible the new virus variant is spreading, health department officials say it's too early to make that conclusion. A new wave of the virus is likely not only to strain the country's health care system. It could exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in regions still suffering from the impact of super typhoon rye. As it is, there are already outbreaks of diarrhea and gastroenteritis in those areas forced hit by the storm. We haven't received official report except for increase of cases in diarrhea, cough, and cold. But, but you know, cough and cold is among the symptoms closely monitored for COVID. There are no partition or division in the evacuation centers. So COVID is an airborne disease and such as that it can easily also spread. Workers hoped an increase in COVID-19 cases would be the last thing they would have to deal with as they're still struggling to provide basic needs like food and clean drinking water to the millions affected by the typhoon.
