0,aLZ85hb4wjE,Loved the calmness of Manilla.
1,aLZ85hb4wjE,"After this pandemic I think every country should have a lockdown every month to give mother nature a time to heal, with all the pollution that the earth is experiencing."
2,aLZ85hb4wjE,manila looks beautifull with less people
3,aLZ85hb4wjE,"The lockdown makes the city look like a place I want to explore.

Before the lockdown, it looked like a crowded mess filled with traffic and pollution."
4,aLZ85hb4wjE,India also same
5,aLZ85hb4wjE,"I went up the viewing spot at antipolo, its a very beautiful, almost smog free view of the metro skyline"
6,aLZ85hb4wjE,The president promised that he'll do his best to ease the traffic in the metro like 5mins of travel along EDSA. Fortunately it happened but unfortunately it wasn't in the ideal way. Nature's sense of humor tho.
7,aLZ85hb4wjE,The sad part is people around the world did not intend to heal earth but afraid of death.
8,aLZ85hb4wjE,i hope it stays like this forever its beautiful with no messy people
9,aLZ85hb4wjE,2020 is the year when nature fight back and reduce human emission dramatically.
10,sdsz-t540WI,The people of The Philippines are so smart and strong. They endure and work incredibly hard. Much love. Make use of online fundraising campaign sights. People will donate. 💯💗
11,sdsz-t540WI,"If you take out the paychecks of the government officials from the President down to the Barangay level, I bet  these people will be the first one to protest against lockdown."
12,sdsz-t540WI,hello sa mga classmates kong nanonood dahil sa documentary veiwing. buhay pa ba guys?
13,sdsz-t540WI,Bersyukurlah buat mereka yg punya kehidupan yg lebih baik. Kadang2 hidup perlu lihat ke bawah agar kita sentiasa bersyukur🤲🤲
14,sdsz-t540WI,Module brought me here 🤧🤦
15,sdsz-t540WI,"God is our only hope in times like these! I pray for y'all in need, the sick, disabled, y'all that have lost loved ones, may the lord and our saviour meet y'all    at point of need🙏."
16,sdsz-t540WI,"I thank God, me and my daughter still on job. We don't have much to worry. We never rent a house and pay water bill, just the electric bill."
17,sdsz-t540WI,Kaway sa mga pumunta dahil sa module
18,sdsz-t540WI,I’m curious with all of this going on why the Philippine peso is so strong against the dollar compared to before the pandemic. I would just assume that the patient would lose value based on the devastation to the economy. And yes the USA lost value as well I agree I’m just curious how this is all working out and why
19,sdsz-t540WI,Instead of focusing on the pandemic effect the govt is busy on the closure of a giant network.

33,DWxIvQlpJK8,DUCHEKWA.
34,E5F3xA_zkFc,"Many people were really hungry during the pandemic, they couldn't go to work, there was no salary, there was no way to eat, I cried in this documentary😭😭😭"
35,E5F3xA_zkFc,What's sad is that these are the same people who still vote for corrupt officials.
36,E5F3xA_zkFc,Very good documentary.
37,E5F3xA_zkFc,Very sad and disturbing.  My prayers are with all the people who are hungry and unemployed.
38,E5F3xA_zkFc,"Perfect docu , can't believe it's happening now, feels like it happened 20 yrs ago"
39,E5F3xA_zkFc,This is ridiculous! The country needs to open up to survive.
40,E5F3xA_zkFc,"As a Melbournian in Australia, I will not complain again after this."
41,E5F3xA_zkFc,"""Those who are just starting to get hungry can wait...."""
42,E5F3xA_zkFc,"Thank god i live in a defiant nation, when state ordered businesses to close down, people collectively showed them middle finger."
43,E5F3xA_zkFc,I can't fathom why the rich received any kind of aid.  Corruption is sky high in the Philippines.  May God right the wrong.

54,8dTelszbObM,Coronavirus: Death toll rises to 427: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eavggz1suMY
55,8dTelszbObM,There's always that one person that hides there sickness and risk a whole world.
56,8dTelszbObM,This sounds serious. Hope they get it under control.
57,8dTelszbObM,"You can't blame people for being cautious. Especially now when there's no vaccine, cure, etc. Only thing that helps is separation. It's nothing personal."
58,8dTelszbObM,"0:07 - 20,438 confirmed cases.  How long ago did you film this?"
59,8dTelszbObM,"My wife is from mainland China. Her friends are from mainland China. We live in California. My wife and her friends are stand away from places they regularly go to that gave large numbers of Chinese. Classes in the evenings and weekends that have mostly Chinese students have less people showing up. Masks are sold out everywhere. Groups on WeChat are coordinating mask purchases from whatever places they find them online, even if expensive. 

I’m not as concerned but am respecting her wishes, I don’t want to cause her extra stress. 

The fear is real. 

You may think it unjustified but it’s not just people who aren’t Asian keeping their distance. Sure, some people are being idiots, especially those making comments around Asian people buy calling people racist and xenophobic doesn’t help. 

Do what you think is right for your family. Don’t let people shame you into not protecting yourself. 

At some point I expect someone to say something to my daughter who is mixed but looks Chinese but I’ve just told her people are scared and when people are scared they sometimes say mean things. It’s not as if she hasn’t heard Chinese people say racist things about other cultures. 

I make sure she knows racism exists and isn’t acceptable. 

To date she gets far more abuse from other Chinese because her Chinese isn’t as good as others. She has been bullied by people from South America in the past. 

To date, she has never told me about being bullied by westerners, she just gets the occasional mean comment which young girls seem to make to each other. 

Racists and mean people come from all races and religions. I’ve heard from the local Chinese community things like Mexicans are stupid, black people are scary, various things about Japanese so let’s not pretend many complaining about racism may also be racist, although they may not see it that way."
60,8dTelszbObM,"The quarantine didn't start until Jan 23rd. The doctor who recently died at age *34,* reported cases going back to December. This is probably worse than the media is reporting."
61,8dTelszbObM,I hope this Outbreak will come to an end! Be safe Everyone!
62,8dTelszbObM,I'm really disappointed with the director - General of the WHO. Every country has the right to ban travel to and from a country to protect it's citizens!!
63,8dTelszbObM,Leave it to the bbc to make this about racism

65,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"The poor gets poorer and the rich gets richer, that's how our country works... Even our farmers is not paid fairly..."
66,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"I became a Housemaid at the age of 13, so I can go to high school at night.  My parents had 9 children. I’ve experienced nothing but poverty in my childhood.  It was harder for us, the older children. I wondered, even at 4 years old, why children are considered as “blessings”, when we were all SUFFERING.  
There was no Pandemic in those days, but POVERTY was crippling us."
67,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,I was born and raised in Cebu Philippines in one of those slums. I have lived in Florida for 15 yrs now and I am so grateful to be able to help my family during these tough times. I bought my mom a duplex out in the country in 2016 so She is no longer living in the slums. It still feels like yesterday when we had to pawn Our clothes so we can buy food. I will never forget where I came from and will always be grateful for the blessings that come my way 🙏
68,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"10 children and 13 grandchildren. Sometimes you can influence how you live your life. We are a poor family too, but our lives are much better than a family with 10 children and 13 grandkids."
69,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,Stay strong Philippines. Love from Indonesia.
70,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"I work 12 to 13 hours a day at minimum. Sometimes I feel like complaining  but after watching this, somehow I feel grateful to have kept my job and be able to take care of my family."
71,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"Even without the pandemic.. many of Filipinos have been starving, and  unemployed"
72,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"Even without the pandemic.. many of Filipinos have been starving, and  unemployed. They also said here that ""Hindi kami natakot mamatay sa COVID, takot kami na mamatay sa gutom"" ""Walang nakakagmot sa gutom, patay ka."" and I think that's the most painful statements i heard in this video. Many filipinos experienced hunger amid the lockdown. In fact, the hunger incidence rate is at its highest in 6 years according to the social weather station. I can say that Filipinos don't easily give up in the situation and they are still helping through good and bad times."
73,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,Dont be ashamed any of you.  This is not your fault.  Keep fighting to stay alive and.never give up hope no matter what you have to do.  CANADA is with you.

85,587N9bJ5J5k,"If you look at the lower income quarters, a lot of these settlements have significant overcrowding and unacceptable environmental hygiene; it just adds to the spread and these environments are a breeding ground for disease.  The situation is very similar to the Brazilian Favelas.  Many of their outdoor marketplaces are also a breeding ground for disease without proper safe food storage.

Many people in the Philippines can't afford private hospitals and don't have health insurance."
86,587N9bJ5J5k,"lockdowns aren't going to deter highly social cultures. At least, not in a way Philippine infrastructure will be able to deal with."
87,587N9bJ5J5k,God bless you all
88,587N9bJ5J5k,the philippines still managed NOT  to be like india and indonesia until now despite having the most densed population in the world.. hoping it will not get worse this time 🙏🏽

90,587N9bJ5J5k,God blessed
91,587N9bJ5J5k,Public hospitals in Philippines are risky at best. Full of caring staff but...

95,nTUWK8vufOk,"As a Filipino student, online class is frustrating because our internet here sucks."
96,nTUWK8vufOk,I hope the family was paid for being interviewed. They need support more than ever.
97,nTUWK8vufOk,nothing is more heartbreaking than children forced to grow up before there time...
98,nTUWK8vufOk,"The problem in the Philippines is that there are many less privileged, challenged people. The government officials and local government unit can be corrupt and don’t do their assigned jobs properly(not saying all of them but some or maybe most of them). The less privileged people and some teens just makes more babies and say having an accidental baby is a “blessing”. It is only a blessing if it was planned and both couple/parents are ready to have their own family. That is why many people are suffering from poverty because many people do not plan making their family. Then they blame everything to the government and if there are people doing better than them they want to pull others down. #crabmentality 🦀 I feel sorry for the challenged people but some of the people just make their own problems.

Didn’t comment here to debate. Just giving my opinion ✌🏻"
99,nTUWK8vufOk,"I was in the Philippines on a mission trip when Covid hit. After I was home in the US with my family, the worry I felt for the kids I'd met there was overwhelming. May God bless the Filipino people💙"
100,nTUWK8vufOk,"As a teacher in Malaysia I feel for these anak- anak . Be strong and be safe ,only education can change your life and your family , Praying for success from Malaysia ."
101,nTUWK8vufOk,"I am so glad that they also tackled the mental health of the youth right now. It is also one of the worst problems that the youth of the Philippines can experience. I know a lot of people in my classmates who suffer from depression, that is why, we must take actions to fight and solve this problem."
102,nTUWK8vufOk,I want to sponsor Johnathan and help him finish school.
103,nTUWK8vufOk,Ah bless jonathan he is so determined while my niece in the philippines her parents send her to a private school provided everything and now she did not finish school what a spoilt brat. I wish jonathan finish a degree someday he deserve to be help
104,nTUWK8vufOk,Poverty in the Philippines had been a long time issue even before pandemic. Children are those who suffer the most because of irresponsible people who only know how to make children even they knew that they are unable to feed themselves. Educate people about family planning🙏
105,lw16DeB6zns,"To people asking why is there a discussion about South Africa, please back to 2:29. The reporter CLEARLY says ""We will now EXPAND this discussion..."" Meaning the topic will also be discussed using other countries' experiences. Philippines was just the main feature or example. It's NOT clickbait. And there's nothing wrong with the editing. Hope this helped :)"
106,lw16DeB6zns,Great insightful report from the reporter.
107,lw16DeB6zns,"They switched because they want to put the philippines as a title because they know they will get more views if the title has the word ""philippines"" on it"
108,lw16DeB6zns,Complete Lockdown is not a solution. Government must try smart lockdown and allow those people who are earning on daily bases. May Allah bless all the people Ameen
109,lw16DeB6zns,Philippines and then South Africa?
110,lw16DeB6zns,"Tthis was really confusing, plss fix ur news well next time,..."
111,lw16DeB6zns,its kinda cute to read angry Pinoy comments
112,lw16DeB6zns,Huh why South Africa? This was regarding the Philippines..the interview is irrelevant
113,lw16DeB6zns,Philippines shouldn't use lockdown...because many of them earn daily not monthly
114,lw16DeB6zns,I don't watch the video I only find information in comment section😊

118,cPVE7QGS7As,"Just because our neighbour Filipina increase their covid test testing does not mean they are the worst in South East Asia. For me I admire that they try to save their people the best they can and honest with the figure too. Better than countries who have huge problem with covid, denying that they have the problem. Sending our thought and prayer to Filipina people..from Malaysia. Keep fighting spirit alive. May god protect you all."

126,cPVE7QGS7As,We are reaching 50k test per day now that's why cases becomes high. What's important is fatality is low and high recoveries.

131,jEINZXA_ujo,The Phillipines seem to be more on the ball than the US. Good on ya. Keep it up and good luck.:-)
132,jEINZXA_ujo,People here in the comment section are getting smarter and smarter that they debate useless things. People are dying you know... Shame on you

134,jEINZXA_ujo,I hope my family is okay 🙏🏻
135,jEINZXA_ujo,"here in the philippines our houses are just so close to each other, The virus here can spread with ease, it's a good thing president duterte declared the lockdown earlier, we would've been all infected by now if it wasn't for that."
136,jEINZXA_ujo,"We don't want to be another Italy,our country can't afford to accommodate all.I think this reporter didnt  emphasized a local produced test kits that will be used next week .our local scientist tried their best to invent new test kits for filipinos  ,since one test kits from other countries is very expensive.I salute our presidente for doing the right thing in order not to spread the virus in other neighboring provinces or islands."

138,SEHcakm-fAc,"Levels of lockdown/quarantine in the Philippines based on how strict it is:
6. EECQ - extreme/extensive enhanced community quarantine
5. ECQ - enhanced community quarantine
        a. LECQ - localized enhanced community quarantine - is only done on small areas of the city.
4. MECQ- modified enhanced community quarantine
3. GCQ - general community quarantine
2. MGCQ - modified general community quarantine
1. New Normal"

141,SEHcakm-fAc,"Success is dependent on the action or steps you take to achieve it. Show me a man who doesn't have an investment and I will tell you how soon he'll go broke. Investment is building a safe haven for the future: with the right choice of investment that has at least 1% minimum risk and with an Expert guidance, profit and interest should be 💯 guaranteed."
142,SEHcakm-fAc,Is it timely?
143,SEHcakm-fAc,"In other words, we've lost the game when we're almost complete and back to zero."
144,SEHcakm-fAc,"ADVICE: If you have covid and is having a hard time breathing. Do a ""Belly Breathing"" - the most efficient way to breathe (you can search it up online). This is exactly what I did when I was slowly losing air to breathe. I was having a hard time inhaling through my nose so I used my mouth. Your belly should come outward as you take in air. As you exhale, your stomach will come back in. If it's hard to breathe through your nose then use your mouth. If this makes your mouth dry then try to have a glass of water and maybe a little bucket beside you where you can rinse your mouth from time to time. If it's hard to breathe when you lay down then just sit. You need to practice until your body gets use to it. Put your hand in your stomach so you can monitor your breathing. ( I tried the one where you hold your breath for a couple of times and cough at the last try but it didn't work for me. It made it even more hard for me to breathe.)"
145,SEHcakm-fAc,Nice to know more about our covid situation in the phil.
146,SEHcakm-fAc,"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance-wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time"
147,SEHcakm-fAc,All those lockdowns do not do very well for the economy because people need to work to pay their bills and feed their family.

190,RhDHGgo4yZg,"Watching this makes me so grateful that I thought it my duty to help. For the past six months, I have been sending money to a family of seven. I am not a rich man but I thought I must do something to help. So I have been sending $125 pcm. I know this will be enough vegetables and rice to see them through. It will save them from starvation."
191,RhDHGgo4yZg,This is so sad and heartbreaking 🥺😢😔
192,RhDHGgo4yZg,This is so sad and to think that I always say I'm starving when I am provided with so much food. I feel ashamed
193,RhDHGgo4yZg,"It's amazing how money literally prevented people from being fed. In the old days, everyone in the tribe would work to feed everyone. Raising animals, growing crops and managing resources responsibly. I think the fact that there are non-profit organizations of volunteers proves that we have this innate desire to collaborate like we did in ancient times."
194,RhDHGgo4yZg,"The Catholic Church should also help the poor since Catholic Church is one of the biggest stock holders and investors of Philippine banking industry, food and beverage industry, mining industry, among others. They owned big expensive hospitals, schools and universities in Philippines. Catholic Church is a trillionaire."
195,RhDHGgo4yZg,"This is so heartbreaking, I want to help but I know that I can't"
196,RhDHGgo4yZg,"Mortality rate from COVID-19 is less than 5 percent (compared to SARs at 20 percent). Of the 5 percent mortality rate, 90 percent of deaths are people in the age bracket 80 years and above.
Is the health risk from COVID-19 worth the poverty, starvation, homelessness, domestic violence and loss of income that arises from consequent government efforts to contain the virus?"
197,RhDHGgo4yZg,God bless the Philippines 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭

Bully and the virus producer"
202,1psSvU1km0I,"As a foreigner who have lived in Ph for 4 years, I observe that: Wealth gap is a big problem in the Philippines; Many Filipinos have low income while the price of everything is too high."
203,1psSvU1km0I,Family planning is one of the main key to prevent poverty.
204,1psSvU1km0I,I'm from Phillipines neighbouring country. Seeing many Filipinos living in poverty makes me sad. Many Filipinos come to our country to get a better life but sadly our government cannot do anything about them since they are taking care of their own people. I hope Phillipines poverty rate may drop
205,1psSvU1km0I,The irony is that those in the poverty are the one who lacks family planning. You’ll notice they are the one with the huge family members.
206,1psSvU1km0I,India is same but 10x times large and worse than Phillipines
207,1psSvU1km0I,"As a Filipino myself. One of the weakest spots of my countrymen is that we are guilible, easily manipulated and are being exploited due to lack of education. Poverty is the driving force of these corruptions because they can control the poor by providing aid to them with malicious intent. Disinformation tru social media has led to many people electing skewed and incompetent politicians. As a result, it cascaded into substandard solutions and short term provisions which aggravated the poor even more. 

EDUCATION is a lengthy investment but I believe it will put an end to the never ending cycle of ignorance and the people being exploited by it."
208,1psSvU1km0I,its so hard too find jobs now in the PH... I'm Bachelor's degree holder and have different skill experience in many aspects but still they hire there relatives and friends in the company even they are not fully qualified instead of the one who is qualified...
209,1psSvU1km0I,"filipinos like to laugh about china, now look whos poorer, this world doesn't need people to insult others with their own nationalistic ideas."
210,1psSvU1km0I,Praying that the Philippines can overcome many of its problem and become a country of just for rich and for poor someday.
211,1psSvU1km0I,The Philippines has a lot of potential if the right decisions are made.

223,o1kPskxFkQ8,"Wag nang magsisihan, lahat tayo ay responsible  sa bawat isa. Hindi natin ito ginusto. May mga tao kasi na irresponsible  na hindi naka mask sa public places o sa kalsada. At sigurado yung hindi naka mask yung ang pinagmumulan ng virus. At hindi hinuhuli ng mga itinalagang magbantay. Sa loob ng mga baranggay pabaya sila. Dapat paglabas pa lang ng bahay ay hulihin na ang hindi naka mask.  Kaso hindi ginagawa. Kayat kahit anong stricto magpatupad sa mga main  roads kung sa loob ng barangay ay pabaya, useless din ang mga efforts ng gobyerno. Marami talaga matitigas ang ulo."
224,o1kPskxFkQ8,"They say, health is our wealth.
But how it'll become our wealth if we don't have proper self discipline?
Come to think of it, they implemented a two-week ECQ in mega manila, yes it was a big help to prevent the wide spread of the virus, for a while. But then, after the ECQ, kanya-kanya na naman tayong labas ng bahay and worst may gumagala pa, even though hindi naman reasonable or valid  yung dahilan natin. And here comes us criticizing the government on what should they do about the issue, when it is clearly evident that we also have faults and lapses. Also, the government should always need to hear the voices of those frontliners, especially the medical professionals and staffs, because they're the ones who know what and how to prevent and avoid the wide spread of the virus. 

Just to be clear, I'm just being neutral about the issue and I just want to express my opinion. Respect is all that matters. This is for educational purpose only, and its not really in my nature to talks anything about politics. 

P.s. if you want to advice me or something, I am open for it. Have a nice day! 🙂"
225,o1kPskxFkQ8,How are covid19 patients counted if hospitals are unwilling to accept suspected patients with covid? As my mother and I experienced where we toured the entire Gen. Trias until we get to the Manila Hospital where she is also not admitted without even passing the swab test.
226,o1kPskxFkQ8,I think the thumbnail is incorrect based on what he wants to imply.  Just saying.
227,o1kPskxFkQ8,"I may say that some people have  biased reasoning. While government officials are not experts on the pandemic, they are doing their best. Maybe not all, but most. Well, maybe not most, maybe some of them.  Regardless. They may not cover every facet of the strategic planning but people should also understand that it is also primarily a measure of each person's discipline.  Everyone is given a mind to think and the right to choose to do what's best for ourselves. Why blame all to the government when people are not doing their best to protect themselves? Government officials are humans, too.  They make mistakes, they get hurt, too. They get sick, they  get scared, too! They are not perfect, well so do we. Instead of blaming the government, why not do something to help them when it comes to the decisions they are making? We can start by reaching out. They have channels to do such. Why not help the government by helping others, too? At the end of the day, we should help each other instead of pulling others down by shooting their flaws or imperfections. Because believe it or not, everything gets better when we work together. So when do you plan to start? When do you plan to contribute for the good of your fellowmen?"
228,o1kPskxFkQ8,"There are a lot of things don't ad up here. In the last 5 months we have had just under 2000 deaths (an average of 400 per month), yet DOH figures show that in a normal year, before Covid, there are approximately 47,000 deaths per month from other causes, so why is it that the system cannot cope with a 1% rise in deaths. Is it incompetence, poor management and just plain panic, just as it is in other countries?"
229,o1kPskxFkQ8,Self-discipline lng guys😉
230,o1kPskxFkQ8,God bless president Duterte.

232,PP3Yu-ro1tA,"Death rate is much lower. Vaccinated cases are mild. No need to raise Alert Level or restrict businesses. Govt should pay nurses and subsidize more Covid beds, cancel military procurement and operations while concentrating on healthcare and vaccination."

237,PP3Yu-ro1tA,"If it's so scary, why is nobody dying from omicron?"
238,PP3Yu-ro1tA,Nothing to worry about this figure for as long as no case of death happen to any vaccinated individuals. I am just wondering why government is so alarmed by this development of covid cases! Would you now suggest again for another kind of vaccine at the expense of government money so politicians and profit oriented individuals  could amass more wealth?
239,PP3Yu-ro1tA,Kami dami positive sa amin 13 peeps huhu please pray
240,PP3Yu-ro1tA,Declare alert level 4 before it gets worst. This omicron variant has exceeded the delta variant and spreading like wildfire. Limit people movement and declare lock downs in places where incidence are high. Learn from what happened before and make drastic and decisive actions before it spreads further

“O Lord, hear my plea for justice. Listen to my cry for help. Pay attention to my prayer, for it comes from honest lips. Declare me innocent, for you see those who do right. You have tested my thoughts and examined my heart in the night. You have scrutinized me and found nothing wrong. I am determined not to sin in what I say. I have followed your commands, which keep me from following cruel and evil people. My steps have stayed on your path; I have not wavered from following you. I am praying to you because I know you will answer, O God. Bend down and listen as I pray. Show me your unfailing love in wonderful ways. By your mighty power you rescue those who seek refuge from their enemies. Guard me as you would guard your own eyes. Hide me in the shadow of your wings. Protect me from wicked people who attack me, from murderous enemies who surround me. They are without pity. Listen to their boasting! They track me down and surround me, watching for the chance to throw me to the ground. They are like hungry lions, eager to tear me apart— like young lions hiding in ambush. Arise, O Lord! Stand against them, and bring them to their knees! Rescue me from the wicked with your sword! By the power of your hand, O Lord, destroy those who look to this world for their reward. But satisfy the hunger of your treasured ones. May their children have plenty, leaving an inheritance for their descendants. Because I am righteous, I will see you. When I awake, I will see you face to face and be satisfied.” (Psalms‬ ‭17:1-15‬)

265,7SKGXkZKjV8,"Sadly, I just recently found out the student I was sponsoring could not answer simple math problems after starting face to face classes for grade 6. But saw that they passed grade 5 with high grades. I told them to tell me the truth, and they told me, they were using math apps on their tablets to answer math problems. They never solved the problems on their own. This is sad, because now, their math level is like the level of a grade 2 student. It is unfortunate that there is no way to place a check system wherein the teacher can find out if they are finding the answers elsewhere. Hence, it takes them a long time to answer each question."

311,xV1oR-RbOGU,"The Philippine government should be wise enough not to depend too much on China for COVID vaccines as the country does not have a good reputation for its clinical trials.  Even Brazil stopped the clinical trials of the CoronaVac produced by SinoVac Biotech on its people due to various serious side effects.  It would be better for the country to be talking to American, Australian, or European Pharmaceutical companies (e.g. Pfizer, BioNtech, Moderna, Astra-Zeneca) that follow strict regimen for clinical trials with emphasis on safety and effectiveness of COVID vaccines."

In other  countries like in Europe and USA giving second dose of vaccine even your a front liners or vulnerable there is a certain period of time or a gap of 3-4 months as there priorities at least majority of people have a chance to have a first job to be protected, while waiting for the volume of vaccine arrival! Meanwhile countries in Europe grapple with more infectious variants, a shortages of vaccine globally while the risk of dying in a road of pandemic! The important thing is the outweighs the risk..."

326,-qFcO_onBdA,"Here in Armenia no signs of improvement for now and the number of coronavirus cases is increasing fast. And in some neighboring countries situation is even worth. Looks scary. But it's still much better than in EU countries. Why everyone starts to move only now? It was much easier to prevent the pandemic in early 2020 when it was just appearing, but by that time WHO saw no major risks of its spreading all over the world and mainstream media were focused on showing news from China."
327,-qFcO_onBdA,I wish we have a lockdown in AZ
328,-qFcO_onBdA,So a possible imported case from Singapore.... what to make of it...
329,-qFcO_onBdA,Wrong report.
330,-qFcO_onBdA,She said 15 million
331,-qFcO_onBdA,Manila doesnt have 50million or even 15m thats way too much. 50million people is the number of population for the whole Luzon island. Before the community quarantine people dispersed to their home villages. Population of Manila right now might be 5m - 10m.
332,-qFcO_onBdA,"so if its about phil

346,fp9uRsmTWqg,Unemployment rate has never been under 20% in Philippines. Many Filipinos are under employed in temp jobs this is why so many Filipinos flee Philippines to work as OFW's. The best and brightest leave Philippines due to it's hopeless corrupt government.
347,fp9uRsmTWqg,"The unemployment rate is much higher if you consider the very low income people who are always ignored. Anyone who has friends, family or associates in the Philippines knows the truth."
348,fp9uRsmTWqg,In September the unemployment rate is really high because of 20k plus new cases a day but now the new cases is only 2k or 1k I think the unemployment rate will low because of lower restrictions in October or November.
349,fp9uRsmTWqg,That rate is muchhhhhh higher. Its getting worse
350,fp9uRsmTWqg,We should reduce the population from 113 million to just around 40 or 50 million
351,fp9uRsmTWqg,"Filipino everywhere in the world
[before c19]"
352,fp9uRsmTWqg,not just in the Philippines almost every country on earth has an unemployment problem
353,fp9uRsmTWqg,"And the vaccination rate in the Philippines is still low, when can they reopen their country. i feel bad for the people"
354,fp9uRsmTWqg,Conformity always leads to extreme poverty. Revolt creates liberty. See: The French Revolution.
355,fp9uRsmTWqg,no child policy for those below poverty and one child policy for those below median income.

365,rS15PX2GVbE,"Look what happened    now  regarding vaccine rollout  Metro Manila, Cebu City , Davao City  lang naka focus  and  it seems that the priority list is not followed thats why the WHO officials  is giving  warning  that the supply of vaccine to the country might be compromise. What about other areas they have also frontliners and  health workers  like Bacolod , Iloilo, Cebu Province, Baguio, Cagayan de oro etc etc."

368,sH_YoV-NA6s,I really appreciate those educators for doing extra work for the indigenous kids in Angeles Pampanga. They innovate their educational system to cope with this new normal system in the Philippines but it is too risky for the teachers also to the students to go outside because of COVID-19. I know that we are all adjusting but this kind of thing bringing the teachers and learners in unsafe point. Government should provide plans considering the safety of many people. LIFE is more important than education. READ IT AGAIN!

374,sH_YoV-NA6s,WION is a really great channel ❤️
375,sH_YoV-NA6s,"please like. for academic purposes

long before the pandemic started, gaps in philippine education system is pretty much the problem most specially in the remote areas. The pandemic only highlight its reality but goo thing we have such dedicated teachers who willingly do extra efforts just to help students to continue learning at midst of the situation we have. It's the teachers' personal money, time and effort that is being excerted in all of those teaching materials and activities making them a real life heroes."

378,zhBdbLj5y6A,"Good luck..Edited by Susan Sadoughi, MD, and André Sofair, MD, MPH

The director of China's National Health Commission said on Sunday that the incubation period for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is roughly 10–14 days — and the virus can be transmitted during that time, before symptoms appear. A U.S. infectious diseases expert said this means ""the infection is much more contagious than we originally thought,"" the New York Times reports."
379,zhBdbLj5y6A,It’s in India....game over
380,zhBdbLj5y6A,As a Pakistani i want my country and all other countries who aren't infected yet remain safe and those who are sadly infected will overcome this problem soon

420,57wz3HuIVLA,"Considering the population of the Philippines, i think its safer here than most of other nation hit by covid. And people here help each other."
421,57wz3HuIVLA,This is not the strictest lockdown since a lot of people can still go out.
422,57wz3HuIVLA,You are not accurate in reporting. Active cases is not million and correct your report. The guy is over acting.
423,57wz3HuIVLA,You interviewed the wrong person. You shouldn't ask a journalist regarding covid data.
424,57wz3HuIVLA,"JC PhP4000 is about USD80. And I think the vaccine rollout is quite efficient comparing it to other countries. 12M people have already been vaccinated, it's like jabbing a small country."
425,57wz3HuIVLA,"The person you interviewed was not giving an accurate story as it pertained to the vaccination rollout. The slow rollout is due to vaccine scarcity in the global supply (note that the country does not have any vaccine production, so all its vaccine supply is imported), and not on the lack of manpower or resource to open new vaccination centers, as indicated by your resource person. The huge droves of people that gathered to get vaccinated was observed only in some areas of the country where the local governments allowed people to show up without pre-registering, and that resulted in chaos."
426,57wz3HuIVLA,"we pray for philipines, love from your cousin indonesia"

429,kn6DKdInYXk,CNA's correspondent in the Philippines Cherry Regalado has got to be the worst CNA corresondent. Seriously. CNA should replace her.
430,kn6DKdInYXk,Module also brought me here can I ask what is the source of information of this video?
431,kn6DKdInYXk,God bless philippines and ASEAN
432,kn6DKdInYXk,god bless asean country
433,kn6DKdInYXk,What the hell is that lady saying
434,kn6DKdInYXk,UNSAY ANSWER ENGLISHHH GRADE 10 ONLYYY
435,kn6DKdInYXk,"The effect of enhanced community quaratine will be seen mid april or may, its still early to make conclusion. The situation is already bad. Family of rumored infected is being discriminated in the society, tons of problems in the issue of relief goods, people are afraid because they know they can die before even get tested, healthworkers are at risk and getting sick, urban places might drop in supply while rural places have over supply yet balancing it will pose a risk to the spread of infection. As the number of infected case rises and more people die it is better to extend ecq until may. People cant afford getting infected even if they are rich and thats the new mindset. Why not make news regarding countries that are panic buying ventilators."
436,kn6DKdInYXk,This CNN correspondent is the worst I’ve ever seen. Her English is nauseating!!
437,lbK7UjoLr8o,They are heroes .... they deserve more than that
438,lbK7UjoLr8o,Typical they want more money
439,lczwrm68u6I,Thanks for watching everyone. Tell us what you think in the comments below.
440,lczwrm68u6I,The best nurses I’ve ever seen were all Filipinas. Absolutely lovely people.
441,lczwrm68u6I,I wish my Filipino brothers and sisters good health and the best of luck. As an international student I socialised with plenty of Filipinos and they are GREAT people. Genuine love from Pakistan. ❤🇵🇰🇵🇭👋🏼
442,lczwrm68u6I,Stay stronger our beloved Filipino brothers and sisters. We Indonesia people always stand by you. God bless you all. ❤️❤️❤️
443,lczwrm68u6I,"Just exactly who gets adequately paid in the Philippines??? Dynastic politicians perhaps.  And there is NO safety net for workers in this situation, in fact very little workers rights in general at all."
444,lczwrm68u6I,"Stay strong Philippines.
Support from Tunisia"
445,lczwrm68u6I,Philippines is archipelagic country meaning it consist of 7000plus island as compare to India where  people move around easily by land. For people to come from one island to another you need to travel by boat or plane. While in India the infection is all over but in the Philippines it’s just main city.
446,lczwrm68u6I,WE LOVE PEOPLE IN PHILIPPINES STAY AND STRONG
447,lczwrm68u6I,My favorite country Philipines...iam sure you will win this battle soon..i pray for it🙏🙏 from Nepal 🇳🇵

459,j3E3NF9nk44,How are covid19 patients counted if hospitals are unwilling to accept suspected patients with covid? As my mother and I experienced where we toured the entire Gen. Trias until we get to the Manila Hospital where she is also not admitted without even passing the swab test.

483,ibWFsmcnefk,Great prediction from a economist. Inflation rate right now is beyond repair
484,ibWFsmcnefk,Honestly I don't think Covid is gonna be 100% over for a few years with how things are going
485,ibWFsmcnefk,The Philippines central bank has always been very safe in the way they set up and takes measures
486,ibWFsmcnefk,Why is it ok to keep drug prices high if there is inflation?  Because it has nothing to do with inflation.  It has to do with top 1% sending out lobbyists to make sure they don’t pay more taxes.  They must be sending lobbyists to news channels too.
487,ibWFsmcnefk,"I got a feeling when I see recovery from economic crisis, what is the recovery, is it earning sufficient money for certain period of time(calculated with normal earnings of the period) all of sudden economic crisis happens for many reasons though in straight forward lack of sufficient amount of money to maintain country sustainable growth and to met with global GDP levels I feel, due to inflation there were chances to meet treasury funds to normal may be there will be less inflation rate after recovery or if it continues there should be of funds left can invest other sectors of development."
488,ibWFsmcnefk,Why are even England's banks not rising interest rates? They are rock bottom and they even make it seem like such a bad thing to raise them to a level which is still so low historically.
489,ibWFsmcnefk,"I think inflation is worse in 1st world countries bec, in this holiday season, many want to spend but the goods are scarce due to supply chain issues. In 3rd world, spending is  not as much but inflation is more mangeable."
490,ibWFsmcnefk,"Yes may be a young population, but ten million of them are overseas working abroad, mass exports of labourers."
491,ibWFsmcnefk,"Someone once wrote ""I think we should keep using a failed system with resource mismanagement as its key component until we have a few incredibly rich deities and 99.9% of people live in absolute poverty..."", it was me, a few moments ago, and yet it was filtered..."

495,e0fN7HxkIUc,"Social distancing isn’t implemented well, this won’t be good."
496,e0fN7HxkIUc,the result of obsolete public transportation. Past 6 administrations are to be blamed but current situation is blamed on Duterte's government.

We don't struggle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, the authorities, the powers of this world’s darkness, and spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. But fear not, Jesus Christ has overcome the world. Only by the grace of God through Christ our Lord we can win this battle. Trust Him at all cost. He's coming very soon to rule and reign!

     If I may recall the video in March of this year of Naftali Bennett, the Defense Minister of Israel, that video stated that the people, the senior citizens are safe to get out of quarantine once  the immunity of the community reaches to 60 percent or better.  Thus, it is safe to say that the Defense Minister is correct.

682,LLFcBFAuauk,"I'm Filipino and I'm not that aware of what's happening in my country. After watching this video, I just realized how hard the lives of my fellow Filipinos. I'm not against with the government but I suppose this is not the best way to help them. Giving money is not enough, for many Filipinos, it'll not last for 3 days. I reckon, instead of giving money and putting the fund of the country in this way, why not arrange mass testing? Just try to test as many as possible so the virus will stop spreading. If that happens, the economy will be back to normal, more job opportunities again and each family can make enough money for a decent life."
683,LLFcBFAuauk,Stay strong Pakistan and Philippines from Indonesia ❤️
684,LLFcBFAuauk,All I have is respect for this country and its govt. for the help they are giving to their needy citizens.
685,LLFcBFAuauk,The money is never enough to help long term :( i just hope everyone the best during the continued pandemic.

My Mom who is a senior (65 years old) receives 500 pesos per month. Not much but its still a big help for us poor here in Manila. I just really hope that this pandemic will end soon. We closed all our small restaurants last year because of this."

On my computer came information today that stated that president Rodrigo had ordered on site shootings of those not content to take the vaccine excluding the health care workers, those exercising, y those purchase life's essentials. I do not know if this order is still currently in effect. That a secondary pig shot/vaccine could be administered usually is given to swine. My prayers are with you. I am a burned patient In a nursing home. One of your very own is my CNA. I have nothing but tip top quality when she at work near me. She is a sweet, dear soul, y also a Christian.

856,HabzHfgdMNs,WE NEED A CLOWN LEADER LIKE LENIE BECAUSE LAUGHTER IS THE BEST MEDICINE..
857,HabzHfgdMNs,"In Leni's 6 year term we never heard a word from her and now she shares so much plans to make Filipinos lives better.  Filipinos don't need jobs.  The Philippines has only 6.3% unemployment rate - one of the lowest in Asia.  What we need is to lower the cost of living which means we need to lower costs in food, energy and housing.  But of course this is something Leni cannot address since most of her financers are those who monopolize these industries."
858,HabzHfgdMNs,"may tanong ako I hope na may sasagot

bakit pa kailangang mag home quarantine ang mga ofw na may negative results?"

881,D7zMgv16cik,"A new study published on the preprint server bioRxiv assesses the antiviral activity of stenoparib against four severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs). This study also focuses on the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant by a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir.

The researchers of the current study also evaluated the inhibitory action of a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir against the Alpha variant. When combined, the drugs acted synergistically and plaque inhibition increased to over 90%

Since stenoparib inhibits a host protein, the antiviral activity of stenoparib should inhibit all variant strains. The current study explored the activity of stenoparib against four SARS-CoV-2 strains including the SARS-CoV-2 67 Germany/BavPat1/2020 wild-type strain (wt), as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma SARS-CoV-2 VOCs"
882,D7zMgv16cik,"Same high numbers in Los Angeles County, California. Yes, thats right:  same number of new cases in entire Philippine population of 107 million people and Los Angeles County population of 10 million. That is one of the many reasons I became a permanent resident of the Philippines!"
883,D7zMgv16cik,"Sa 21,819 ilan kaya dian ang fully vaccinated at non vaccinated. Sana ilabas din"
884,D7zMgv16cik,"So... no numbers on how many of those are vaccinated/un-vaccinated? You'd think it's a very important number to show the people if they want to continue to push the vaccine to people, no? But I guess it's not an important number because it's probably either majority of cases are vaccinated, or insignificant number of un-vaccinated cases ( because most are staying at home anyway)."
885,D7zMgv16cik,Simple. Don't panic and give in to scare tactics.
886,D7zMgv16cik,"OMG, dear God protect us please🙏"

902,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,"No need to hype on irrelevant data - always focus on daily reports on new cases, number of asymptomatic, number of recoveries and deaths since its more significant data for us."
903,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,How many people died? How many people recovered? Those are the important numbers. Just giving a tally of total cases so far is just fear mongering for clicks and views.
904,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Keep safe everyone. Sumunod sa mga patakaran na ipinatutupad.
905,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,"Pls Note: 1,840,294 ""Recovered"" of 2 Million Cases. Thanks. ... Stay clean & healthy 24/7 :)"
906,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,"ADVICE: If you have covid and is having a hard time breathing. Do a ""Belly Breathing"" - the most efficient way to breathe (you can search it up online). This is exactly what I did when I was slowly losing air to breathe. I was having a hard time inhaling through my nose so I used my mouth. Your belly should come outward as you take in air. As you exhale, your stomach will come back in. If it's hard to breathe through your nose then use your mouth. If this makes your mouth dry then try to have a glass of water and maybe a little bucket beside you where you can rinse your mouth from time to time. If it's hard to breathe when you lay down then just sit. You need to practice until your body gets use to it. Put your hand in your stomach so you can monitor your breathing. ( I tried the one where you hold your breath for a couple of times and cough at the last try but it didn't work for me. It made it even more hard for me to breathe.)"
907,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Given that covid-19 especially the delta variant is highly contagious as per CDC's. 2M is 2% of our population and thankfully I lot have recovered. I remember Germany's Merkel mentioned in her speech last year that they'd expect 70% of their population being infected as per expert's data. We are nowhere as rich as Germany but 2% is considered low basing on experts data.
908,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Woooh go on! Record Holder! Go Philippines!
909,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Get ready for the Mu variant. This is never ending

Pag kelangan mo ma admit sa ospital (non covid related) kahit boosted ka pa at wala kang symptoms, kelangan mo pa rin mag pa swab test including yung magbabantay sayo sa kwarto. Pagtapos nun, ang bantay di pwede umuwi or umalis ng ospital baka daw may makuhang covid sa labas, in short parang nasa detention cell ka. Pero yung mga nagtatrabaho sa ospital freely pwedeng umuwi o mamasyal at pumasok sa ospital. Kahit hindi sila i swab test kada pasok sa duty. In short. Do not comply and dont get jabbed.

Yung mga ofw galing Wuhan, ang tanong ko ay kinuhanan ba sila ng tests? Or kinuwarrantine lang sila ng 14 days? kapag may symptoms dun lang sila ite-test? at dahil wala naman symptoms ay pinakawalan na sila after 14 days. What if beyond 14 days lumabas ang symptoms??

1014,ZBO3c3ko0eg,"quarantine is a restriction on the movement of people and goods which is intended to prevent the spread of disease or pests. It is often used in connection to disease and illness, preventing the movement of those who may have been exposed to a communicable disease, but do not have a confirmed medical diagnosis"
1015,ZBO3c3ko0eg,Sana mahinto na ang kakaibang sakit na yan lage po tayo magdasal upang di na kakalat
1016,ZBO3c3ko0eg,Doh and lgu need to immediately address the concern of searching for an area in case there is a need to isolate positive or patient under monitoring. And have a separate health team to manage the health crisis
1017,ZBO3c3ko0eg,Report also those who are getting well upang to spread hope.

Yung sinasabi dito sa video na approved na ng DOH starting Dec22 ang shortened 3months period ay only sa media. Pero sa local govt, wala pa daw silang approved memo!! DOH, magaling lang kayo pumapel sa media! Gawin nyo naman ang trabaho nyo! Kulang kayo sa coordination sa LGU!!😡😡"

1042,tq7FyWSGaD4,"As of yesterday, the Philippines moved into a General Community Quarantine, which is a more relaxed version of the lockdown than the one described in the video. Asian Boss is the first foreign media to have interviewed such a high profile police officer in the Philippines, so hope this gives you the kind of perspective you wouldn’t be able to get from Western mainstream media."
1043,tq7FyWSGaD4,"he should have mentioned in the interview that one high ranked cop celebrated his birthday violating the same quarantine policies they impose upon people, whereas an old fisherman was detained by the cops for 12 days because he was looking for food for his kids and one guy had PTSD and was shot by a cop right on the checkpoint alleging the victim acted inappropriately..."
1044,tq7FyWSGaD4,okay now interview regular Filipinos and ask them how well the Philippine government is handling the current pandemic
1045,tq7FyWSGaD4,"I didn't know you can speak real fluent in Filipino, Marie!! You are so good at it! Who else is taken aback hearing Marie proficient in Tagalog?"

1047,tq7FyWSGaD4,I didn't know Marie can speak tagalog. Good job Asian boss!
1048,tq7FyWSGaD4,"Now, we need to hear from ""regular"" people to know the truth."
1049,tq7FyWSGaD4,This dude's eyebrows make him look like an angry supervillain...
1050,tq7FyWSGaD4,Thank you for Interviewing this police officer. Please interview Filipinos from various socioeconomic backgrounds to know what really is happening from the perspective of ordinary citizens.

Get tested:

If you have symptoms of COVID-19.
If you have been within six feet of someone for 15 minutes or more who has tested positive for Covid-19. (Note: some testing sites don’t offer testing if you’ve been exposed but don’t have symptoms.)"

1062,Bo24jIb7GA8,It seems people were suspicious of the daily tally of new cases.  An irrovacable resignation of Duque will bring back the trust to the health dept and system
1063,Bo24jIb7GA8,"Maging realistic na tayo. Hindi na kaya ma contain ang covid dito sa pilipinas. Ibahin nyo na ang taktika DOH at IATF. Imbis na puro community quarantine ang puro ginagawa nyo tapos mamimigay ng milyong milyong ayuda. Yung mga  ayuda na binibigay bakit hindi nyo idagdag na lang gamitin ang pera sa pagpapalakas ng health care system dito sa pinas, magtayo ng facilties na kaya ang hundreds to thousands na covid patient. Ibigay sa mga health care workers ang pangangailangan nila. Dagdagan ang pagbili ng bakuna. Hindi yung pinapataba nyo lang ang bulsa nyo samantalang milyon na tao ang nagdudusa."
1064,Bo24jIb7GA8,in contrary pala dapat pag tumataas ang   covid cases luwagan ang quarantine!
1065,Bo24jIb7GA8,Please be complete in your reporting.  Include if these patients are vaccinated or not.
1066,Bo24jIb7GA8,Paano hindi mag highest mga hospital kahit hindi covid positive patients ginagawang covid positive para wala daw babayaran sa hospital. Pls Phil. Gov't intervene.
1067,Bo24jIb7GA8,"Nothing new! DOH, OCTA and mainstream media are so much excited and seemed happy and amazed to tell the nation that covid cases are getting higher! Is this news really helping the economy! Is this giving helpful information to the people or more fear, anxiety, confusion , hardship, and hopelessness ??!"
1068,Bo24jIb7GA8,"Huwag kayo masyado padala ng emosyon dahil sa datus, bumilis ang testing capacity natin kaya ganyan.  Malay natin last year pa yan ang 20k per day, hindi nga lang natest.  What i mean, the data does not tell everything.  Kailagan lang natin mag-ingat, follow the protocols, be healthy, galaw2x din minsan.  Expose sa sunlight.  You see, ang mga media outlet na kagaya nito nananakot lang ito upang makuha ang atensyon natin at views para kikita sila ng malaki.  So just relax, be optimistic. huwag padala sa stress."
1069,Bo24jIb7GA8,WHAT ABOUT HOME SERVICE. CLEANING ?
1070,Bo24jIb7GA8,"always reporting the numbers ,maybe should report places in each province where one can receive vaccines and testing -then the numbers might go down"
1071,Bo24jIb7GA8,"The stats will go higher, as election is getting near... Hahahaha they need more money for their campaigns...

1072,29LXKUT0eMY,To flaten the curve just means to decline the number of new cases up to zero. When new cases become stable to 0 then the curve is flat.

Then syempre 1month lockdown yon tapos ako na bahala sa needs ng mga tao. Kase may pondo. Wala akong paki kung bumagsak ekonomiya ng pilipinas kasi ubos pondo dahil sa pagbibigay ng ayuda.

1096,sJ0xpruFAwQ,Congrats Philippines for getting the silver play button
1097,sJ0xpruFAwQ,Restrictions were not loosened in March! Maybe you meant May! Philippine total lockdown was March to May.

1119,glahrwdA2Co,Always take virgin coconut oil and malunggay in the Philippines. Malunggay or moringa is very nutritious plant nad has anti viral properties same as virgin coconut oil. Just google the health benefits of that two powerful foods. Stay safe and always bring alcohol at all times when you go outside.
1120,glahrwdA2Co,BTW...if you need anything for emergency anything like that..the best person to ask for help or assistance is the owner of your Hotel or the Barangay Chairman...plus most Filipinos are very helpful and very hospitable.....God Bless and be safe...

1124,glahrwdA2Co,Better to stay there guys safer than city.Stay safe and enjoy the island for a while.😊😊🇵🇭
1125,glahrwdA2Co,It’s hard to be in a city right now. I rather be in El Nido during lockdown then at home.
1126,glahrwdA2Co,Glad you guys are safe AND that you were able to find a more comfortable place to wait it out! A bit more space and natural sunlight makes the world of a difference. All the best from Canada!
1127,glahrwdA2Co,I think it was a very good choice and the safest.Good luck guy.

All i want to say that Jesus loves you no matter what you have sin before just seek Him, accept Him as your Savior and Father and lastly repent your sin to Jesus and ask Him your fully heart that you need Him every second of your life. I want to realized na you are beloved children of Him. Tayo lang ang gumagawa ng mga bagay na ikinasisira natin at tayo lang ang gumagawa ng mga dahilan para tayo ay mapalayo sa kaniya. Kagaya nalamang sa book of Genesis na una palang pinaalalahanan niya na sina Eba at Adan na huwag kakain ng ipinagbabawal na bunga. Ngunit sa Genesis 3:6 dahil sa curiosity ng babae na si Eba na sa isip-isip niya mukang masarap ang bunga at sa isip-isip niya okay lang naman ang maging marunong kaya hindi napigilan na kainin nila ang bunga na nagbibigay pagkamarunong. At dahil rin nagpatukso sila sa salita ng kaaway. Jesus loves us uulitin ko mahal tayo ng Diyos tayo lang ang gumagawa para mapalayo sa kaniya. Plsss repent and seek Him wth your fully heart and give you all to Him because the end is near at pasama na ng pasama itong mundong ito. Hindi ako nagsisinungaling dahil sa experience ko palang na ako'y binago niya and he completely restored me to become a new born child of Him. Godbless and I love you with the love of the Lord, Jesus Christ.💓☝️🙌😊"

And how many athletes/celebs/elites can you name right now that really died of covid?

Exactly"

1158,GUVKWAEO_hY,"here in PH, they are fast in administering vaccines but only while supply last. especially in the provinces, it takes weeks before a new batch of vaccines arrive. How can they administer vaccines if there is no supply."
1159,GUVKWAEO_hY,"The Filipina interviewee’s fear on general public being left behind is not true. The vaccines of the private companies have not come in yet (not that we know of), and the poor sector are being vaccinated now through the government’s procurement and donations. They’re not last to be vaccinated. Admittedly last to be vaccinated are those from far-flung provinces but they are not in immediate danger of the pandemic."
1160,GUVKWAEO_hY,"28:39 where the deck did you get that information from?? In Indonesia health workers and elderly are first and second priority to get vaccine hence why my dad  could get one in early March.
39:19 did you say fifty or fifteen?"
1161,GUVKWAEO_hY,You will get vaccinated here in the Philippines when you get registered on local government sites. Some places in the Philippines allow people to walk in and get vaccinated as long as they have registered online. It also depends on your local government or City.
1162,GUVKWAEO_hY,3rd world problem and the fact were both extremely populated countries. Godbless brothers and sisters in the Philippines and Indonesia. But same form of government there’s too much beaurucracy that complicates the management. We can get over this! 🇮🇩🇵🇭
1163,GUVKWAEO_hY,Thank you CNA for providing quality content day after day.
1164,GUVKWAEO_hY,"Philippines have been ramping up vaccination nowadays amidst the threat of delta variant. Schedule for vaccination has been consistent but people such as front liners, senior citizens and with pre-existing health conditions are given much priority. I just hope that we would have enough vaccines to give to all population since we need this so much to go back to our normal lives."
1165,GUVKWAEO_hY,PH vaccination process in local government are fast enough however the Supply is Erratic why lines are always building up.. Vaccination centers sometimes finished the allotted jabs for the day by lunchtime..
1166,GUVKWAEO_hY,"I was supposed to be vaccinated by the Moderna vaccine procured by our company. My brother was also waiting for his company's vaccine. I didn't mind waiting at first; however, the rising Delta cases made me paranoid. So we just decided to register last Friday. It's a good thing that the process in Manila was smooth. We just got our 1st dose of AstraZeneca today. My parents and sister who live in a province in Visayas already completed their 2 doses of Sinovac since May I think."
1167,GUVKWAEO_hY,You overlook Malaysia?
1168,rxfbTVjIGa0,Yan na yung preparation nila for Omicron. We all know the cases will skyrocket once it spread throughout the community.
1169,rxfbTVjIGa0,"The people have the right to know and to be informed about the trends of such significantly timely issues such as this pandemic.  For in one way or another such information is key as to how individuals and institutions will move and decide on things that will matter to their health, either individual health or general health.  Moreover is it not that this, the people's right to be informed about the things happening around them, does this hinge on the Constitutional Right to Information Access and Media? 

To not release daily social media updates about the pandemic is to keep the people in the dark. You will do them a huge disservice."
1170,rxfbTVjIGa0,How hard could it be to take a screenshot of the website every 4pm and have it posted on your social media pages for public information? Kahit ojt kaya naman gawin yan.

1178,GUVKWAEO_hY,"here in PH, they are fast in administering vaccines but only while supply last. especially in the provinces, it takes weeks before a new batch of vaccines arrive. How can they administer vaccines if there is no supply."
1179,GUVKWAEO_hY,"The Filipina interviewee’s fear on general public being left behind is not true. The vaccines of the private companies have not come in yet (not that we know of), and the poor sector are being vaccinated now through the government’s procurement and donations. They’re not last to be vaccinated. Admittedly last to be vaccinated are those from far-flung provinces but they are not in immediate danger of the pandemic."
1180,GUVKWAEO_hY,"28:39 where the deck did you get that information from?? In Indonesia health workers and elderly are first and second priority to get vaccine hence why my dad  could get one in early March.
39:19 did you say fifty or fifteen?"
1181,GUVKWAEO_hY,You will get vaccinated here in the Philippines when you get registered on local government sites. Some places in the Philippines allow people to walk in and get vaccinated as long as they have registered online. It also depends on your local government or City.
1182,GUVKWAEO_hY,3rd world problem and the fact were both extremely populated countries. Godbless brothers and sisters in the Philippines and Indonesia. But same form of government there’s too much beaurucracy that complicates the management. We can get over this! 🇮🇩🇵🇭

1206,aw59h2FNMIQ,may 2021
1207,aw59h2FNMIQ,Why is Russia going to conduct the clinical trial of its vaccine in the Philippines first? Why don't they do it first to their Russian citizens? And why the Philippine government is going to allow it here first?
1208,aw59h2FNMIQ,FDA of the Philippines how do you think about this?
1209,aw59h2FNMIQ,Sputnik five... Hmm interesting
1210,aw59h2FNMIQ,Good
1211,aw59h2FNMIQ,not a wise decision considering how silent Russia has been through the vaccine development process! Duterte's opportunistic approach may prove fatal

1224,nO6ieff7WAA,"I think it was to be expected as the capital city is very densely populated. Because they are testing thousands by the day, they will have more confirm cases. The advantage to more testing is they can isolate and treat the active cases and trace slowly but surely as many possible infections so to help treat them. I would rather know how bad the infection is than not knowing that the virus is all over the place. At least they are transparent. The active cases should be the focus."
1225,nO6ieff7WAA,Who is here watching after Indonesia overtook Philippines again?
1226,nO6ieff7WAA,As an Indonesian. We don't care if other country surpasses us. We're still struggling

Philippine system is so messed up, it's basically designed to churn out professionals expecting them to work abroad and send back remittances. While those who remain will just have to settle with low wages, establishments are happy with it."

1346,MJfGRmF0pMc,"mahina ang immune system ng karamihan sa mga senior kaya ok lang kahit hindi muna sila palabasin, baka nga karamihan sa mga nasa death list na hindi frontliner ay  mga senior eh kasi mas hirap sila pag tinamaan ng virus."
1347,MJfGRmF0pMc,Payag ako jan kc isa ako sa senior citizen na tumatakbo at natatapos pa ng full marathon(42.195 kms) with the time ok 5hrs and 30mins. Kaya wag nyong lahatin ang senior na mahina lahat..Kaming mga walang sakit wag nyo kaming ikulong kasi yon pa ang maging dahilan ng aming pagkasakit. Salamat PO!!
1348,MJfGRmF0pMc,"Kung kailan tumaas ang kaso ng namamatay saka i oopen nila😥
Ok lng sana kung may gamot na sila.meyroon n b?."
1349,MJfGRmF0pMc,Lotto: 8512 pagkatapos ng 7777.
1350,MJfGRmF0pMc,"Kahit naman wala silang sakit hindi na sobrang malakas ang immune system ng mga senior citizen, Jusko Macalintal."
1351,MJfGRmF0pMc,Masyadong kampante sa desisyon na mag open ng kanilang negosyo..dagsa na naman mga tao jan..mahabang pila..dapat zero covid na ang pinas 4 sure hindi na kakalat..maniwala kayo delikado yan disisyon na yan.

1359,RBOtpAfaeo4,We all must survive until COVID-19 vaccines in our hands ‼️  Please be patient and be kind to others ‼️ Let’s wear masks a few more months❣️
1360,RBOtpAfaeo4,"We only need to implement wearing of mask , face shield and physical distancing . All smart phone should be required to install these contract tracing apps and symptom tracing apps.
these is the easiest and most effective way of flattening a disease's curve and easing the immediate pressure on health services.

Paul Romer, the former World Bank chief economist, has suggested that ""An economy can survive with 10 percent of the population in isolation. It can't survive when 50 percent of the population is in isolation."""

1367,GT638K0aj6I,Ask the public over and over again not to relax to avoid surge of covid cases. But do not make alarming news that early the case will be up by 6000. Make the necessary precautions but not make fear.
1368,GT638K0aj6I,"enjoy first, then problem later"

1371,GT638K0aj6I,"There are far more poor enforcement & violations of Covid quarantine than reported.  This is specially true w/ less known hotels as well as those in hone quarantine in small towns & cities.. lots of ""palakasan"" going on while everyone else has to suffer debilitating lockdowns."

1376,q_RqD3m217Y,"Ayan kasalanan na naman ng mamamayang Pinoy, parang doon sa magboboteng nagpupumilit na magkariton amid the quarantine at nakulong at nubugbug, or pati na yon mga ""nag jump ng queue"", PROBE NA NAMAN, when obviously like the activists, there must be a deeper reason behind their ""queue jumping"", stubborness in going out. Like the LACK OF GOVERNMENT AID, even when it comes to mask, especially early on, as well as their sensing that the government cares more for ""CHINESE FEELINGS"", than their own very survival, like the survival of their healthcare worker children, or their grandparents, with the government practically forcing SINOVAX aka CORONOVAC, despite the BRAZIL STUDY, etc.Tayo ba ang nagopen ng mga cinemas, etc., nag appoint sa all PMA generals IATF, etc. nagpapasok ULIT ng pogos, etc. Ha...the current covid epidemic, with the Philippines being the only nation which did not have a second wave, because we are still in the FIRST WAVE, with more than 700 K infections, and without vaccines, except for the few thousands who had been practically forced to be vaccinated with the more expensive and RISKIER Sinovax, which uses the entire virus particle, and even without the complete clinical data, even after the Philippines borrowed TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS of US dollars as additional covid 19 utang. And not to mention in the face of the world's LONGEST LOCKDOWN."
1377,q_RqD3m217Y,Have them gargle with bactidol and clean their nasal cavities with bactidol too so the virus wont multiply instead will break before it comes inside the body. It also prevents pneumonia development.
1378,q_RqD3m217Y,"well, said dok. and the reporter sir."
1379,q_RqD3m217Y,Doctorrr of the lung centerr of the Philippinesrrrr

1384,q_RqD3m217Y,mayaman lang takot sa covid ngayon pero yung mahihirap at kalam ang sikmura ang salitang covid
1385,q_RqD3m217Y,"that is bad. if the lung center is reporting full, there would be more issues for people with covid 19 and that means the lung center is incredibly strained"
1386,NXc44RuolII,"In short, NCR might revert to MECQ or ECQ..."
1387,NXc44RuolII,feeling ko marami ang magiging asymptomatic or mild na lang ang case sa NCR

1390,NXc44RuolII,Masaya akong ganap na nabakunahan at hindi nag-aalala tungkol sa anumang mga variant o suot na maskara na.
1391,NXc44RuolII,Pwedi ba 4AM pa lang mag start na mag vaccine hanggang 12MN at ang pag swab pwedi ba 24 hrs na lang din at kahit week end pwedi sa mga government swabbing site? DOH tama na ang 8AM to 5PM mag 24 hrs na din kayo. Pagod na kami sa hospital na 24 hrs ang work.
1392,NXc44RuolII,DOH murag mga jasnow! Hahaha

1396,Jk_fIlDznwI,"1,653,351 human individuals in the Philippines are now in severe poverty. That number must go up to  approximately 3000000 people. As result the whole country is poor and defenceless and ready to colonize again by a foreign country. How faster the new cases and active cases increase in numbers, how faster the target of 3000000 can be reached. Yes, the Philippines will be colonized by a foreign country. That is the informatie those numbers telling. The masks are there to tell the people to obey and let the country be invaded without opposing with violence. A Troyan horse is been build."
1397,Jk_fIlDznwI,sa 1.8M na nagpositibo ilan diyan ang dalawang beses na nag-positive? ilan din ang mga nagpositibo na mabakunahan na?
1398,Jk_fIlDznwI,Panong di tataas yan e konting luwag lng di na agad gumagamit ng face masks and shields.
1399,Jk_fIlDznwI,"pakireport naman po ang cases kada probinsya, hindi yung total lang.. kasi we need to analize the data and not just take it in"
1400,Jk_fIlDznwI,"Not surprised.  Says a lot even up to know people only use face shields to get into a mall or a store, not to wear as protection outside."
1401,Jk_fIlDznwI,ang active cases ang tignan…daily count and total active case.
1402,Jk_fIlDznwI,With vaccines and all that health protocols still

1404,Jk_fIlDznwI,Road to 2M guys! stay safe!
1405,Jk_fIlDznwI,I always lick the pen that everybody uses to sign their name at the malls and I still can not seem to get the covid. I sniff it too. I think if this pandemic is dver going to end everybody needs to start doung that.
1406,FgFZgZcwUE4,"I got the flu last year and I bet more than 10,000 Filipinos because I know so many who did.  I am sure thousands died especially those old people and poor.  But the economy last year was the strongest our country has had.  Now the Duterte govt has all but destroyed it and many people's lives.  We have to hold them accountable for this."
1407,FgFZgZcwUE4,what happens... Phil DOH?
1408,FgFZgZcwUE4,"Nkakapag-alala ito.Cge pa rin ang pagdagdag ng bilang.Sna meron tayo gaya yong testing ng Senegal.Lahat na mamamayan tini-test nila kahit mga walang symptoms.Agad-agad ma
-quarantine yong mag-positive.10minutes lang,parang pregnancy test kahit sa bahay lang gawin."
1409,FgFZgZcwUE4,Yung recovered ba na mga patients na yan 100% ba na sure na wala na silang covid?
1410,FgFZgZcwUE4,Maria Rosario please wear your mask at all time. Be a good example.

1439,L0RRohlPzOc,"Loki joins a TVA mission to the site of an attack by ""The Variant"" in 1985 Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where he stalls and attempts to bargain his way into meeting the Time-Keepers, the supposed creators of the TVA and the Sacred Timeline. Renslayer objects to Loki's further involvement, but Mobius convinces her to give him another chance. Loki researches TVA files and theorizes that the Variant is hiding near apocalyptic events where their actions do not affect the timeline. Loki and Mobius confirm this possibility by visiting Pompeii in 79 AD, before deducing that the Variant is hiding during a hurricane in 2050 Alabama. There, they are ambushed by the Variant, who enchants several locals and TVA agent Hunter B-15. The Variant reveals herself to be a female version of Loki and rejects his offer to overthrow the Time-Keepers together. She sends the stolen reset charges to various points along the Sacred Timeline, which activate and create numerous branched timelines that throw the TVA into disarray. She teleports away and Loki follows her."
1440,L0RRohlPzOc,"Wow! Everything is going sideways real fast people...as if Mapipigilan ntn ""Delta Variant"" na mas matindi pa kesa sa UK Variant...."

1446,L0RRohlPzOc,"alpha, sigma, omega, beta madami dami pa yan."
1447,L0RRohlPzOc,Pano nakalusot ang variant kung may detect.quarantine .pinalusot nalang cguro sa pamamagitan ng pera
1448,9ehc2TyH2ak,This is the part in plague inc where you crank up the lethality when the vaccine is nearing deployment.
1449,9ehc2TyH2ak,"They say Impose stricter protocols, why don’t you just enforce the ones you already have. You have not done that yet.  Divisoria proves it."
1450,9ehc2TyH2ak,So the PH govt has learned its lesson..early travel ban
1451,9ehc2TyH2ak,"As a country with lot of OFWs, nearly impossible talaga sa Pilipinas to totally ban international flights. Kayang gawin yan ng North Korea kasi halos wala naman silang citizens na nasa labas ng bansa. Kaya lang natin pigilan ang non Filipino Citizens pumasok, pero paano ang mga OFWs na mageend contract at maeexpire ang working visa during this time? Hindi naman sila pwede mag stay sa ibang bansa kasi pag nahuli kang expired ang visa, ikukulong ka naman as illegal alien. Tsaka kung wala na silag trabaho sa ibang bansa, paano naman sila kakain? Torn between the devil and the deep blue sea tayo. Pababayaan na lang ba sila sa ibang bansa or payagang pauwiin with the risk na pwedeng sila ang magdala ng new strain ng virus? Diyos ko ano na bang nangyari sa mundo."
1452,9ehc2TyH2ak,wow galing ahh. sana nun nyu pa yan naisip diba nung nag uumpisa palang ang covid na to from china diba? pero noo sige pasok mga chekwa!!! pasok mga covid carriers of china! basta may pang lagay pasok lang.
1453,9ehc2TyH2ak,I can't wait to evolve this into Zombie Outbreaks
1454,9ehc2TyH2ak,Ganito sana kayo kabilis nag ban ng flights noong una
1455,9ehc2TyH2ak,Travel ban for people from UK but may allow cargo from UK? Think again.

Sadyang matitigas talaga ang ulo ng karamihan, tila hindi man lang masunod ung minimum health standard or protocol. Minsan nasa satin narin na mamayanan kung paano natin labanan ang isang problema, sa kaso natin ngayon ay itong pandemya. Hindi natin maikakaila na lahat ""GIGIL"" lumabas, ""GIGIL"" magsaya buhat ng hirap na dinanas sa mga nakaraang buwan, ngunit sana naman manatili parin sa ating isipan na kung paano natin mapuksa ang pandemya. Tanggalin natin sa ating systema ang katagang ""Enjoy now, suffer later"", ""Bahala ni si Batman"", ""''Di totoo ang COVID"" sabay sisi sa GOBYERNO sa huli. Sa mga pasaway diyan, isipin naman sana natin ung mga taong nagsasakripisyo na sundin ung mga minimum standard, mga nag sasakripisyo sa 'di lumabas para lang 'di maidagdag sa datus ng covid, sa mga nagsasakrippisyo ng oras nila, oras sa pamilya at buhay nila sa paglaban sa pandemya (FRONTLINERS).

1477,lw0rcwYyiwE,Follow minimum health standards pero yung mga namumuno mismo sa LGU hindi nasusunod yung protocol kitang kita sa video netong report na to. Complacent na rin karamihan ng pinoy. Goodluck sa Pilipinas
