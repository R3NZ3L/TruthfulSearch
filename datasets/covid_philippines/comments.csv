0,aLZ85hb4wjE,Loved the calmness of Manilla.
1,aLZ85hb4wjE,"After this pandemic I think every country should have a lockdown every month to give mother nature a time to heal, with all the pollution that the earth is experiencing."
2,aLZ85hb4wjE,manila looks beautifull with less people
3,aLZ85hb4wjE,"The lockdown makes the city look like a place I want to explore.

Before the lockdown, it looked like a crowded mess filled with traffic and pollution."
4,aLZ85hb4wjE,India also same
5,aLZ85hb4wjE,"I went up the viewing spot at antipolo, its a very beautiful, almost smog free view of the metro skyline"
6,aLZ85hb4wjE,The president promised that he'll do his best to ease the traffic in the metro like 5mins of travel along EDSA. Fortunately it happened but unfortunately it wasn't in the ideal way. Nature's sense of humor tho.
7,aLZ85hb4wjE,The sad part is people around the world did not intend to heal earth but afraid of death.
8,aLZ85hb4wjE,i hope it stays like this forever its beautiful with no messy people
9,aLZ85hb4wjE,2020 is the year when nature fight back and reduce human emission dramatically.
10,sdsz-t540WI,The people of The Philippines are so smart and strong. They endure and work incredibly hard. Much love. Make use of online fundraising campaign sights. People will donate. üíØüíó
11,sdsz-t540WI,"If you take out the paychecks of the government officials from the President down to the Barangay level, I bet  these people will be the first one to protest against lockdown."
12,sdsz-t540WI,hello sa mga classmates kong nanonood dahil sa documentary veiwing. buhay pa ba guys?

16,sdsz-t540WI,"I thank God, me and my daughter still on job. We don't have much to worry. We never rent a house and pay water bill, just the electric bill."
17,sdsz-t540WI,Kaway sa mga pumunta dahil sa module
18,sdsz-t540WI,I‚Äôm curious with all of this going on why the Philippine peso is so strong against the dollar compared to before the pandemic. I would just assume that the patient would lose value based on the devastation to the economy. And yes the USA lost value as well I agree I‚Äôm just curious how this is all working out and why
19,sdsz-t540WI,Instead of focusing on the pandemic effect the govt is busy on the closure of a giant network.

34,E5F3xA_zkFc,"Many people were really hungry during the pandemic, they couldn't go to work, there was no salary, there was no way to eat, I cried in this documentaryüò≠üò≠üò≠"
35,E5F3xA_zkFc,What's sad is that these are the same people who still vote for corrupt officials.
36,E5F3xA_zkFc,Very good documentary.
37,E5F3xA_zkFc,Very sad and disturbing.  My prayers are with all the people who are hungry and unemployed.
38,E5F3xA_zkFc,"Perfect docu , can't believe it's happening now, feels like it happened 20 yrs ago"
39,E5F3xA_zkFc,This is ridiculous! The country needs to open up to survive.
40,E5F3xA_zkFc,"As a Melbournian in Australia, I will not complain again after this."
41,E5F3xA_zkFc,"""Those who are just starting to get hungry can wait...."""
42,E5F3xA_zkFc,"Thank god i live in a defiant nation, when state ordered businesses to close down, people collectively showed them middle finger."
43,E5F3xA_zkFc,I can't fathom why the rich received any kind of aid.  Corruption is sky high in the Philippines.  May God right the wrong.

54,8dTelszbObM,Coronavirus: Death toll rises to 427: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eavggz1suMY
55,8dTelszbObM,There's always that one person that hides there sickness and risk a whole world.
56,8dTelszbObM,This sounds serious. Hope they get it under control.
57,8dTelszbObM,"You can't blame people for being cautious. Especially now when there's no vaccine, cure, etc. Only thing that helps is separation. It's nothing personal."
58,8dTelszbObM,"0:07 - 20,438 confirmed cases.  How long ago did you film this?"
59,8dTelszbObM,"My wife is from mainland China. Her friends are from mainland China. We live in California. My wife and her friends are stand away from places they regularly go to that gave large numbers of Chinese. Classes in the evenings and weekends that have mostly Chinese students have less people showing up. Masks are sold out everywhere. Groups on WeChat are coordinating mask purchases from whatever places they find them online, even if expensive. 

I‚Äôm not as concerned but am respecting her wishes, I don‚Äôt want to cause her extra stress. 

The fear is real. 

You may think it unjustified but it‚Äôs not just people who aren‚Äôt Asian keeping their distance. Sure, some people are being idiots, especially those making comments around Asian people buy calling people racist and xenophobic doesn‚Äôt help. 

Do what you think is right for your family. Don‚Äôt let people shame you into not protecting yourself. 

At some point I expect someone to say something to my daughter who is mixed but looks Chinese but I‚Äôve just told her people are scared and when people are scared they sometimes say mean things. It‚Äôs not as if she hasn‚Äôt heard Chinese people say racist things about other cultures. 

I make sure she knows racism exists and isn‚Äôt acceptable. 

To date she gets far more abuse from other Chinese because her Chinese isn‚Äôt as good as others. She has been bullied by people from South America in the past. 

To date, she has never told me about being bullied by westerners, she just gets the occasional mean comment which young girls seem to make to each other. 

Racists and mean people come from all races and religions. I‚Äôve heard from the local Chinese community things like Mexicans are stupid, black people are scary, various things about Japanese so let‚Äôs not pretend many complaining about racism may also be racist, although they may not see it that way."
60,8dTelszbObM,"The quarantine didn't start until Jan 23rd. The doctor who recently died at age *34,* reported cases going back to December. This is probably worse than the media is reporting."
61,8dTelszbObM,I hope this Outbreak will come to an end! Be safe Everyone!
62,8dTelszbObM,I'm really disappointed with the director - General of the WHO. Every country has the right to ban travel to and from a country to protect it's citizens!!
63,8dTelszbObM,Leave it to the bbc to make this about racism

65,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"The poor gets poorer and the rich gets richer, that's how our country works... Even our farmers is not paid fairly..."
66,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"I became a Housemaid at the age of 13, so I can go to high school at night.  My parents had 9 children. I‚Äôve experienced nothing but poverty in my childhood.  It was harder for us, the older children. I wondered, even at 4 years old, why children are considered as ‚Äúblessings‚Äù, when we were all SUFFERING.  
There was no Pandemic in those days, but POVERTY was crippling us."
67,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,I was born and raised in Cebu Philippines in one of those slums. I have lived in Florida for 15 yrs now and I am so grateful to be able to help my family during these tough times. I bought my mom a duplex out in the country in 2016 so She is no longer living in the slums. It still feels like yesterday when we had to pawn Our clothes so we can buy food. I will never forget where I came from and will always be grateful for the blessings that come my way üôè
68,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"10 children and 13 grandchildren. Sometimes you can influence how you live your life. We are a poor family too, but our lives are much better than a family with 10 children and 13 grandkids."
69,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,Stay strong Philippines. Love from Indonesia.
70,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"I work 12 to 13 hours a day at minimum. Sometimes I feel like complaining  but after watching this, somehow I feel grateful to have kept my job and be able to take care of my family."
71,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"Even without the pandemic.. many of Filipinos have been starving, and  unemployed"
72,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"Even without the pandemic.. many of Filipinos have been starving, and  unemployed. They also said here that ""Hindi kami natakot mamatay sa COVID, takot kami na mamatay sa gutom"" ""Walang nakakagmot sa gutom, patay ka."" and I think that's the most painful statements i heard in this video. Many filipinos experienced hunger amid the lockdown. In fact, the hunger incidence rate is at its highest in 6 years according to the social weather station. I can say that Filipinos don't easily give up in the situation and they are still helping through good and bad times."
73,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,Dont be ashamed any of you.  This is not your fault.  Keep fighting to stay alive and.never give up hope no matter what you have to do.  CANADA is with you.

85,587N9bJ5J5k,"If you look at the lower income quarters, a lot of these settlements have significant overcrowding and unacceptable environmental hygiene; it just adds to the spread and these environments are a breeding ground for disease.  The situation is very similar to the Brazilian Favelas.  Many of their outdoor marketplaces are also a breeding ground for disease without proper safe food storage.

Many people in the Philippines can't afford private hospitals and don't have health insurance."
86,587N9bJ5J5k,"lockdowns aren't going to deter highly social cultures. At least, not in a way Philippine infrastructure will be able to deal with."

96,nTUWK8vufOk,I hope the family was paid for being interviewed. They need support more than ever.
97,nTUWK8vufOk,nothing is more heartbreaking than children forced to grow up before there time...
98,nTUWK8vufOk,"The problem in the Philippines is that there are many less privileged, challenged people. The government officials and local government unit can be corrupt and don‚Äôt do their assigned jobs properly(not saying all of them but some or maybe most of them). The less privileged people and some teens just makes more babies and say having an accidental baby is a ‚Äúblessing‚Äù. It is only a blessing if it was planned and both couple/parents are ready to have their own family. That is why many people are suffering from poverty because many people do not plan making their family. Then they blame everything to the government and if there are people doing better than them they want to pull others down. #crabmentality ü¶Ä I feel sorry for the challenged people but some of the people just make their own problems.

Didn‚Äôt comment here to debate. Just giving my opinion ‚úåüèª"

101,nTUWK8vufOk,"I am so glad that they also tackled the mental health of the youth right now. It is also one of the worst problems that the youth of the Philippines can experience. I know a lot of people in my classmates who suffer from depression, that is why, we must take actions to fight and solve this problem."
102,nTUWK8vufOk,I want to sponsor Johnathan and help him finish school.
103,nTUWK8vufOk,Ah bless jonathan he is so determined while my niece in the philippines her parents send her to a private school provided everything and now she did not finish school what a spoilt brat. I wish jonathan finish a degree someday he deserve to be help
104,nTUWK8vufOk,Poverty in the Philippines had been a long time issue even before pandemic. Children are those who suffer the most because of irresponsible people who only know how to make children even they knew that they are unable to feed themselves. Educate people about family planningüôè
105,lw16DeB6zns,"To people asking why is there a discussion about South Africa, please back to 2:29. The reporter CLEARLY says ""We will now EXPAND this discussion..."" Meaning the topic will also be discussed using other countries' experiences. Philippines was just the main feature or example. It's NOT clickbait. And there's nothing wrong with the editing. Hope this helped :)"
106,lw16DeB6zns,Great insightful report from the reporter.
107,lw16DeB6zns,"They switched because they want to put the philippines as a title because they know they will get more views if the title has the word ""philippines"" on it"

143,SEHcakm-fAc,"In other words, we've lost the game when we're almost complete and back to zero."
144,SEHcakm-fAc,"ADVICE: If you have covid and is having a hard time breathing. Do a ""Belly Breathing"" - the most efficient way to breathe (you can search it up online). This is exactly what I did when I was slowly losing air to breathe. I was having a hard time inhaling through my nose so I used my mouth. Your belly should come outward as you take in air. As you exhale, your stomach will come back in. If it's hard to breathe through your nose then use your mouth. If this makes your mouth dry then try to have a glass of water and maybe a little bucket beside you where you can rinse your mouth from time to time. If it's hard to breathe when you lay down then just sit. You need to practice until your body gets use to it. Put your hand in your stomach so you can monitor your breathing. ( I tried the one where you hold your breath for a couple of times and cough at the last try but it didn't work for me. It made it even more hard for me to breathe.)"
145,SEHcakm-fAc,Nice to know more about our covid situation in the phil.

190,RhDHGgo4yZg,"Watching this makes me so grateful that I thought it my duty to help. For the past six months, I have been sending money to a family of seven. I am not a rich man but I thought I must do something to help. So I have been sending $125 pcm. I know this will be enough vegetables and rice to see them through. It will save them from starvation."
191,RhDHGgo4yZg,This is so sad and heartbreaking ü•∫üò¢üòî
192,RhDHGgo4yZg,This is so sad and to think that I always say I'm starving when I am provided with so much food. I feel ashamed
193,RhDHGgo4yZg,"It's amazing how money literally prevented people from being fed. In the old days, everyone in the tribe would work to feed everyone. Raising animals, growing crops and managing resources responsibly. I think the fact that there are non-profit organizations of volunteers proves that we have this innate desire to collaborate like we did in ancient times."
194,RhDHGgo4yZg,"The Catholic Church should also help the poor since Catholic Church is one of the biggest stock holders and investors of Philippine banking industry, food and beverage industry, mining industry, among others. They owned big expensive hospitals, schools and universities in Philippines. Catholic Church is a trillionaire."
195,RhDHGgo4yZg,"This is so heartbreaking, I want to help but I know that I can't"
196,RhDHGgo4yZg,"Mortality rate from COVID-19 is less than 5 percent (compared to SARs at 20 percent). Of the 5 percent mortality rate, 90 percent of deaths are people in the age bracket 80 years and above.

Bully and the virus producer"
202,1psSvU1km0I,"As a foreigner who have lived in Ph for 4 years, I observe that: Wealth gap is a big problem in the Philippines; Many Filipinos have low income while the price of everything is too high."
203,1psSvU1km0I,Family planning is one of the main key to prevent poverty.
204,1psSvU1km0I,I'm from Phillipines neighbouring country. Seeing many Filipinos living in poverty makes me sad. Many Filipinos come to our country to get a better life but sadly our government cannot do anything about them since they are taking care of their own people. I hope Phillipines poverty rate may drop
205,1psSvU1km0I,The irony is that those in the poverty are the one who lacks family planning. You‚Äôll notice they are the one with the huge family members.
206,1psSvU1km0I,India is same but 10x times large and worse than Phillipines
207,1psSvU1km0I,"As a Filipino myself. One of the weakest spots of my countrymen is that we are guilible, easily manipulated and are being exploited due to lack of education. Poverty is the driving force of these corruptions because they can control the poor by providing aid to them with malicious intent. Disinformation tru social media has led to many people electing skewed and incompetent politicians. As a result, it cascaded into substandard solutions and short term provisions which aggravated the poor even more. 

EDUCATION is a lengthy investment but I believe it will put an end to the never ending cycle of ignorance and the people being exploited by it."
208,1psSvU1km0I,its so hard too find jobs now in the PH... I'm Bachelor's degree holder and have different skill experience in many aspects but still they hire there relatives and friends in the company even they are not fully qualified instead of the one who is qualified...
209,1psSvU1km0I,"filipinos like to laugh about china, now look whos poorer, this world doesn't need people to insult others with their own nationalistic ideas."
210,1psSvU1km0I,Praying that the Philippines can overcome many of its problem and become a country of just for rich and for poor someday.
211,1psSvU1km0I,The Philippines has a lot of potential if the right decisions are made.

223,o1kPskxFkQ8,"Wag nang magsisihan, lahat tayo ay responsible  sa bawat isa. Hindi natin ito ginusto. May mga tao kasi na irresponsible  na hindi naka mask sa public places o sa kalsada. At sigurado yung hindi naka mask yung ang pinagmumulan ng virus. At hindi hinuhuli ng mga itinalagang magbantay. Sa loob ng mga baranggay pabaya sila. Dapat paglabas pa lang ng bahay ay hulihin na ang hindi naka mask.  Kaso hindi ginagawa. Kayat kahit anong stricto magpatupad sa mga main  roads kung sa loob ng barangay ay pabaya, useless din ang mga efforts ng gobyerno. Marami talaga matitigas ang ulo."
224,o1kPskxFkQ8,"They say, health is our wealth.
But how it'll become our wealth if we don't have proper self discipline?
Come to think of it, they implemented a two-week ECQ in mega manila, yes it was a big help to prevent the wide spread of the virus, for a while. But then, after the ECQ, kanya-kanya na naman tayong labas ng bahay and worst may gumagala pa, even though hindi naman reasonable or valid  yung dahilan natin. And here comes us criticizing the government on what should they do about the issue, when it is clearly evident that we also have faults and lapses. Also, the government should always need to hear the voices of those frontliners, especially the medical professionals and staffs, because they're the ones who know what and how to prevent and avoid the wide spread of the virus. 

Just to be clear, I'm just being neutral about the issue and I just want to express my opinion. Respect is all that matters. This is for educational purpose only, and its not really in my nature to talks anything about politics. 

P.s. if you want to advice me or something, I am open for it. Have a nice day! üôÇ"
225,o1kPskxFkQ8,How are covid19 patients counted if hospitals are unwilling to accept suspected patients with covid? As my mother and I experienced where we toured the entire Gen. Trias until we get to the Manila Hospital where she is also not admitted without even passing the swab test.
226,o1kPskxFkQ8,I think the thumbnail is incorrect based on what he wants to imply.  Just saying.
227,o1kPskxFkQ8,"I may say that some people have  biased reasoning. While government officials are not experts on the pandemic, they are doing their best. Maybe not all, but most. Well, maybe not most, maybe some of them.  Regardless. They may not cover every facet of the strategic planning but people should also understand that it is also primarily a measure of each person's discipline.  Everyone is given a mind to think and the right to choose to do what's best for ourselves. Why blame all to the government when people are not doing their best to protect themselves? Government officials are humans, too.  They make mistakes, they get hurt, too. They get sick, they  get scared, too! They are not perfect, well so do we. Instead of blaming the government, why not do something to help them when it comes to the decisions they are making? We can start by reaching out. They have channels to do such. Why not help the government by helping others, too? At the end of the day, we should help each other instead of pulling others down by shooting their flaws or imperfections. Because believe it or not, everything gets better when we work together. So when do you plan to start? When do you plan to contribute for the good of your fellowmen?"
228,o1kPskxFkQ8,"There are a lot of things don't ad up here. In the last 5 months we have had just under 2000 deaths (an average of 400 per month), yet DOH figures show that in a normal year, before Covid, there are approximately 47,000 deaths per month from other causes, so why is it that the system cannot cope with a 1% rise in deaths. Is it incompetence, poor management and just plain panic, just as it is in other countries?"

232,PP3Yu-ro1tA,"Death rate is much lower. Vaccinated cases are mild. No need to raise Alert Level or restrict businesses. Govt should pay nurses and subsidize more Covid beds, cancel military procurement and operations while concentrating on healthcare and vaccination."

238,PP3Yu-ro1tA,Nothing to worry about this figure for as long as no case of death happen to any vaccinated individuals. I am just wondering why government is so alarmed by this development of covid cases! Would you now suggest again for another kind of vaccine at the expense of government money so politicians and profit oriented individuals  could amass more wealth?
239,PP3Yu-ro1tA,Kami dami positive sa amin 13 peeps huhu please pray
240,PP3Yu-ro1tA,Declare alert level 4 before it gets worst. This omicron variant has exceeded the delta variant and spreading like wildfire. Limit people movement and declare lock downs in places where incidence are high. Learn from what happened before and make drastic and decisive actions before it spreads further

‚ÄúO Lord, hear my plea for justice. Listen to my cry for help. Pay attention to my prayer, for it comes from honest lips. Declare me innocent, for you see those who do right. You have tested my thoughts and examined my heart in the night. You have scrutinized me and found nothing wrong. I am determined not to sin in what I say. I have followed your commands, which keep me from following cruel and evil people. My steps have stayed on your path; I have not wavered from following you. I am praying to you because I know you will answer, O God. Bend down and listen as I pray. Show me your unfailing love in wonderful ways. By your mighty power you rescue those who seek refuge from their enemies. Guard me as you would guard your own eyes. Hide me in the shadow of your wings. Protect me from wicked people who attack me, from murderous enemies who surround me. They are without pity. Listen to their boasting! They track me down and surround me, watching for the chance to throw me to the ground. They are like hungry lions, eager to tear me apart‚Äî like young lions hiding in ambush. Arise, O Lord! Stand against them, and bring them to their knees! Rescue me from the wicked with your sword! By the power of your hand, O Lord, destroy those who look to this world for their reward. But satisfy the hunger of your treasured ones. May their children have plenty, leaving an inheritance for their descendants. Because I am righteous, I will see you.

They never solved the problems on their own. This is sad, because now, their math level is like the level of a grade 2 student. It is unfortunate that there is no way to place a check system wherein the teacher can find out if they are finding the answers elsewhere. Hence, it takes them a long time to answer each question."

308,xV1oR-RbOGU,Be strong Philippines
309,xV1oR-RbOGU,I feel super safe in the philippines when it comes to the whole pandemic situation.. The philippine handled this pandemic better than th most other countries. We atleast follow what is required and mandated by the government.
310,xV1oR-RbOGU,every poor family in the Philippines are given cash aid from the government. what are you talking man? your local officials will be doomed if they did not gave it to you guys. report them to our direct hotline to the President.
311,xV1oR-RbOGU,"The Philippine government should be wise enough not to depend too much on China for COVID vaccines as the country does not have a good reputation for its clinical trials.  Even Brazil stopped the clinical trials of the CoronaVac produced by SinoVac Biotech on its people due to various serious side effects.  It would be better for the country to be talking to American, Australian, or European Pharmaceutical companies (e.g. Pfizer, BioNtech, Moderna, Astra-Zeneca) that follow strict regimen for clinical trials with emphasis on safety and effectiveness of COVID vaccines."
312,xV1oR-RbOGU,"Philippine government strategy giving second dose vaccine isn‚Äôt a wise decision! In other  countries like in Europe and USA giving second dose of vaccine even your a front liners or vulnerable there is a certain period of time or a gap of 3-4 months as there priorities at least majority of people have a chance to have a first job to be protected, while waiting for the volume of vaccine arrival! Meanwhile countries in Europe grapple with more infectious variants, a shortages of vaccine globally while the risk of dying in a road of pandemic! The important thing is the outweighs the risk..."
313,xV1oR-RbOGU,"They just admitted that since they were being used as test subjects, they hope they get some for free."
314,xV1oR-RbOGU,"The leaders in the Phillippines should consider the efficacy of the following vaccines before they roll them out into the public:  Pfizer-BioNTech 95%, AstraZeneca 90%, Moderna 89%, Sinopharm 79%, and Sinovac 50.38%.  The promotion on the type of vaccines should be based on effectiveness and safety to the Filipino people, instead of political considerations or preferences.  Just my suggestion."
315,xV1oR-RbOGU,I don‚Äôt buy the ‚Äúno budget ‚Äú idea.  It‚Äôs the availability and the priority countries. We are not that poor

But it's still much better than in EU countries. Why everyone starts to move only now? It was much easier to prevent the pandemic in early 2020 when it was just appearing, but by that time WHO saw no major risks of its spreading all over the world and mainstream media were focused on showing news from China."

346,fp9uRsmTWqg,Unemployment rate has never been under 20% in Philippines. Many Filipinos are under employed in temp jobs this is why so many Filipinos flee Philippines to work as OFW's. The best and brightest leave Philippines due to it's hopeless corrupt government.
347,fp9uRsmTWqg,"The unemployment rate is much higher if you consider the very low income people who are always ignored. Anyone who has friends, family or associates in the Philippines knows the truth."
348,fp9uRsmTWqg,In September the unemployment rate is really high because of 20k plus new cases a day but now the new cases is only 2k or 1k I think the unemployment rate will low because of lower restrictions in October or November.
349,fp9uRsmTWqg,That rate is muchhhhhh higher. Its getting worse
350,fp9uRsmTWqg,We should reduce the population from 113 million to just around 40 or 50 million

424,57wz3HuIVLA,"JC PhP4000 is about USD80. And I think the vaccine rollout is quite efficient comparing it to other countries. 12M people have already been vaccinated, it's like jabbing a small country."
425,57wz3HuIVLA,"The person you interviewed was not giving an accurate story as it pertained to the vaccination rollout. The slow rollout is due to vaccine scarcity in the global supply (note that the country does not have any vaccine production, so all its vaccine supply is imported), and not on the lack of manpower or resource to open new vaccination centers, as indicated by your resource person. The huge droves of people that gathered to get vaccinated was observed only in some areas of the country where the local governments allowed people to show up without pre-registering, and that resulted in chaos."

Family of rumored infected is being discriminated in the society, tons of problems in the issue of relief goods, people are afraid because they know they can die before even get tested, healthworkers are at risk and getting sick, urban places might drop in supply while rural places have over supply yet balancing it will pose a risk to the spread of infection. As the number of infected case rises and more people die it is better to extend ecq until may. People cant afford getting infected even if they are rich and thats the new mindset. Why not make news regarding countries that are panic buying ventilators."

483,ibWFsmcnefk,Great prediction from a economist. Inflation rate right now is beyond repair
484,ibWFsmcnefk,Honestly I don't think Covid is gonna be 100% over for a few years with how things are going
485,ibWFsmcnefk,The Philippines central bank has always been very safe in the way they set up and takes measures
486,ibWFsmcnefk,Why is it ok to keep drug prices high if there is inflation?  Because it has nothing to do with inflation.  It has to do with top 1% sending out lobbyists to make sure they don‚Äôt pay more taxes.  They must be sending lobbyists to news channels too.
487,ibWFsmcnefk,"I got a feeling when I see recovery from economic crisis, what is the recovery, is it earning sufficient money for certain period of time(calculated with normal earnings of the period) all of sudden economic crisis happens for many reasons though in straight forward lack of sufficient amount of money to maintain country sustainable growth and to met with global GDP levels I feel, due to inflation there were chances to meet treasury funds to normal may be there will be less inflation rate after recovery or if it continues there should be of funds left can invest other sectors of development."
488,ibWFsmcnefk,Why are even England's banks not rising interest rates? They are rock bottom and they even make it seem like such a bad thing to raise them to a level which is still so low historically.
489,ibWFsmcnefk,"I think inflation is worse in 1st world countries bec, in this holiday season, many want to spend but the goods are scarce due to supply chain issues. In 3rd world, spending is  not as much but inflation is more mangeable."

670,N9OQbW0YOLU,"President Duterte hoping Filipino professional nurses would have the ""spirit and the fervour to serve the Filipino people"" is one of his most insensitive and ""out of touch with reality"" statements.  It appeals to the conscience of these honorable people without recognizing the years of appeal this work force sector has been clamoring to uplift their dignity.

Excellent feature story by Channel News Asia, relevant for the times."
671,N9OQbW0YOLU,medical course is literally the most expensive course but they be paid that low?
672,N9OQbW0YOLU,"My brother works as a nurse here as well, many of his colleagues decided to resign because of severe workload for months. And with another surge of cases, many of them are bound to work in worse conditions, my brother is now considering resigning too.

Philippine system is so messed up, it's basically designed to churn out professionals expecting them to work abroad and send back remittances. While those who remain will just have to settle with low wages, establishments are happy with it."
673,N9OQbW0YOLU,The head of department of health in the Phillipines only concerns about how much money he can make.

I'm not against with the government but I suppose this is not the best way to help them. Giving money is not enough, for many Filipinos, it'll not last for 3 days. I reckon, instead of giving money and putting the fund of the country in this way, why not arrange mass testing? Just try to test as many as possible so the virus will stop spreading. If that happens, the economy will be back to normal, more job opportunities again and each family can make enough money for a decent life."

881,D7zMgv16cik,"A new study published on the preprint server bioRxiv assesses the antiviral activity of stenoparib against four severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs). This study also focuses on the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant by a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir.

The researchers of the current study also evaluated the inhibitory action of a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir against the Alpha variant. When combined, the drugs acted synergistically and plaque inhibition increased to over 90%

Since stenoparib inhibits a host protein, the antiviral activity of stenoparib should inhibit all variant strains. The current study explored the activity of stenoparib against four SARS-CoV-2 strains including the SARS-CoV-2 67 Germany/BavPat1/2020 wild-type strain (wt), as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma SARS-CoV-2 VOCs"

906,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,"ADVICE: If you have covid and is having a hard time breathing. Do a ""Belly Breathing"" - the most efficient way to breathe (you can search it up online). This is exactly what I did when I was slowly losing air to breathe. I was having a hard time inhaling through my nose so I used my mouth. Your belly should come outward as you take in air. As you exhale, your stomach will come back in. If it's hard to breathe through your nose then use your mouth. If this makes your mouth dry then try to have a glass of water and maybe a little bucket beside you where you can rinse your mouth from time to time. If it's hard to breathe when you lay down then just sit. You need to practice until your body gets use to it. Put your hand in your stomach so you can monitor your breathing. ( I tried the one where you hold your breath for a couple of times and cough at the last try but it didn't work for me. It made it even more hard for me to breathe.)"
907,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Given that covid-19 especially the delta variant is highly contagious as per CDC's. 2M is 2% of our population and thankfully I lot have recovered. I remember Germany's Merkel mentioned in her speech last year that they'd expect 70% of their population being infected as per expert's data. We are nowhere as rich as Germany but 2% is considered low basing on experts data.

982,O06AlL8nONo,"yung first 4 confirmed cases halos isang buwan na ang nakalipas. so ibig sabihin hindi sila ang nakahawa dun sa mag asawang taga-Cainta. May iba pang carrier.


Yung mga ofw galing Wuhan, ang tanong ko ay kinuhanan ba sila ng tests? Or kinuwarrantine lang sila ng 14 days? kapag may symptoms dun lang sila ite-test? at dahil wala naman symptoms ay pinakawalan na sila after 14 days. What if beyond 14 days lumabas ang symptoms??  Diba kahit nga walang symptoms ay nakakahawa pa din?"
983,O06AlL8nONo,Tama ba ? Nag confirmed sila after nabalitaan may 2 tourist na galing dito nagkaroon ng covid19

Imbis na puro community quarantine ang puro ginagawa nyo tapos mamimigay ng milyong milyong ayuda. Yung mga  ayuda na binibigay bakit hindi nyo idagdag na lang gamitin ang pera sa pagpapalakas ng health care system dito sa pinas, magtayo ng facilties na kaya ang hundreds to thousands na covid patient. Ibigay sa mga health care workers ang pangangailangan nila. Dagdagan ang pagbili ng bakuna. Hindi yung pinapataba nyo lang ang bulsa nyo samantalang milyon na tao ang nagdudusa."

What i mean, the data does not tell everything.  Kailagan lang natin mag-ingat, follow the protocols, be healthy, galaw2x din minsan.  Expose sa sunlight.  You see, ang mga media outlet na kagaya nito nananakot lang ito upang makuha ang atensyon natin at views para kikita sila ng malaki.  So just relax, be optimistic. huwag padala sa stress."

All i want to say that Jesus loves you no matter what you have sin before just seek Him, accept Him as your Savior and Father and lastly repent your sin to Jesus and ask Him your fully heart that you need Him every second of your life. I want to realized na you are beloved children of Him. Tayo lang ang gumagawa ng mga bagay na ikinasisira natin at tayo lang ang gumagawa ng mga dahilan para tayo ay mapalayo sa kaniya. Kagaya nalamang sa book of Genesis na una palang pinaalalahanan niya na sina Eba at Adan na huwag kakain ng ipinagbabawal na bunga. Ngunit sa Genesis 3:6 dahil sa curiosity ng babae na si Eba na sa isip-isip niya mukang masarap ang bunga at sa isip-isip niya okay lang naman ang maging marunong kaya hindi napigilan na kainin nila ang bunga na nagbibigay pagkamarunong. At dahil rin nagpatukso sila sa salita ng kaaway. Jesus loves us uulitin ko mahal tayo ng Diyos tayo lang ang gumagawa para mapalayo sa kaniya. Plsss repent and seek Him wth your fully heart and give you all to Him because the end is near at pasama na ng pasama itong mundong ito. Hindi ako nagsisinungaling dahil sa experience ko palang na ako'y binago niya and he completely restored me to become a new born child of Him. Godbless and I love you with the love of the Lord, Jesus Christ.üíì‚òùÔ∏èüôåüòä"

Philippine system is so messed up, it's basically designed to churn out professionals expecting them to work abroad and send back remittances. While those who remain will just have to settle with low wages, establishments are happy with it."

Like the LACK OF GOVERNMENT AID, even when it comes to mask, especially early on, as well as their sensing that the government cares more for ""CHINESE FEELINGS"", than their own very survival, like the survival of their healthcare worker children, or their grandparents, with the government practically forcing SINOVAX aka CORONOVAC, despite the BRAZIL STUDY, etc.Tayo ba ang nagopen ng mga cinemas, etc., nag appoint sa all PMA generals IATF, etc. nagpapasok ULIT ng pogos, etc. Ha...the current covid epidemic, with the Philippines being the only nation which did not have a second wave, because we are still in the FIRST WAVE, with more than 700 K infections, and without vaccines, except for the few thousands who had been practically forced to be vaccinated with the more expensive and RISKIER Sinovax, which uses the entire virus particle, and even without the complete clinical data, even after the Philippines borrowed TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS of US dollars as additional covid 19 utang. And not to mention in the face of the world's LONGEST LOCKDOWN."

Loki researches TVA files and theorizes that the Variant is hiding near apocalyptic events where their actions do not affect the timeline. Loki and Mobius confirm this possibility by visiting¬†Pompeii in 79 AD, before deducing that the Variant is hiding during a¬†hurricane¬†in 2050¬†Alabama.

The Variant reveals herself to be a female version of Loki and rejects his offer to overthrow the Time-Keepers together.

1470,lqbQhDHBuNQ,"Wag na nating sisihin ang gobyerno sa hirap at walang sawang pabalik-balik na higpit ng protocol at pagtaas ng COVID, na kesyo wala silang ginagawa, walang kwenta ang IATF kung walang sawa silang nagpapaala satin. Sadyang matitigas talaga ang ulo ng karamihan, tila hindi man lang masunod ung minimum health standard or protocol. Minsan nasa satin narin na mamayanan kung paano natin labanan ang isang problema, sa kaso natin ngayon ay itong pandemya. Hindi natin maikakaila na lahat ""GIGIL"" lumabas, ""GIGIL"" magsaya buhat ng hirap na dinanas sa mga nakaraang buwan, ngunit sana naman manatili parin sa ating isipan na kung paano natin mapuksa ang pandemya. Tanggalin natin sa ating systema ang katagang ""Enjoy now, suffer later"", ""Bahala ni si Batman"", ""''Di totoo ang COVID"" sabay sisi sa GOBYERNO sa huli. Sa mga pasaway diyan, isipin naman sana natin ung mga taong nagsasakripisyo na sundin ung mga minimum standard, mga nag sasakripisyo sa 'di lumabas para lang 'di maidagdag sa datus ng covid, sa mga nagsasakrippisyo ng oras nila, oras sa pamilya at buhay nila sa paglaban sa pandemya (FRONTLINERS).

HINDI PORKET BAKUNADO AY HINDI NA NA KAYO MATATAMAAN. CARRIER PARIN PO TAYO, LAKAS PARIN MAKAHAWA NIYAN. KUNG SA TUTUOSIN PO MAS MALAKAS PA TSYANSA NATING MGA BAKUNADO MAKAHAWA DAHIL 'DI NATIN MASYADO INIINDA ANG MGA SYMPTOMAS NG COVID. MINSAN ISIPIN LANG NATIN ""NAHANGINAN LANG"" KAYA DIRETSO PARIN LABAS UN PALA COVID POSITIVE NA, NAG OUTING OUTING PA, NGAYON SANGKATUTAK ANG HINAWAAN.

SA MGA UUWI DIN PO GALING IBANG BANSA, KUNG 'DI RIN NATING KAYANG SUNDUIN UNG PROTOCOL AND OR QUARANTINE NG ISINATUPAD NG PINAS AY WAG NA PO TAYONG UMUWI. NG HINDI PA NATIN MAPAHAMAK ANG MGA SARILI NATIN, GANUN DIN ANG MGA TAONG NAKAPALIBOT SATIN. 

KONTING SAKRIPISYO LAMANG PO, PARA SA PANGKALAHATAN.

Maligayang bagong taon sa lahat. Ingat po tayo palagi."

1476,lw0rcwYyiwE,"I'm a little confused. He arrived March, which was 7 months ago. What does that have to do with the variant? Does he have it NOW or did he have it THEN when he arrived? If he's only had it now, are you suggesting that he couldn't have gotten it here (unless it mutated by itself inside him) and that it incubated for 7 months??"
