I‚Äôm not as concerned but am respecting her wishes, I don‚Äôt want to cause her extra stress. 

The fear is real. 

You may think it unjustified but it‚Äôs not just people who aren‚Äôt Asian keeping their distance. Sure, some people are being idiots, especially those making comments around Asian people buy calling people racist and xenophobic doesn‚Äôt help. 

Do what you think is right for your family. Don‚Äôt let people shame you into not protecting yourself.

I make sure she knows racism exists and isn‚Äôt acceptable. 

To date she gets far more abuse from other Chinese because her Chinese isn‚Äôt as good as others. She has been bullied by people from South America in the past. 

To date, she has never told me about being bullied by westerners, she just gets the occasional mean comment which young girls seem to make to each other. 

Racists and mean people come from all races and religions.

762,D7zMgv16cik,"A new study published on the preprint server bioRxiv assesses the antiviral activity of stenoparib against four severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs). This study also focuses on the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant by a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir.

The researchers of the current study also evaluated the inhibitory action of a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir against the Alpha variant. When combined, the drugs acted synergistically and plaque inhibition increased to over 90%

Since stenoparib inhibits a host protein, the antiviral activity of stenoparib should inhibit all variant strains. The current study explored the activity of stenoparib against four SARS-CoV-2 strains including the SARS-CoV-2 67 Germany/BavPat1/2020 wild-type strain (wt), as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma SARS-CoV-2 VOCs",0.16727272727272727,positive
