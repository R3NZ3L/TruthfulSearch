Classes in the evenings and weekends that have mostly Chinese students have less people showing up. Masks are sold out everywhere. Groups on WeChat are coordinating mask purchases from whatever places they find them online, even if expensive. 

I’m not as concerned but am respecting her wishes, I don’t want to cause her extra stress. 

The fear is real. 

You may think it unjustified but it’s not just people who aren’t Asian keeping their distance. Sure, some people are being idiots, especially those making comments around Asian people buy calling people racist and xenophobic doesn’t help. 

Do what you think is right for your family. Don’t let people shame you into not protecting yourself. 

At some point I expect someone to say something to my daughter who is mixed but looks Chinese but I’ve just told her people are scared and when people are scared they sometimes say mean things. It’s not as if she hasn’t heard Chinese people say racist things about other cultures. 

I make sure she knows racism exists and isn’t acceptable. 

To date she gets far more abuse from other Chinese because her Chinese isn’t as good as others. She has been bullied by people from South America in the past. 

To date, she has never told me about being bullied by westerners, she just gets the occasional mean comment which young girls seem to make to each other. 

Racists and mean people come from all races and religions. I’ve heard from the local Chinese community things like Mexicans are stupid, black people are scary, various things about Japanese so let’s not pretend many complaining about racism may also be racist, although they may not see it that way.","my wife is from mainland china. her friends are from mainland china. we live in california. my wife and her friends are stand away from places they regularly go to that gave large numbers of chinese. classes in the evenings and weekends that have mostly chinese students have less people showing up. masks are sold out everywhere. groups on wechat are coordinating mask purchases from whatever places they find them online, even if expensive.
