0,aLZ85hb4wjE,Loved the calmness of Manilla.
1,aLZ85hb4wjE,"After this pandemic I think every country should have a lockdown every month to give mother nature a time to heal, with all the pollution that the earth is experiencing."
2,aLZ85hb4wjE,manila looks beautifull with less people
3,aLZ85hb4wjE,"The lockdown makes the city look like a place I want to explore.

Before the lockdown, it looked like a crowded mess filled with traffic and pollution."
4,aLZ85hb4wjE,India also same
5,aLZ85hb4wjE,The president promised that he'll do his best to ease the traffic in the metro like 5mins of travel along EDSA. Fortunately it happened but unfortunately it wasn't in the ideal way. Nature's sense of humor tho.
6,aLZ85hb4wjE,"I went up the viewing spot at antipolo, its a very beautiful, almost smog free view of the metro skyline"
7,aLZ85hb4wjE,The sad part is people around the world did not intend to heal earth but afraid of death.
8,aLZ85hb4wjE,i hope it stays like this forever its beautiful with no messy people
9,aLZ85hb4wjE,2020 is the year when nature fight back and reduce human emission dramatically.
10,sdsz-t540WI,The people of The Philippines are so smart and strong. They endure and work incredibly hard. Much love. Make use of online fundraising campaign sights. People will donate. üíØüíó
11,sdsz-t540WI,"If you take out the paychecks of the government officials from the President down to the Barangay level, I bet  these people will be the first one to protest against lockdown."
12,sdsz-t540WI,hello sa mga classmates kong nanonood dahil sa documentary veiwing. buhay pa ba guys?
13,sdsz-t540WI,Bersyukurlah buat mereka yg punya kehidupan yg lebih baik. Kadang2 hidup perlu lihat ke bawah agar kita sentiasa bersyukurü§≤ü§≤
14,sdsz-t540WI,Module brought me here ü§ßü§¶
15,sdsz-t540WI,"God is our only hope in times like these! I pray for y'all in need, the sick, disabled, y'all that have lost loved ones, may the lord and our saviour meet y'all    at point of needüôè."
16,sdsz-t540WI,"I thank God, me and my daughter still on job. We don't have much to worry. We never rent a house and pay water bill, just the electric bill."
17,sdsz-t540WI,Kaway sa mga pumunta dahil sa module
18,sdsz-t540WI,I‚Äôm curious with all of this going on why the Philippine peso is so strong against the dollar compared to before the pandemic. I would just assume that the patient would lose value based on the devastation to the economy. And yes the USA lost value as well I agree I‚Äôm just curious how this is all working out and why
19,sdsz-t540WI,Instead of focusing on the pandemic effect the govt is busy on the closure of a giant network.
20,E5F3xA_zkFc,"Many people were really hungry during the pandemic, they couldn't go to work, there was no salary, there was no way to eat, I cried in this documentaryüò≠üò≠üò≠"
21,E5F3xA_zkFc,What's sad is that these are the same people who still vote for corrupt officials.
22,E5F3xA_zkFc,Very sad and disturbing.  My prayers are with all the people who are hungry and unemployed.
23,E5F3xA_zkFc,Very good documentary.
24,E5F3xA_zkFc,"Perfect docu , can't believe it's happening now, feels like it happened 20 yrs ago"
25,E5F3xA_zkFc,This is ridiculous! The country needs to open up to survive.
26,E5F3xA_zkFc,"As a Melbournian in Australia, I will not complain again after this."
27,E5F3xA_zkFc,I can't fathom why the rich received any kind of aid.  Corruption is sky high in the Philippines.  May God right the wrong.
28,E5F3xA_zkFc,"Thank god i live in a defiant nation, when state ordered businesses to close down, people collectively showed them middle finger."
29,E5F3xA_zkFc,"""Those who are just starting to get hungry can wait...."""

42,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,For greater INSIGHT into the top issues affecting Asia: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkMf14VQEvTaHr6oTqYbWqKOsmcveuhca
43,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"The poor gets poorer and the rich gets richer, that's how our country works... Even our farmers is not paid fairly..."
44,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"I became a Housemaid at the age of 13, so I can go to high school at night.  My parents had 9 children. I‚Äôve experienced nothing but poverty in my childhood.  It was harder for us, the older children. I wondered, even at 4 years old, why children are considered as ‚Äúblessings‚Äù, when we were all SUFFERING.  
There was no Pandemic in those days, but POVERTY was crippling us."
45,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,I was born and raised in Cebu Philippines in one of those slums. I have lived in Florida for 15 yrs now and I am so grateful to be able to help my family during these tough times. I bought my mom a duplex out in the country in 2016 so She is no longer living in the slums. It still feels like yesterday when we had to pawn Our clothes so we can buy food. I will never forget where I came from and will always be grateful for the blessings that come my way üôè
46,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"10 children and 13 grandchildren. Sometimes you can influence how you live your life. We are a poor family too, but our lives are much better than a family with 10 children and 13 grandkids."
47,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"As someone who is privileged enough, these are the stories most of the government officials, middle and upper class Filipinos should see to realize what's really happening when we allow poor priority/decisions and poor politics plague our land. Let us have the initiative to help, both the government and the people together from making this our ""new normal"" üôè"
48,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"I work 12 to 13 hours a day at minimum. Sometimes I feel like complaining  but after watching this, somehow I feel grateful to have kept my job and be able to take care of my family."
49,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"Even without the pandemic.. many of Filipinos have been starving, and  unemployed"
50,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,"Even without the pandemic.. many of Filipinos have been starving, and  unemployed. They also said here that ""Hindi kami natakot mamatay sa COVID, takot kami na mamatay sa gutom"" ""Walang nakakagmot sa gutom, patay ka."" and I think that's the most painful statements i heard in this video. Many filipinos experienced hunger amid the lockdown. In fact, the hunger incidence rate is at its highest in 6 years according to the social weather station. I can say that Filipinos don't easily give up in the situation and they are still helping through good and bad times."
51,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,Dont be ashamed any of you.  This is not your fault.  Keep fighting to stay alive and.never give up hope no matter what you have to do.  CANADA is with you.
52,nTUWK8vufOk,"As a Filipino student, online class is frustrating because our internet here sucks."
53,nTUWK8vufOk,I hope the family was paid for being interviewed. They need support more than ever.
54,nTUWK8vufOk,nothing is more heartbreaking than children forced to grow up before there time...
55,nTUWK8vufOk,"I was in the Philippines on a mission trip when Covid hit. After I was home in the US with my family, the worry I felt for the kids I'd met there was overwhelming. May God bless the Filipino peopleüíô"
56,nTUWK8vufOk,"As a teacher in Malaysia I feel for these anak- anak . Be strong and be safe ,only education can change your life and your family , Praying for success from Malaysia ."
57,nTUWK8vufOk,"The problem in the Philippines is that there are many less privileged, challenged people. The government officials and local government unit can be corrupt and don‚Äôt do their assigned jobs properly(not saying all of them but some or maybe most of them). The less privileged people and some teens just makes more babies and say having an accidental baby is a ‚Äúblessing‚Äù. It is only a blessing if it was planned and both couple/parents are ready to have their own family. That is why many people are suffering from poverty because many people do not plan making their family. Then they blame everything to the government and if there are people doing better than them they want to pull others down. #crabmentality ü¶Ä I feel sorry for the challenged people but some of the people just make their own problems.

Didn‚Äôt comment here to debate. Just giving my opinion ‚úåüèª"
58,nTUWK8vufOk,"I am so glad that they also tackled the mental health of the youth right now. It is also one of the worst problems that the youth of the Philippines can experience. I know a lot of people in my classmates who suffer from depression, that is why, we must take actions to fight and solve this problem."
59,nTUWK8vufOk,Ah bless jonathan he is so determined while my niece in the philippines her parents send her to a private school provided everything and now she did not finish school what a spoilt brat. I wish jonathan finish a degree someday he deserve to be help
60,nTUWK8vufOk,I want to sponsor Johnathan and help him finish school.
61,nTUWK8vufOk,I'm here out of curiosity if they include how there are so many errors/incomplete in the modules given to students for online study. It's like it never even went to proofreading before it was released. Even our senate wants an investigation on this matter. How can we have internationally competitive students if the materials provided to them has so many errors.
62,dIsaz_XlmTw,wow ! GOOD NEWS ! glad we are all safe and there is near zero cases of covid ! ü§ó
63,dIsaz_XlmTw,Thanks a Lot/ DOH- Keep all Our Health Well!!!‚ù§üòä

74,8dTelszbObM,Coronavirus: Death toll rises to 427: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eavggz1suMY
75,8dTelszbObM,There's always that one person that hides there sickness and risk a whole world.
76,8dTelszbObM,This sounds serious. Hope they get it under control.
77,8dTelszbObM,"My wife is from mainland China. Her friends are from mainland China. We live in California. My wife and her friends are stand away from places they regularly go to that gave large numbers of Chinese. Classes in the evenings and weekends that have mostly Chinese students have less people showing up. Masks are sold out everywhere. Groups on WeChat are coordinating mask purchases from whatever places they find them online, even if expensive. 

I‚Äôm not as concerned but am respecting her wishes, I don‚Äôt want to cause her extra stress. 

The fear is real. 

You may think it unjustified but it‚Äôs not just people who aren‚Äôt Asian keeping their distance. Sure, some people are being idiots, especially those making comments around Asian people buy calling people racist and xenophobic doesn‚Äôt help. 

Do what you think is right for your family. Don‚Äôt let people shame you into not protecting yourself. 

At some point I expect someone to say something to my daughter who is mixed but looks Chinese but I‚Äôve just told her people are scared and when people are scared they sometimes say mean things. It‚Äôs not as if she hasn‚Äôt heard Chinese people say racist things about other cultures. 

I make sure she knows racism exists and isn‚Äôt acceptable. 

To date she gets far more abuse from other Chinese because her Chinese isn‚Äôt as good as others. She has been bullied by people from South America in the past. 

To date, she has never told me about being bullied by westerners, she just gets the occasional mean comment which young girls seem to make to each other. 

Racists and mean people come from all races and religions. I‚Äôve heard from the local Chinese community things like Mexicans are stupid, black people are scary, various things about Japanese so let‚Äôs not pretend many complaining about racism may also be racist, although they may not see it that way."
78,8dTelszbObM,"The quarantine didn't start until Jan 23rd. The doctor who recently died at age *34,* reported cases going back to December. This is probably worse than the media is reporting."
79,8dTelszbObM,"You can't blame people for being cautious. Especially now when there's no vaccine, cure, etc. Only thing that helps is separation. It's nothing personal."
80,8dTelszbObM,"0:07 - 20,438 confirmed cases.  How long ago did you film this?"
81,8dTelszbObM,I'm really disappointed with the director - General of the WHO. Every country has the right to ban travel to and from a country to protect it's citizens!!
82,8dTelszbObM,I hope this Outbreak will come to an end! Be safe Everyone!
83,8dTelszbObM,Leave it to the bbc to make this about racism

96,jEINZXA_ujo,"here in the philippines our houses are just so close to each other, The virus here can spread with ease, it's a good thing president duterte declared the lockdown earlier, we would've been all infected by now if it wasn't for that."

Would you now suggest again for another kind of vaccine at the expense of government money so politicians and profit oriented individuals  could amass more wealth?

186,SEHcakm-fAc,"ADVICE: If you have covid and is having a hard time breathing. Do a ""Belly Breathing"" - the most efficient way to breathe (you can search it up online). This is exactly what I did when I was slowly losing air to breathe. I was having a hard time inhaling through my nose so I used my mouth. Your belly should come outward as you take in air. As you exhale, your stomach will come back in. If it's hard to breathe through your nose then use your mouth. If this makes your mouth dry then try to have a glass of water and maybe a little bucket beside you where you can rinse your mouth from time to time. If it's hard to breathe when you lay down then just sit. You need to practice until your body gets use to it. Put your hand in your stomach so you can monitor your breathing. ( I tried the one where you hold your breath for a couple of times and cough at the last try but it didn't work for me. It made it even more hard for me to breathe.)"

211,RhDHGgo4yZg,"It's amazing how money literally prevented people from being fed. In the old days, everyone in the tribe would work to feed everyone.

253,o1kPskxFkQ8,"Wag nang magsisihan, lahat tayo ay responsible  sa bawat isa. Hindi natin ito ginusto. May mga tao kasi na irresponsible  na hindi naka mask sa public places o sa kalsada. At sigurado yung hindi naka mask yung ang pinagmumulan ng virus. At hindi hinuhuli ng mga itinalagang magbantay. Sa loob ng mga baranggay pabaya sila. Dapat paglabas pa lang ng bahay ay hulihin na ang hindi naka mask.  Kaso hindi ginagawa. Kayat kahit anong stricto magpatupad sa mga main  roads kung sa loob ng barangay ay pabaya, useless din ang mga efforts ng gobyerno. Marami talaga matitigas ang ulo."
254,o1kPskxFkQ8,"They say, health is our wealth.
But how it'll become our wealth if we don't have proper self discipline?
Come to think of it, they implemented a two-week ECQ in mega manila, yes it was a big help to prevent the wide spread of the virus, for a while. But then, after the ECQ, kanya-kanya na naman tayong labas ng bahay and worst may gumagala pa, even though hindi naman reasonable or valid  yung dahilan natin. And here comes us criticizing the government on what should they do about the issue, when it is clearly evident that we also have faults and lapses. Also, the government should always need to hear the voices of those frontliners, especially the medical professionals and staffs, because they're the ones who know what and how to prevent and avoid the wide spread of the virus. 

Just to be clear, I'm just being neutral about the issue and I just want to express my opinion. Respect is all that matters. This is for educational purpose only, and its not really in my nature to talks anything about politics. 

P.s. if you want to advice me or something, I am open for it. Have a nice day! üôÇ"
255,o1kPskxFkQ8,How are covid19 patients counted if hospitals are unwilling to accept suspected patients with covid? As my mother and I experienced where we toured the entire Gen. Trias until we get to the Manila Hospital where she is also not admitted without even passing the swab test.
256,o1kPskxFkQ8,I think the thumbnail is incorrect based on what he wants to imply.  Just saying.
257,o1kPskxFkQ8,"There are a lot of things don't ad up here. In the last 5 months we have had just under 2000 deaths (an average of 400 per month), yet DOH figures show that in a normal year, before Covid, there are approximately 47,000 deaths per month from other causes, so why is it that the system cannot cope with a 1% rise in deaths. Is it incompetence, poor management and just plain panic, just as it is in other countries?"
258,o1kPskxFkQ8,"I may say that some people have  biased reasoning. While government officials are not experts on the pandemic, they are doing their best. Maybe not all, but most. Well, maybe not most, maybe some of them.  Regardless. They may not cover every facet of the strategic planning but people should also understand that it is also primarily a measure of each person's discipline.  Everyone is given a mind to think and the right to choose to do what's best for ourselves. Why blame all to the government when people are not doing their best to protect themselves? Government officials are humans, too.  They make mistakes, they get hurt, too. They get sick, they  get scared, too! They are not perfect, well so do we. Instead of blaming the government, why not do something to help them when it comes to the decisions they are making? We can start by reaching out. They have channels to do such. Why not help the government by helping others, too? At the end of the day, we should help each other instead of pulling others down by shooting their flaws or imperfections. Because believe it or not, everything gets better when we work together. So when do you plan to start? When do you plan to contribute for the good of your fellowmen?"

262,1psSvU1km0I,"As a foreigner who have lived in Ph for 4 years, I observe that: Wealth gap is a big problem in the Philippines; Many Filipinos have low income while the price of everything is too high."
263,1psSvU1km0I,Family planning is one of the main key to prevent poverty.
264,1psSvU1km0I,The irony is that those in the poverty are the one who lacks family planning. You‚Äôll notice they are the one with the huge family members.
265,1psSvU1km0I,I'm from Phillipines neighbouring country. Seeing many Filipinos living in poverty makes me sad. Many Filipinos come to our country to get a better life but sadly our government cannot do anything about them since they are taking care of their own people. I hope Phillipines poverty rate may drop
266,1psSvU1km0I,A bachelors degree is not even enough to get a huge pay in the philippines. How much more the people who cant afford education and just finding jobs to survive.
267,1psSvU1km0I,"As a Filipino myself. One of the weakest spots of my countrymen is that we are guilible, easily manipulated and are being exploited due to lack of education. Poverty is the driving force of these corruptions because they can control the poor by providing aid to them with malicious intent. Disinformation tru social media has led to many people electing skewed and incompetent politicians. As a result, it cascaded into substandard solutions and short term provisions which aggravated the poor even more. 

EDUCATION is a lengthy investment but I believe it will put an end to the never ending cycle of ignorance and the people being exploited by it."
268,1psSvU1km0I,Praying that the Philippines can overcome many of its problem and become a country of just for rich and for poor someday.
269,1psSvU1km0I,The Philippines has a lot of potential if the right decisions are made.
270,1psSvU1km0I,its so hard too find jobs now in the PH... I'm Bachelor's degree holder and have different skill experience in many aspects but still they hire there relatives and friends in the company even they are not fully qualified instead of the one who is qualified...
271,1psSvU1km0I,"It‚Äôs not just a lack of family planning‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs a matter of *communication barrier* between the educated and those in poverty. We have different values, different ideals, different ways of speaking.
And WE ALWAYS FORGET THAT.

Say if I‚Äôm poor, I wouldn‚Äôt understanding family planning words like lower costs, investments, regulations, etc.
Tell me instead that ‚ÄúHaving kids is like raising utang,‚Äù THEN I‚ÄôLL UNDERSTAND. (Could use some work though)

305,ibWFsmcnefk,Why is it ok to keep drug prices high if there is inflation?  Because it has nothing to do with inflation.  It has to do with top 1% sending out lobbyists to make sure they don‚Äôt pay more taxes.  They must be sending lobbyists to news channels too.

You have tested my thoughts and examined my heart in the night. You have scrutinized me and found nothing wrong. I am determined not to sin in what I say. I have followed your commands, which keep me from following cruel and evil people. My steps have stayed on your path; I have not wavered from following you. I am praying to you because I know you will answer, O God. Bend down and listen as I pray. Show me your unfailing love in wonderful ways. By your mighty power you rescue those who seek refuge from their enemies. Guard me as you would guard your own eyes. Hide me in the shadow of your wings. Protect me from wicked people who attack me, from murderous enemies who surround me. They are without pity. Listen to their boasting! They track me down and surround me, watching for the chance to throw me to the ground. They are like hungry lions, eager to tear me apart‚Äî like young lions hiding in ambush. Arise, O Lord! Stand against them, and bring them to their knees! Rescue me from the wicked with your sword! By the power of your hand, O Lord, destroy those who look to this world for their reward.

487,ZlBM9CRsG7U,Oh wow big deal he's only talking about the criminals who commit violence against his soldiers.
488,ZlBM9CRsG7U,"Duterte's subject on that ""shoot them dead"" address in that video was deliberately clipped off. The real score was that Duterte was warning the Kadamay rallyists, a left-leaning group of Netherlands-based Communist Party of the Philippines leader Jose Maria Sison, that instigated trouble in a lightning rally the other day at Quezon City in the guise of food distribution problem. That phrase was meant to protect and secure the law enforcers as well as law-abiding citizens of the Philippines against evil. Be fair to the majority of us the Filipino people by not tailoring neither customizing any story regarding the Philippines just to fit greedy ends of some interests."
489,ZlBM9CRsG7U,Funny how his full speech and intentions for the people was edited out. He was talking about something else not the people quarantined
490,ZlBM9CRsG7U,"I am Live here in Pilipines , some People here , poured a strong Bleach or chemical on tha face of a Medical Worker because they say he have Viruz , now the Medical worker Eyes was damage , so President is angry . And also there is a rally because the rebel group make the Poor here angry because they say no Relief Goods but not true because it is delievered with delay becoz of Check Point in here  ."
491,ZlBM9CRsG7U,"His statement is a ""hyperbole"" so the message will be way more effective. It was given to the police that if someone fight and your lives is at the risk. Aren't you gonna depend yourselves? This technique can scare the citizens that they can hardly follow the rules."
492,ZlBM9CRsG7U,Why you cut his speech!!!
493,ZlBM9CRsG7U,Why not show the whole speech? This statement is incomplete and misleading..
494,ZlBM9CRsG7U,"We need a guy like this at this time, especially here in America. There are so many lockdown violators here in America that it's the reason why we have the highest number of cases in the world. If we had a leader like this, we would have been out of this pandemic by now. Kudos to this guy."
495,ZlBM9CRsG7U,His duty is to protect the law abiding citizens from the criminals. Therefore he's doing his job.
496,ZlBM9CRsG7U,"This is out of context. The ""threat"" was for the rebels, and those that do bad things to our frontliners."

523,6zkba0hNiE8,".     In spite of massive demonstrations in Europe and in the US,  with no social distancing and lesser face masks, yet there is no abrupt spike of  deaths and cases as of now as everybody is projecting and watching the opposite. What happened ?
     If I may recall the video in March of this year of Naftali Bennett, the Defense Minister of Israel, that video stated that the people, the senior citizens are safe to get out of quarantine once  the immunity of the community reaches to 60 percent or better.  Thus, it is safe to say that the Defense Minister is correct.
     For now, social distancing and wearing of face masks etc are observed while there is no vaccine yet."

584,R0i7i80ToUM,"The covid pandemic showed how uniquely different the Philippines is from the rest of the world. I'd say the BPO industry and OFW remittances kept the Philippine economy afloat during the pandemic, both of which showed marked increases contrary to expectations. Had we depended on the manufacturing sector like most of our neighbors, we most likely would not have bounced back from the pandemic that rapidly. In a short span of 2 years, the Philippines transitioned from a contracting economy to the best-performing economy in the region. (Btw, thanks to covid vaccine donor countries that saved us billions of dollars). Edit: Thanks also to the private sector that stepped up during the pandemic; it averted further deterioration of the economy."
585,R0i7i80ToUM,Good thing the philippines economy got it's recovery from the covid. Atleast now the philippines economy is growing very fast and catching up.
586,R0i7i80ToUM,"Thanks to the strong partnership between the government (Duterte and Marcos administrations) and the private sector, plus the repatriation of money by overseas Filipinos, the economy of the Philippines was able to bounced back quickly. That is an example of the ""bayanihan"" spirit of Filipinos both in the Philippines and abroad."

636,57wz3HuIVLA,"The person you interviewed was not giving an accurate story as it pertained to the vaccination rollout. The slow rollout is due to vaccine scarcity in the global supply (note that the country does not have any vaccine production, so all its vaccine supply is imported), and not on the lack of manpower or resource to open new vaccination centers, as indicated by your resource person. The huge droves of people that gathered to get vaccinated was observed only in some areas of the country where the local governments allowed people to show up without pre-registering, and that resulted in chaos."
637,57wz3HuIVLA,"Considering the population of the Philippines, i think its safer here than most of other nation hit by covid. And people here help each other."

639,57wz3HuIVLA,You interviewed the wrong person. You shouldn't ask a journalist regarding covid data.
640,57wz3HuIVLA,It could have been better had they also interviewed someone from the other side of the story. What the journalist said were all true but the picture he is painting is not reflective of the general situation in the Philippines as a whole.
641,57wz3HuIVLA,"JC PhP4000 is about USD80. And I think the vaccine rollout is quite efficient comparing it to other countries. 12M people have already been vaccinated, it's like jabbing a small country."
642,57wz3HuIVLA,This is not the strictest lockdown since a lot of people can still go out.
643,57wz3HuIVLA,You are not accurate in reporting. Active cases is not million and correct your report. The guy is over acting.

On my computer came information today that stated that president Rodrigo had ordered on site shootings of those not content to take the vaccine excluding the health care workers, those exercising, y those purchase life's essentials. I do not know if this order is still currently in effect. That a secondary pig shot/vaccine could be administered usually is given to swine. My prayers are with you. I am a burned patient In a nursing home. One of your very own is my CNA. I have nothing but tip top quality when she at work near me. She is a sweet, dear soul, y also a Christian.

665,fp9uRsmTWqg,Unemployment rate has never been under 20% in Philippines. Many Filipinos are under employed in temp jobs this is why so many Filipinos flee Philippines to work as OFW's. The best and brightest leave Philippines due to it's hopeless corrupt government.
666,fp9uRsmTWqg,In September the unemployment rate is really high because of 20k plus new cases a day but now the new cases is only 2k or 1k I think the unemployment rate will low because of lower restrictions in October or November.
667,fp9uRsmTWqg,That rate is muchhhhhh higher. Its getting worse
668,fp9uRsmTWqg,We should reduce the population from 113 million to just around 40 or 50 million

I'm not against with the government but I suppose this is not the best way to help them. Giving money is not enough, for many Filipinos, it'll not last for 3 days. I reckon, instead of giving money and putting the fund of the country in this way, why not arrange mass testing? Just try to test as many as possible so the virus will stop spreading. If that happens, the economy will be back to normal, more job opportunities again and each family can make enough money for a decent life."

It appeals to the conscience of these honorable people without recognizing the years of appeal this work force sector has been clamoring to uplift their dignity.

Philippine system is so messed up, it's basically designed to churn out professionals expecting them to work abroad and send back remittances. While those who remain will just have to settle with low wages, establishments are happy with it."

This study also focuses on the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant by a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir.

The researchers of the current study also evaluated the inhibitory action of a combination of stenoparib and remdesivir against the Alpha variant. When combined, the drugs acted synergistically and plaque inhibition increased to over 90%

Since stenoparib inhibits a host protein, the antiviral activity of stenoparib should inhibit all variant strains. The current study explored the activity of stenoparib against four SARS-CoV-2 strains including the SARS-CoV-2 67 Germany/BavPat1/2020 wild-type strain (wt), as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma SARS-CoV-2 VOCs"

The advantage to more testing is they can isolate and treat the active cases and trace slowly but surely as many possible infections so to help treat them. I would rather know how bad the infection is than not knowing that the virus is all over the place. At least they are transparent. The active cases should be the focus."

1011,O06AlL8nONo,"yung first 4 confirmed cases halos isang buwan na ang nakalipas. so ibig sabihin hindi sila ang nakahawa dun sa mag asawang taga-Cainta. May iba pang carrier.


Yung mga ofw galing Wuhan, ang tanong ko ay kinuhanan ba sila ng tests? Or kinuwarrantine lang sila ng 14 days? kapag may symptoms dun lang sila ite-test? at dahil wala naman symptoms ay pinakawalan na sila after 14 days. What if beyond 14 days lumabas ang symptoms??

1050,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,congrats for reaching 2million what a great milestone we had
1051,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,"No need to hype on irrelevant data - always focus on daily reports on new cases, number of asymptomatic, number of recoveries and deaths since its more significant data for us."
1052,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,How many people died? How many people recovered? Those are the important numbers. Just giving a tally of total cases so far is just fear mongering for clicks and views.
1053,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Keep safe everyone. Sumunod sa mga patakaran na ipinatutupad.
1054,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,"Pls Note: 1,840,294 ""Recovered"" of 2 Million Cases. Thanks. ... Stay clean & healthy 24/7 :)"
1055,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,"ADVICE: If you have covid and is having a hard time breathing. Do a ""Belly Breathing"" - the most efficient way to breathe (you can search it up online). This is exactly what I did when I was slowly losing air to breathe. I was having a hard time inhaling through my nose so I used my mouth. Your belly should come outward as you take in air. As you exhale, your stomach will come back in. If it's hard to breathe through your nose then use your mouth. If this makes your mouth dry then try to have a glass of water and maybe a little bucket beside you where you can rinse your mouth from time to time. If it's hard to breathe when you lay down then just sit. You need to practice until your body gets use to it. Put your hand in your stomach so you can monitor your breathing. ( I tried the one where you hold your breath for a couple of times and cough at the last try but it didn't work for me. It made it even more hard for me to breathe.)"
1056,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Given that covid-19 especially the delta variant is highly contagious as per CDC's. 2M is 2% of our population and thankfully I lot have recovered. I remember Germany's Merkel mentioned in her speech last year that they'd expect 70% of their population being infected as per expert's data. We are nowhere as rich as Germany but 2% is considered low basing on experts data.
1057,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Woooh go on! Record Holder! Go Philippines!
1058,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,This is good news! That means many are acquiring natural immunity without dying.
1059,ZaTPlJ8nd9Q,Anyone know when the seasonal flu returns from vacation?

1061,sJ0xpruFAwQ,Im from malaysia which I worked in makati manila for more than 1 year.  Last time I leave the phil last march. And i really care about those people even im just a foreigner their country. It really makes me heart broken to see the cases spike in daily basis. Take care my dear brother and sister in philippines hope all is well. You guys can win it too. Mahal kita. Semoga dipermudahkan semua untuk anda

1068,sJ0xpruFAwQ,Congrats Philippines for getting the silver play button
1069,sJ0xpruFAwQ,"The problem here in the Philippines are the leaders, they are hard headed person...almost if they‚Äôre people are LAWYER and MILITARY, wtf are they gonna do in this time of pandemic? That is really the problem they‚Äôre EGO, every body wants to be the best in their position but they don‚Äôt even any experience with this pandemic...what I‚Äôm pointing is live it to the experts medical people scientist who can understand the problem..we filipino already lockdown since March WTF and yet they can‚Äôt contain the virus, WHY??? Because of the politics! Yeah they can‚Äôt afford to let down they‚Äôre OFW behind people the number one supporter of this admin...it‚Äôs ok to let them home ok BUT they should not let use the main airport here in MANILA, maybe use Clark instead and straight to a quarantine facilities don‚Äôt let OFW travel or go home by its own..that‚Äôs is the number one problem that is why manila is now the epicenter of this bullshit..every foreign people coming outside of this COUNTRY that might infected the virus are all here in MANILA where the international airport are located..wtf use davao international airport! Jesus Christ! If the people are from mindanao charter a plane straight from mindano and don let land it here..to lessen the contact of PUI here.."

1071,GUVKWAEO_hY,"here in PH, they are fast in administering vaccines but only while supply last. especially in the provinces, it takes weeks before a new batch of vaccines arrive. How can they administer vaccines if there is no supply."
1072,GUVKWAEO_hY,"The Filipina interviewee‚Äôs fear on general public being left behind is not true. The vaccines of the private companies have not come in yet (not that we know of), and the poor sector are being vaccinated now through the government‚Äôs procurement and donations. They‚Äôre not last to be vaccinated. Admittedly last to be vaccinated are those from far-flung provinces but they are not in immediate danger of the pandemic."
1073,GUVKWAEO_hY,"28:39 where the deck did you get that information from?? In Indonesia health workers and elderly are first and second priority to get vaccine hence why my dad  could get one in early March.
39:19 did you say fifty or fifteen?"
1074,GUVKWAEO_hY,You will get vaccinated here in the Philippines when you get registered on local government sites. Some places in the Philippines allow people to walk in and get vaccinated as long as they have registered online. It also depends on your local government or City.
1075,GUVKWAEO_hY,3rd world problem and the fact were both extremely populated countries. Godbless brothers and sisters in the Philippines and Indonesia. But same form of government there‚Äôs too much beaurucracy that complicates the management. We can get over this! üáÆüá©üáµüá≠
1076,GUVKWAEO_hY,"Philippines have been ramping up vaccination nowadays amidst the threat of delta variant. Schedule for vaccination has been consistent but people such as front liners, senior citizens and with pre-existing health conditions are given much priority. I just hope that we would have enough vaccines to give to all population since we need this so much to go back to our normal lives."
1077,GUVKWAEO_hY,Supply is really the issue since the first vaccines approved in December. The report has shown that private sector will step up to supplement government effort.  But the report failed to probe into why US & G7 did not push big pharma for patent waiver in the midst of a pandemic in order to manufacture more vaccines.
1078,GUVKWAEO_hY,"I personally think that it's good that countries in southeast asia are having several vaccines option.
Here in Japan we only have either Pfizer or Moderna. That's all."
1079,GUVKWAEO_hY,Philippine vaccination drive is as fast as the supplies will allow them. I appreciate the Frontliners and local governments for being efficient & working hard nonstop to facilitate the vaccination driveüôåüôè

1087,FIiz8hqXm24,"Might need one come December ( at least 6 months). Depends kung widespread pa rin ang infection. If not, I can take it at a later date - maybe Jan/feb of next year. Mauna na lang muna yung mga di pa vaccinated."

1107,aw59h2FNMIQ,Philippines authority should consider Russian vaccine carefully. I watched a video clip of an American doctor and he says he doesn't question Russian vaccine validity but he questions why Russia refuses to provide scientific data of the third stage test to international organization to confirm.
1108,aw59h2FNMIQ,not a wise decision considering how silent Russia has been through the vaccine development process! Duterte's opportunistic approach may prove fatal

1319,9ehc2TyH2ak,This is the part in plague inc where you crank up the lethality when the vaccine is nearing deployment.
1320,9ehc2TyH2ak,"They say Impose stricter protocols, why don‚Äôt you just enforce the ones you already have. You have not done that yet.  Divisoria proves it."
1321,9ehc2TyH2ak,So the PH govt has learned its lesson..early travel ban
1322,9ehc2TyH2ak,"As a country with lot of OFWs, nearly impossible talaga sa Pilipinas to totally ban international flights. Kayang gawin yan ng North Korea kasi halos wala naman silang citizens na nasa labas ng bansa. Kaya lang natin pigilan ang non Filipino Citizens pumasok, pero paano ang mga OFWs na mageend contract at maeexpire ang working visa during this time? Hindi naman sila pwede mag stay sa ibang bansa kasi pag nahuli kang expired ang visa, ikukulong ka naman as illegal alien. Tsaka kung wala na silag trabaho sa ibang bansa, paano naman sila kakain? Torn between the devil and the deep blue sea tayo. Pababayaan na lang ba sila sa ibang bansa or payagang pauwiin with the risk na pwedeng sila ang magdala ng new strain ng virus? Diyos ko ano na bang nangyari sa mundo."
1323,9ehc2TyH2ak,Ganito sana kayo kabilis nag ban ng flights noong una
1324,9ehc2TyH2ak,I can't wait to evolve this into Zombie Outbreaks

1326,9ehc2TyH2ak,Travel ban for people from UK but may allow cargo from UK? Think again.

1339,Jk_fIlDznwI,"1,653,351 human individuals in the Philippines are now in severe poverty. That number must go up to  approximately 3000000 people. As result the whole country is poor and defenceless and ready to colonize again by a foreign country. How faster the new cases and active cases increase in numbers, how faster the target of 3000000 can be reached. Yes, the Philippines will be colonized by a foreign country. That is the informatie those numbers telling. The masks are there to tell the people to obey and let the country be invaded without opposing with violence. A Troyan horse is been build."
1340,Jk_fIlDznwI,sa 1.8M na nagpositibo ilan diyan ang dalawang beses na nag-positive? ilan din ang mga nagpositibo na mabakunahan na?

1349,0BSZ8-EeAIw,Been waiting all night for update on Sg's daily cases.
1350,0BSZ8-EeAIw,"Indonesia's central government lies with data about cases of victims of the covid virus, the actual number of times reported by the public. This is because the government allows workers from China to enter Indonesia on a large scale during the outbreak.
Now 30 doctors and 4 nurses have died and hundreds of health workers are infected with the virus, and the Indonesian government does not care at all.
The affected Indonesians were not given help from the government, this is a reality that happened in Indonesia.
Anyone who criticized the government was arrested so that the international community did not know what was happening in Indonesia now."
1351,0BSZ8-EeAIw,That's because they been slacking in the fight against this disease right from the begining. How many more have to die before they realise.
1352,0BSZ8-EeAIw,no update from sg today???

1357,0BSZ8-EeAIw,Why are there few cases in Thailand considering that Bangkok its capital is the world‚Äôs most visited city in the world?
1358,0BSZ8-EeAIw,The whole world should agree to lockdown at the same time to have any hope of making this virus a short term pain.

Renslayer objects to Loki's further involvement, but Mobius convinces her to give him another chance. Loki researches TVA files and theorizes that the Variant is hiding near apocalyptic events where their actions do not affect the timeline. Loki and Mobius confirm this possibility by visiting¬†Pompeii in 79 AD, before deducing that the Variant is hiding during a¬†hurricane¬†in 2050¬†Alabama. There, they are ambushed by the Variant, who¬†enchants¬†several locals and TVA agent Hunter B-15. The Variant reveals herself to be a female version of Loki and rejects his offer to overthrow the Time-Keepers together. She sends the stolen reset charges to various points along the Sacred Timeline, which activate and create numerous branched timelines that throw the TVA into disarray. She teleports away and Loki follows her."

1654,O5ks3kEx724,DOH should identify the source to prevent spreading out viruses.conducting swab test is not the solution to suppress covid 19
1655,O5ks3kEx724,"If they are sincere when it comes to the public's health, why not give doctors the freedom to choose altenative means to treat it. We are talking about professionals who took an oath to ""do no harm"". Tsaka isa pa, ginawa na ng publiko yung gusto ng gobyerno at big pharma which is to vaccinate di ba? So if nagka covid ulit kahit vaccinated na, bakit di pa payagan yung ibang pamamaraan? Bat ipagpipilitan pa rin na ""walang alternative"" we all know practicing doctors who recommended alternatives kahit na dinedeny sa media."

1684,OkYWAnJ0iGM,Having to get a Rapid Antigen Test 24 hours before traveling is putting me off wanting to visit. And I used to love to visit the Philippines.
1685,OkYWAnJ0iGM,So you don‚Äôt use e-travel form on NAIA terminal 1? I thought e-travel was the new form for all entering at all terminals.
1686,OkYWAnJ0iGM,The Philippines is still unclear about moving forward.
1687,OkYWAnJ0iGM,"It's it one custom form for a family, or do each person have to fill out a form? Thanks."
1688,OkYWAnJ0iGM,Hard to believe its almost July of 2023 and PH is still requiring test for entry.  I moved to Thailand for this reason only.  I want to visit PH but I am not interested in getting a test for COVID.  It has to be the dumbest policy in all of SEA besides Indonesia getting rid of visa on arrival. How is the PH so far behind everyone else?
1689,OkYWAnJ0iGM,Thank you for all the information. I‚Äôm planning to travel to Philippines this June. Will I also need a negative antigen test to return home to USA?

This is our first time applying for tourist visa. My son is only 5 years old. Could you please let me know what's the process on scheduling an appointment in my situation. Do I need 1 time slot schedule only, and that's gonna be for both of us. or we need a separate appointment? Please help thank you."
1691,OkYWAnJ0iGM,"I had a question for u, we had plan to travel in Ph this May with my family, do we need a antigen test covid on the way back home USA? Pls answer my question, thank u"
1692,OkYWAnJ0iGM,I am a Filipino living in Japan and this is the reason we have not gone home to the Philippines for almost 3 years coz of so many rules. Japan is not requiring vaccination certification anymore after May but we still have to get the antigen test 24 hours before departure? So we can take this antigen in Japan or before we depart in Narita airport or in Cebu airport? Isn't this a little inconvenient? When we travel we get so busy plus we have a baby. Any experience?
1693,OkYWAnJ0iGM,Thank you for the information.

1705,x5b5soBp37U,"The Philippine capital is one of the most overpopulated places on earth. There are few other areas where so many people live so closely together: On average there are 41,282 people per square kilometre, but in some slum regions there are as many as 88,000 people living per square kilometre. Living place is becoming increasingly satuarated. This overcrowding is causing a range of problems such as lack of education, lack of healthcare, unemployment and general poverty."
1706,x5b5soBp37U,"I have to say this, but you guys just don't understand.. You can't just say "" Stop making *babies during pandemic* "" They probs got pregnant before the Covid19 case wasn't really that much of a bad thing!

1744,FJGLJKtYFIU,The first problem is putting the responsibility of birth control solely on the women when they're only half of the equation.
1745,FJGLJKtYFIU,"NOT ONE WORD ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE FATHERS TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR 
CHILD."
1746,FJGLJKtYFIU,"instead of just blaming it on the pandemic, the men should grow some balls & accept the fact they are messing up!! They should be held accountable! Also the women are giving such stupid ""out of boredom"" reason is beyond me!!!"
1747,FJGLJKtYFIU,"The fact is this country is predominantly Catholic.
The Catholic religion has a lot of responsibility when it comes to unwanted pregnancy 
Any bith control is frowned upon even for married menopausal women when there is a danger to life of the mother & baby."
1748,FJGLJKtYFIU,Education and awareness is the solution to this problem. It's tragic that this is happening as information has never been so readily available.
1749,FJGLJKtYFIU,"Age of consent in the Philippines has been 12 years until recently changed to by Duterte to 16 years.
Coupled with lack of educational opportunities, low or no income, and forced marriages it is a disaster.
Religion plays a large part in prohibiting abortions and encouraging child marriages.
Duterte has the guts to do the right thing.  I have the guts to say Religion has lost its meaning and purpose along the way."
1750,FJGLJKtYFIU,People who are against family planning should spend their lives living in the squatter areas and seehpw unfair it is to dictate what they should do with their bodies.
1751,FJGLJKtYFIU,"Great content. Also, one factor why birthrate has increased among teenagers during the pandemic and even before the pandemic is due to sex abuse. This type of abuse sometimes happens at home (domestic). Meaning the perpetrator is either an immediate family member or a relative and sometimes a neighbor. Someone she knows personally."
1752,FJGLJKtYFIU,5 minute joy turned into lifetime of burden
1753,FJGLJKtYFIU,"Have been watching this for 10 mins and I was like, why can't men stop having sex temporarily when they don' t have birth pills?. So angry they risk their wife's health and create an unwanted child."

1774,UPCrsOYVRzw,Yan yung bakuna na gusto sa mga senador
1775,UPCrsOYVRzw,"In the event the vaccine supply chain is disrupted.
Maybe it would be better to study if the Philippines can get licenses from vaccines pharmas and produce the vaccines here in the country for better control and less dependency from other countries.
But we need to check if we have human expertise, technology, machines and material  resources to do this.
And best to pick the vaccine with the most locally available ""ingredients"" and the cheapest price tag, ease of production/ maintenance/storage but have an acceptable efficacy equal at least or  greater the 75%.

as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one.

For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

Matthew 5-7 NIV
""The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God.""
May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with all."

1828,4Sm58j8vewE,"For everyone's information, We are taking the Covid-19 seriously, we are not mocking other countries who have more cases than us. The nurses made these colourful hazmat suits to reduce not only their anxieties but the covid patients' as well, imagine being admitted in the hospital for days and you only see dull colors.  Colors can change a person's emotion or behaviour. That is why most children hospitals are colourful. Even in this comment section others see them as creepy or annoying. But again, this is our way to reduce anxiety. And mind you, these were handmade by them. Even ordinary citizens are helping in making improvised PPE for our frontliners. So please stop the negativity."
1829,4Sm58j8vewE,Love that positive Filipino spirit! No other people take disaster in stride as those people. My Filipino in-laws are the only ones who really cheer me up these days!‚ô•Ô∏è

Different calamities but we always face it with same filipino spirit. Please don‚Äôt hate on our frontliners. They are not insensitive and they are serious with their job. But they need to have a positive attitude and this is one way of showing it. Fight frontliners! Thank you for your service."
1835,4Sm58j8vewE,I know our frontliners are scared but im glad that they always find a way to be happy. Thank you all for your service

1915,F-P_Jb4QFiU,"The Philippine government should be wise enough not to depend too much on China for COVID vaccines as the country does not have a good reputation for its clinical trials. Even Brazil stopped the clinical trials of the CoronaVac produced by SinoVac Biotech on its people due to various serious side effects. It would be better for the country to be talking to American, Australian, or European Pharmaceutical companies (e.g. Pfizer, BioNtech, Moderna, Astra-Zeneca) that follow strict regimen for clinical trials with emphasis on safety and effectiveness of COVID vaccines."

Dapat naka ready na ung disinfect areas with proper equipments.

Dapat may ample supply na ng hasmat suit para sa medical workers. 

Dapat mag order na ng more supply ng med mask sa mga supplier.

Dapat wag na basta basta mag papasok sa bansa pag galing sa mga countries na may mga infected. Quarantine muna or i test using the kit.

Dapat i cancel muna mga large crowd gatherings like concerts etc.

Hindi lang dapat govmt hospitals and private hospitals ang binigyan ng med supplies dapat pati medical lgu's sa mga barangay bigyan na din sila ng designated temporary quarantine areas. Bago pa dalhin sa ritm.

Mag announce muna ng travel advisory discouraging going to countries with infected covid19 at total ban muna ss mga may outbreak na."
2001,VEQJpP7XEco,Chinese and Koreans invest and build PH tourist resorts and are the connection to getting Filipinos sick with COVID-19.

2042,g8IFXT5_fJU,Per my observation the corruption started when they (PS-DBM) made pharmally the most favored supplier.  In this way you cannot help but to speculate that everything was rigged.
2043,g8IFXT5_fJU,"Sa totoo lang, natumbok na nang Senado ang issue ng Overpricing. When DOH issued the SRP for Face Masks and Face Shields, PS-DBM continued to purchase using the retailed price when in fact wholesale ang bilihan nila. 

The way Pharmally was favored is so incorrect. First, they didn't have the capacity to supply because they were merely a reseller. Meaning, yung presyo ng manufacturer, dinagdagan pa nila . 

Mali rin ang move ni Pharmally to get Ms. Iluminada. With that amount of revenue, they could've used an Auditing firm to audit their FS, however since mukhang may tinatago nga sila, humanap sila ng maliit na accountant to sign off their docs. 

Ang nakakapagtaka pa, halos lahat ng sangkot from PS-DBM, nagsipag-applyan sa Ombudsman. Bakit? Para di makasuhan ? Hmmmm."

1.  All padre de pamilya will be held accountable for the safety of their family from Covid 19;
2.  ECQ will be strictly implemented on specific barangays only who have C19 infections;
3. Suspected carrier of C19 should wear a shirt where everybody will know her/his condition;
4.  Businesses should be opened ensuring every one should wear face mask and disposable gloves;
5.  Transients should be required to have a negative test of C19 before traveling to and from places;
6.  Government should learn how to manufacture C19 test kits and not rely on imports;
7. No more check points except for places like airports, sea ports, regional boundaries;
8.  Logistics should continue and should not be disrupted by police for businesses to flourish;
9. Business owners will held responsible and accountable that their establishments and staffs are C19 free;

As far as reporting is concerned, the number of infection reported are going up. Delays in reporting can also increase potential transmission from infected person (waiting for result). Hope DOH can make necessary adjustment to their reporting system and may present a close to true report. Sayang yun comment nila if they can not present valid data."

2495,ThvELiY3TnU,"With our quarantine system now there is no way to catch all infected people coming from overseas. A PCR test can only have a positive result if your viral load is already high enough. A person can be infected for a few days before testing positive. What happens now is that we can only check the viral load on the day of their arrival.  

That's why countries that have low infection rates like Korea, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia have 14-day quarantines and multiple PCR test during those days."

2518,OD07J9GAHk0,"The policy and protocols should be reviewed well. Why the passengers are paying P4,000 for covid test and also they are paying for their hotel and food for 7 days? most of the passengers from UK and US already have their completed 2 doses of Vaccine and they also have a negative test result before boarding the plane. The DOH should let the passengers go to their respective destinations and not to waste time and money staying in a hotel if they already have the negative test result before boarding the plane and if they have the Vaccine. The DOH should only require the passengers to be tested after 7 days at their own respective places/cities/provinces. Again, the policy and protocols should be reviewed, analyzed and not to just guess and implement things blindly. I know DOH are doing their best and I know a lot of passengers are frustrated too about different protocols. What about those people who don't have money, those people attending emergency, burials and family matters? Why they are not giving exemptions?"

Hindi kailangan ng mga tao ang pera galing sa gobyerno basta May mga trabaho Lang ang mga tao...
At Kung tapos na ang virus outbreak, pwede rin yan gamitin bilang mga training base ng mga sundalo.... 
At pwede rin magamit anytime in case magkaroon pa ng 2nd, 3rd wave ang virus outbreak...
Or magka outbreak ulit sa mga susunod na taon....
Maagapan agad Kung meron ng mga facilities at Hindi na kailangan pang Mag lock down ulit...

2640,JqIMlY7N_dc,"It was never under control. Duterte had the chance to close incoming international flights when corona virus was starting to spread in China (and probably because 'nagpa-papogi sa Chinese government' and 'loves communist China' very much). But he got over confident and only took precautionary measures when it was too late. He waited for the problem to get worse. Duterte loves Chinese government very much maybe he should live there and be the wingman of Xi Jinping. I voted for Duterte by the way, because i thought he would make a difference and there isn't much of a choice anyway."

But as long as the threat is still present, and we're still too far away from the safety zone of herd immunity which is still full of uncertainty, cases may rise again (though not as much as before) if we we don't keep the eye on the ball and apply complacency too early. It will just saturate corresponding to how well we control the pandemic. We're still far away from the ""normal"", so we have to follow protocols as expected and avoid the consequences from mistakes by europe and the americas which is slowly worsening nowadays.

I would rather have my soul 
They want power and control That's their number one goal

 Even Nazis say they were doing what they're told
 Walking down this road all alone in the cold
 But my soul never sold
 I'm exposing the clones God has chosen this role
 Although those who oppose Want me hopeless and broke 
Like I'm Noah on boats I'm just tryin' to tell 'em all 'bout the flood 
I can feel it in my bones I can feel it in my blood Man
 I came up out the mud Only God is my judge 
I don't listen to these politicians They're the real thugs 
Won't comply with the lies 
They disguising as science 
They want you complying 
The media's biased 
These corporate giants Are capitalizing on us By dividing
But I'll keep on fighting"

2792,1vsRRIYjcaE,"I have a major issue regarding the picture used in the thumbnail. Isn't that gonna be a potential source of transmission? Do they change the gloves every time a new patient comes? Why no let the patient or those who wanna be tested take their own swabs, just instructed them so they are sure they're not putting them in danger."
2793,1vsRRIYjcaE,bakit po ganon iisa lang un gloves n ginagamit? what if un nauna pasyente eh positive paano kung un next na pasyente eh negative eh d mahahawa pa un negative. dapat palit lagi ng gloves kada pasyente. safe nga sa frontliner pero apra hindi naman po safe sa mga pasyente
2794,1vsRRIYjcaE,Duque employs the REACTIVE approach. What we need is a PROACTIVE leader. 2-3 steps ahead dapat ang decision and action.

But countries that didn't start testing and tracing early have had a harder time reducing the number of daily new coronavirus cases.""

Nobody blamed their citizens except this administration. PH has the worst testing efficiency in the Asia-Pac region and it's not about money. Duterte govt is incompetent and a complete failure."

About me:  My name is Teacher Gio to my students and Gio to my friends. I left the USA over 4 years ago to travel SE Asia and live a better life.  Follow my journey as I travel around The Philippines reviewing different islands and cities.
My channel: Reviewing different islands and cities in The Philippines as places to visit or live, condo and apartment reviews, dating advice, how to travel and live inexpensively in The Philippines."

3097,GTEzaFlMoYE,"Lord Jesus Christ is the only One who can save people. No one else in the world is able to save us. 
There is truly no other way to be saved, since we are born in Adam, in sin, and all die. ... Our salvation cleanses us from our sin by only one name, Jesus Christ. Since we must have an ultimate sacrifice, only the Son of God, who is the only one born sinless, can save us.
Salvation is a free gift through believing LORD JESUS CHRIST as LORD and SAVIOR of your life physically and spiritually. 
By accepting Lord Jesus Christ, we need to repent meaning changing our old ways for example if we drink alcohol and get drunk, you no longer drink and get drunk basically it means to stop sinning and¬† transforming you to practice righteousness. 

God bless to everyone"

Wearing mask, social distancing, hand washing is still the WHO recommendation to prevent   covid19 infection."

Never mind the arbitrary 60% - epidemiologists say the rate must be significantly higher - address please the horrific effect the magnitude of even the arbitrarily low 60% will have on the the admittedly inadequate treatment capabilities. Panicked people will be told to stay home, treat themselves and prepare to die. But it does take leadership and government off the hook: no responsibility in a herd immunity policy. And once embarked on a herd immunity policy, turning back will be next to impossible no matter how gruesome the plight of the infected or how hopeless the state of the economy. Actions have consequences even if the action is ‚Äòno action‚Äô."

Just make sure nalang na mataas ang resistance mo everyday at mag ingat lalo na sa personal contacts. Since napakalaki naman ng percentage (90%+) ng recovery sa covid patients sa pinas. Saka yong numbers ng mga infected at deaths ay kaduda duda sa report ng DOH! 
Sila muna mag pa vaccine!!!"

COME OUT OF HER!!!
So that you will not share with her sins, and you will not receive any of her plagues, because her sins are piled up to Heaven and God has remembered her crimes.

As a thief is disgraced when he is caught,
¬†¬†¬†¬†so the people of Israel are disgraced‚Äî
they, their kings and their officials,
¬†¬†¬†¬†their priests and their prophets.
They say to wood, ‚ÄòYou are my father,‚Äô
¬†¬†¬†¬†and to stone, ‚ÄòYou gave me birth.‚Äô
They have turned their backs to me
¬†¬†¬†¬†and not their faces;
yet when they are in trouble, they say,
¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄòCome and save us!‚Äô
Where then are the gods¬†you made for yourselves?
¬†¬†¬†¬†Let them come if they can save you
¬†¬†¬†¬†when you are in trouble!
For you, Judah, have as many gods
¬†¬†¬†¬†as you have towns.

Why do you bring charges against me?
¬†¬†¬†¬†You have all rebelled against me,‚Äù
declares the¬†Lord.
In vain I punished your people;
¬†¬†¬†¬†they did not respond to correction.

If you, Israel, will return,
¬†¬†¬†¬†then return to me,‚Äù
declares the¬†Lord.
If you put your detestable idols¬†out of my sight
¬†¬†¬†¬†and no longer go astray,
and if in a truthful, just and righteous way
¬†¬†¬†¬†you swear, ‚ÄòAs surely as the¬†Lord¬†lives,‚Äô
then the nations will invoke blessings by him
¬†¬†¬†¬†and in him they will boast.

This is what the¬†Lord¬†says to the people of Judah and to Jerusalem:

Break up your unplowed ground
¬†¬†¬†¬†and do not sow among thorns.
Circumcise yourselves to the¬†Lord,
¬†¬†¬†¬†circumcise your hearts,
¬†¬†¬†¬†you people of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem,
or my wrath¬†will flare up and burn like fire
¬†¬†¬†¬†because of the evil you have done‚Äî
¬†¬†¬†¬†burn with no one to quench it."

3382,tsYbdv5Eu4o,"Do not sugarcoat !  Not just the Philippines but every country in the world is badly affected by the Coronavirus menace. Right now the aim is how to survive this pandemic, forget about dreams, grand plans, Build Build Build. How to get up and going, making again a first step would really be difficult. üò∑"
3383,tsYbdv5Eu4o,"Current Philippines is great for rich locals but they are getting behind even to Vietnam.  Cambodia and Laos will eventually pass Philippines because it doesn't want to develop using foreign capital using it's anti foreign investment policy. Outsiders need 2/3 local ownership to start a business and foreigners can't get loans from local banks.  Rich Filipinos don't want to share their wealth with outsiders which means they are doing just fine without outsiders and want to maintain their wealth thus nothing changes in Philippines.  It's one of worst investment country for outsider.  Philippines rely heavily on wire fund from Filipinos working abroad which is 9% of its GDP thus 6% growth doesn't mean anything when 9% of its GDP capital came in from foreign countries by Filipinos. Just from the US, about $21 billion is wired to Philippines every year from Filipinos working in the US."

3423,Knw4s71JDy0,OMG... kung saan saan nalang kumukuha ng man power!? Ano ba yan? U need to train thesee pipol bago nyo ma deploy.. otherwise kawawa lang sila lahat
3424,Knw4s71JDy0,Walang maibibigay ang medical training na yan. pag ipunin nyo ang lahat na albularyo baka may maitulong pa.
3425,Knw4s71JDy0,"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

‚ÄúThis, then, is how you should pray:

‚Äú‚ÄòOur Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdom come,
your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one.

For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

Matthew 5-7 NIV
""The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God.""

""In the New Heaven and New Earth, only Righteousness dwells.""
May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with all."

3598,tXjyD9zwUEA,So the question is - why is this required??? I have traveled to the Philippines countless times and never had a need. And if I need medical services I pay my own way.
3599,tXjyD9zwUEA,These are mostly secondary medical coverage. Is that accepted? or do you need primary medical insurance?  Primary insurance is much more expensive.
