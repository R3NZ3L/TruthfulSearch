6,MQ5aYS4YFlQ,COVID-19 In Philippines: The Starving Urban Poor. What Went Wrong? | Insight | Poverty In Asia,"The people in the Philippines are suffering from one of the toughest and longest lockdowns in the world. As the government struggles to deal with the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, the ultra-strict quarantine and social distancing measures which have now stretched to more than half a year, have left the economy on its knees. The move has also left millions of people jobless and hungry. The dire situation has now pushed millions of people to the brink of starvation. Why did the pandemic hit the poorest of poor so hard? With the Philippine economy slipping into its worst recession in decades, can the poor pull themselves out from the crushing poverty? Will their cries for help be heard?

have left more than 5 million filipinos hungry [Music] more than 10 million people have lost their jobs and their livelihoods destroyed me uh why did the pandemic hit the poorest of the poor so hard when a crisis like this hits an equal society like the philippines it's like amplifying the inequality in the social divide so the poor are bearing the brunt of an equal distribution of the impacts of this crisis as the philippine economy is crashing into its worst recession in decades how can the country's poor pull themselves out of the crushing poverty [Music] manila the capital city of the philippines a business hub plagued by economic disparity as the city progresses 35 percent of its population or more than 4 million still reside in slums they are laborers who have to contend with meager incomes of less than two dollars a day and now manila has become the new epicenter for the coronavirus outbreak in southeast asia with slums considered as viral hotbeds for the transmission of the disease space is a luxury for the rich so the poor they live in small homes in crowded congested communities the vulnerability of course with any sort of infectious disease it's the enclosed space the post interaction the amount of people you're interacting with uh the poor really have it worse in in in the normal time they also have it worse i think in times of crisis right now [Music] but the country's urban poor is facing a fear far more frightening than kovid the fear of starvation [Music] as work and incomes dry up starvation is forcing the urban poor to cope in unthinkable ways midnight at one of manila's biggest slums 64 year old bernadette sablazar and her neighbor elena perena together with elena's 16 year old daughter leia breach quarantine restrictions in search of food as an elderly bernadette is required to stay at home and like her teenage leia is also not allowed to be outside of her residence yet in spite of all the restrictions they're venturing out during curfew hours and risk being caught but they're too hungry to care for rules foreign they're braving their way to divisoria manila's largest public market to scavenge for vegetable scrap or collect leftover goods freely handed out by generous sellers the lockdown has crippled elena and bernadette's ability to work and earn an income bernadette is an egg seller who used to earn 15 u.s dollars a day elena is a freelance massage therapist who could earn up to 30 us dollars on good days she was doing well enough to even put up a small store to help with the family's daily spend but everything just fell apart during the first week of the lockdown elena's family was forced to consume every foodstock they had in this small store the crisis has damaged significantly damaged the asset base of urban pool street vendors couldn't sell on the streets jeepney drivers pedicab drivers tricycle drivers couldn't operate couldn't go out and pick up passengers so it would be very difficult for them to recover economically from this crisis [Music] like bernadette and elena many filipinos experienced hunger amid the lockdown in fact the philippines hunger incidence rate is at its highest in six years according to the social weather station a non-profit research institution the poll reveals that 20.9 percent or 5.2 million filipino families have experienced involuntary hunger at least one in the past three months of the quarantine period [Music] after four hours elena bernadette and leia have collected more than enough to tide them through the next two days and are planning on giving their extras around their neighborhood the philippine government has come in with aid to help mitigate the problem of hunger among the people a week after announcing its quarantine measures philippine president rodrigo duterte signed into law a package of emergency cash subsidy to 18 million low-income families beneficiaries will receive at least 100 u.s dollars to a maximum of 165 u.s dollars each month for two months city governments and village leaders were given a month to distribute the aid and aid had to reach swiftly but many like elena didn't receive her subsidy right away even after waiting for more than a month me borrowed just enough money to purchase rice christmas depression [Music] if not for these loans as well as elena's risky venture to the market earlier today her family could have fallen very ill or worse die of starvation [Music] foreign [Music] lockdown is the government doing enough to alleviate their pain will help come in time before the situation spirals out of control [Music] so soon after announcing a nationwide lockdown president rodrigo duterte signed into law the social amelioration program or sap under the sap the government provides 18 million low-income families with a much needed emergency cash subsidy each beneficiary will receive at least 100 us dollars each month for two months city governments and village leaders were given a month to distribute the aid the distribution had to be swift so that aid gets to the more vulnerable segments of the population as an urban poor elena perena qualifies as a beneficiary for the social amelioration program she was expecting to receive the promised first month cash subsidy immediately but help didn't come along until two months after aid was not only slow but it was also very little elena received only 138 u.s dollars on her first month of subsidy equivalent to about four days of her usual daily income is the emergency cash subsidy is only about a quarter of what a family of five actually needs in a month to get by based on current estimates by economists and urban poor advocates well the thing is the subsidy was not meant to be like a cure-all it was just meant to be a a partial subsidy so and we have to recognize also that government has its own risk constraints they don't have infinite money elena's problem is even more dire that's because she has 10 children and 13 grandchildren living under the same roof except for one all of them don't earn an income after their employers had temporarily ceased their businesses the government claims it has nothing left to extend its subsidies but the harsher reality is elena's family are much better off than most other families had waited for far much longer to receive their first month emergency cash subsidies three months into the lockdown five million families are still wondering if their raid is ever going to come the majority waited so long and also the trash they got was next to nothing it is equivalent to about nine pesos per person per day over the last five months you can't do anything with that a huge cause of delay a random distribution of aid we also we've heard a lot about irregularities in the distribution some local officials were prioritizing their own relatives their own probably friends they would prioritize their friends because we have a very weak democratic system that hardly works in some areas and that of course affects the poor who are supposedly benefiting fairly from the distribution but some of them were not able to receive this assistance because they were not part of that patreon client system in their area under the law an irregularity like this is a criminal offence on the second month of the lockdown the national government received more than 2 000 complaints against village council officials for the delay in the distribution of aid currently the philippine prosecutor's office have charged 134 officials with various graft related cases 50 officers are now suspended from office but the crux of the matter is local governments are also facing systemic problems the philippines has barely begun transitioning to a national id system though a newly created law mandates it that's why city governments had to rely on an outdated list of their constituents based on a national census that was held five years ago as a result many filipinos have been excluded during the pandemic even if we wanted to have universal cash transfers we couldn't because there was no mechanism there is no way for us to locate any everybody now nearly six months after announcing provisions for emergency cash subsidies the government has given the second month subsidy to almost 95 percent of beneficiaries the original sin with the social administration program is that the government was so stingy about it you did not get a sense that they wanted to help as many people as quickly as possible elena is unsure if her second month subsidy is coming in the meantime elena's deaths are piling up she currently owes about 100 us dollars from friends on top of utility bills she has to pay salomon in elena's family has also become too poor to protect themselves against covid19 [Music] the philippines is known to have one of the most restrictive lockdowns in the world a special pass was needed to move around to buy essential goods those who violate the curfew and social distancing measures or fail to wear a mask will be punished they range from fines to detention mass gatherings like protests are banned but on the third week of the lockdown a hundred filipinos gathered at edsa a main thoroughfare where historic protests happen sixty-four-year-old caesar galamosa was one of them as an elderly he's not allowed outside of his residence but caesar is desperate he lives from paycheck to paycheck after he lost his blue-collar job foreign famished caesar decided to join his neighbors at edsa he arrived at nine in the morning there was no relief distribution in sight later a team of police arrived to disperse the crowd driven into a corner time and options are running out for the urban poor will the government be able to deliver a solution or will anger spill out into the streets [Music] three weeks into the philippine lockdown a commotion over food aid erupted at edsa one of manila's main thoroughfares a day before the incident rumors spread across the slum village of san roque that a sack of rice would be given out as aid at edsa although mass gatherings are banned about 300 people turned up the following day soon the police arrived and advised them to disperse but driven by desperation 64 year old caesar villamosa stayed on you know the pandemic really put a strain on the poor they are already the most vulnerable they put a strain on the floor because absolutely poor would not want to get sick as much as possible they don't want to be sick because they know it's going to cost money they know it's going to stop them from working the poor do not want to get sick but they will risk life and limb if they're not going to be able to money that's how caesar ended up in detention for five days together with 20 others they were charged with five cases allegedly in violation of quarantine rules and health emergencies these offences could have put them in detention for six months in the philippines violations are quite commonplace since the lockdown was implemented in mid-march more than 300 000 quarantine violators were apprehended by authorities violators were warned fined detained or charged most of these violators come from impoverished families the night of the commotion philippine president rodrigo duterte addressed the country about the incident he suspected that leftist insurgents were behind it and promised to act tough against the room among us [Music] there is no understanding there is no social consideration there is no value being given to the life that is supposed to be saved that is the most difficult part for me to understand you enforce a quarantine because you want to save lives you want to save lives by spreading by by stopping the spread of disease and yet here we are here is the government having very little consideration for that life it just goes against the grain the very green for humanity caesar and the other 20 detainees are now out on bail paid for by two influential celebrities it cost more than 6400 us dollars to release them an amount they could not have raised by themselves fortunately they also received free legal assistance if not for these caesar and his family would have no choice but to accept the punishment but caesar continues to confront his worsening poverty day by day nearly six months into the lockdown he and his daughter are still waiting for a job he also faces a pile of debts and the prospect of eviction from his rented home even as they're trying to cope with the problem of starvation [Music] ironically many urban poor come to manila in search of a better life away from rural poverty but even in the city life has been a constant struggle covet 19 has threatened to displace nearly 11 million workers from the informal sectors and erase years of progress on poverty alleviation the truth is there are not enough policies and mechanisms to help pull the poor out of their poverty but also i think because people are seeing how unequal the philippines is and how problematic our politics is i think we are in the middle of a moment people are actually asking is this the government we deserve are these economic policies we need why are people so bad off the philippines has been fighting chronic poverty since the late 1960s for decades the nation had always been dubbed as the sick man of asia but a series of economic reforms in early 2000 paved the way for growth from opening country to country international trade foreign direct investments like business process outsourcing as well as hospitality and tourism in 2013 the philippine economy finally gained strength the world bank described the philippines as asia's rising tiger with its gdp rising steadily the philippines was no longer the sick man of asia but a breakout nation with one of the most promising economies in the world philippine poverty rates were finally going down but it was just numbers these income indicators actually one don't fail to capture so many other dimensions of poverty but secondly i think it's the worst thing for us it's actually used to hide high levels of poverty we have the richest 50 filipinos having a combined wealth of 4.1 trillion pesos which is equivalent to the combined wealth the poorest 60 to 70 million filipinos that doesn't make sense a clear evidence of uneven exclusionary growth is right in the slums the urban poor have been struggling to own homes in the last 10 years caesar's informal settlement has been defying eviction and demolition about six thousand families live on this government-owned property but a part of this real estate has been sold to a private developer with no plan of resettling its slum dwellers is so while gdps have been rising job opportunities and better labor conditions among the urban poor are barely improving many of the urban poor remain as workers in the informal economy as drivers of jeepneys and brick shores street peddlers owners of small convenience stores or manual laborers in the construction industry statisticians and economists estimate that at least 62 percent of filipinos are working in the informal economy that's about 30 million informal workers suffering through decades of income inequality you also have a lot of workers who don't have legal protection of the law but they are still there they you know the street vendors the tricycle drivers the barkers of jeepneys they are workers they are contributing to the economy but they are not part of the mantle of legal environment it's no wonder the urban poor like elena bernadette and caesar are the most vulnerable during the pandemic the urban poor like them already had it worst before covert 19 as mere daily wage earners without safety nets and social protection i'm still calling this pandemic as in a way as low as a form of slow moving disaster why because disasters or crises don't exist in a vacuum in the case of the philippines we have very weak democratic institutions and for us to be able to manage this well to begin with this has reached this level this unprecedented level because i think it was poorly managed from the start the philippine government wants to recover from the pandemic by providing corporate tax breaks and loans to smes but so far they've been silent on how to help the urban poor in the informal sector or perhaps there is really none at all now the urban poor are resorting to self-help while a new sector is plunging into poverty but how much can they do to solve their financial and health worlds [Music] in manila philippines the urban poor are left on their own to survive through the pandemic [Music] in san roque an informal settlement with roughly 30 000 residents many have been jobless throughout the six month long quarantine in place of their jobs the city government helped to distribute rice to local residents [Music] m to solve hunger in their community fair sidco decided to help in a community kitchen the non-profit organizations helped to raise funds to kick-start this initiative they established 28 community kitchens throughout san roque providing breakfast to 3 000 residents aside from this kitchen the non-profit organizations helped pull together community health volunteers like jelen rossilo as most of them are under-educated volunteer doctors taught them about how to respond to the threat of covet-19 infections and what they can do to avoid falling ill but they have a more important task volunteers like gellin look out for covert 19 symptoms around the neighborhood and deliver food to those under quarantine in closed and congested places where covet virus would most likely thrive mass testing at san roque hasn't even begun the residents also claimed that government healthcare workers avoided their slum community they've been told that government frontliners lack personal protective equipment or ppe too that's why most residents feared for their lives so from the point of view of individual vulnerability the poor is already vulnerable their their immune system is low they're not they're not eating the food that they need to survive and they don't have the rest mandatory precautionary measures like safe distancing hand washing hand sanitation and mask wearing are luxuries for slum dwellers is [Music] relied on private donations to assist her community but nearly six months into quarantine help has stopped coming in foreign [Music] back in the community kitchens funds are also running out no new pledges have come in chalita's community kitchen used to feed 75 people five times a week now they are down to 35 twice a week [Music] this week's feeding will actually be the last hungry as she may be chelita had not been eating from meals they'd prepared that's because she feels others need the food more than her i know [Music] but community volunteers like faye is not giving up she decided to grow vegetables on her backyard to be a food source whenever someone asks for help at the end of the day if this community kitchens dry up and we stop providing food the government has to come in uh at the end of the day it's their responsibility to provide relief and to help the struggling urban poor in their own vicinity in their own city so if the government is not part of that it's like you are exonerating the state from its responsibility to provide the needed assistance especially of the urban people there's only so much that kellen can do to protect herself if she gets infected with covet 19 she will not receive any free treatment the national government extends help to those who contribute to estate health insurance but gellan is too poor to make the voluntary contributions [Music] foreign as many of the urban poor struggle on their own through the community quarantine another sector of society is increasingly desperate jeepney drivers are resorting to begging or protesting to go back to work jeepneys are the most popular transportation in the philippines it's known for its crowded seating so the government allows less than five percent of jeepneys to ply through the roads as a containment measure well if we're looking at their numbers there's more than i think 170 000 jeepney units nationwide so you're talking about 170 000 families nationwide relying on the jeepney industry so you multiply that by what five or six members so we're talking about close to 1 million people relying on the jeepney industry alone and if we're not serious with listening to their demand or at least hitting their appeal then it's like you're basically ignoring one [Music] section of your population now in just six months jeepney drivers have fallen into poverty [Music] chito bustamente had been driving a jeep for more than a decade to save up for his dream home now he is not only out of work chito has also no house to live in had to rely on loan sharks to help supplement his unstable income and send his seven children to school income [Music] 19 year old trisha is honorario's eldest daughter who has a year left before finishing her engineering degree all she wants is to graduate from a university be gainfully employed and help her father honorario in sending [Music] adding to their worries is a contentious government plan to phase out jeepneys they require jeepney owners like honorario and chito to upgrade to environmentally friendly vehicles but it's an investment they cannot afford they're still paying loans for the current jeepneys they own the government hasn't extended assistance to jeepney drivers like chito and honorario except for emergency cash subsidies it's also unclear if they will ever get back on the roads even when covert 19 is over we know at the end of the day gp drivers will be displaced um we do agree there is a need to modernize gps but there's a way to more than sgp's without leaving the poor and vulnerable drivers behind again it involves the government subsidizing the transition and that's the basic demand of gp drivers amidst these uncertainties honorario's children suffer the most trisha's dreams are put on hold as honorario was forced by circumstances to drop his children out of school family now sells native delicacies to enable the family to eat three times a day while cheeto has to find other ways to put food on the table the only recourse is to scavenge for junk foreign while strangers fear him chito actually has fears too he worries about getting infected from the junk he collects for this morning he traded the stash he's collected for one us dollar and 50 cents it's enough to buy him a kilo of rice the government isn't doing enough that's why they're so dismissive because they know the filipino poor have suffered so much through all the years they will survive it's not a question of them recovering even if pushing the ground they will try their best to make do with what they have poverty is a vicious cycle a self-perpetuating condition that can't simply be broken without external help caught in a daily struggle for survival before the pandemic that challenge was almost insurmountable but a crippling lockdown brought on by covert 19 has turned that challenge into a huge battle against hunger and hopelessness how long can the poor hold on to hope before starvation takes over how long more shall they wait before their cries for help give way into silence [Music] [Music] you
7,nTUWK8vufOk,Asia&#39;s Lost Generation: The Hidden Cost Of COVID-19 On Philippines&#39; Youth | Insight | Full Episode,"For almost 2 years since the COVID-19 outbreak began in Philippines, schools in the Philippines have shut their doors to students. Children are kept mostly at home and classes have resumed through distance learning. But with no access to the necessary devices and uneven internet connections, many of the students have missed out on their education. 

Last year alone, around two million students dropped out of school. Poverty has also forced many of the children to take up illegal and often dangerous jobs to help their families cope with the economic impact of the health crisis.  How can these children be helped? What would it take for the Philippine government to save these children before it’s too late?

of the pandemic, and the Philippines is no exception. The pandemic has forced schools
to shut down their doors and keep students at home. Last year alone, around two million students
dropped out of school. Many have taken up
illegal and often dangerous jobs to help families cope with the economic impact
of the health crisis. How can these children be helped? What would it take
for the Philippine government to save these children before it's too late? Life has come to a virtual standstill
in the Philippines. That's after the government
placed a major part of the city under strict lockdown. The once busy street in Manila
is now empty. The tight COVID-19 restrictions
have snuffed out faint signs of recovery that the people are hoping for, especially for 47-year-old Jonathan Mapa,
a bicycle taxi driver. Even more worrying for his family is the fate of his 12-year-old son,
also named Jonathan. His entire future is now at stake
in the midst of the continuing lockdown. For 1.5 years, the Philippines has been
under varying degrees of lockdown, with certain industries remaining closed while others have been partially operating
at 50% at the most. Stringent restrictions
have pulled the GDP down to its lowest in seven decades. More than four million people
have now lost their jobs. Their livelihoods have also
been left in tatters. At least two million youths
are out of school. The youths are affected
by the COVID-19 pandemic, and no one seems to talk about it. We have heard how specific sectors
or demographic groups are at a disadvantage. We've heard, for example,
how frontliners are at a disadvantage. It's true because they're the ones
at the forefront of the pandemic. We've also heard about
overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and their families. We've heard how the family members
of OFWs who have lost their jobs abroad are in a much more difficult position because they now have less remittances and may have limited savings
to depend on. But one specific demographic that I think was left behind
in these discussions was the youth. A sluggish economy,
along with slow vaccination rates, has made the country
the worst place to be during the pandemic, according to research assessing how 53 nations have been managing disruptions caused by COVID-19. Part of the problem is that we never get a clear understanding of what the reason for
one degree of lockdown over another is. There seems to be no consistent recording and transmission of information for us to understand what is going on and how we should go about the problem. The prescription is,
you follow the rules. However, the rules are sometimes incomprehensible, and then they say,
""Oh, this doesn't work. It just turns out this doesn't work. Never mind. You can forget about them."" Quarantine exacts a heavy toll, especially for daily wage earners
like Jonathan. His slum community has been
put under total lockdown thrice in the past 1.5 years for a total of four months. There's no mobility,
no passengers and no income. To compensate for the losses
during total lockdowns, the government handed out
US$78 a month on average to families like Jonathan's. But it is barely half
of what he usually makes. Twelve-year-old Jonathan
is the youngest of nine children and a beacon of hope for the family. But the health crisis has forced children
to bear the brunt of the raging pandemic. In Jonathan's village, almost every other child as young as 10
end up scavenging, unintendedly flouting the law
on child labour to help put food on the table. Eventually, these children end up
with worse, lifelong problems. Dad Jonathan is struggling
to keep his son safe when the government
ordered all schools to close. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte says he won't allow students
to go back to school until a coronavirus vaccine
is available. He says if no one graduates,
then so be it. Only 20% of the Filipino population
have been vaccinated to date. The low vaccination rate has heightened
the risk of exposure to the virus, making them vulnerable to infections. Campus closure has been extended
for the second school year in an effort to contain
the spread of the virus. The Philippines is one of the two nations
and the only Asian country to have not resumed face-to-face classes. According to the UNESCO data
on school closures, in the whole of Southeast Asia
and East Asia, the Philippines has the longest duration
of school closures, which means schools have not been open
since mid-March 2020. That is alarming
because our neighbouring countries, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam,
to some extent, have partially opened schools. And what's troubling about this is that
the Philippines is an island economy. We're composed of
many different regions and provinces, and not all regions and provinces
are affected the same way, which means that a blanket policy,
which is school closures for all, is definitely not the right approach
to go for. The country's economic managers
estimate that one year of school closure already costs the economy
about US$4.5 million. These are losses
that would most likely be felt by the Filipino youth
for the next 40 years. With a study-at-home policy, most schools in Manila
shifted to online learning. The problem is, access to the Internet,
as well as gadgets, is widely uneven. Based on the government's
rapid assessment, 6.3 million households
do not have access to the Internet while 2 million households
have no devices for learning. Even before the pandemic, Dad Jonathan could ill afford
a smartphone. Determined to continue his studies, 12-year-old Jonathan
made a painful decision on his own. But how far will he go
to achieve his dream? The Philippines is the worst place to be
in a pandemic, according to experts. And its youths are paying the price for the government's
weak response to COVID-19. Enrolment numbers are down by 2%
compared to pre-pandemic figures. That's more than two million students. And 12-year-old Jonathan Mapa
is one of them. Initially, he used his eldest sister's phone
for online lessons. Nowadays, Jonathan's father earns only US$3, or half of his pre-pandemic income. Desperate, 12-year-old Jonathan
resorted to scavenging for recyclables. It is his father's greatest fear. Jonathan's 47-year-old mother, Normelita,
suffers from arthritis that requires taking daily medication
to manage her pain. Jonathan is now trapped
in a vicious cycle, as long as his family faces hunger
and schools are closed. He also joins an estimated
160 million children worldwide who have been pushed into hazardous work
because of the pandemic. On average, 12-year-old Jonathan
earns as much as his father. The number of children
pushed into child labour by the pandemic has yet to be tracked
by the Philippine government. I don't want to sound overly pessimistic, but I think we have to recognise that we are really facing a crisis that is
not only a learning crisis but also a generational crisis that will affect
all segments of the society. It has been nine months since 12-year-old Jonathan
began scavenging. Each moment spent working
is a step further away from his dreams. Unlike Jonathan, three of the Damiar children
are carrying on with their studies, but they're struggling to cope
with distance learning. Life is a constant struggle for 56-year-old
odd job labourer dad Dionisio. Armed with just a basic education, he could only find work
in contractual, blue-collar jobs. When jobs are not readily available, he'd go into the forest
in search of forest products to sell for some cash. Fourteen-year-old Judith is the brightest
among a family of five. She aspires to be a police officer so that she could earn a decent income to help ease
the family's financial burden. The Damiar family lives in a village that has very poor
or no Internet connections, so like 80% of Filipino families, they opted for what the government calls
""modular distance learning"". Under this scheme, teachers hand out and collect
paper-based modules at least once a week. These modules lay out
detailed instructions for studying and weekly assessments. It is designed
for learning on one's own, without a teacher's help. Key subjects
like English, Maths and Science are written in English, which makes self-learning
almost impossible for students like Judith. The Damiar family
is not an isolated case. A survey of 1,000 families conducted by the Movement for Safe,
Equitable, Quality, and Relevant Education reveals a pattern. One in every five students
had no one to guide them in their studies. One in 10 students
claim to fall behind in school. 12% of the parents indicate that at least one of their children
has stopped schooling. There are repeated problems. They couldn't answer the modules. Was there learning? I would say that we have poor education quality because of how we teach our students. Alone in her struggles, Judith's final marks sank, from a pre-pandemic average of 85 down to a slightly passing grade of 79. Printed modules were certainly
the most practical way of delivering and continuing
the delivery of education, but it probably was not the optimal when it comes to ensuring that
the children are actually learning as they were when going to school. How long will
this ""learning crisis"" continue? Will the economic downturn
and continuing school closures force these children
out of school forever? Life has taken
a sudden and unexpected turn for 19-year-old undergraduate
Juriel Natividad. It happened after his mum, Alma, who worked as a massage therapist
in the United Arab Emirates, lost her job in 2020
following the outbreak, and that has caused
a deep economic hardship and financial distress to the family. Juriel would have been in the second year
of his university education, had his mum not lost her job abroad. Nowadays, they can hardly afford
high-speed Internet to help him in his studies. So, he dropped out of school. So long as Juriel is out of school
and idle, he'd remain a burden to the economy. He doesn't have the qualification
or the necessary training to be a productive member of society. The youths should be
in either one of them. To be a productive member of society, they should soak up
all the human capital they can at this point so that in the future, they get better
labour market opportunities. But they also drop out of school, which means these are idle years, and ""idle years"" in this sense
means that they're not contributing to the human capital development for future benefits, so to speak. Juriel spends time
tending to the family's small store. The income can only cover
their daily needs. That's why Juriel is desperately
seeking a job, even though the odds
are heavily stacked against him. He's competing with
nearly four million other Filipinos currently unemployed
as a result of the pandemic. What we can infer from this is that other parts of the labour force
seems to already be recovering. The recovery process is already happening, but the youths are not
recovering as quickly. The Philippines is suffering from
its worst economic recession in decades. The country's economic managers say
it will take more than 10 years to return to pre-pandemic growth. So, whether Juriel goes back to school
or lands a job in these coming years remains uncertain for now. But what we know from past evidence,
or past recessions, is that there are scarring effects, and we literally use the term ""scarring"", which means that
individuals, or the youths, who enter the labour market
during a recession suffer permanent income losses,
at least for a decade. And it only dissipates. They only earn
as much as their counterparts who entered the labour market
during normal times after a decade. Juriel, however, lays the blame
squarely on the government. He feels that the government
is not doing enough to help young people like him
get out of their predicament. There is also a mental health crisis
unfolding among children, according to Save the Children,
a child rights advocate. Mental health effects
include mental and emotional stress, anxiety, depression and panic attacks. The students share that
these mental concerns were triggered by being overwhelmed
with the class and household duties, limited or lack of social interaction and inability to understand the lessons
for distance learning or difficulty in self-directed learning. Eighteen-year-old Maica's ordeal began with a simple misunderstanding
between her classmates when she accidentally deleted
her classmate's compiled essays on a shared document. Hostile arguments online involving insults
is called ""flaming"", a form of cyberbullying. Even before the pandemic, UNICEF estimates that cyber violence affects almost half
of Filipino children aged 13 to 17. One third of these cases
involve verbal abuse over cell phones. Cyberbullying is so much more insidious than traditional bullying, because physical bullying happens in places like schools
during a particular time and only a particular group
of people saw it, but for cyberbullying,
you don't know where it goes. For three months now, eating and sleeping
have become harder for Maica. The constant harassment
has also affected her studies. You don't want
a major part of the young generation having mental problems because... unless you have a very robust system
of dealing with them, that condition is going to
persist for life, and people are living longer. The Filipino youths
are suffering in silence. Distance learning has only done
more harm than good. Returning to face-to-face schools
would help mitigate the negative impact of a physical separation
between teachers and students. A pilot programme that would shift
its students back to the classroom has been approved by the president
only a month ago, but it will only take effect next month. For now, Filipino youths are forced
to endure their struggles with long-lasting consequences. We cannot continue
keeping our schools closed. Since the pandemic began
early last year, youth unemployment in the country
has swelled to 31.6%. That's about 1 in 6 young people
currently unemployed, and 19-year-old Juriel Natividad
is one of them. He can't find a proper job to help ease
the family's financial burden. He also can't go back to school because the family is just too poor
to support his university education. One way to help people like him is to encourage companies
to hire young workers. Something that we could look into is, for example, employer subsidies. Other countries in Europe that have persistently high levels
of youth unemployment, for example, Spain or Italy, have experimented with programmes
such as employer subsidies for those hiring youth workers. I don't think we have
that sort of programme right now, but that's something
that we should definitely look into. But that can only be done
once the economy, which has been severely battered
by the pandemic, is back on track. Before the onset
of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Philippines was poised
to become the next Asian tiger economy. It posted an average growth
of more than 6% annually for 9 years, but its economy is now faltering, and it would take years to recover
to pre-pandemic growth levels. That has put limits
on the government's capacity to deal with
the crisis of this magnitude while the children suffer. The issue really is our capacity to deal with the problem. People are saying that at this stage, it no longer makes sense to differentiate between
natural and political calamities. They're the same now. The damage of natural calamities depends on the capacity
of the people in authority to deal with them. Unless the children are educated, there is no hope for them
to improve their standing in life. There have been growing calls
from many quarters, including the UN Children's Fund, for schools to be reopened
and in-person learning to be resumed. The concern is prolonged closure
would further exacerbate the education crisis in the country, leading to more school dropouts
and youth unemployment. 47-year-old Dionisio Damiar's
biggest worry is his 10-year-old, Jane. Jane had to drop out of school
in her first grade, when she had only begun
to read and write. Eldest sister Judith is barely coping
with distance learning and has little time to spare
to tutor her sister, while dad Dionisio and mum Rowena
are undereducated themselves and are incapable
of guiding their child. Nowadays, Jane is helping her mum
at a small store while taking care of the family's newborn
at the same time. She has already missed
two years of learning. Young dropouts like her
are highly likely to stay out of school for the rest of their lives, and Jane would become
a permanent liability to her family and the country
if it stays that way. We have a young population. They will be taking their place
in the labour force. They will be able to be productive. Therefore, they will be able
to support the ageing population. But that is true only if that younger generation
is prepared to address the tasks
of the employment market, and without education, that ability is going to be
severely limited. Having dropouts is a significant issue. I'm not belittling
the importance of that problem, but you've got to take it
in the context of your responsibility for the larger population
that is also at risk, because if you don't do a good job
with the 26 million, they're going to be dropouts, and you'll have
that segment of the population becoming an even bigger drag
on the society. Saving the children's future
requires investment and innovation. The city of Navotas
has one of the lowest dropout rates and highest re-enrolment rates
in the country. It invested US$2.3 million
this school year so that learners like eight-year-old Brian
would be supplied with what he needs, like mobile phones,
prepaid credits and school supplies. Volunteers are also being mobilised
to help tutor students like him at least once a week. We're going to have to go in
what has been, for the country, the default position. We're going to have to rely, again,
on the private sector. We're going to have to rely
on NGOs and civil society organisations to supplement the ability
of the government to address these basic tasks. Even in the handling of the pandemic, it's really the private sector
that has taken a very strong lead in addressing the issues. Back in Manila city, an afternoon spent scavenging has only earned 12-year-old Jonathan
40 cents. It's barely enough
to buy a kilogram of rice. In this slum community, income, as well as help,
has dwindled. COVID-19 restrictions have prevented
outsiders from coming in to provide aid
to poor people like him. COVID-19 ravaged the gains
the Philippines had made in a decade, and the government's weak response
is failing its youth, leaving a generation and a country
unable to find its way. Captions: CaptionCube"

10,8dTelszbObM,Coronavirus: First death outside China reported in Philippines - BBC News,"The coronavirus continues to spread at speed. This time a week ago, there were under 3000 cases in China. There are now more than 17,000 - and more than 360 people have died. Outside China, there are more than 150 confirmed cases  - and a fatality in the Philippines.



Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog",2020-02-04,437009,2766,1371,UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA," well the corona virus continues to spread at speed this time a week ago they were under 3,000 cases in China there are now more than 17,000 and more than 360 people have died outside China there are more than 150 confirmed cases and we now have a fatality in the Philippines - and in a bid to contain this virus some countries are denying entry to any people from Wuhan the city where this virus began and China's accusing some countries of overreacting and stoking panic for example it's unimpressed that the US has declared a public health emergency and it's denying entry for all foreign nationals who visited the whole of China in the past two weeks and if that's the Americans this is what the World Health Organization is saying is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade we call on all countries to implement decisions that are evidence-based and consistent well in China millions of people are going back to work after the Lunar New Year holiday we have these pictures first of all you can see people well these are public areas being disinfected and we know that there have also been fever checks at Transport Hobbs to try and spot people with raised temperatures you may have the virus workers are also trying to disinfect these public spaces and China is urging and issued an urgent appeal for more protective suits goggles and masks because it's running low most of these pictures from Manila in the Philippines there's been a rush to buy face masks they're after a man from Wuhan died and then this is Hong Kong where hospital staff are going on strike they want the border with mainland China to be completely shot well next let's focus on the experience of being in the city of Wuhan it remains on lockdown people aren't being allowed to leave or come in and those who are there are being encouraged to stay at home we spotted this one Russian man who works there and film this one around 5:00 p.m. Sunday on his 3d can see only fake people say people here eight people there and remember that new hospital that was promised in Wuhan well it's finished this is a time-lapse of it being constructed in nine days it's now admitting patients and these images have been enthusiastically distributed by a Chinese state TV it's also been showing this graphic as well a cartoon with the machinery involved in that construction being hailed as heroes there are other images circulating on Chinese social media fan art featuring these machines a lot of it created by people stuck inside cities currently locked down so here's one digger with a big love heart in front of it or you've got this one here and this one's been given a nickname the cement king now several countries are trying to get their citizens out of Wuhan let's focus on Australia these are Australian evacuees waiting for hours at we had an airport before eventually being flown out eighty nine children were among those on board that's the first plane of Australian citizens and permanent residents to be flown out and this is where the plane landed in Western Australia but before passengers were put onto those what they'd landed there they were put onto smaller planes and immediately taken here to Christmas Island it's very much known for a large immigration detention center which you can see there this will be used to house the Australians in quarantine they're expected to be there for two weeks you also have these images released by channel 7 which shows some of the medical facilities that have been put up there you can see here an inflatable room to be used for isolating any potential confirmed cases of the virus it's known as a negative pressure because it allows fresh air in but stops potentially contaminated air from getting out well since 2003 asylum thousands of asylum seekers have been detained on Christmas Island well off the mainland of Australia under Australia's refugee policy at the moment though it just houses a family of four Sri Lankans who are fighting deportation so the plan here is to house the Australians who've been taken out of Wuhan and house them on the island in the short term but there are concerns particularly whether there are adequate medical facilities indeed not all of the 600 Australians and Wuhan have chosen to leave his woman who did woman who did leave explaining why she said I got a lot of pressure from my husband he said the situation is not very good all the other countries have starts to close the borders he said if we stay over here would probably take a couple of months to get out of Wuhan so he started to get really nervous and she got on the flight four flights carrying evacuees are now scheduled for the rest of this week now two other important parts of this story are misinformation and racism we spotted this post it's been widely shared in Australia supposedly from an organization called the department of disease geology Parramatta except that it doesn't exist and the information in it advising people to stay away from suburbs with large Chinese populations is baseless I saw this from a doctor in Australia she tweeted a patient made jokes about not shaking my hand because of coronavirus in frota might my team had not left Australia this is not sensible Public Health precautions this is racism well on infamous information and conspiracy theories around the coronavirus here's will summer a tech journalist from The Daily Beast we're seeing a lot of these these fake claims you know whether it's you know drinking bleach to ward it off or the idea that this is spread from Chinese people eating bats you know these frankly you know many of these these ideas are frankly very racist that are blowing up on social media so so it's it's tricky you know we've seen some tweets from even epidemiologist people who are experts in this field get taken out of context and really blow up online by people who are you know can very concerned about coronavirus so you know the solution I think is very responsible reporting and in people really you know going to the experts on this rather than you sort of seeing what's going viral and running with that boy so this article by journalist called Angela hoy written in the metro newspaper in this article she highlights some of the media coverage she's taken exception to for instance this is the Herald Sun in Australia it has the headline Chinese virus pandemonium with the word panda highlighted and she's also written about her personal experiences here in London in particular one incident on the underground a white man about in their twenties thirties sits down next meme and then immediately shoots back up and gets up and then like mutters under his breath like oh not so next to a corona virus and then sits a croc goes across the carriage and then sits somewhere else and at the time I was just like kind of taken aback beligum that really just happened and not really thinking too much about it and didn't really say anything at the time because it's a little bit in shock and also I didn't really want to kick up a fuss about anything because is this yeah I think that's what happened and now you've shared this story have other people come to you and said well actually I've experienced something similar yeah actually like quite a few people have you know experienced the same thing the problem was when the corona virus like broke out it was around like Lunar New Year as well so a lot of people weren't allowed to go back to go back home and visit family because a lot of people were locked down and it was quite sad as well in Chinatown many people in Chinatown like London yeah a London Chinatown a lot of people didn't you know we're avoiding the area because of you know fear of Oh catching something or catching coronavirus and I never girl that I spoke to she was also on the tube and then she saw a man that she witnessed man like holding a newspaper and then there was like a group of East Asians that just got on the tube and he was just like using a newspaper tonight covered his face and like like this kind of thing getting away from them and then as soon as they got off the tube and he just kind of relaxed and it was just this I think it's just kind of really sad that everyone's being lumped together it doesn't really matter if you're East Asian Southeast Asian you know everyone's kind of lumped together it doesn't mean you know regardless maybe if you're trying to use a lot which is the sad thing I think and in your article you were just talking about your personal experience you're also highlighting some of the media coverage that you've taken issue with have you been surprised by the tone that you've seen in some newspapers I'm surprised because I feel like a lot of like East Asian like it's just nation is just not really reported on and it's always is often ignored and I think these scare mongering headlines are just you know thinking the worst and it's making everyone think and think irrationally and do irrational things and it's just you know cause I look like a frenzy where everyone's just scared and yeah I think it's just very unfairly the way that everything's been reported and there's much more information on the coronavirus via the BBC News website"

equivalent of six us dollars a day selling food but now he says he's happy if he's able to bring home four we've been hungry since march in the first two weeks of the lockdown we finished off the very little cash we had and since we couldn't really go out to work we just borrowed money many people here are in a similar position they used to be part of what the government calls the informal sector they are either self-employed or run businesses providing goods and services but now they tell us many people here have lost their jobs and some have resorted to begging and it isn't happening in the capital manila alone local survey shows at least seven million families have experienced hunger at least once in the past three months that's a record high of more than 30 percent the highest incidence of hunger since 2014. the survey comes as the country is well into its seventh month of community quarantine one of the longest ever implemented by a government in the world the philippine government imposed a lockdown when the coronavirus pandemic broke out but it pushed the country into one of its worst economic recessions in decades the government says it is doing the best it can it has given out cash to millions of filipinos and says it hopes to give more we are saddened about this that is why we are up in the economy to restart jobs and to generate more income for those most affected but others say more could be done there has been permanent damage done to livelihood to jobs and there needs to be a more sustained response to this problem i think we need to dispel that notion that there isn't enough funding there is funding it's just not being used in the more appropriate interventions there is enough funding for infrastructure projects of local politicians this is a community inside one of the country's top business districts people here tell us life has always been difficult but now they fear it is getting worse jamel allendogen al jazeera manila we're going to expand this discussion now with isabel fry director of the studies in poverty and inequality institute on skype from johannesburg isabel thank you for joining us why don't we talk specifically about south africa first of all an african country which was hit very hard and which already had to deal with inequality and haves and have-nots how much worse has it got in your opinion thanks kamal as you point out south africa was facing dire economic inequalities uh prior to the impact of kovitz so we had we have one of the highest inequalities in terms of income and wealth our poverty levels more than one in two people were living below the poverty line one in four people with daily starvation and in addition to that our unemployment in terms of formal unemployment was uh 40 and that was in the first quarter of 2020 what we've seen since the impact of the formal lockdown from march is skyrocketing levels of poverty and unemployment in fact unemployment figures were released earlier this morning what we've seen is that the former labor market itself has shrunk so far more people are now dependent on on livelihoods that they can scrape through inco informal economic activity unfortunately as a result of the fact that there is such widespread poverty there are very few people who can support the informal economy and so you have a very negative cycle of poverty which reinforces poverty and then of course the formal sector of the economy that very small um elite formal sector um continues to to grow with the commodity export um so we've seen that sorry to interrupt isabelle do people have any it's a strange word to use here but hope is there any hope that things could start to improve return to the levels they were if not get better at least get them back on an even footing it's a really important question and i think on a day-to-day basis that hope that might have been there um start with increasingly shrinks what we saw at the beginning of lockdown was a really strong response by the state the rollout of cash transfers to people um and the hope that that would increase with time what we've seen is that fewer and fewer people are actually becoming eligible for the receipt of this and so as the unemployment grows and the impact of unemployment on um sort of family uh handouts and that kind of of indirect support increases people's hope is becoming um far less strong in terms of future recovery obviously you specialize in south africa and africa but i think the the the problems that the government faces there are replicated in many other places and the simple fact they've gone into recessions money is not being generated and the amount of government can do can long term it could end up being quite limited it is a really tough situation what we see within the sadiq region is that a lot of the income is generated by commodity exports that continues but the question is how much of that is retained by the state in terms of tax as opposed to being taken out and beneficiated by countries uh globally i think that uh for our region the global supply chain is really precarious so the exports of a number of goods um such as cut flowers for instance uh that affects people's livelihood the question is also however political will and priorities if the state is determined to spend on people's well-being that kind of financial financing can be found whether it's global international funders and and all borrowers isabelle fry joining us from johannesburg we thank you very much for your time do appreciate it thank you

It’s estimated that over 10 million Filipinos lost their jobs and livelihoods to the pandemic. Many are starving, especially those living in slums. 
 
16-year-old Leia lives with her mother, 23 other siblings, nieces and nephews in a slum at Tondo, Manila. In order to feed herself and her family, she breaks quarantine restrictions to look for food scraps and leftover produce in markets. 
 
While community initiatives have tried to help the urban poor, donations are quickly drying up in this extended six-month lockdown.

Duterte's remarks contradict those of his health officials who have said that while people are urged to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, it was voluntary.

Many residents in Manila were displeased with the threat, saying it was wrong and harsh to force those who choose not to get vaccinated.

Because we have this vaccine now, we feel fully protected when we go on duty. I feel hopeful that this pandemic will end soon and that I can finally go home to my 3-year-old son and husband and hug them, kiss them. That’s the advantage I feel with this vaccine as a healthcare worker.

With this vaccine, we feel that we are protected and that we also protect our patients. As health workers, we must not be the carrier, we must be the one protecting patients. We must not get infected so that we can continue our service as healthcare workers.”

34,o1kPskxFkQ8,Coronavirus: Philippines introduces stricter COVID-19 lockdown measures amid surge in cases,"Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte said Sunday his government would introduce a stricter lockdown in the capital Manila as it attempts to reign in a surge in COVID-19 cases.

Duterte said Manila and nearby provinces would be placed under a two-week enhanced community quarantine that would remain in effect until Aug. 18. Some businesses and public transit will be closed during the period and work and quarantine passes would be required as movements are restricted
.
The enhanced measures come after local groups representing some 80,000 doctors and a million nurses called for tighter controls, claiming the country was losing the battle against the novel coronavirus pandemic.

The Philippines recorded 5,032 additional COVID-19 infections on Sunday-- the country’s largest single-day increase-- bringing the total number of cases in the island nation to more than 100,000. The death toll is now above 2,000.

45,Ji47WRv2tQE,Philippines Cremate Coronavirus Victims,"Crematoriums in the Philippines cremate coronavirus victims, Sunday, May 3. 

Families of COVID-19 victims in the Philippines are being denied traditional death rites in favor of hurried, impersonal cremations, with virus restrictions often meaning they are forbidden a last look at their loved ones.

It is a painful and disorienting process for both the families and crematory workers that has upended the Philippines' intimate rituals of laying the dead to rest.

Burial is the norm in the Catholic-majority nation, and it usually follows a days-long display of the embalmed body at home or in a chapel.

But due to the pandemic authorities are encouraging rapid cremations -- though quick burials are still allowed -- of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 deaths.

Wakes are barred in these cases and hospitals must seal remains in plastic and send them directly to crematories or funeral homes.  

The number of coronavirus cases in the Philippines reached 9,223 with 607 deaths according to figures from the Johns Hopkins University.

#Coronavirus #India #ChinaCoronavirus",2020-01-30,1256305,8789,3138,UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg, in many parts of China this is the new normal very few people on the streets and the usually crowded public transport system Albert empty like here in Shanghai every passenger has stopped and every passenger screened for signs of the coronavirus it's fine our temperature was taken both getting on and off the train everyone has a mask on I feel relieved it may look like a country grinding to a halt but this is China's response to a mass public health emergency one week after these drastic measures were introduced the numbers of infected still keep climbing up people are anxious they prefer to stay at home and not to go out on the streets or wear a mask when they go out on the streets this here is a major tourist destination usually this area is quite busy with people walking around having snacks sightseeing now people prefer staying at home nobody really knows whether the measures the government has taken will be able to contain the virus so people are taking their own measures of precaution and that means minimizing social contact as much as they can elsewhere a lack of basic necessities and information are eroding confidence in the authorities in Hong Kong people have been queuing since 2:00 a.m. hoping to buy face masks the Hong Kong government should do like Macau's and say every resident can only buy ten pieces that way every single Hong Kong person could have a face mask to wear right as the second plane load of repatriated Japanese nationals touched down in Tokyo it caused some to wonder what this type of outbreak could look like if it happened during the Olympics here in July I take it as a wake-up call for us to take precautions against an outbreak like this especially towards the Olympics yes Japan is naive I think Japan should step up measures in South Korea the government is building a containment facility for those infected people here fear for their safety the governor and Minister should come here and try to find a point of compromise what are they doing bringing troops here are we in a battle this is such nonsense they're really creating a mood of fear in South Korea as in many other countries some residents feel the government's response to the crisis has lacked the apparent intensity and clarity of China's all right let's get some analysis on this story now we can speak to virologist Ian Jones from the University of Reading in England hi Ian good to have you here on DW I would ask you about the raft of measures that we've seen countries take to try to contain this outbreak multiple countries evacuating their citizens from affected areas we've seen China shutting down or locking down entire cities is this the right approach to stop this from spreading it's the right approach at the current time time will tell whether or not it's been effective in either stopping or slowing the progress of the virus I think as the numbers continue to rise it looks increasingly likely likely that this will become a pandemic and will eventually spread around the world we've seen as you said this is spreading and we see in first cases reported in the Philippines in India these are densely populated countries in how worrying is that you if we look at the efforts now to try to contain the spread yes it is worrying for two distinct reasons one is as you say these are very dense populations so the opportunity for transmission among people is much higher than it would be in a low population density country but in addition to that these are areas of the world which also have quite a hide burden of respiratory disease particularly things like TB and until the virus gets there we really don't know what to expect in terms of the severity of the infection in those target populations and you said this could become a pandemic how dangerous is this virus in comparison to other diseases other outbreaks we've seen like SARS in 2003 for example it certainly lost much less in serious than SARS the case fatality rate for SARS was around about 10 percent currently this is running around 2 percent that is still pretty high it would at that number it would be almost like the Spanish influenza at the early part of last century however if it's true that there are many more infected people than the confirmed cases then the actual fatality rate is somewhat lower than that and more like a seasonal influenza which perhaps could be coped with more easily by the existing health resources the World Health Organization is set to decide today whether they should declare this a global health emergency should they do so I mean what would that change or whether they should do so or not depends on them and the data that they have at hand which I don't have I would guess perhaps that on this occasion they didn't on the last occasion but on this occasion they will consider it a global health emergency there's been sufficient spread internationally I think and what that would do was just mobilize more resources with alerts barriers up country boundaries and maybe alert healthcare systems that they need to put mitigation processes in place all right Ian Jones speaking to us from the University of Reading in England thank you for your insight

speculation that it could be linked to a SARS virus that killed hundreds of people in 2003 a mysterious pneumonia has gripped China with scores hospitalized by the illness Chinese authorities first notified the World Health Organization on January 11th that they had discovered a novel coronavirus SARS Kove - and that it had already infected 41 people in the who Bay province that had caused one death due to the disease that it causes called Koba 19 On January 12 the who came out with a statement and they decided that pending more investigations there is no big threat and there is no need to impose any travel restrictions on China the next week saw cases appear from Thailand Japan all the way to Nepal in the USA On January 22nd the death toll in China was at 17 with more than 550 infections and finally on January 3rd Wuhan was placed under quarantine On January 30th the who declared Koba 19 a global emergency for all of these reasons I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern over the global outbreak of novel coronavirus the sobering fact is that it took 19 days to go from 41 cases to more than 7,000 bringing us to today March 22 2020 a total of three hundred six thousand cases thirteen thousand deaths and eighty six thousand recoveries in 181 countries 110 countries have reported confirmed cases of the total deaths and the UK is now eight de piel casamento PFF asada propagation reviews have we been able to eradicate the virus despite our best efforts we have therefore made the assessment that kovat 19 can be characterized as a pandemic earlier this year people were downplaying the seriousness of the virus saying that it couldn't compare to the 2009 swine flu or even the seasonal flu however a couple of months down the line it's alarming rate of growth and its impact everyday life are painting a very somber picture if history is to be believed this is far from over and we're looking at at least one year of getting it under control in the Philippines it seems like we have just begun what are the pyramid Ola for sick people sokovia die T the number of Filipinos testing positive for the corona virus is rising by the day horrid its second case of the disease and the country's first novel coronavirus related death community quarantine is hereby imposed entire of Metro Manila on January 30th the Department of Health announced the first case in the country on March 5 and 6 the fourth and fifth cases are confirmed on March 16 that number rose to 142 cases and then the next two days saw 50 more people added to that list as of March 22 we have 380 confirmed cases this is what makes the virus so frightening experts have said that the virus has a 2 to 14 days incubation period on average this means that it can take as long as 14 days for you to show symptoms finally realize that you're sick 80% of these cases are considered mild as we're so in the midst of it there seems to be a new study coming out about its transmission every day but it's safe to say that person-to-person contact is the main method of transmission tonight authorities confirm it is being spread from human to human but what does that actually mean well if you're sitting next to someone who has the infection and suddenly he sneezes coughs or spits they could potentially spray you at respiratory droplets that contain the virus unfortunately these droplets can also be found on a hand before reaching out for a handshake or on a surface that was touched not everyone has hit the same way by the disease the most at-risk being the elderly people would a compromised immunity system and anyone would prior health conditions that being said a lot of people can carry the virus only have mild symptoms and still infect other people wreaking havoc and potentially infecting people at risk the most vulnerable population are those actually aged 50 and above their cases are much worse they have comorbidities such as diabetes hypertension and as such also those patients in the younger age groups who have comorbidities are also greatly affected this is why people have been wearing protective masks hoarding alcohol and washing their hands all the time since its seen as the first way to avoid getting the virus washing your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds with soap not touching your eyes mouth and nose with dirty hands and covering your cough or droplets with a mask back to those numbers whatever official count is given at any point you can be sure that the actual number of cases is much higher since the only way to confirm if someone has coded 19 is to test them meaning if testing is slow the number of confirmations will be as well unless mass testing is carried out we will never truly know how many people are carrying the virus most experts are saying that you should take the number of cases you have in your country and multiply it by 10 unless mass testing is currently being done to have a more realistic figure whatever number you find will then continue to grow exponentially every day this will only get worse as the infection spread from Metro Manila to all the other provinces in the country where they might not be as well equipped it can reach that peak polska and seventy-five thousand unwitting microRNA infection South Korean Singapore focus on mass testing from the onset their number one priority was to test as many people as they could so that they could proceed to contact tracing meaning identifying every person that potentially came in contact with someone who had the disease and testing them as well this would then help their agencies identify hotspots places where a high concentration of people had the virus and control those areas as best they could forcing the confirmed cases to go to the hospitals and placing persons under investigation in home quarantine that's an ideal situation but even with that the infection continued spreading but is now doing so at a slower rate some of the have been coming in because of fever most of them have having cuffs and coats for the past couple of days already and some would go to the emergency room because of difficulty of breathing if you have the following symptoms make sure to contact the proper authorities [Music] while waiting for mass testing to be possible the other option is a lockdown and the Philippines is not the only place in the world where this is happening officials have suspended public transport outgoing flights to be cancelled and train service is shut down we're in travellers coming from the UK and Ireland have been banned from entering the United States and northern Italy locked down but unlike Asia Europe has open borders if a lockdown seems to be the most effective way as proven in China to flatten the curve the curve people refer to is basically a graph that shows how exponential the rate of infection can be if people are left to still go out to concerts use public transport or attend mass gatherings and the country already has a high rate of infected people then logically more people will get infected take the example of Italy they went from about 150 cases to 5,000 cases in only two weeks now if you lessen the number of people in a certain location tell them to stay away from each other and then eventually seclude them the virus will still spread however it'll do so at a much slower pace this is called social distancing basically staying away from other people and trying to stay home as much as possible experts say social distancing is a way to prevent spreading kovat 19 malignant supermarket pero Hangang cashier my de stanza Amba wat Kost America not only does this help reduce the rate of infection but it also allows the hospitals that are currently being flooded with cases to be able to accommodate people and help them recover before being flooded with another wave of patients the last thing we need is a choke point in the hospitals because the less people they can treat the more people will be getting sick and not getting the proper treatment possibly infecting other people and making the death toll rise because of a lack of beds and hospitals and the proper equipment to treat extreme cases of a particular kind of pneumonia this is already starting to happen some of the hospitals have been calling in donations for PPE and I think it's the best thing that the hospitals need right now because it's the most important gear a frontline ER should have this is what flattening the curve is all about and this buys time for people around the world to help patients recover and eventually try and find a vaccine or a proven method of treatment regardless of where you are social distancing shouldn't practice as much as possible avoid going out the safest place right now is actually in your homes as lockdowns and travel bans become the norm worldwide from China to Spain Italy Germany Paris to New York there's more and more talk about the economic impact of this lockdown do not travel abroad do not go overseas in lockdown with us our g7 countries basically some of the most developed in the world now as the Philippines is a developing nation this becomes even more burdensome not only are we at risk of higher infection rates because of living conditions in lower-income communities but since a majority of the population needs to work daily to be able to afford housing food stopping work completely will create even more hardships for them [Music] at my hospital and Poggenpohl really sanitation is also a luxury that isn't found in most urban poor areas in the metro so the virus could spread in those communities even faster the lockdown was very abrupt like the complete shutdown of public transport and no one was really ready for it creating a confusing wave of panic from March 11th onwards note Allah Karim Allah coming bounnam kadamba every day the national government and LG News are starting to come out with solutions to help workers with no pay the casual workforce and people who not be able to afford the basics during this lockdown there even talks of a stimulus package we tapped will likewise to go to rehabilitation for those displaced in their jobs for example due to this month-long suspension of mass transportation suspension of work as well while waiting for longer-term solutions to be put in place by the national government I think there is hope and that's all of us we should support our LG use in communities in any way that we can every day the private sector is also starting to do its part the private sectors involvement will hopefully avoid businesses having to close and in turn not being able to pay their employees and just creating a vicious cycle that will take months if not years to recover from if we stop the spread of the virus now the economic impact will be less important so what can you do first stop the spread of fake news and don't add to the noise it might confuse people on this time of information fatigue only get your news from verified sources second practice proper hygiene wherever you are clean your hands constantly and properly avoid touching any unnecessary surfaces use soap water alcohols aerosols whatever you have at your disposal to try and stay as clean as possible third if you have to go out for food runs and to acquire basic amenities practice strict social distancing and inform the people around you to do the same finally understand that if you're at home and have access to food know that you are part of the privileged few to try and help out the less fortunate communities where you can we should all stay at home but that doesn't mean it'll be as easy or as simple for everyone else around you the lack of income and food for the urban poor would lead to widespread hunger and frustration I hope that video kind of helped just condense all the information that's coming out because it's it's crazy like each time we turn on the news now it is that's all we hear and rightly so you know it's a worldwide pandemic it's affecting each and every one of our lives in various ways but I'm a hundred percent sure of one thing is that after this the world will be a very very different place after this little spiel that I'm gonna do to you right now or to put a bunch of information in terms of how you can help and donate if you do have the capacity to donate please do so I think would be very useful we're also going to be putting a bunch of links in the description box below where you can try and get some more information on either organizations or nonprofits or just people in general who are trying to help and who need cash to do so if you want to kind of donate things for front liners for food and protective equipment to PPE for frontline front liners you can check out Rach Edie relief they've been doing this for a long long time gang leads it and she's been absolutely wonderful each time there's a crisis in the Philippines so she can be trusted a hundred percent there's one called PAGASA ph that go into communities and see how much people actually need and help them get the groceries or whatever they need for that week and i think that's really great and create this Manila does one as well we'll put their information in the bottom me because we're currently well I'm stuck in Australia because supporters of both Australia and the Philippines are currently closed so I don't know how long I'm gonna be staying here for those of you who are stuck like me and can't return to the Philippines I'm currently stuck in Australia both borders in both countries are closed there's one that was put up by liners I've been working with minders for a long long time called one voice for peanuts and it's great because you can actually donate through a credit card which is the only thing I can do because I can't do bank transfers or anything like that up as of the moment so I'll be doing the cash from this video if it makes anything to that to one voice for the peanuts if it doesn't I'll be also donating my personal cash to one voice through the peanuts as well because I think they will know exactly what to do with it what's important these times is you try to help out where you can and everyone should stay positive even though that's something that's very tough to do but that's one way to stay mentally healthy is just to be positive to be a voice of change to be helpful to your neighbors the community everyone who's around you and just not fall into this spiral of just negativity because it's never going to be putting you in a good place so if you're in a good space mentally then you're gonna be able to provide positive and affect positive change in other people and I think that is kind of like the purpose of you know being human it's being humane to other humans if that makes sense so thanks for watching I know it's kind of a gloomy video we're gonna be doing more cooking videos because we're all pretty much stuck at home so if you guys want to see any types of recipes or any way to be counter fifty and crafty let me know in the comments below and we get to work on those [Music]"

""Shoot them dead.""  Duterte's orders to the military were televised after media reports of a disturbance in the capital Manila, where residents were protesting about government food aid.

On Thursday, however, the national police chief said police understood that Duterte was merely demonstrating the seriousness of the situation in his most recent address and that no one would be shot.

The city has been under lockdown since March 15.

74,R0i7i80ToUM,The Philippines Covid Economic Recovery,"Produced by: Behind Asia Team

Inquiries: behindasian@gmail.com
Brought to you by the Behind Asian Team.",2023-04-22,17372,402,131,UCz2MlDYRidHyyubC4r7dQcA," When Covid-19 took over the world in 2020, 
many economies collapsed. From the world’s   most developed countries to the poverty-stricken 
nations. Each of them experienced hardship after   hardship. In the region of Southeast Asia, 
however, there was one country that contracted   the most in its economy; The Philippines. 
The archipelago country in 2020 incurred   a GDP contraction of about 9.5 percent, 
which was the worst in the entire region,   and one of the worst in the entire world. The 
cause for such downfall as suggested by economists   and analysts was simply a lack of government 
support and proper interventionist policies.   It was reported that consumption spending had 
fallen dramatically due to undeterred lockdowns,   which was followed by a fall in investment 
spending and most importantly a small economic   intervention aid. For a clear understanding, data 
published by the Asian Development Bank compared   Covid-Response spending in the big economies 
of Southeast Asia stretching until November   2020. They found that Malaysia had spent about 
22.7 percent of its GDP in response spending,   which is about $2,562 dollars per capita. Followed 
by Thailand at 15.9 percent, or about $1,211   dollars and Indonesia at 10.9 percent, or 432 
dollars per capita. The Philippines, however,   was the weakest of all, which could explain 
the big contraction. The government had only   spent 5.88 percent in terms of GDP or only 202 
dollars per capita. Hence, such a small government   response immediately resulted in the worst 
contraction in the entire Southeast Asian region. Such poor government planning would make it easy 
for people to blame the policymakers. However,   we are way past the issues constraining 
the Philippines' economy now. In fact,   the Philippines economy, based on macroeconomic 
data, had already jumped back up. Data from the   Central Bank of the Philippines sees that 
in 2019, the gross domestic product of the   Philippines was about 19.5 trillion pesos 
or about 376 billion US dollars. By 2022,   it has registered over 22 trillion pesos or 404 
billion US dollars. While it may in numbers show   the Philippines is in a better position even 
pre-covid, the most important question, however,   is better off in addressing the bounce of the 
Philippines' economy. How did the Philippines   beat the worst health and economic crisis it has 
experienced since the Pacific war? How did the   Philippines bounce back from one of the worst in 
the entire region in 2020 to becoming one of the   best performers in 2022. Indeed, the Philippines 
in 2022 posted GDP growth of over 7.6 percent,   which was also the fastest in four decades. 
So how did the Philippines beat Covid-19? Well, we can first start with what truly 
went wrong in 2020. To summarize this as   we noted earlier, it was simply due to a lack 
of government response. The government just did   not push enough stimulus to help the falling 
economy. With little help from its citizens,   Filipinos had no choice but to spend less and less 
as their incomes, savings, and others continued   to deplete. As consumer spending drops, so does 
economic activity. The reason for such, however,   is often a critical point of the government’s 
inaction. Many policymakers and analysts have   pointed out that the government even was 
very slow in responding to the crisis. A   failure in planning and communication 
as one article pointed out in 2021. Government response and spending, however, are 
important as we understand just exactly how and   why we believe that the Philippines beat covid-19. 
The economy immediately bounced back, in fact,   in 2021, when the same data from the Central Bank 
showed that the gross domestic product was already   close to the levels in 2019. And here, the answers 
are obviously mixed again. People would state   that it is all but due to what people suggest as 
“revenge spending”, a concept that simply means   the lockdown is over and people are now spending 
more and more. Well, that could truly be an   answer, but it is very much lacking. Consumer 
spending was not the only source of growth in   2021 and 2022. The strong answer on our basis is 
government spending. Indeed, what was once lacking   in 2020, continued to be a strong indicator 
in the Philippines for 2021, 2022, and beyond. Government spending has slowly increased since 
2016, the year when former president Rodrigo   Duterte took office. Data from the World 
Bank shows the general government's final   consumption expenditure as a percentage of GDP, 
which shows that in 2015 it was only 10.9 percent,   but by 2021, it rose to over 15.6 percent. 
While data has not been published yet,   the Government's final consumption expenditure 
from the central bank has likewise shown an   increase of over 10 percent from 2021 to 2022. 
What we are getting here is that the government   of the Philippines has continued to increase 
its spending during Covid-19, but much more   after Covid-19. This way many analysts have 
then stated that it is now due to the strong   government spending that is propping up growth 
in the economy. One paper from the First Metro   Investment Corporation of Metrobank Group has 
stated that “consumption, services and government   spending has driven growth for 2022”. Indeed, a 
separate article in 2021 from the Philippine News   Agency also stated that “Government spending 
contributes more to economic recovery”. But one may ask how this constitutes economic 
growth. What is the government doing? Are they   giving money to the people to spend? Well, both 
yes and no. The most important part of government   spending in the Philippines since the entrance 
of Rodrigo Duterte is due to infrastructure.   The construction of infrastructures after 
infrastructures has impacted the Philippine   economy massively. It is not just about the 
impacts and financial effects of these built   infrastructures, but rather, the continued 
effects of employing labor while constructing   these infrastructures. Over the past few 
months, we have seen unemployment in the   Philippines continue to drop, which on top of 
that a rise in consumer spending. This was in   part because of the private sector, but also 
because the government has continued to spend   on its infrastructure and economy which boosted 
job demand in the labor market. One cannot simply   ignore this fact as it has been shown in several 
budgets across Rodrigo Duterte’s tenure, on the   notion that government spending must increase. 
The government itself, which poured over to the   succeeding administration of President Marcos 
has too favored a strong government. President   Marcos’ first national budget of 2023 saw a big 
deficit of spending of about 6.1 percent of GDP,   which means they are seeking to spend over 5 
trillion pesos but only make 3.6 trillion pesos   in revenue. Which may at first glance seem like 
they are also ambitious, it may, however, also   mean that they would need to borrow more money to 
fund operations, or else print them in their own   central bank. But this topic is not the highlight 
of today’s video, so we will leave it at that. What one needs to understand, however, is that the 
government in both cases of Duterte and Marcos,   despite underspending during Covid-19 for the 
former, is continuously spending more and more,   to the point that it helped the latter. The 
miraculous GDP growth of 2022 was not solely   due to the impact of revenge spending, as 
resulted in a low unemployment rate. The   labor market was strong, some have suggested 
that the private sector enabled unemployment   to drop to such levels. However, one too cannot 
ignore the fact that the government has been   spending rapidly throughout the economy. A 
fiscal deficit of about 7.6 percent in 2022,   was in fact, experienced. Much higher than the 
projected deficit for the year 2023. But anyway,   as we look forward into the future, the Marcos 
administration which favors a strong fiscal   deficit in its national budget may continue 
to show the strong hand of the government in   the economy. Do let us know what you think. Do 
you think that the government is on the right   track to spend more money than it makes? Or 
do you think that this is a crazy notion due   to the possible issues it may bring? A strong 
government with its expenditures, after all,   is also not something that some economists favor. 
Some have coined its inefficiency. Nevertheless,   it was all but necessary at a time of 
unprecedented economic and health disruption,   and a time when the Philippines was truly 
lagging behind its neighboring countries   when it comes to government spending. Let 
us know down below, Thanks for watching!"

began it's just that when the case loads stabilize then the government kind of loosens the restrictions a bit but we've always been under some form of community quarantine that's the catchphrase here and people are tired and especially because they don't see much of a new strategy or plan from the government on how to combat the pandemic and people are now getting desperate to get vaccinated of course to protect themselves and be able to go out and provide for their families and they're also desperate for government aid which doesn't cover everybody it just includes a segment of the population the poorer segment of the population and at twenty dollars per person it doesn't cover much honestly so it doesn't sound like a lot of people would rate the government highly when it comes to its performance combating the pandemic yes um well the the the general sentiment here is that the government has done quite poorly in addressing this pandemic it has hinged the approach to vaccination but there are too few shipments of vaccines coming in and those vaccines that are on hand well the rollout is rather slow because there aren't enough resources and manpower to be able to open new vaccination centers so people tend to crowd around whatever centers are available and then to add to all that are issues of politics and even corruption just the other day state auditors flagged 67 billion pesos or about 1.5 billion dollars worth of what they call deficient funds from the department of health basically what it means is these funds were either not spent or were spent but are not accounted for and they could have gone to the government's pandemic response effort it's a huge scandal here in the philippines now and the government has not been able to satisfactorily explain it now i want to talk about vaccines one of the things we've seen play out has been the struggle for developing countries to obtain vaccines good ones that work because we know that the chinese sino-vac and cynofarm once have lower efficacy rates what is the philippines using and has it been difficult to get them the huge bulk of vaccines available here is the sign of that one and like you said there is considerable hesitancy and reservation as to how effective they are especially since uh it's assumed that what's driving this current surge in new infections is that more virulent delta variant of the coronavirus uh just to illustrate that point some people delayed signing up for the job to wait for the more reputable brands like pfizer and moderna to come in and when they did come in people came out in droves and lined up causing considerable chaos in some vaccination centers so safe to say it's really hard to get a vaccine here you have to fall under certain categories either you're a health worker you're a frontline worker you're elderly or you are in firm otherwise you are not even qualified to sign up for the job yet and even when you do sign up for one you have to be you have to wait weeks or even months to get that call from your local government to go and line up sounds very very frustrating jc gotenga thank you so much for joining us you

[Music] it is 60 more transmissible than alpha in uk variant it is three times more contagious than the original stars called two virus seems to be deadlier patients also seem to get sicker and younger ages can also develop severe disease young delta has a thousand times more virus particles than the original virus faster time from becoming infectious using a sabinas in that in a close contact at least 15 minutes one two [Music] had already overwhelmed countries like indonesia and thailand by the end of july delta is now in 132 countries and that list is growing [Music] the world health organization warns delta is becoming the globally dominant variant of the virus and it has become as contagious as chickenpox health experts and scientists are concerned because of its worrying set of traits it's highly transmissible there's increased risk of hospitalization hospital stay is usually prolonged and people who've only had one dose are still vulnerable what does this mean and archovit19 vaccines in the philippines effective against delta [Music] the good news is that all of the who emergency use listed vaccines do protect against developing severe disease hospitalization and death due to the delta variant so there are studies now from countries where there is a predominance of delta variant to show that people who've been vaccinated are much less likely to end up in hospital and you need the full course of vaccination in order to give you that full immunity to protect you against the delta variant in rare cases fully vaccinated people get infected infection is usually mild but why do some people still get sick even if they are fully vaccinated let's put things in perspective now there is no such thing as vaccine that will prevent 100 of the infections so i'm not defending cyanobab in kurus indonesia where around 5 000 health workers were vaccinated with cyanobac dozens got hospitalized from covet 19 but most of those who got infected despite being vaccinated were asymptomatic and only needed to self-isolate you want to avoid the severe outcomes and that's what the vaccines are for you want to minimize hospitalization you want to minimize critical cases you want to minimize deaths vaccines also need to work with your immune system so it's important to keep a healthy lifestyle vaccine it reduces your risk but if you are exposed every day and if your immune system is not healthy enough to produce the immune response that it needs to do when pathogen is there you are not optimally protected if you're in a country where vaccination isn't widespread you need to continue practicing safety health measures like wearing a mask how about the russian-made sputnik vaccine that is not in the who list but is used in the philippines its developer claims it's 90 percent effective against the delta variant i would say it's still acceptable because of course we are seeing a few numbers below as compared to the previous one but it's still helpful while the world waits for more data on sputnik v some information available can also help us understand how the vaccine might perform sputnik is a viral vector vaccine and it's similar to astrazeneca so even if it's not the same vaccine we can sort of have an idea of how this kind of vaccine will work against delta and we are seeing with astrazeneca if you get the two doses it's still really effective in preventing hospitalization and death as international travel slowly resumes some countries are already limiting the kinds of vaccines that will be recognized take the case of singapore a frequent destination for work in leisure for filipinos and indonesians synovac a vaccine widely used in the philippines in indonesia is not in its recognized list sputnik another vaccine administered in the philippines is not on any country's list except russia these lists are not static and could expand soon to include other vaccines the who and other groups in kovacs urged countries to give equal recognition to wh o approved vaccines only recognizing some would create a two-tier system widen the global vaccine divide and drive further inequality to keep vaccines working scientists and health experts say widespread vaccination all over the world is urgent over 3.5 billion doses have been administered worldwide but 75 have gone to only a handful of rich countries why get vaccinated if you can still get sick they're two very good reasons to get vaccinated the first is to protect yourself from getting severely ill if you catch the infection but secondly you could pass it on to others why do you want to take the risk of doing that why do you want to be one person in the chain of transmission what we need to do in the world today is to break those chains of transmission get a control on this disease vaccination will make lockdowns and heart measures unnecessary making sure more people are vaccinated as soon as possible is crucial to ensure variants do not gain the upper hand scientists in japan report the lambda variant of interest may already be showing signs of this threat we are lucky because up to now vaccines are still working against the variants but it could happen that in the next couple of months there will be a variant that's really significantly affecting vaccine efficacy and we will be in a different situation

96,lczwrm68u6I,🇵🇭 COVID-19: Could the Philippines see an India-style surge? | The Stream,"The Philippines is in the throes of one of the worst Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia, topping one million total infections last week. 
 
The country now has the second-highest number of infections and deaths in Southeast Asia after Indonesia and health experts are warning of a possible ""India-style"" wave. 

Although the government has struggled to obtain vaccine supplies, vaccine hesitancy is proving a bigger challenge. According to a March survey by Pulse Asia, six out of 10 Filipinos expressed safety concerns and were therefore unwilling to get immunized. In an attempt to assuage those fears, Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte last week received his first vaccine dose live on Facebook.

Rights group Amnesty International says what it calls the government's inadequate response to the pandemic amounts to ""a serious human rights issue."" 
 
In this episode of The Stream, we talk to those on the frontline and ask them what is needed to address the surge and keep the healthcare system from crumbling.

#COVID19",2021-05-04,144776,1546,1038,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg, [Music] hi i'm femi okay i don't need to tell you how many countries around the world are struggling with the coronavirus today on the stream we focus on the philippines have a look here on my laptop covered 19 mortality rate by country in south east asia this is the philippines look at where that bar goes that line on the graph grows making the philippines the second highest in terms of covert 19 infections and casualties in southeast asia that is the graph this is what the surge looks like in reality we are going to be talking about the philippines and the situation there earlier we spoke to gyorgy engelbrecht from the international crisis group and this is what he told us so the philippines is not a stranger to disasters they can be natural or human-made hazards but kobe 19 is a different type of beast the virus does not only attack the fragile health system of the country the economy was hit as well showcasing the rifts between rich and poor meanwhile higher food prices are exerting an additional strain prospects for economic recovery are uncertain with presidential elections coming next year filipinos will also cast a vote on government's performance resilience in the communities remain strong but how long can this resilience last and its continuing challenges and an uncertain future that was one analyst perspective but what is yours you can join our conversation by jumping into the youtube comments section and asking our guests your questions so let's talk to the guests let's say hello dr pauline convocal hello doctor nice to see you hello ambassador hello emmeline as well welcome to the stream dr convocal introduce yourself to our international audience tell everybody who you are and what you do good day everyone thank you family for the introduction and also i'm dr pauline conwakar i'm the immediate past president of the philippine college of emergency medicine and i am an active clinician so i'm currently going on duty as an attending emergency physician in many hospitals here in the metro and two other hospitals in the region thanks for joining us hello ambassador welcome please introduce yourself to our global audience yes i'm jose mourinhos i'm the philippine ambassador to washington d.c welcome hello emily nice to have you tell everybody who you are what you do very important for today's conversation hi and thank you femi uh my name is emerilyne hill i'm the deputy director for research of amnesty international and i'm also a filipino lawyer welcome doctor i am looking at some pictures that you sent us from earlier on you were working earlier on today and i'm just looking at these two pictures what are we seeing here how do we know this is a surge okay so it has already been really declared that there's a surge so there were really sustained um spikes in the numbers we have we're seeing increased uh trends for the past three a month even and what you're seeing here are the tents um that for patients that are waiting to be taken inside the formal emergency department so this is part of the expansion of the capacity of our hospital to take in patients and they're waiting in line to vacant beds inside the hospital you're very kind because you've obviously protected the the identity of many of these people who are really suffering this doesn't even look like a hospital this looks like a temporary setup there are now field hospitals temporary hospitals in manila because doctor oh okay so um since we've been seeing surges and increasing trends obviously we can't take them all in so we just have to make do with uh whatever it is that we have so we have to put up tents increase our capacity by expanding space um adding more beds um even if this will be only in makeshift beds or even in wheelchairs so that i will still be able to attend to these patients outside our formal emergency departments emelina i'm really curious because we've all been in this global pandemic for over a year now but when when we use the phrase or the term surge that means something cause diff is different emilyn are you seeing something different in terms of your family your friends your relatives back at home definitely so as i said earlier i am a filipino lawyer i've been working as an international human rights lawyer for years but i am still very much a filipino lawyer and i have my family and my friends are still in the philippines and for the last few two weeks at least six friends of mine have passed away um because of kovid and this is really very that's not even counting um family members of friends so this is this is really concerning for me because again this is not about people who cannot afford um health care facilities but it's really now just a matter of people cannot access healthcare facilities because there is not enough to go around ambassador i want to bring you into the conversation but first i would like to play a little clip this is rosette liquette she's a hospital director and uh we just got this comment from her a little bit earlier so we can understand what is going on in hospitals particularly in manila have a listen have a look ambassador every hospital at the ncr especially the government hospitals they are now struggling we noted an increase in the number of cases just as we note that increase in the number of health workers being positive no in the past especially in the past since march ambassador who is running the covet 19 i would say the fight for covert 19 in the philippines who is in charge of that who is doing that practically down on the ground well the task force is actually headed by secretary carnitos galvez he's the one in charge and he's the one that i've been in touch with on a regular basis basically to help in procuring the vaccines coming from the united states i totally understand the situation in the philippines i know that it is really very critical and our health care system has uh is is really and it's a very critical stage right now and to me i i can really see that obviously the only solution or the light at the end of the tunnel that we've always been hearing are the vaccines and this is exactly what we're trying to do as far as we're concerned here in washington d.c uh talking to the pharmaceutical companies we've been in touch with them for more than a year now well almost a year actually and it's unfortunate that the supplies uh for for the vaccines especially coming from here has been very very tight and it's only recently that president biden approved vaccines to be made available for the world especially specifically the pfizer that can be exported now from the united states so this is really the work that we're doing here as far as the kovite 19 response is concerned our audience wants to speak to you uh ambassador and also doctor so i'm going to put this youtube comment to you this is from dr waterforos thank you for being part of the show dr furrows dr frost says my main concern is that for how long are we going to live like this is there any light at the end of the tunnel why isn't the who responding appropriately let me start with you doctor and then go to the ambassador for a response doctor light at the end of the tunnel what are you seeing are you seeing any light yeah i i have to agree with the ambassador that um indeed the vaccines is really the hope and the light at the end of the tunnel but we have to do something right now since we have a problem right now we have long queues there's crowding really in the emergency departments and it may be a grim picture of the current situation of the philippines and that vaccine serves as hope for all of us healthcare workers and the general public that um it may it may pull us out from the situation but currently the demand really and the crisis of the people really is that what must be done right now so all of those congestion all of those inadequacies in the field so they're really asking for help um on when where to seek help for access for the hospitals emeline go ahead did i jump in very quickly um because um indeed i agree with ambassador and agree with dr konbokar that vaccines are very important but um i think it's not it's only just one part of addressing this crisis this what's happening in the philippines now actually exposes the frailty of our health care system and how neglected our health care system has been for many many years and our sense always is that it has never been a framework by the philippine government and even with previous administrations it has never been um the healthcare system has never been seen from the lens as a human right as a right to health so um you you see facilities you see healthcare workers who are underpaid and who would rather go abroad to seek a better life to get paid better so vaccines is just one point but then emeline overall system let me let me bring this to you because this is really important this is something that that a conversation that is also happening on youtube so i want to bounce it off of you so sleeping panda says i'm concerned about the lack of adequate action by the government how filipino nurses are flocking to other developed countries because they're not getting adequately compensated in the philippines does that count as a human right definitely can you explain so um why are filipino some of them are actually many of them are my friends they're watching now friends who are in the united states working as nurses so i asked them to watch this show and many of them actually flee or go to the united states or here in london because they don't get adequate um they don't get adequately paid for their services for their skills in the philippines so in order to have a comfortable life in order to be able to pay for necessities in life they have to go somewhere else and that is definitely a lot of human rights rolled into one it does not only mean um an impact on the health care system in the philippines but it also goes to the human rights of the people who are not paid well so that they have to go to other countries in order to be paid well ambassador i have seen reports of the military you're talking about the task force the kobe task force in the philippines the military being accused of overstepping their power overstepping what they should be doing during a global pandemic how did you see those stories do you feel that there's any credibility to those stories and those complaints about the military well i'm not quite sure about what are they doing but i know that the the government is at least initially when they put on the lockdowns they needed to have obviously persons in authority to be able to implement that and the military was tasked to to be one of those in the front lines to be able to implement the laptops i think for a while it was successful but in the end obviously the the economy is starting to show with signs of of really becoming again critical a critical situation especially for the for the uh for those who work every day and they they are regular day wagers so so to speak uh just to uh just to uh uh mention some of the things that emilyn said i i agree that yes the healthcare care situation in the philippines is quite critical but of course no one ever foresaw a pandemic of this type that will ever happen during our time in this century and so the healthcare is now obviously suffering from that uh i i remember my brother who was the health secretary during the time of uh former president joseph estrada uh was one of those that pushed for universal care uh as one of the cornerstones of that administration and uh i think it has been recently passed and at the same time he was also one of those that pushed for generic medicine to be sold in the philippines you know medicines in the philippines are one of the most expensive ever and for a while the major pharmaceutical companies that we are now having to deal with right now especially coming from the united states have a very strong uh i would say they had quite a lot of power in the philippines that they could not get this pass through but again that was passed recently or at least not too long ago for generic medicines to be available and then to make it much cheaper for the majority of our people in the philippines dot i want to play this clip and this is this is a tragic story just one of many tragic stories coming out of manila over the last few weeks or so this is from angelo barrera who lost one of his parents to covet 19. he was searching for a hospital bed and he couldn't find one have a listen me and my family we've moved on or are trying to move on so we don't really entertain these thoughts anymore but you know maybe if we had a clear clear plan of action maybe we if we knew that hospitals were a bust um that you know we could have just relied on ourselves more rather than spend all that time five hours you know looking for a hospital to know a veil really doctor the way that angelo puts it is like if i if we'd only known hospitals were a bust it was like what was the point of spending five hours throwing our parent around manila what's the situation like now how do how do we address that because vaccines are not the immediate uh solution for that are they if i may just quickly um just say something since the universal healthcare was mentioned but sure the good ambassador that um indeed universal healthcare is very much really needed right now but um i believe that there can really be no true universal healthcare without emergency care so all of these things just um were exposed or highlighted by kobe so i agree that we were really not prepared nobody was prepared for kobe but it's just it just exposed so many inadequacies of the philippine healthcare system and we've never invested that much for decades so um emergency care is an integral part of universal healthcare and what was just manifested by by one of the those one of the uh the one who lost the parent is that in an ideal setting it should not be the patient or the patient's families who should be looking for hospitals to take them in so the system should have looked for a place for them all we need to do is just dial a number in an ideal setting and as easy as just a three-digit number to call where you can get advice or to go to but currently it's not really here in the philippines it's not we don't have a system yet um we're getting there but there's just so many numbers to remember and um they're left on their own um their own way looking through this maze of the metro and even in their own private uh cars because we don't have really an emergency medical services with competent emergency medical services staff so there's a long long way to go for the philippines so even before they leave their homes ideally should there should be already be a plan um where the nearest competent facility or any available bed for that matter so can i jump in there it can really be heartbreaking right evelyn got to build yes just to build on what um dr pauline convocat said um yes um totally um the implementation of universal health care and also the generic medicines act was a move was a step were steps forward in terms of um improving the health care system in the philippines but those are not enough and um i completely agree with dr convakar that um emergency care is um is a is a component an integral component of universal healthcare also in the philippines right now including people i know including family members of mine um an illness would still mean severe financial hardship so um this cannot be denied and um this we cannot um this is something that i'm still seeing until now in the philippines um i'm remembering what you said right at the beginning of our conversation which is the solution is going to be vaccines right it's not going to be a meat because i'm not sure where the beds are going going to come from uh dr confirkar showed us just from her shift earlier on today how people were just closely packed together in makeshift temporary hospitals so uh i'm just looking at and i want to share with our audience a picture of president duterte getting a vaccine which i believe was over a week ago i am wondering uh it was yesterday excuse me it was even sooner than i thought even more recent than i thought i'm i'm wondering ambassador what impact does that have seeing the president getting a vaccine what's that value well i i suppose most leaders all over the world that's one of the things that they do is to show that the vaccines are supposed to be safe and i i would like to assume that that is what the president of duterte was trying to show you know here in the united states we all know the success of their vaccine rollout obviously because of the resources that they have we are now seeing the numbers really go down dramatically and i understand from many states are beginning to open their economy because of the vaccine so i'm one of those that really truly believes that this is the only way out of this now it's very unfortunate that many countries all over the world including the philippines have very little access to these supplies because obviously countries the rich countries are the ones that are getting it and you mentioned something about the wh so we've been working with them through the covax facility that they set up and even then we still can't get uh enough of the supplies that we really needed it's coming in in trickles like for instance a pfizer that we've been working on for more than uh seven months now even before they were given the eoa uh it's only now that we were able to finish off the indemnity agreement that they required us to do so all of this we're all under the gun do you think ambassador let me let me just think out the outline do you think do you think the problem is because the philippines has a reputation for a corruption and lack of transparency so do you think that is part of the problem about now when you're in a crisis where you do need international help it might be a little bit on the slow side because of that reputation do you think those two things are connected no no well i'm not uh i don't think that that's the case because in our case for instance the wh i'm sorry the world bank and the adb are those that are uh ready to uh in fact they have uh standby uh credit for not only for the philippines but for many countries in asia including indonesia and they've kept and they're the ones that directly pay the pharmaceutical companies they have representatives here in washington dc we've had a couple of meetings with them they said we have the money for you but there are no vaccine supplies so it's really that is really the problem and and we're not the only ones that are suffering from this and that's why we have to depend on donations coming from other countries like china and also from uh from what i understand now israel is coming up and ready to help us and other uh smaller countries that have offered to help the philippines want to put one more thought into our conversation this one comes from christine cebilo who's a health and science reporter who is looking at now where do we go from here in the philippines how do we make sure fewer people are dying from covert 19. this is what she told us so with the philippines reaching one million copied 19 cases the medical societies and experts i interviewed all recommended basic epidemic response proper contact tracing expanded testing and strict isolation on top of weak implementation are the gaps in the health infrastructure another challenge is local government units are not used to align in response so the national government needs to guide them there are bright spots in some cities but we need consistency as simple as having the same contact tracing app and a centralized real-time dashboard on hospital occupancy which we still don't have either the government unifies its covered response or we wait for everyone to get vaccinated but with inefficient rollout and the limited vaccine supply that will likely take a while so dr convocat i'm also seeing questions on youtube where people are asking about vaccine hesitancy in the philippines so vaccinations are the answer to how do you reduce the number of deaths and and there's vaccine hesitancy what do you do as the medical profession to help people well okay we make them understand that really the vaccine is one way out of this pandemic um unfortunately really the vaccines um are not they're not coming in fast enough to for all of this spot for for most of our population to be vaccinated so um with regards to vaccine hesitancy i think the president having been vaccinated lately is a big optic it's a it's a good picture of um you know uh that the public may trust the vaccine and that um most of the healthcare workers are are are already vaccinated and they can speak for themselves as well on the trust for the vaccines but indeed it is really part of the problem of vaccination or the vaccine hesitancy that we need to understand that we need to make the public understand i'm just looking here my laptop to see how vaccinations are doing in southeast asia covered 19 vaccination race in asia at the top singapore this is this is uh doses administered per 100 of the population in selected asian countries singapore there is right at the top china a little bit further behind them and we have to go all the way down here to the philippines and then thailand is even lower so this is going to be an ongoing problem it's an ongoing challenge for people in the philippines dealing with the search right now dr convocal thank you so much ambassador appreciate you emilyn so much to talk about really thank you very much for helping us shine a light on the surge of covert 19 the case is there the casualties there and really what you need which are vaccinations a lot of them thank you so much for joining us on the stream and thank you youtube for being part of our conversation always appreciate you i will see you next time take care [Music] are we still on youtube no they know you

Elite police in the Philippines were activated, Thursday, July 16, to enforce a coronavirus lockdown in parts of metropolitan Manila.

The Special Action Force of the Philippine National Police was deployed to detain people who violated the quarantine regulations around Navotas City.

The city is under a two-week lockdown because of a continuous rise of coronavirus infections.

Most business were closed nationwide in March, but some have reopened to boost the economy, as unemployment soared and massive government funds dwindled for cash and food aid.

104,DS5bARgeR7Y,How will Philippine tourism recover after the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The tourism sector is one of the hardest, if not the hardest-hit sector by the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic has not only affected the country’s economy, but it has also caused the loss of thousands of jobs in the tourism sector. 

In this interview, Department of Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat discusses with INQUIRER.net reporter Neil Arwin Mercado the government’s plans moving forward to recover from the pandemic, including plans to allow foreign tourists from virus-free countries to visit select tourist spots here. 

But one question remains: Is the Philippines ready?

Webinar #47 
April 9, 2021 
“COVID-19 in the Philippines: What are the Scenarios for the next 12 Months?”  Special Topic 
Rising cases, crowded hospitals, new restrictions on movement, higher levels of fear and  frustration --- a month ago, it looked like things were improving, and then suddenly it feels like  we are back to square one. 
What does trend data tell us about the pandemic? What do we know about the spread of  SARSCoV2 at national and local levels? Will it get worse before it gets better? What about the  economy? What can we expect in the coming months? How should families prepare for what is  ahead? How should health workers prepare for what is ahead? 
Some of the assumptions will change because of the advances in the health sciences and  medicine. The vaccines will have an impact on disease transmission. Newer drugs are being  studied for treatment of moderate and severe COVID. People are slowly adapting and modifying  their behavior to protect themselves and survive. 
In the next episode of STOP COVID DEATHS, UP Professor of Economics, Dr. Toby Melissa  Monsod, opens the webinar with a perspective on the economy. The main presenter is Dr. John Q.  Wong, lead epidemiologist of the IATF and reactors are infectious disease specialist Dr. Cybele  Lara Abad from UP-PGH and pulmonologist Dr Aileen David Wang of the UP College of  Medicine. 
While we cannot gaze into a crystal ball, we can look up the data and see where we are-- and move  toward where we want to be in the coming year, together.

you okay good afternoon everyone um this is taken from publication we did have some time in november last year myself and a colleague okay at the onset of the kovit 19 crisis it was thought that strong macroeconomic fundamentals would carry the day for the country we were coming from about a decade of high and robust growth our credit credit ratings were at their highest ever our fourth quarter gdp growth in 2019 was second only to china in the assay m3 plus three thus in mid-march but march 16 2020 that i was saying do you have a power do you have a presentation no no they said no no slides okay no no no no no yeah go ahead look at this one you get slices yeah i don't know sorry sorry to interrupt okay go ahead sorry yeah okay um so uh yeah so in mid-march in mid-march last year economic managers reassured us that economic fundamentals are on our side and that even under the worst possible scenario the philippines will grow in 2020 and in the medium term by about six percent so this is when the lockdown happened so that's like the famous last words right this this has clearly not happened by the second quarter of 2020 we had a contraction of about 16 percent which is our lowest uh quarterly growth in four decades since 1981 and the second lowest in the asean plus three we were also predicted to have the worst projected economic growth outcome in 2020 of the sharpest reversal from country performance in 2019 among our neighbors so the question was why why despite strong economic fundamentals did the country do so poorly are managers largely blamed or accounted for this by describing the strict community quarantine imposed in march 2020 that was extended until the third quarter however this is a somewhat circuitous argument because the lockdown precisely suspended economic activity it restricted mobility of people we couldn't go out people couldn't work etc in order to hold the pandemic at bay and buy time for the health system to organize itself in other words the lockdown did not cause the economy to contract rather the economy was contracted it was activity was suspended as a response to the virus rather than blame the lockdown person a colleague and i had a different thesis we noted that the philippines version of the lockdown was seemed to be the longest and most stringent in the assay and plus 3 region other countries vietnam and even singapore south korea south korea or china did not use such an extreme measure nor use lockdowns for prolonged periods and so we post the hypothesis rather than the timing intensity or length of a country's lockdown per se do the different capacities to detect and respond to the covid19 outbreak account significantly for the different economic outcomes among countries in the region sadly we found the answer was yes implementing a cross-country model we found that stronger national capacities to detect and respond to emerging outbreaks are associated with better short-term economic outcomes for the philippines better prepared laboratory systems coming into the crisis could have saved up to 3.6 percentage points in lost gdp growth forecasted in 2020. what does this mean this is equivalent to about 700 billion pesos so if we had just been a little if we had just done our homework when uh you know everyone was doing that homework in the early 2000s and if we had listened to our own experts that we had to be better prepared for emerging outbreaks perhaps we would not have suffered such a contraction in the economy we also found evidence that the traditional channels via government spending to increase output and stabilize the economy are overshadowed by the importance of having specific core capacities precisely to detect and decisively respond to the covet 19 pandemic put another way if kovid 19 is not first well contained then government spending aimed at other things may not matter for economic recovery and could even make things worse the implication is clear health system capacity must be prioritized over and above other types of spending including build build build spending unfortunately the budget for 2021 does not quite reflect this if i'm not mistaken the 2021 budget decreases the budget of the doh and other related items by about 25 that may not be as accurate as before and increases allocations to dpwh and dotpr for infrastructure spending and now we see ncr again in an ecq but this time without allocations for any sort of ayuda to households in other words we're back at the relief stage and we don't even have that we don't even have recovery budget much less relief budget what is our challenge today we need to convince officials and stakeholders who are concerned for the economy and for economic recovery to focus on capacitating public health systems so that we can get out of this hole this is a big ask because they're just not accustomed to thinking in that way right but it would help to identify more precisely what capacities to invest in as a matter of priority in what sequence and where and at what level of the public health system national provincial city municipal clearly the crisis has proceeded at different speeds and intensities across the archipelago and so it may not make economic sense for all regions or cities to invest in the same capacities at the same time in the same sequence everywhere in other words a one-size-fits-all solution doesn't make sense so given budget and time constraints for instance should all provinces and cities be investing in a vaccination rollout now would it be more efficient and effective for instance for some regions and provinces to focus on developing better contact tracing infrastructure precisely to avoid what has happened in ncr i hope this webinar can help us answer these questions thank you okay thank you very much that's that's professor tobi monsaad of the school of economics of the university of the philippines and um we're going to keep toby you can stay right so toby will be with us in the panel and um we have a q a a q a box over there which you know you can put in questions there and we're actually going to ask our our panelists to answer questions that that come up so thank you so much toby for that uh that framing i think uh you know in this webinar we usually talk about more of the medical and the health and the public health side of stuff and uh occasionally we have had speakers like you we had professor pernia also speak at some time um on on the economics of it and um i think in the future we have to do more of it so thank you so much for for those opening remarks all right so um we have a uh we have a person on the street set of interviews that tvup prepares for us on the topic and our topic is um you know kovid is what are the scenarios for the next 12 months and i think we are all it's a good thing to be forward-looking so that we don't we don't get um mired in the difficult situation we are in right now so tvup has done some interviews so tvup please take the platform [Music] more than a year [Music] you know give it to science actually uh you you what is happening now give it to science data analytics maintain the the health protocol such as social physical distancing uh frequent washing of hands face shield face masks [Music] to prevent or to to minimize the increasing uh the increase of the the virus the spread of virus no padding related support 19 [Music] [Music] vaccination should be sped up [Music] improved procedures improved protocols improved testing and treating [Music] [Music] m [Music] thank you very much tvp and uh those who participated in in those short interviews we're going to the main part of our program which is uh we have our main presenter our topic is hovid19 what are the scenarios for the next 12 months and it is my pleasure to introduce um someone who is actually has actually been working very quietly behind the scenes throughout this whole pandemic but his work has been so powerful and he's an epidemiologist he's currently professor of the ateneo school of medicine and public health and he's the co-founder and senior technical advisor of epimetrics so dr john wong is a expert in many government panels when it comes to epidemiology and even in the assessment of medications or drugs that are used in the country so i'm very pleased to welcome uh john welcome to the webinar all right thank you susie for that kind introduction time there's a short version and then a long version that i will uh present later okay my short version is how are you doing i mean are you even able to sleep with all the work that you have to do all the analytics that you have to do all right since last year i found that my my quality of sleep fluctuates up and down with the level of quarantine so you mean more more quarantined more sleep no more quarantine less sleep i think raymond that's a common thing well for those of us who are working in public health and our frontliners you know there's rest but it's not really rest no so anyway john go ahead with your go ahead with your presentation everyone's waiting for you okay thank you i'll share my screen can you see my screen yes sir go ahead okay so uh i'll talk about pandemic uh alternative futures for for the philippines in terms of the pandemic so this is how i'm going to structure my talk now where are we now how did we get here where do we want to go and how do we get there uh so just briefly you know because i think everybody knows what's happening uh so here we are now now it's uh more than twice uh the august peak that we had last year and it seems to be peaking now but we have to wait with a few more days now uh before uh we say that it's good news now uh but i also want you to i want to draw your attention also to the pre-peak period uh after the august peak we sold the plateau during this period no uh it was lower than the august peak but it never never really got down no below maybe 500 cases now and we we were sort of uh happy with this with this low level of uh cases now so uh just remember this i'll talk about i'll come back to it later and this is the the curve for our cases also uh as cases have gone up no deaths have also uh started to go up uh hasn't reached the the peak of last year but it's past the 75th percentile which is a significant length [Music] okay so how did we get here no this is a search we started in february so um one way to understand uh the pandemic is to look at it as a as a system um so if we look at it holistically you know uh we know uh what states what health states people are in and uh how do they flow no from one health state to another now so for example um we can divide uh the philippine population into five or six uh compartments no or buckets no so uh most of the population is here no we're susceptible we're not sick you know um people who have to go out now in spite of the quarantine uh have to have to travel you know have to go to the workplace now they will be exposed because they're they're mixing with people from other family bubbles you know uh some of most of these people will not be infected but some will be infected and they become infectious um so these people know some will be high risks [Music] some will be admitted to hospitals you know most will recover but also some will die okay so if we look at this uh system system diagram of the pandemic now it becomes easier to understand how how we got to where we are you know so for example now uh susceptible uh can become exposed no so if we want to reduce that we have to reduce exposure you know so we have to do things that reduce the transmission rate no um this is something that we cannot influence like i said it's the incubation period this is a characteristic of the disease but this is where we can influence things though uh how do we increase recovery rate how we how do we reduce the death rate no um if you look at the other direction the more active cases we have no the more susceptible people can be exposed okay but there's also a silver lining there's another bucket in our compartment which is immunization which we have now so the objective one objective would be to drain the susceptibles so the more you immunize and then fewer become exposed um let's let's talk next about our no i mean i think a lot of you have read about this in the papers now or the basic reproduction number no which is a which is a number which measures transmission okay so uh i mean we see this in the papers uh every day you know uh uh rt you know or the time to time dependent reproduction number no uh but more important than the number um as i said the number uh it's actually just an estimator no it fluctuates up or down but it doesn't tell you give us much information what is more actionable is to understand what contributes to reproduction or transmission so is the transmission rate of the virus uh it's how many people we have contact with let's say in a week and if we're infected no uh how long we are in the community you know inspecting other people not infecting uh our household or infecting people in the workplace before we're isolated okay so um these are the things which have contributed to the increase in reproduction number no uh the variance uh low compliance to the non-pharmaceutical interventions uh we had a couple of super spreader events now starting last december uh there's increased mobility because of the opening of the economy and poor indoor in the ventilation now they've begun to understand that uh erdosa's mission uh is a significant uh driver now of infections in fact it was in the newspaper today that cdc finally reversed itself and said that for my transmission or transmission through uh objects no it's not a significant uh uh or a major driver of transmission and then uh this one the duration of infectiousness is influenced by uh if we're sick no if we're symptomatic how long no before we go for testing no and then how long before uh we're isolated the quarantine and how long it takes contact tracers to trace other contacts and have them quarantined no all of these can either increase or decrease the duration of infectiousness so let's look at this now let's start with variance now so this is just a simple analysis now comparing cities uh with the variance and those without the variance though this was early early march the data from early march now so at that time no some some metro mandercities had variants the others did not no um so of the patients with variance no their symptoms set data media median date was around here not me made february now in cities with the b117 varian now uh also known as the uk variant although we shouldn't be using country names now those with the b117 variant at the fastest outbreak now this is incident three the number of cases not per day no uh they had the fastest rates now since mid-february those with b135 or with both variants no had the second to the fastest increase in infections whereas those that did not have variance at the lowest increase so we know that variance did contribute a little not to uh to the to the search but we also notice here that even cities without variance uh had the search now so we know that there are also also other factors not involved let's look at those other factors so this is uh uh uh effectiveness of face covering stuffed face shields and face masks now uh so face face masks have an effectiveness of about 70 um if you have good compliance to it no the effectiveness in the population is about that much also you know 65 to 70 percent uh face shields also have the same level of effectiveness that used properly however uh unfortunately our compliance to the various patients that they loan about 30 so that at the population level the effectiveness is also very low um so combine uh the combined population of effectiveness of this is about maybe 69 no um the target of the uh is for ninety percent of the population to be wearing face master patients so if we're able to achieve that now uh we can actually increase the effectiveness of uh these non-pharmaceutical interventions to eighty percent you know uh eighty four and eighty percent is quite a high level of production and it's actually even higher under some of the vaccines you know so as you're waiting for your turn no procrastination just these these two things can protect you to the same degree uh let's look at super spreader events now so uh these are graphs of uh google google mobility trends if you own an android phone now google's tracking your movement from place to place now uh and it can tell us you know at the population level uh the amount of time now people spend in in certain areas also if you look back at christmas eve no there was an increase in time spent in groceries and also in retail recreation this includes include restaurants um later uh later in the um in the next month now uh for the translation um event there was also an increase in mobility for groceries and also for retail and recreation but also in parks and transport transport stations in contrast no we didn't see the same uh mobility no or rate of people going out for chinese new year and valentine's day so did this increase mobility contribute to cases um so this is for christmas eve now so uh so this was christmas eve and we know that mobility increased now when we look five to 14 days later no there was an increase no in the production number so we know that there was a pos holiday search about for translation uh the increased mobility did not uh result in uh an increase in reproduction number no and i think this is because this was mostly an outdoor activity you know so uh the even there was crowding on the the spread and was mitigated by uh open the open space okay how about the duration of infectiousness how did that contribute to the search now so uh from last year's data you know um when people get symptoms no they usually wait three days before they go to the health center or to see their doctor and get tested and it takes two days another two days to get their lab results now the current protocol is that when they're already symptomatic but before the test results come out you know are they already asked to quarantine so this is the probably the more significant period but we we know that the infectious period of coving is two days before symptoms and five days before symptoms so we know that in these three days uh they're infecting their colleagues at work or their household members and there's also some evidence that um a quarantine is also a bit leaky not everyone stays in quarantine or is quarantined early no or if contact racing is not completed uh soon enough no now you also have these people who are out in the open uh for their possible infections uh what about testing uh if we're able to do enough testing you know we can isolate inquiry and quality in people earlier and shorten the duration of infectiousness uh this is our positive cases we have now uh in our in our positivity rate is about 20 or so what that means is that to achieve a five percent positivity rate which is the standard set by who uh signifying good control of the outbreak now we need to be doing 200 000 cases at 200 000 tests instead so we need to do five times more than what we're doing now so if we can't find them no we can isolate or guarantee that uh where are the clusters coming from now most of them are still community clusters no people [Music] found in the household or spreading it in the household now but for this february search now we've seen that the number of workplace infections are also increasing also this was this december to january for hospitals uh government offices and workplaces now so in general oil workplaces now and then by far before very much now this had doubled or quadrupled uh so workplace clusters now are also contributing significantly okay so so that's how that's probably how the search now uh occurred you know uh it's not the virus uh alone it's multifactorial you know and each of these factors none that they uh identified or contributed to so from where do we go from here now or where do we go from here no uh first short term uh in the short term uh what will the ecq accomplish now again if we use the august search as a benchmark uh the number of cases will peak 10 days no into the lockdown so yesterday was the 10th day you know so in the next few days no uh we should watch uh carefully what's what's going to happen in the next few days uh however hospitalizations will peak two days at two weeks later you know because uh it would take time for people to to recover and be discharged from hospitals and we there's already a wave of cases now coming uh even i mean even if the cases come down here there's already we have cases that need to be admitted so in the short term that's what we're going to expect in the next two or three weeks uh how about in the long term no uh what goals should we set of ourselves um if this were baseline so let's say this was january uh and this is where we are now you know uh the varying because it increases stress there's visibility by about 56 percent so if it becomes a dominant stream no uh right now we don't we don't know yet whether it's a dominant strain now because we haven't done enough uh sampling now we've done that we've done a lot of testing of the genome or the virus no uh but the sampling has been an event uh but if it becomes a dominant strain this is where we will be you know a month after it becomes a dominant strain so we can probably set targets now so uh the rationale is that uh once the ecq is able to bring the number of cases down to the pre research baseline uh this is we we shouldn't be complacent at 500 or 1000 cases a day we should continue to drive them down and set successive uh goals now so that our baseline cases uh will be lower you know and if uh they're lower you know even with the variant we will not have the search that we have we're experiencing now so that that can be a long-term goal so how do we get there uh again it's useful to um [Music] it's useful to look to go back at the go back to the system model um and look at this now and we that right away we're able to identify several uh intervention points how do we decrease death rate how how do we reduce the number of active cases reduce transmission or speed up the the pace of vaccination um from the equation for r you know again we we find several ways now that we can we can do no uh to reduce the reduction number or reduce transmission improving compliance to the minimum public health standards now uh improving indoor ventilation also um those recently released guidelines now for improving ventilation in workplaces now but it will take time now for businesses no to install these avoiding mass gatherings now so this is uh individual behavior you know this is where the public community and business cycle can contribute but this is for government to do [Music] since uh people are delaying health seeking uh there should be active case finding like what they did in the arabi in india they did community community based testing now this is not mass testing now but this is bringing the the laboratories to the communities you know uh where we have a lot of cases uh it's difficult to do contact tracing now at the scale of the pandemic now uh but we have to prepare that capacity so that when the cases come down no we're able to do it better and prevent another search and we have to uh be able to measure now how efficient are we in isolation and quarantine um so um so if we look at the pandemic as a system no uh there's this uh systems uh one of the founders of systems thinking of the data meadows he said she said that there are about nine to 12 no ways we can intervene in a system to bring it into balance so i'll go through uh some of them uh i've color coded them in terms of effectiveness now so these are uh actually they're they're they're numbered in reverse order of effectiveness so these are the disaffected and these are the most effective so let's start with the the bottom three now so one way to influence systems is to manipulate constants parameters and numbers so these are uh providing subsidies taxes or setting standards no so for example we can set performance targets now for isolation and quality inefficiency meaning what percent of your positive cases or your symptomatic patients know do you isolate in 24 hours um but the reason that this is no i mean we we use indicators a lot in in the public sector and private sector but the reason this is one of the least effective ways to influence systems is numbers alone do that change behavior you need other interventions uh second you can second thing you can do is to change the structure of material stocks and flows not for example changing building new roads not changing the transport networks so if you remember a while ago now the exposed lead to infectiousness but if we improve indoor ventilation no not all of the exposed will become infected and some will some would become exposed but not infected so this that's one one way of changing the structure of the of the model no however you know facilities take time to revise and improve now um installing new filters no new fans will take time uh third no uh we can try to weaken uh or strengthen negative feedback loops now for example uh one loop no that's driving the pademic is that as i appointed a while ago more active cases uh increased transmission uh because uh there's uh more susceptibles are becoming exposed to these infectious cases so a negative loop that can counteract this uh growth in cases is to increase and maintain public health capacity to test trace and isolate no uh however um negative feedback loops you know i said they're usually uh backup loops no backup or reserve capacity no when they're not in use or when they're not needed no like uh when we had uh fewer cases when we had the two last year you know they're frequently dismantled when they're not used so such that when we have when we need it uh again uh they're no longer there for us to use uh so these are some of the things that intervention can accomplish now uh so sometimes simply opening windows and doors improves ventilation or installing fans but this will take time for for the the standards not to uh be disseminated across uh business sectors uh you can also improve air conditioning by installing this high quality filters now merge 13. uh and we have evidence that ventilation actually works so there was this case of a gym where a tray in their head was positive for colvin but none of the [Music] gym clients were infected because that prevented by improving ventilation and using a carbon dioxide monitor to monitor uh ventilation so this these monitors are actually available and you can you can buy them online um so i showed this a while ago now we have we also have to uh multiply by five times the number of tests that we're doing uh but it all this also presumes that we're able to find this cases so active case finding is also necessary uh so while we're in lockdown we have to uh ramp up again our contact racing ability now so uh last december now we uh disc this discontinued the contracts of uh most of the contact a lot of the contact tracers that were that were nationally hired now uh and because we ran out of money now to to pay for them now so we started the year you know with decreased contact raising ability and then i encourage you to read this article from raptlerno it's a very interesting and very detailed story of how when the search started no [Music] we lost control of the number of cases because we were not able to quattac trace isolate and quarantine you know and reduce the duration of infectiousness uh the second set also decide moderate effectiveness now [Music] so another way to intervene is to reduce the positive feedback loops so a positive feedback loop is as i said the more infectious cases uh more transmission leading to more infectious cases and yeah it continues to drive itself now uh so the way to break that is to reduce infectious cases uh by isolating them yeah um again that's difficult to do now uh but what's a better intervention is to uh reduce the um uh the number of cases or the number of exposed people that are feeding this uh positive loop no so you reduce exposure of the susceptibles uh so that it doesn't see the positive feedback loop anymore uh another way to intervene is to provide uh more information and this is actually a very effective way our efficient way of doing it like i say improving information does not cause a lot so for example what what we've tried to do now uh is to provide some barangay level maps that are visible to the public now unfortunately uh that website on uh uh on by the doi is that it's not very much uh use no public's not very well aware of it though but they could see the level of the outbreak in their barangay you know it it can change their behavior in terms of uh not just staying at home but also wearing masks and being more careful or all around so this requires data to be open and it requires uh innovation um so we're we're approaching the more effective interventions now so one powerful way is to uh reset you know or change the rules of the system no providing incentives punishments or constraints now for example um so as as toby mentioned a while ago now we don't have a single epidemic or outbreak no we don't have a national outbreak now we have what we have are uh different outbreaks now at different phases no or levels no the of the outbreak now some are just at the low level some are at the peak nor are accelerating some are slowing down and some are just have gone through a search and are waiting for the next one so uh we need to provide incentives and this is this incentive for each lg uh to rate them in terms of their performance for outbreak control but also to provide incentives uh for them for this incentives if they uh perform poorly no so right now jose although we do trap the the levels uh of the epidemic in each lg uh because of lg autonomy no uh there are no rules as to or consequences no for for different levels of performance so accountability is very important so for example just so this is from the voice faster website no it's called the faster website now f a triple s s s d e r you when you sign in or when you register you can actually zoom down to your own data and it can show this so for example red are uh marine guys with high level of transmission but also surrounded by other branded guys so these are uh hot spots no and then you also have uh but then guys with no cases no but also button guys for they don't have a lot of cases but they're also surrounded by modern guys with high levels of cases so if you're a resident of this banang and you have this information it can change your behavior so as i said so this is the uh the framework that we use uh to escalate or this as de-escalate as juice in terms of uh the severity of their outbreak or epidemic so before we allow lg us to de-escalate now we make sure that they have sufficient public health capacity and their customs case transmission is already at very low levels now before they are allowed to sort of pass through again you know and assume a low level lower level of humility quality status but this is voluntary now there are no rules no uh that will first of all even require lgs to submit their their data you know much less no consequences if they don't meet not their the standards uh and then the last set uh of leverage points now uh this power to i change evolve or self-organize now in short now this is the ability to innovate so for example after more than a year of the pandemic people have been experiencing pandemic fatigue they've been lost in compliance now they forget no it's more difficult to get yourself to do yourself to do it but design thinking is a process for uh we can uh rethink know or reinvent the way we communicate these messages or we motivate people to adhere you know to these public health standards but what what's necessary is in the decision-making process now uh we have to incorporate more diversity you know not just a hold of government but a host of society approach now we need other sectors to be involved in um decision making uh and we also need to allow experimentation and innovation to uh to come up with uh better fresher ideas so that we're we're not stuck in uh what we're doing now uh so again one of the more effective ways is uh rethinking what are the goals of the system no uh control they can control the outbreak or save the economy no um it's it's it's uh it's sort of strange also that uh some people think that we have to balance uh health with the economy as if now they're opposing opposing forces but actually public health or good public health uh also translate into a better economy you know so they're not conflicting forces now uh one of the former uh economic advisors in the obama administration uh said this very early in the epidemic now the number one rule of virus economics is that you have to stop the virus before you can do anything about economics and then finally the most effective way of changing or intervening in the system is to change your paradigm so once you change the paradigm everything downstream no changes no goals structures rules no incentives so we need to be looking upstream now and looking at the factors which uh may not directly have caused a pandemic but made it much worse than comparable countries so in equity housing transport working conditions so for example under ecq some people have been allowed to work because they're frontline essential workers but they're these are usually lower income uh workers also and then they have to take public transport now which is also unsafe you know uh they have they live in crowded housing so social justice is not really something that they can do and they report to workplaces now that may not have uh good safety protocols so we need to address not just the social determinants of health but also the political and commercial determinants of health so this is a study done on oecd countries now it shows how how econ economy and uh public health are related so these are four four countries that did a hammer and dance approach um but what's what's noticeable is that as debts started to go down they already opened up the economy now without waiting for it to come down at the to very very low levels now so this was a premature opening of the economy so so that's stayed low for a while the economy improved no but since they never really eliminated the viruses it was still there no they had the second third or uh as in the us now not a fourth surge and by the end of the year you know uh their economy uh had negative growth versus uh four other again developed countries um that uh uh try to or aim for elimination and not just mitigation so uh again they they knocked down except maybe in japan and is an outlier you know so uh this is this is a country that has a culture of wearing masks even before the pandemic also uh they actually were at the safety protocols pre-installed but when they what these four countries had in common was uh they drove the cases or the deaths very very low you know before they opened up um and all of these countries ended the year with positive bills except except for japan no not as bad as for the other countries so good public health also translate into good economics so again it matters no what what what is the goal of our system no um so this is the rate now the cur so if we look at the vaccination program which is the the sixth compartment in our pandemic system model this is the rate at which we're vaccinating [Music] after a year now we could probably get get up to about 10 million this is the goal that government has set no uh hurd immunity which is about 70 percent of the population uh the third immunity is an unrealistic goal no for several reasons no the duration of immunity given by the vastness is unknown some variants have already escaped no the protection of vaccines now a lot of the vaccines have decreased protection against the variants and the efficacy numbers that are reported for vaccines is israeli efficacy against being susceptible to the virus and effectiveness against progression of the disease meaning they're good at preventing mild and they're even better at preventing severe and severe disease and death no but we still don't know whether the vaccines are affected in preventing onward transmission meaning preventing transmission from the vaccine not the vaccine recipient to people who are not vaccinated so because of that no herd immunity may not be realistic at this moment so what what we should be aiming for is prevention of deaths and prevention of severe disease now which is what we know not that uh vaccination can do you know and uh we also know that variants are affecting the younger population now you know so even the younger population can be at risk for death now so we need to aim for 100 percent uh vaccination or full vaccination so this is the rate that which we should be doing it no so again this is an example of how uh setting a resetting that goes to the system uh will affect how the system operates uh and then this is a diagram or a framework of how we can look at uh covet 19 in terms of its uh upstream you know process this is just one part now social determinants but you can see that these are things these are weaknesses uh that we have now before the pandemic now and this is these are things that we need to fix you know um at the same time that we're uh trying to control the outbreak no or eliminate eliminate the uh the virus uh and this is my last slide now so we have seen that uh the problems are systemic now so it requires system solutions and not solutions that are done in isolation from each other thank you thank you very much uh thank you very much john um i'm sure our audience truly appreciates all all the things that you have said and presented and uh you know our the number of participants has been increasing over the past few minutes i think so john thank you so much uh there are a lot of questions in the chat box so i encourage you to continue to put your questions in there and we're going to ask our our resource persons to try to answer them while they're not talking or they have a break and um we have two reactors to this to this presentation um i'm going to turn over to raymond to introduce our next speaker thank you thank you for that excellent presentation as always dr john i miss going to your house so i hope we could get together soon thereafter sir um anyway i will go on to the to our reactors but before that let me give a quick shout out to uh the youtube college of medicine dean uh dean charlotte chong is in the call also as well as the director for the up manila community health development program and all the member spot now you p manila chdp uh together with director anthony herron anyway uh may we call on the very first speaker who will talk about from a clinical perspective pono she is an infectious disease specialist trained in the united states pono and is currently a political associate professor at the u.p philippine general hospital may we call on dr sibel lara abad dr sibel uh please go ahead with your reaction man hello thank you so much for the invitation today and let me just share my screen can you see my screen yes go ahead all right so thank you so much for having me today and i have the job of trying to digest dr wong's excellent talk but i was asked to focus mainly on the variance and why we should be concerned about these variants given everything that dr wong talked about so some reflection points that i i had to digest as a physician and as a filipino a member of society as dr wong has mentioned the b1 variant has shown an increased capacity to transmit the virus and because there's a lot of transmission so it's the nature of viruses to mutate to go forth and prosper uh to multiply other variants are sure to follow so we have to do something about that before we come up with a super variant and we'll talk about that in a bit the increased rates of transmission and the surge so to speak of our kovid is really overwhelming it's overwhelmed the physicians the healthcare workers and the hospitals and it's been very heartbreaking because we've had to turn down you know patients we know our own families uh or relatives because the hospitals are full and so kind of the flip side to that as mentioned by dr wong what what can we do to solve that you know as individuals now perhaps there has been inconsistency or laxity in the following protocols if you were here at the first part of this webinar there were people on the street saying following all these protocols because it's been a year and that is totally understandable and for some it's actually not doable right we always ask people to physically distance but sometimes there's just no space to do the distancing so we have to correct this and as dr wong mentioned it has to be a systems change and then finally you know as a clinician and as a doctor i'm always thinking with the emergence of these variants do our current strategy still work and will our vaccines work and this has been also alluded to by dr wong so let's try to answer some of these reflection points just so everybody's on the same page the variants also have some definitions so there's a variant of interest there's a variant of concern and a variant of high consequence so simply put a variant of interest is simply a variant that has changed enough that it is associated with perhaps reduction in neutralizing antibodies perhaps reducing the efficacy of treatments but this is kind of just anecdotal evidence not just an association it's not yet proven so there are actually many variants of interest at the moment but we want to focus our attention on the variant of concern because these variants have shown evidence already that there is increase in transmissibility such as the b1 variant right with an increase of more than 50 in terms of transmission it can cause more severe disease right such as increased hospitalizations or deaths so this is what we are concerned about as the label uh suggests but there is also a variant of high consequence and thankfully we do not have yet any variant that meets this criteria we will be in grave danger by the whole world if we have a variant of high consequence because this will show that the current preventive measures or medical counter measures are no longer effective so at the moment again we do not have yet any variant of high consequence so let's focus on the variance of concern now there are actually three variants of concern the b1 variant which was first discovered in the uk that dr wong discussed there's a b351 variant out of south africa and there's the p1 variant out of brazil right and these smaller notations here are the number of people in the philippines known to carry this variant already this is as of march 20. so these variants are here and so as shown by dr wong this is in part responsible for part of the search but as you saw in the graphs earlier there's also a surge in errors without the variant so there must be other things we're doing wrong or not correctly no so what can we do so as individuals and as members of society we can do little things that will amount to big things so perhaps we cannot do a system change by ourselves but we can do these little things no it just means going back to the basics so hand hygiene physical distancing frequent disinfection you know wearing our mask and our shields properly and now we have a fifth dimension so someone has to think of a catchy phrase now so lima bisa or something like that now we have vaccination in addition to this armamentarium and the way you think about these uh methods is you want to think about them in layers so the more layers you have the more we protect ourselves and others uh so that we will we don't transmit the virus forward so the way to think about it is to think about in terms of the swiss cheese model of prevention i always show this picture when i do lay for uh because they seem to get it when when now i show this picture so this is the swiss cheese slices so there are holes right and you want to plug as many holes as you can so when you have many layers you can plug all these holes such as the virus will not come across and infect this person to the right but note here and i want to emphasize this as well there are personal responsibilities in a pandemic this is what we're all doing already you know and this is what we're all tired of doing but we have to hang tight now but there are also shared responsibilities in a pandemic so you don't think only of yourself you think of your neighbor you think of the people around you so you have to follow or we all have to follow quarantine and isolation protocols we can't escape or jump ship and escape quarantine for example we have to abide and be tested or be contact trace and then finally we added on this layer here in the last slice of chase is vaccines and we'll talk about that in a second now here in the middle if you notice there is a mouse munching at the cheese so this is who you call the misinformation mouse and dr susan pineda mercado earlier mentioned that so there's a lot of noise and this is all coming from the misinformation mouse you know so i think i want to also emphasize that people should follow the science just as dr wong presented there's really a lot of science behind kovid 19 and we should stop listening to these rats so i'll just call them a rat or the misinformation nice so yeah we have to be very careful and be discerning in terms of the things we forward on viber or the things we forward on facebook is it true is it fake or is it a half truth so we have to contribute as well in terms of trying not to forward misinformation pieces so what else can we do to slow transmission and this in my mind is how i envision the virus mutating or the variance so viral replication is in the order of thousands per day or even millions sometimes depending on the virus so the more it multiplies again the more chances it can form a variant which are these in different colors so what you want to do is you want to slow down transmission so that you can prevent emergence of these variants and you can do it just by doing things that we're doing already so hand hygiene wearing your ppe's your mask and your shield properly physically distancing if you can and of course vaccines so here's my two cents on vaccinations so vaccines still work okay and again as mentioned it will decrease the number or the end of the susceptible population and it will also modify illness right so what we want to happen is we want to get vaccinated so that if we get covered 19 we will not get severe illness we will just get mild over 19 a very mild cold for example or flu-like illness so that we can also help decongest the hospitals for example and in terms of vaccination we also want to think about prioritization which we're already doing right we're vaccinating the healthcare workers first the frontliners and then the seniors who are at risk of very severe clothing 19. so there is some speed or there's some urgency to getting vaccinated and there's also equity because i think we have to think about it in terms of the whole philippines everybody will eventually and should eventually be vaccinated because we want to avoid what i like to think of as a vaccination gradient again this is kind of the picture in my mind so if we have two areas with covid19 for example and they both have a lot of viral transmission but area one is a bit more successful than area two in stopping the transmission of virus so let's say they've been able to curb or flatten their surge eventually because the economy will open up or because of the laws of physics or the loss of science there's actually diffusion or osmosis or travel right of people from area two to area one so because area two is not very successful in curbing the virus then eventually area one will again be reinfected and perhaps even be infected with the emergence of a super variant or a variant of high consequence which is what we really want to avoid at this point so kind of some take-home thoughts for you to think about in the next few months or the next few days even with the variants our current minimum health protocols still work so please try and hang in there and wear your masks and wear your shields and remember to layer up so if you have to go out because you know you have to a job to do you have to feed your family then just wear your mask and wear your shield the more layers you do the more likely you are to stop the transmission of the virus and the less likely you are to be infected yourself in terms of urgency to vaccinate we have to vaccinate a lot as dr wong showed you in the graph what we have to do it the right way because we want to also avoid the emergence of a super variant or a variant of high consequence and as everybody put in the chat box i also like this line now there's also virus economics if you control the virus that we control the economy and i think that's my last slide i just want everybody to be safe and if we are safe only if everyone else is safe thank you very much thank you very much uh that was dr sebia lara abbad again another excellent presentation thank you so much for that very clear uh on the variance and i'm sure i can already see in the chat box or a lot of a lot of questions so i'm gonna ask our doctors to continue to try to answer on the q a in the q a box okay so we're going now to another reactor and um just a little bit of a backstory when we started this last april so our webinars theory started lasting the person who helped put together the first set of speakers for the stockholm death webinars that's webinar is dr eileen david um we talked a bit about who do you put who do we put in the webinar first if we want to have clarity on clinical management of kovid remember at that time we didn't know you know we had very little information but pgh plunged into research right away and was as they were going along modifying protocols and so on and in this webinar we did talk about for the first time cytofine storms proning uh using not not ventilating to intubating too early and so on and so forth and the person who worked on getting those speakers in the early days was none other than dr david one so we're very happy to welcome her back she's professor of medicine at the university of the philippines and is uh one of the leading pulmonologists in the country eileen welcome thank you very much susie so now before you start eileen um give us a give us an idea of what the situation is like right now uh at the philippine general hospital yes allow me to include that this uh reaction course we'll see later so again thank you for this kind uh invitation again susie and raymond and the stop kovid team and i would like to share this first infographic now benign pgh group naming it's been a year since this horror started and we still haven't awakened from this nightmare and indeed frontliners they really rose to the occasion and i think over and beyond what is expected of them over and beyond their call of duty and as mentioned by susie she invited me to speak at the very first stop kovid webinar and can you imagine number 47 and susie actually asked me to talk about conducting research during this pandemic how visible it is and i think at the from the beginning we already saw the importance and the need for unavailable indisputable evidence so that it can help us in caring for our patients and at that beginning at that outset we already talked about how we can possibly conduct research and i think we are fortunate that we have scientists like john who the legal ignores the strong opinions and strong emotions and just sift through all the noise and just gives us he analyzes he looks at uh what figures and numbers and trends that do not lie so that we know what we can do so i was asked to give my reaction one as a clinical researcher and two as a clinician pulmonologist and it young how i feel about john stock first each of his slides i think gave uh acaring so i think he opened our eyes to the sobering reality of our current situation and formerly at least for me i really couldn't see the forest for the trees so if you look at all the social media and all the news with all these things and but we don't really know what's happening and i think for today so and i also found solace despite being confronted by the results of his big data analysis and that we we did see the big picture and now at least we know now how to move forward and to quote aristotle or probably misquote him knowing ourselves is the beginning of all wisdom and i have another favorite adage this time from george santayana those who cannot remember the past i condemn to repeat it and we're right there right one step forward two steps backwards so what do we do next for the next year so how how do we stop this so i thought that john's presentation was factual it was incisive it was succinct it was pretty compelling to me he was informative you can really tell that he the presentation was well thought out and there was extensive prior preparation and i think the most important thing as i've mentioned he provided clarity amidst this chaos of all the background noise and misinformation going around and pero hindi long negative or doomsday scenario he did propose solutions and they are science based he emphasized the need for systems change and i think for us even for the layman we need to think along this way and if there's one take home message for me it's that we need to trust science and hard statistics which brings me allow me to make another last adage passable from adam smith science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition so let's talk science just to share with you and i thank nina berba for sharing these slides with me she's the head of our hiko control so pgh just to show you that what's hap what happened or what's happening in the in our hospital mimics what happened to in the community just what john presented so in pgh in march 66 of our health care workers got their infections not from the hospital but from the community or household and as you can see it from all of these and a new young definition of activities from community community spread and if you will actually see how it affects our work in pgh those infected co-workers who still work and expose others they produce the greatest disruption to our operations so young called liga isolate yourself i remember nina sharing one info graphic for every healthcare worker was infected the infection of four to five others so what happened in pgh the same as in the community microcosm within the macrocosm so as a clinician and as a researcher what evidence convinces us to prescribe a new drug for our patients so let me share with you one study that came out early in the pandemic march last year 80 admitted patients with covid19 they were given drugs a and b and look nice results 83 negativeness viral load clearance by day seven 93 by day eight and 97.5 showed clinical improvement with the mean hospital stay of five percent and only one death that makes it one percent really nice results right so this was actually one of those studies that were released in march talking about the beauty or the uh effectiveness coat and coat of hydroxychloroquine this time combined with acetomycin and this and similar studies moved politicians uh donald trump to telegun uh try to to brasso the arms of the cdc to put c hydroxychloroquine there in the guidelines and actually in our clinical pathways we actually put it there as well but many months later the huge recovery trial came out it's a uk multi-center it's a randomized controlled trial obviously you've noticed that the original one did not have a controlled arm so these were huge numbers comparing hydroxychloroquine with usual care and what did this study find so hindi one percent the debts at least within 28 days 27 much much higher for the hydroxychloroquine group and although it did not show overall a difference in the usual care but what they found the patients given hydroxychloroquine were less likely to be discharged from the hospital alive and if they were not incubated at baseline they had a higher frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation and eventual deaths and there was some concern about some excess of cardiac deaths so this was published in a high impact peer-reviewed journal new england journal of medicine so take note of the difference between a cohort study with no control and a randomized controlled trial then let's look at the natural history of kovid so as of yesterday 23 million of active cases 99.6 of them have a milder disease and i would like to quote who country representative uh see rabbindra and as seen as a natural history nancovid for those patients have recovered actually more than 95 percent of them recovered without specific treatment so if you give that patient a certain drug that's mainly now you'd think that that drug actually cured them and dr abbey has said this is not science this is not evidence so in god we trust all others must show data but what kind of data do clinicians trust and i know that there are laymen in the group so let me just share with you how we oh sorry how we look at evidence-based medicine we actually have a what we call a hierarchy of research design and based on this we assign levels of scientific evidence at the very bottom are the animal and laboratory studies which we call mechanistic studies and then next human testimonials from a series of cases that show a good outcome or poor outcome and expert opinions and then the observational studies case control uh retrospective studies prospective studies and at the top of the pyramid they're not as many but they're the most important are the robust well-conducted randomized control trials and the pulling of those results of those rcts which we call meta-analysis only rcts can actually or have the ability to control bias and therefore will have more valid results and can truly demonstrate cause and effects in humans in the indubitably so this is how we look at it and unproblemat all that noise and all those uh misinformations going on and let me quote again dr abbayya singh here the fight against the info demi has been even more difficult than the fight against the pandemic so just to show you how it is in my village um one of our residents actually posted this uh facebook group naming comparing mrna vaccine with a controversial drug i'm not going to mention what it is yeah for effectivity it's proven to kill kovid in laboratory experiments positive from positive trends from retroactive studies and widespread anecdotal evidence and effectivity and if you remember from my pyramid those are way way at the bottom of our levels of evidence although young resident one acknowledge that there are conclusive data inconclusive data rather or still lack of data from well-controlled prospective human studies pero since highly effective against parasites you can give it and in case you have that you hit two birds with one stone so potassico with but i didn't see parasite but this is the problem that we have now and i really think we need to address this by uh sibel has actually given all those beautiful steps how we can do this try not to share fake news or have truth news so how is it like in the in up in manila what are we doing in our group so in april of last year i presented the proposals or the studies that we were planning to do and what is the scenario for the next 12 months i would expect that we will be able to share already the results of these studies so these are all sponsored by pchrd and what you can actually look at from our study group we try to see all the salient disease aspects so that we'll be able to understand the disease further and we will know what works so as you can see we looked at epidemiology clinical profiles outcomes predictors of mortality lab-based studies and then separate very important this is transmission and infection control i put in yellow the project leaders for each of these studies and then we all we're also looking at impact of covid19 families and patients miss more i included here the rapid leaving reviews of our very own nih institute of clinical epidemiology in coordination with the philippine society of microbiology and infectious disease so there and then we're doing predictive models we're trying to validate them and also addressing ethical issues so the ethical guidelines on call with 19 crisis level has actually been published already by dr lenny fernandez and finally the most important studies looking at diagnostics the utility of the various biomarkers to detect cytokine storm and predicting hospital mortality and also coagulation parameters and the randomized control trials those important studies in our very own population so hopefully by end of next year we'll have an answer for you on convalescent plasma therapy ibitosilisma virgin coconut oil oil wh we are part of the wh o solidarity trial and we've actually already published uh the interim results last year and nina bear was doing the avignon trial she's the country investigator for this i did not include here the vaccine studies were also involved in them and finally among the studies as we speak we're actually also developing the program from for what comes after kovid so we're looking at long long or long haul covered or what we should now call the was task and to try and understand and address this and plan for it to help our patients and finally i think this is my last slide in the hospital what are we doing so in march april we formed clinical pathways to try and to make uh standardized how we manage our patients at the pgh and in april of this year or early this year rather we actually updated this we've been updating this continually throughout the past year and you'll expect that in the next 12 months we'll still do this depending on what new data appears so what you will see here in the clinical pathway we've put here those that have been shown to work by solidarity and all the other trials including steroids or dexamethasone for the more severe patients an oxamarine or anticoagulation that works and then umbrella de severe for a certain group of patients so usually those patients were moderate to severe in character and then all the other trial of all the other interventions hemoperfusion you will see here and dosilisumab so studies also now coming from the recovery trial showing that tosylisumab will be effective for patients with high inflammatory markers like crp so that is what we've been doing in at the pgh and you'll expect that we'll still be doing that and finally as a last slide we've had some doomsday scenario my vote of confidence and let me quote one of my favorite ideas aside from sibel of course dr edsel how good are filipino doctors and healthcare workers during the covid19 pandemic world-class better than world-class our death rate of 1.8 percent is lower in many countries so out of the top 30 countries with the highest number we actually have the second lowest so at least some hope and some confidence in with with our frontliners and i think that's my last slide thank you very much susie back to you all right thank you very much that was dr eileen uh david another excellent presentation and you'll see in the chat box uh i lean all of the uh also for also for uh for john and for sibel okay we're going to call everybody back now um toby uh sibel john um and um aileen and i understand that uh dean charlotte trump of the u.p college of medicine is around charlotte you're most welcome to join the panel if if if you can okay so we're going to now go into our panel our panel discussion but before before we go into the panel um raymond is going to inform our panelists of who the audience is so raymond please go ahead thank you dr susie and thank you to mom aileen i i particularly like the suspense but i was actually trying to wait for um the naming of that controversial drug next week nothing in my entire manner we have five questions we'll start with the demographics 54 of those who inputted their locations are located in metro manila next up are those from northern and southern luzon and then also central luzon with one percent comprising of attendees from outside of the philippines as always majority and 56 of those who are attending our webinar are from the medical and nursing sectors [Music] very much excited to tease that out we have um three questions i'll try we'll probably try to answer this later dr seuss he will go to the panel discussion uh before we try to answer these questions thank you okay thanks a lot okay so um for our panel discussion i thought what i'd like to do is uh because toby's toby started us off on on um on economic side of it and how uh the investments in public health are actually good for the economy so i'm going to ask toby to have a reaction and maybe to ask a question to our to our panelists so i hope i'm not putting you in this on the spot i'm sure there are questions you know that come out of what you heard so uh toby let me turn it over to you no i'm i'm i i have i'm happy i heard the same thing from john you know he calls it virus economics for me it's it's uh really quite simple right it's not about controlling the outbreak versus growing the economy or even in a sequence it's not the first is a necessary condition for the second case and i think what um and i think we're seeing that now because we're going you know back and forth and back and forth on on all these things um i think what uh what what what what the questions i had actually um to john and the rest were were things like this no um for example with with respect to john because i'm thinking about okay so what does this mean operationally right what are we talking about and i got many messages from john and from an economic viewpoint we are into we need to prioritize because of budget and time constraints we cannot just say vaccinate all we cannot do that right and so it's not helpful to policy to say things like that um what is what what for me it's like i'm happy you said something about you know testing and you need the point that our testing must be five times more than what we're doing now that's really important to me however i'll also still ask because the debate in april last year was are we talking about diagnostic testing or surveillance testing because that was the big debate the oh did not want to do surveillance which is what we thought as economists was necessary in order to track the dynamics of the of the of the um of the pandemic of the virus right not so much for clinical or diagnostic purposes and honestly i think that's what we're missing now we don't have that right because we never did it so it's important that we define um what you mean by five times more right so it could be a combination um i'm happy also that you're saying contact tracing mainly because this group is across the country right what's happening in ncr is not happening in other in other places and like i said before i do believe obviously that nci needs to get its act together and roll out but with the national government um but that as a priority may not be the same as somewhere in the visayas right so the question to everyone i think from a regional viewpoint or provincial viewpoint if you had one more peso where would you put it would you put it in vaccinations would you put it somewhere else that's the economic question for me right and i think that if um the doh for instance now and i'm not quite clear how they're allocating vaccines i'm not you know is it equal because typically that's what they did before if i don't divide by n everyone gets everyone gets something even if the level of priority is so different across the country and now if you're saying that you want to uh vax you know vaccinate a good percentage in order to optimize that measure right the instrument is vaccinations where would you put that would you distribute it across the country from an economic viewpoint that doesn't make sense right um and so i think you need to do that and from from the health uh public health uh people it would help if you if you say that uh this is the general rule but you know you have to apply um some sort of cost effectiveness or uh efficiency analysis to say what where when and when right um that's my i know and i think uh the stuff that john was talking about and others nika it's like yes systems thinking but systems thinking itself must be unbundled some is short term some is medium some is long term whenever you make um recommendations not only do you disaggregate by geography because we are just as john said we are different pandemics happen epidemics happening all over the place but also short long uh medium and long term so that we don't get overwhelmed right so from what i understand from susie in our previous discussion maybe in ncr is vaccinations because because it's happening in congested urban areas how can you even isolate right so maybe that that thing in ncr is so different from um i don't know uh you know the rest of cebu province and so forth so if we can if we can have that then economists can help you know um uh you know can help parse that i had that there was a comment in the chat box about um you know how do you deal with the no work no pay right because of pandemic my only answer is well government has to provide ayuda if there's going to be a government imposed lockdown such that people cannot work they have to come in the other question was can we print money to give printing money guys is a is a phrase we use um it's one way to raise funds right um from the from the bank essential viewpoint there's a technical thing with that you don't just you know print money and then give it away though you can um but i think the issue here is um our economic managers don't seem to get and i'm sorry if anyone's in the room don't seem to get that yes we prepared for a rainy day we were strong before the pandemic so now you borrow to the hilt your country is suffering what are you doing trying to monitor you know this is the time that you use you leverage those fundamentals to to borrow to the health etc so that the country does not die and households do not die and in in from an economist viewpoint remember for as long as you use the borrowed money wisely then it will all pay back later on the issue is if you don't use that borrowed money wisely then you won't get the returns later on so that's you know that's what we need to do right um i i do i i agree that if we are in a lockdown stage we're not we shouldn't even talking about recovery it's relief it's relief and then you set up uh for um for recovery the way everyone's been talking about thank you thanks toby john you want to respond to that yeah i i feel like i was in my master at this defense [Laughter] you're kind of starved it's john i want your slides the testing i mentioned was uh diagnostic testing so these are people who are symptomatic who need to be tested now so that the the decision could be me to isolate or quarantine them let's say we also don't want to indiscriminately isolate people no even though they're negative no but i i agree that surveillance testing is also necessary one study by the cdc said that in the u.s for every person that was that tested positive they missed about 4.5 other people no uh i think here in the philippines it it would be it'd be much larger you know so uh we uh well we might be closer to our immunity than we actually think no because of those uh undiagnosed people um regards to vaccination uh i i also did the uh the the modeling that uh toby mentioned what if we just focus on ncr uh because that's where most of the cases are and most of the deaths are and i i didn't look at the economic side no but just from uh epidemiologic side though uh we actually do see more deaths now uh uh focusing just on on ncr but the problem is and we're supply constrained also no so uh if we had unlimited supply now we could do that and say uh i don't remember how many lives we we would save though but i also looked at the the timing of the delivery of the the vast seas now we we we won't be getting it in time not to be able to do it at that scale and i agree with you the in systems approach that has to be both prioritized in terms of person place and also time just to um john so if there's a supply constraint the more so it shouldn't be just distributed across the country yeah if there's a supply constraint so it's it's you have to sequence it and it's not only and i i understand about seniors but you know i remember susie bringing this up um you're talking about this earlier right after seniors we should really think about the working age population right i mean it's like if you really wanted to to do that shouldn't that be next right so my point with the ncr which you share right there is a supply constraint so the more you have to prioritize who gets it first the more so and yeah that's all thanks yeah so uh the government does have prioritization and they did prioritize uh saving lives first now so these are seniors uh but also persons with comorbidity now they have on the average 1.5 times the risk of death and then uh the the next two goal would be in frontline essential workers no so i think this this group have a lower risk of death but the higher risk of infection because they're they're the people out there you know um so yeah i think that's uh yeah thank you is it is it seniors across the country or is it is it at least geographically um sequence right right now it's across the country yeah well that's what i mean i mean i i'm being very cold it may come out very cold right but the risk honestly the risk of someone who's not senior may be higher in ncr than someone who's senior outside that's my point right so you that's the that's what i mean that the national if we cannot just apply national analysis we've got to go down right because we don't have enough money we don't have enough supply and we don't have time that's a resource allocation issue when i did that exercise my experience was that it's not just an epidemiological economic issue it's it's also ethical not uh you're also already deciding who who's likes to save first person when you prioritize ncr no uh some lives will will be lost also in other regions so but it needs a bet a wider discussion across a broader group of stakeholders no i agree john but you you just said in your slide that you know masks and shields can give you almost equal protection i i'm just saying you know can you you know we i'm i'm not suggesting that someone is saved saved first because there as you said there are other measures that could maybe um [Music] be at you know approximate the vaccine the vaccination right so as you it was in your slide so i'm wondering right if you know given the spillovers and given everything else some hard choices have to be made but that doesn't mean that you're you're condemning someone to die it just means that in the meantime right in other places can we make sure that masks and and are available for seniors in rural areas right i mean that's all we're we're saying can you use that first while the supply comes on stream yeah i think i think i i think you know and that's why we entitled this webinar what to expect in the next 12 months no yeah but an ideal world we would like you know everything everyone to have access to everything ideally but that but that's not that's not the situation and in fact let's ask our clinicians i was gonna ask um both eileen and uh sybil um because they're seeing it on the front line right uh to describe to us a little bit what they're seeing and what they think the effect is going to be on on the system because um well okay so i get it that that we we actually know what the trends are so john has given that to us i think toby you're talking about what the consequences are of not shifting our prioritization or going more more localized but i think from the point of view of of the front line which i'm going to ask id now and ask sybil um where earlier we were talking about nurses are leaving hospitals or you know patients are dying in the emergency room so let me turn over to eileen and maybe to civil and just talk a little bit about because because there's a short term right there's the long term and the ideal that we want to do but there's this right now we are in a crisis so what are you seeing and how do you think we're going to mitigate that so let's go to eileen first allow me to ask sibel first because she's a frontliner she's right there okay she's good yes but so so in the front line visually it's really it's a war zone um the ers look like a mess there's too many people in the er inside and outside of the er this is both in the private and the public health setting so pgh looks the same as the medical city in terms of volume of people and by the way they're just waiting outside distinction between private and public hospitals just to paint the picture um and it's the the recent surge has really stressed the capacity of all hospitals now in the ncr the big hospitals uh to accommodate the sicker patients so it's been very stressful because it's getting closer and closer to home i know parents apparent seven degrees of separation now it's closer and closer to home i know relatives now and colleagues now we're admitting them or not being able to admit them is even more stressful because you know they call you and they you know you try to look for a bed for them and almost certainly indicate successful no so that's very stressful and um so maybe a hospital for example right now i am in the pgh icu it's just virtual rounds but we have to triage there's about 22 people lined up for the icu just to get in the icu but it's full and so a lot of them unfortunately either get too sick or die outside of the icu or wherever they are in the er or in the pila no so that's how it is a private hospital um people are spending five days in the er where they should just be spending hours there and some of them die in the er while waiting for their room so but i understand that because shebrey if you have a loved one you want to get into a hospital but without having choice because incoming we're always about trying to find solutions so part of the solutions we're trying to uh hopefully uh we're talking some people are talking to um the government and other lgu's company may be recovering patients maybe they can just step down to a facility somewhere paramount open up in rooms something like that uh some have even maybe said open up field tents for the uh for those who can do that um and also home care now um is home care where people who have the means or people who have at least some people to take care of them or help them but these sicker people who should be admitted we're trying to help at home so this is how it looks like in the field um it's really quite a mess um so we really need all the help we can get mama eileen thank you thank you sorry what do you think where are we going where are we going now in addition to what sibel has mentioned um we'll need to consider also with all those increased number of cases the worry particularly among us great care people the lack of medications important medications that are starting to run out and i think we're still fortunate in pgh we have a very proactive supportive leadership who see these things and at least we're more better prepared in pgh but i've seen small hospitals in outside of metro manila not having not even having the basic needs and uh something for me which was a shock they should have had at least a year to prepare for this and you find out they don't even have high flow nasal cannula etc so at least for the next 12 months this has to be addressed the problems of the variants i don't think is going to go away we can try i think the most important still is to kill the source of those viruses so we really need to isolate the hosts it's still very important i think the priority should be in contact tracing and community isolation i think we should have those sign hospitals like in china those huge tent hospitals if we can set those up at least to relieve the tertiary hospitals so that we can really just take care of the moderate to severe patients so um that's my additional take on what sibel has mentioned yeah i mean john also said that you know the the the peak and you will see a peak in hospital hospitalizations in two weeks so what do we need to do to prepare for that i don't know who wants to answer that john maybe you should answer that question not your your uh what what what are the what's being put in place for this we already know we already anticipating a huge number of hospitalizations and you know we've got 3 000 people who are listening to us right now from all over the country what kind of preparations need to be put in place whether it's in metro manila or the outskirts of metro manila so see i think let's also ask john when do we expect to see the benefits of the is of the lockdown okay do we start doing it now and where where is that is that ncr sorry yeah so uh if we if this this current search follows the pattern of the previous search now and just looking at ncr uh the the the peak should have been yesterday 10 days after the lockdown and then hospitalization will be two weeks after uh after yesterday uh two weeks after the peak of the cases well with regards to uh susie's question of uh i think you phrase it correctly now how do we prepare for the next search because i think it's already too late not to uh uh to do anything about the the way the hospital system has been overwhelmed and we we should have prepared for this search during the interim no between august and now uh one one of the things we realized is that uh we'll be measuring beds and ventilators no but now we realize that uh healthcare workers are actually a scarcer resource now they're more difficult to to increase in number and they're more difficult to replace especially now that they're also uh hospital clusters uh that's that's that's uh that's that's all i can say then i i hope i wish i had better news wow okay riemann uh rama did you want to ask a question or do we have a question from the audience well we have uh mom maria cecilia cecilia polido uh coming in from uh our live audience uh mom me uh may we ask you to unmute and ask your question but it's the most upvoted question in the q a yeah we can hear you now go ahead good afternoon uh my question is uh our government is also pointing out that pasawise are the main reasons for this search but i believe that we citizens are not given the means and measures to cope against a massive community transmission uh there is poor mass transportation ventilation and capacity no safety net for our daily wage earners in our administration uh what do we do what we ask our administration to increase the compliance to health standards and be trustful in reporting possible contacts without being stigmatized that's all thank you very much wow okay who wants to answer the question i've heard him answer this question before [Laughter] i've answered some some of the questions though so uh i i don't uh i disagree that i know poor compliance is the main factor you know it's one of it's one of many factors though uh variance uh for contact tracing isolation quarantine so it's multiple and i don't think it's uh it's the main factor uh second i i also believe that uh we should have uh lockdowns with equity meaning it shouldn't just be a lockdown no but there should be economic relief also enough for uh for people who need it the question of your last question of how do we improve better uh how do we how do we improve compliance i think this is where uh we need more more more innovation more design thinking processes uh [Music] initially it uh it was it worked when uh people were people were afraid people were cooperative but uh i said as it dragged on now you know uh their other concerns uh became uh a stronger factor in uh influencing their compliance so i i don't have a good answer for that but uh i think uh we need to do uh more or introduce more design thinking processes in the decision making but uh we have more uh more answers for this but one one one easy maybe not easy no but but one one way we can do it is uh the more effective mass are are the surgical mass and the uh in 95 ps94 no uh if we can if government can can pay for that no at least for people who cannot afford it though that's one way to increase the protection right away yeah um i think that i agree with john and that first of all you cannot ask people to stay home uh without without providing uh subsidies of some sort right in cash or any kind it's just it's just not feasible i mean sorry it just it makes no sense you know uh the risk of getting um the risk of infection is much smaller than the you know the fear of you know is much more than the fear of going hungry or or something right so you have to provide so it's not possible to have a la it should not be done that a lockdown is imposed without that and if they do without ayudar of some sort and if they do that you already know that there's some i don't know a flaky decision making going on right um it's like i think one of the officials early in the lockdown last year remember remember he said something like that and so um it was ridiculous so we can't have that okay um uh second i i know what you're talking about you're saying that how can we really uh comply with um non-pharmaceutical you know instructions like social distancing if they do not provide if mass transportation is not uh adequate right so yes okay you have you allow work now but if they're all crowded in buses or whatever there's not enough they have to line up line up for hours to get there then you know that's that that's why we have you know that could also lead to another surge right um so the answer to that is straightforward then there must be some sort of public um intervention with respect to providing more buses or subsidizing private um you know the private sector to mobilize vehicles for that matter if it's an annoying um you you you must solve the problem directly because if you go around in circles right you may not get there now if they cannot do that right it's effectively a partial knock down for people who can't get to work right and so you go back to the enough um uh household subsidies right so i think um [Music] you know maybe we can't do anything about this surge and i'm not sure that but certainly can we now do figure out the next search right so if we already know that this search did not we had infrastructure was bad health workers were were in short supply etc then what okay you know what is it do we now you know all those quarantine facilities that were built can they be remobilized or repurposed for um i don't know intensive care something you know is there a is there a uh is there a program sana better than the contact racing program you know that you know you can really uh mobilize people who may not be who may be out of work now right um and repurpose them to be some sort of supplement health worker in some capacity you know what i'm saying in other words you you um i don't know what or repurpose some parts of your labor force that are now finding themselves without work because the tourism industry is dead and so forth can they be somehow used to help relieve uh the health system you have we have to think out of the box yeah i know i know i'm not supposed to do this and i rarely do it but i'd like to answer the question too because toby's very provocative i mean i think to help compliance one of the things the government should do it should make testing all testing free if all testing is free then people will know they will know if they have to stay home not stay home they will do their own contact racing okay so short of having an improved contact racing system if you do one thing you make all testing free and actually testing is not that expensive it's expensive because it's in the hands of the commercial sector but if you find a way to test everybody to make testing available to everyone people will go for testing they're going to do that now the other thing is john is correct when you go you know make make masks and shields free make that available for everybody and the third one of course is every time you lock down you should receive something in your bank or your paypal or whatever it is there is it is there is no reason to not give people money during a lockdown because if you tell people to stay home and they have no money are they gonna stay home they're not going to stay home they're not pass away they're hungry they have no they have no food and we you know toby just reminds me of many years back like we were saying distribution distribution of relief food is very expensive because logistics in unlucky if you just put cash you you give people direct cash okay they will comply i don't think our man is they need to be capacitated so i'm sorry i'm giving an opinion but testing should be 100 free and i don't know people are going to get mad at me but and we have the money for that right so you see we have i mean phil health has a whole whatever stack of money that there are okay let's not go into that right yeah i gotta get started on that right but i know that i know that but i guess our point is we can do it yes it can be done so yeah yeah you know on the cash i i i agree with you i think there are certain circumstances where i think in the beginning of the um lockdown last year where the supply chains themselves were disrupted and therefore when you have cash and no supply then it doesn't you know what i mean that could be a a situation where it should be in kind right so there are certain circumstances maybe that's not the case anymore yeah so um anyway rather than rather than putting money to building highways or something give people okay we're we are past the top of the hour all right sorry everybody we got excited we're getting a little emotional yeah yeah we have some i know we have some uh we want to answer the questions to the opinion poll so raymond let's go to that so that and then we're going to close i mean i know we could talk about this for a long time but we're you know we're we want to honor everybody's time and raymond let's go to the questions and let's ask our guests to to answer them thank you dr susie um for the first question well actually it's the third question in the poll how much more transmissible is the b117 variant is it 26 56 or 76 percent dr john 56 56 thank you sir uh so for those of you regular people will appreciate thank you sir um number four is for professor toby monsoon the economy can only recover if the public health crisis is contained true or false ma'am okay absolutely yeah okay and then uh finally uh so this is how it goes we they have to hear it from the expert themselves okay okay yeah then the the fifth question would be which variant of concern was first discovered in the philippines let me call uh uh it's the b1 the uk variant was first discovered here uh but the one that from here or the new variant here is the p3 variant but the first variant in general is the b1 vary thank you thank you dr sibel uh may we call on all of our panelists back and then let's let's probably ask for their final reminders or messages for address to our attendees yeah everyone i think are we doing the evaluation also raymond i'm seeing it on myself oh yes okay okay so while we're while they are going through their messages phone or we maybe asked also our attendees to please fill out or key in your answers for the panel discussion assessment uh there are five questions uh but in the interest of time just in a nutshell it's mostly about how much you have learned and how it was delivered to you with regards to the topic what are the scenarios for the next 12 months for call with 19 here in the philippines over to you dr susie thanks raymond okay so we're about to close but we'd like to ask um everyone to just uh give a very short a very short message and i think uh the question the question we want to ask is um what's your advice what's your advice to all these doctors nurses who are listening to us right now what's your advice for the next year for this coming year so we'll start with eileen yeah i i think coming talking uh coming from all the lectures that we heard today um let us not let us try not to make gatum young disinformation and misinformation so and i think let's leverage young social media by sukuru going to the advocacy groups about proper use of masks what kind of masks are effective and how do you clean face shields etc and you know friends not then let's try to get drives how to give free masks and free face shields to our less fortunate co-citizens thank you very much eileen very very positive message and something that we can all we can all do okay so uh 7 yes um thank you again for inviting me here and to all the fellow healthcare workers the doctors the nurses especially uh so today is anonymous today is we probably don't say it enough to all of you especially the nurses who have stayed and who are still with us throughout this pandemic and just hang in there i'm with you in the front lines so we just take it day to day uh we can do this this will end so hang in there great thanks uh john well i think the first thing to do is uh continue protecting yourselves now because uh there are a lot more clusters now in hospitals so get uh get your vaccine if you haven't yet no uh i think only half of the health workers have gone to take the vaccine and then second i'll try to uh observe you in health protocols like i say a lot of the clusters also come from uh i mean health workers coming back to eat together again but uh i think i know maybe the more important message is uh we need to uh get our political leaders to to do more and to do better and i think health workers have a lot of social and political capital that they can use but have not you have not yet maximized though uh i think we we need to all speak up no and get government to the same thank you thank you very much toby um same as everyone else i all i can say is please keep keep safe we need you thank you um i wish we did a better job um in terms of resource allocation and prioritizing and and and i hope we can do um and i hope we can push um so that you know moving forward investments are in in the public health system led by you um will will really will really be made rather than in anything else so i think you know from an economic viewpoint it's it's our economic managers i think that have to come around um in that sense as well sorry but uh we'll we'll keep on trying we'll keep trying yeah thank you very much toby okay so um we have a uh closing statement and a bit of a summary coming from our executive vice president uh for up tender bossa ted over to you thank you very much susie and it's you know you guys always amaze me it's the 47th episode of this and the first one was a blockbuster and each one continues to be blockbuster on top of the other one and for all the people that are here in this webinar you know these guys that work for this they prepare a lot they think about this they choose who to bring in and every week every friday i am impressed with the level of information that you have been able to deliver today is no different and uh today is more auspicious and cyber already talked about it it's something that happened on april 9 1940 1942 that was 79 years ago and what happened then there were 78 000 soldiers that were fighting for this country 66 000 of them were filipinos 12 000 of them were americans and they were fighting and the filipinos what did the filipinos say no we're not going to surrender and they were ready to fight to the death the filipinos wanted to fight to the death but the americans couldn't take the number of deaths that would happen so the americans decided that they surrender and they indeed surrendered and we commemorate that day of surrender but that surrender saved many lives although what followed was a death march uh the the lieutenant general of the japanese invading force lieutenant general houma masaharu he didn't know what to do with 78 000 prisoners so he walked them all the way to kappas and people that were weak or sick or tried to escape were killed or bionetted and it's amazing how many people died 600 uh american soldiers died on that that march and 5 000 filipinos died almost the same as the number of deaths probably we have here in kovi but the interesting thing is uh eventually they were able to execute this lieutenant general for war crimes i'm not saying we should execute our government officials but definitely there is a lesson to be learned here filipinos never give up filipinos always keep fighting to the death and i'd like to thank all the speakers led by our economists our epidemiologists our infectious disease specialists our evidence-based medicine pulmonologists who described everything to us uh professor toby monsoon gave us all the points of view from the economist i will counter by saying my rebuttal as a health professional well the economist never invested in our health system we've been fighting for a higher investments in health system and we work we as doctors i worked in pgh for many years as head of an er that is very similar to the situation most ers are actually having today and we try to work it out with the meager budget that we we have uh i i think what's important is a lot of what she said i agree capacitate the health system the way to fight this pandemic is really the to capacitate the health system and i heard this as well from professor pernia he said health and economics we shouldn't be afraid to spend for health care and we should invest we shouldn't spend for it it's not an expenditure help is an investment and it is not an expenditure john wong professor john wong talked a lot about data and epidemiology he has been guiding the iatf with this uh with his epimetrics group and without his analytics of all the data we probably will be in the panzitan but i think all his analytics are on point and uh describes exactly where we are and he contributed three things he said where are we how did we get here and where are we going and he gave a lot of suggestions like me in the national task force i give plenty of advice but i don't know if the advice although it falls to death years and here's some of the advice that i say has been actually echoed by our experts here in this particular period so thank you john wong for those uh nice contributions about how to really fight an epidemic and we value that we value your your comment on systems thinking that said if you have a problem again very similar to what uh professor toby said it's you need systems thinking to solve a systems problem and it's not so different from what our economy is actually said then there's tribal who's in the front lines in the critical care and infectious disease front lines and talked about uh how it is really out there and i i can commensurate with her i'm glad i'm not doing any more clinical practice because i'd be shouting my head off in an emergency department that was exactly how she described but she described several things that are important to me the swiss cheese model that solutions to us must be layered and that we must continue to to have all those layers in place to protect us and that misinformation and science are very important espec and she coined the term that's very uh the cut cut on the virus economics i think that's something that needs to be written about eileen in the end actually impressed me with her coach i didn't realize eileen was a wise woman with all these codes she started with the calendar of brutal that she didn't know how to translate looking at the forest instead of the trees uh she looked at the solace at the big picture that january was able to show and uh quotes like knowing yourself is the beginning of true knowledge quotes like science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and what's the other one of enthusiasm and and uh superstition superstition correct and she demolished a current uh conversation uh some some politicians want to give away a current drug and she demolished the evidence for why these politicians are so passionate about that and she said in god with trust in all the rest we need data uh in the end i'll talk and say my favorite thought because people was were throwing on their favorite was my favorite quote when i was studying abroad was i studied disaster medicine and uh and what what was told to me was that we are in the information age we are swimming in ocean's day of data and the data needs to be organized to become information so that you can flow to rivers of information so that the rivers of information can be used in lakes of knowledge where we get our droplets of wisdom thank you very much for joining us this afternoon thank you very much it's dr tederbosa the executive vice president of uh university of the philippines and also special adviser to the national task force for complete making okay so next week next friday uh we have an exciting discussion and the topic is facts and fiction on covid19 prevention and treatment and we actually might talk about some drugs that we are not mentioning right now because we feel like if we talk about it we give it more you know it's it's like you're you're you're you're giving more attention to it but we will talk about facts and fiction and so we're going to address misinformation and we're going to have dr issa alejandria who again is the uh the president of chris smith the philippine society for microbiology and infectious disease and we're going to have a couple of infectious disease specialists hopefully we also have somebody from the department of health and i've seen this uh in the chat they're going you know should be invite some from the department okay we will but i can't announce yet where who because i might get into trouble again but i'm not saying i don't know if confirmed yet but we do have uh somebody invited from huh i can i can it's confirmed okay so we will have them we will have beverly hall from the department of ed okay so uh raymond over to you thank you and uh thank you for that uh well it was a way what a way to wrap it up evp uh i will not give my code because uh we'd like to thank everyone who is watching us in the live streaming links youtube facebook who are still with us here in the zoom webinar for those who want to again retest their knowledge and try to understand we are sharing the poll results as you are seeing here and the answers to the questions for us relayed by our experts so again next week facts and fiction on covet 19 prevention and treatment hope we could see you uh next week for friday 12 00 to 2 p.m it's a day okay together let us stop convince so keep safe keep healthy and see you online the enemy remains unseen i'll keep your hand in mind [Music] until the coast is there [Music] i look into myself and ask do i have

108,N9OQbW0YOLU,Nurses in the Philippines: Underpaid and unprotected from COVID-19 while saving lives,"In April 2020, the Philippines government imposed a deployment ban on nurses, blocking them from taking on jobs overseas. The labour minister, Silvestre Bello, explained that the country cannot lose the “services of our nurses” at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. Thousands of ‘prisonurses’ (coined from the term, prisoners) have appealed for the lifting of the ban. 

For almost two decades, nurses in the Philippines have been fighting for fair compensation. A public law guarantees a starting salary of US$680 in public hospitals. In this episode of #UndercoverAsia, we spoke to a nurse who earns US$13 a day, barely US$3 above minimum wage in Manila. 

In comparison, a nurse earns about US$2,400 in Germany, between US$2,700 and US$3,000 in the UK and about US$4,000 to US$8,000 in the US with overtime pay. 

The Philippines government also promised that there’d be sufficient protection and introduced a hazard pay of US$10 a day for work during the pandemic. 

Nurse Maria Theresa Cruz, 47, worked in Cainta Municipal Hospital. She had to purchase her own Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). When she showed signs of COVID-19, she was only given rapid tests that came back negative, despite a government memo stating that rapid tests “should not be used to definitively rule out COVID-19”. 

Theresa was later given a swab test which came back positive. By then, it was too late, she had already passed away. On top of her salary, she’d posthumously receive only US$1.26 a day in hazard pay. 

As of November 2020, over 16,000 healthcare workers have yet to receive their hazard pay.

113,r6pVw9jYkgs,COVID-19 UPDATE: Philippines lockdown status  | Live Interview,"COVID-19 UPDATE: Philippines lockdown status | Live Interview | Dr. Wessam Atif Comments on Coronavirus situation in the Philippines

In this live interview with C.G.T.N. comment discuss the following updates related to the current Coronavirus situation in the Philippines:

1) Suggesting a new paradigm for a real ""refreshed"" approach other than mass testing or counting number of cases.
2) Risk acceptability and how we need to learn to live with and manage Coronavirus as an acceptable risk in the Philippines.
3) The importance of easing Lockdown measures and rebooting economy in the Philippines.

#Covid19PhilippinesUpdate #PhilippinesCoronavirusNews #PhilippinesLockdown",2020-08-18,666,11,1,UCJq1YV3cJbJNs_xxp5_P7vQ," next is asia focus, philippine president
rodrigo duterte has decided to ease the coronavirus
lockdown in and around the capital manila while most businesses
will be allowed to partially reopen with restrictions his government also
promises a refreshed approach to fighting COVID 19
that includes more testing the philippines has the most number of
cases in southeast asia with nearly one hundred
and seventy thousand infections and now let's talk more about this and
let me bring in our guest Dr. Wessam Atif he joins us to get the latest analysis
and he's an occupational and public health consultant based in manila
welcome to our program sir now the government
says the new approach will include expanded testing and more door-to-door
checks on patients do you think this new approach will work
and why it's taken so long for authorities to roll out this new
approach well ii don't think the approach is new
the first thing i want to say that i assume that everyone has good
intentions and the government for sure usually wants what's best for
uh the people but so far mass testing hasn't helped very much in the philippines or
in many other countries i think very few success stories
uh i'm not sure how more testing will help, but let's see if if you'd ask me for a refreshed
approach maybe better change the paradigm not
only also the philippines but i suggest that everywhere
stop obsessing about or over the number of COVID 19
cases and maybe start focusing on minimizing other indicators or focusing
on other indicators maybe minimizing fatalities 
if you have scarce resources or limited resources like what we have here in the
philippines it may be better to invest it in
improving and boosting the healthcare system capacity
maybe that would be a little bit of a different approach maybe
more ICU beds, more hospitals, better working conditions and 
better pay for the healthcare workers maybe more medical supplies and access to health services this should help minimize fatalities i
think and maybe more effective than just doing more and more testing because
we've been doing testing so far. well you mentioned paradigm changes are
needed in containing the spread of the COVID 19.
could you elaborate on these indicators that you were talking about Dr. Atif
yeah well first as i said we can stop obsessing not only the Philippines but
everywhere else please about the number of cases they may not be the 
best reliable indicator i'm speaking as a health
professional in the scenario of COVID 19 i'm not saying this is applicable to other
diseases, we should focus on the number of fatalities that's an indicator
the number of cases requiring hospitalization that's another indicator
and very good indicator also is the positivity rate of tests if you'd like
to to look at cases rather than just piling up number of
cases or trying to count number of cases. yeah and president duterte also says
there is a need to reopen the economy as smaller companies are barely surviving
and i guess this is the question facing governments around the world how can
they balance economic and health needs? yeah i totally agree i think this is
already a bit too late As we don't have clear schedule when exactly this pandemic will end
even with a vaccine, we must now learn how to
start to learn how to manage it and and live with it as an acceptable risk at this point in the same way, we live with many other diseases and risks everyday. i like to elaborate on that for example in the
field of safety or health and safety at work
we study something very important called risk acceptability
and what we do in risk accessibility is a common practice of judgment of the
balance of risks and societal benefits this means that in
in real life sometimes the management or the
government in that case will decide to accept risks
even if they may not be very low and what we do is that we
weigh the benefits so we check the benefits of the control measures for
example in this case the lockdown against other factors
like economic cost or convenience or time or
mental well-being etc, and the management or the government then takes this
information and decides whether to accept the risk so this is risk acceptability
if we believe that they have minimized the risk
to what we call as low as reasonably practicable
then this means as low as reasonable enough
for life to continue and for work and production will go on we cannot just
stop business over risks, so lockdown has negative
impacts not only on the economy but also on mental and social well-being for sure
and i think it is now time that we open our economy
uh not only in the philippines but with all precautions, of course, we talk about
masks, proper ventilation, hand washing, and keep the task force after one target: zero fatalities. sorry to interrupt you but we gotta go
thank you so much Dr. Wessam Atif for your insights."

petitioning against the anti-terror law says friday december 10 the ruling of the supreme court on the controversial law is a consolation they do not deserve the supreme court upheld most of the anti-terror law voiding a killer qualifier that would have exempted dissent from the definition of terror only if it has no intent to cause harm with the intent qualifier removed the phrase now says dissent is not terrorism some lawyers and petitioners call it a win but virginia suarez lawyer for women's groups says otherwise we do not deserve mere conservation from the supreme court we deserve more than that we deserve protection from the supreme court [Music] it's like we are all mistaken giving all those arguments suarez says the exception on dissent is not true because they've seen how

one knows anything yet but we found out we're still waiting on it's actually the mr president duderte he's gonna be the one announcing what's gonna happen so 3 p.m we're still just waiting on this and and why is it so important to know about this because we cannot do anything until it goes from ecq to something else in order for us to start restart our lives basically and many other people millions of people is actually not just us it's millions of people in cebu and manila that are waiting on this news so it's a huge thing 10 30 p.m any news [Music] still no news what's going on we waited last night we waited all day and no one seems to be knowing what's going on we're waiting on the order from the president i guess we'll see you guys in the [Music] morning [Music] that's what i'm doing for you jake cleaning up your mess always every day [Music] all right guys this is a crazy thing about this quarantine i actually enjoy these small things a lot like even just wiping the floor going outside one of my highlights of the day is taking the trash out i pick up the trash me and jake go walk the treasure and do it he's like that's all the quality does to you this small thing's become so much fun but of course we're taking very good care of this place that we're uh yeah basically being hosted by we're paying a little bit fees so staying here of course but uh we want to maintain it as good as we can but when you have a dog like jake look at this this is like everything is crazy no just we trade this three days jake's here are you recording so it's july 16 and 11 30 p.m last night there was official announcement by the president and uh we took the ecq which is the highest quarantine status the highest lockdown and we downgraded it to mod boy downgraded to modified ecq so i guess that's a positive news the zebra province is now in modified gcq which is the lowest so that's really great i think in the coming days we're gonna start working on something to get out of the city it's been 16 weeks and i think that's like the world's longest lockdown correct me if i'm wrong comment down below is this the longest lockdown in the world i don't know so yeah we're gonna start working on the changes in the jungle the mighty jungle jack sleeps tonight snoring all night keeping us awake he keeps us awake all night snoring 1am weather report pretty damn good that's how it is living in the tropics beautiful sunny hot day it's one of the reasons i love as well living here is the weather because it's not like in the desert where it's always always hot you get the rain the coolness the freshness and a lot of divert type of weather conditions so it's always interesting how the weather is am i getting old talking about the weather another cool update here in cebu city is that they opened the international flight so now you can fly into the country you can land in cebu and cebu airport has the first corona swap test facilities on arrival so when you arrive now in the philippines simply specifically i would definitely fly through cebu so you can get tested at the airport there is price of course for it i think it's around 80 to 100 or something which is a very standard and so yeah you can fly into cebu now the airport has these facilities with which is fantastic it's really nice to hear that i said in my previous video that's probably the only way to get tourism back into the country is to have tests at the airport so that's absolutely fantastic another super positive note is that there is some tourism activities already opening up in the philippines and diving for example has been opened in darwin and in batangas the resorts have to get a special permit for uh for opening for tourists and they of course have the new norm protocols for their operations so that's super awesome i haven't heard anything but sibo yet so today we're still trying to figure that out i'm messaging a lot of people that are in the industry and some of my other friends trying to get some information about that i'm as well trying to work on getting a permit for diving here because we don't want to break any rules anyways finally we got a new package sent to me for diving this is uh this is called macroport and it used to film like the tiniest tiniest creatures out there and this one is basically a magnifier that's going to give me a 2.5 times magnifying image when i'm under there trying to catch those small creatures all right i just assembled the port it has the magnifying glass here in front and it's very needy because if you don't need the magnifier you just pull it out like that film like this and if you need an additional reach pop it on like that man i can't wait to test it out hello say hello i'm trying to vlog here hi huh i'm sorry yes it's so annoying by the way everybody's been commenting thin you know if if filipinos see something icelandic in the news or the tv they're always commenting to me have you seen this movie have

139,GUVKWAEO_hY,Asia&#39;s Vaccine Disparity: Can We Inoculate Indonesia &amp; Philippines? | Insight | COVID-19,"Indonesia became Asia’s epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in July, with infection rates driven by the Delta variant. The highly transmissible variant has also started to spread in the Philippines. But with global vaccine distribution skewed towards richer nations, both countries face the same dire lack of vaccines, stymying the roll-out of their vaccination programmes. Together, there are now more than 100,000 deaths in both nations and their health systems are overwhelmed. 

What led to this situation? What can both Indonesia and the Philippines do now to face down the crisis?

Website: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",2021-08-11,92544,691,435,UC_Lnb8ZHqqgLbp-7hltuT9w," Indonesia has been overwhelmed by a 
second wave of COVID-19 infections   since June 2021 the country is now 
the epicenter of the pandemic in   Asia and the crisis is being fueled by 
the highly transmissible Delta variant the situation right now in 
Indonesia is particularly worrying.   If the vaccines were available earlier 
Indonesia will not see a high fatality rate over in the Philippines a delta variant is now 
a looming threat. Worryingly the country is   facing the same lack of vaccines we still have the 
threat of the Delta variant and while we haven't   fully vaccinated our people, yet we have to 
manage the pandemic without the vaccine so far Across the globe vaccine distribution has been 
hugely unequal. 75% of the world's vaccine now   is being accessed by developed countries and 
countries in Asia have five to ten percent access This inequitable access to vaccines has led 
to devastating consequences it has created   an opportunity for the virus to freely transmit 
in countries where there is lower coverage What   has led to this situation? What are both Indonesia 
and the Philippines doing to face down the crisis? Indonesia has become the epicenter of the COVID-19 
pandemic in Asia, overtaking India since mid-July   2021. Every day we receive bad news that we 
have lost our friends, families, close relatives   many more people heavily suffered from this second 
wave so if the vaccines were available earlier   Indonesia will not see a high fatality rate even 
though right now the country is fighting against   the second wave of the pandemic. Many would 
have agreed even before the second wave hit   Anastasia retinol pujastuti trains 
caregivers and babysitters in Jakarta.   Until early this year, the single mother 
lived with her 12- year old twins and her   aged parents in bakassi 30 minutes away from 
central jakarta her neighborhood had not been   spared by the coronavirus but anastasia and her 
family took all precautions then in february yeah anastasia's parents got so ill they had 
to be hospitalized due to the lack of beds at   the intensive care units they ended up in separate 
hospitals where they tested positive for covet 19.   two weeks later they were put on 
ventilators and the condition deteriorated but even as she was burying her parents 
anastasia herself was falling sick but when anastasia's ordeal first started in february   indonesia had inoculated less than one percent 
of its population of more than 276 million people   in comparison the us had vaccinated 15 of 
its 330 million people by that time but for   people like anastasia and her parents there just 
hadn't been enough vaccine doses in indonesia to eat the hour hour um the slow rollout was further held back when the 
second wave hit with the delta variant driving   daily cases to more than 50 000 at one point 
movement restrictions had to be implemented um unfortunately low vaccination numbers are not 
unique to indonesia poorer countries around the   world have all faced a severe lack of vaccines the 
imbalance has its roots in how vaccine development   started rich countries like the us the uk and 
even singapore could invest billions in the   pharmaceutical companies working our vaccines 
supercharging the process but that also meant   that they were entitled to the vaccines for 
their own populations ahead of other nations   many developing countries around the world do 
not have the same capability do not have the same   capacity to provide such funds that's why they 
they also do not have equal access to vaccines   taxi negotiations was not an easy process and 
not so many vaccine manufacturers from developed   world provided favorable response to indonesia and 
the fact since manufacturers prioritize those who   support them so the impact is poorer countries 
will not be prioritized in vaccine supply in response to this problematic vaccine 
nationalism the global alliance for   vaccines and immunization the coalition 
for epidemic preparedness innovations   and the world health organization set up the 
covet 19 vaccines global access also known   as kovacs for the second week it aims to 
coordinate international resources to enable   low to middle income countries more equitable 
access to covert 19 tests therapies and vaccines   the effort is funded by rich countries 
together with private sector and philanthropic   contributions a total of 92 countries are 
eligible to receive covet 19 vaccines through   the kovacs mechanism including but as singapore 
has secured sufficient doses for its population   it has announced that it will donate its share of 
covax vaccines to other countries if there is a   very strong nationalism without 
taking care of other countries   the main goal of no one is safe until everyone is 
safe will not be achieved the main issue of the   the new balance especially because they transmit 
very frequently so the disease could spread more   more faster so if people could not be protected by 
vaccine so the problem will become bigger bigger   in in the country or area without a faxing 
cover but at the end of the day we are an   interconnected world we cannot separate 
one country to the other so it has to be   everybody here at 675 million people southeast 
asia has a percent of the world's population   but its average gdp per capita 
of around 13 000 us dollars   is far below other parts of the world like 
u.s at 68 000 and europe at 41 000 us dollars   the two most populous nations indonesia and 
the philippines have a combined number of   over 5 million covet 19 infections they have 
fully vaccinated less than 10 of their people the impact of vaccine nationalism has also 
been significant in the philippines with the   delta variant and impending threat to date just 
over seven percent of his 108 million people   are fully vaccinated so that is the injustice you 
know some countries have a lot and restore a lot   and yet some of their citizens kind of the luxury 
of not wanting to but in the philippines you see a   reversal of that many people now would like to be 
vaccinated and yet we don't have that much supply as an economic frontliner now in apon is 
one of those desperate for okova 19 vaccine   he's a tricycle driver in malalas an 
hour's drive from metro manila good morning the country's lack of access to vaccines 
have been made worse by bureaucracy well   the philippines initially hesitant to negotiate 
purchase agreements with pharmaceutical companies   first it was avoiding to sign 
non-disclosure agreements with   these companies secondly it was avoiding 
to protect pharmaceutical companies for   any liabilities and thirdly there are existing 
philippine laws that prevent the government from   prepayment of orders in the end the philippines 
complied with all these conditions however   it was too late for the the 30 administration 
when it finally made up its mind so the   philippines was relegated at the bottom of the 
priority list of pharmaceutical companies and   therefore other countries got the available 
slots for early delivery of the vaccine in manila tricycle drivers are starting to 
get their vaccines but the city of malolos   is still only giving out doses to health workers 
senior citizens and patients with co-morbidities driver nauen and others like him have good 
reason to worry besides the risk of   infection there's also the risk of long 
covet in indonesia anastasia is still not like many lower to middle income countries   the philippines did not have the public funds to 
pay for vaccines in the early development stages   during president duterte's state of the nation 
address in july 2020 he asked china for help four   days ago i made a plea to president xi jinping 
that if they have the vaccine can they allow us   to be one of the first so that we can normalize 
as fast as possible we were talking to diplomatic   routes so that we can actually connect with the 
government so that they can order their vaccine   manufacturers to supply us the necessary vaccines 
that our country needed at the earliest possible   time first delivery that was scheduled to us was 
going to be pfizer and astrazeneca but eventually   got delayed cynoback so far has actually been 
delivering on the dates they scheduled we also   asked for an increase in delivery but they 
acceded to that and they're delivering more since the start of this administration 
duterte has relied heavily on china   when the philippines face issues or 
problems for example national disasters   its war on drugs and the marawi siege it really 
relied on china for help so it is no wonder that   the duterte administration asking for china 
for its vaccines china donated over a million   doses of vaccines to the philippines and 
china also pledged to make the philippines at   its on top of its priority list of its 
shipments abroad for their vaccines   indonesia also turned to china in august 
last year but early in 2020 the government   was already trying to secure deals with 
the pharmaceutical companies in the west   one was with astrazeneca for 100 million 
doses of its vaccine the british swedish   company vowed to sell the vaccine at cost making 
it cheaper than other western-made vaccines aside from pricia we have to also take into 
consideration the logistic issue the distributions   of isa and modern vaccine must be supported by 
some specific good infrastructure that not so many   regions in indonesia can provide i think 
indonesia was taking a chance to procure   astrazeneca vaccines at that time indonesia was 
also uncertain about the efficacy of the vaccine   indonesia was not in the position to choose 
indonesia was more in the situations that we have to make any deals as soon as possible   but indonesia does own one of the world's 
oldest vaccine production company pt biopharma   biopharma had collaborated with synovac on 
the development of other vaccines before   and so in december 2020 the two state-owned 
enterprises launched a human trial of samavax   vaccine in west java involving more 
than one thousand six hundred patients   yes dynavac engaged biopharma and vegetarian 
university in bandung west java to conduct a   stage three clinical trial and in west gerber and 
at the time kovid was prevalent in west java so   it made for the appropriate conditions 
for a successful clinical trial because   at that time china is already under control 
indonesia has high prevalence of coffee 90   that's for the main reason the second this 
vaccine will be also given to the indonesian   so it will also raise more confidence if 
the result come from within the country   when they released the result they found these 
65 percent of the effi cassie of the senate uh uh china was then already the largest investor 
and trading partner for both indonesia and the   philippines turning to the asian superpower for 
vaccines created controversy in both countries   the indonesian governments claimed that 
one of the dimensions of synoffex biopharma   vaccine corporations is transfer technology 
it's not that really significant because we   only receive a faxing bulk from china and 
then indonesia just put it in a battle so   and indonesia make the vaccine bulk into finnish 
product we haven't seen any direct pressure given   by the chinese sites for for for the indonesian 
side so the indirect pressures could be manifested   into a feeling of indebtedness that somehow we 
need to pay back during the pandemic indonesia had   already organized at least three or four bilateral 
meetings of our foreign minister visited china   and even state councilor wang e also visited 
indonesia so we can see an intensifications of   bilateral interactions the dirty administration's 
reliance on chinese vaccines would make the   philippines more vulnerable to chinese pressures 
on issues in the bilateral relation this   might make the philippines weaker 
in its negotiations with china in   matters related to west philippine sea the 
philippines will get more dependent on china   this is not a good situation for the philippines 
but this is the reality because we also need china   to help our countrymen to get 
vaccinated through their vaccines but despite getting the 
vaccines from china neither   indonesia nor philippines had enough 
vaccine doses for its population so both turned to their private sectors for help 
for the philippines it was a public private effort led by secretary joey concepcion 
actually gambled because they signed   an agreement and paid for the deliveries of 
astrazeneca for a 2.5 million doses initially   even before the eua the emergency use 
authorization by our philippine fda was given   the philippine government honored that 
particular arrangement the tripartite   agreement was the first in the world so after 
the first 2.5 million there were subsequent   uh consolidation of companies that want to procure 
vaccines for their employees and the dependents   of their employees so this is public and private 
sector helping each other to achieve a vaccination   of the population faster flexible innovative 
thinking there because the government is looking   at how they can use private sector finance 
increase the number of people protected   innovative perhaps but it has its limitations 
the general public might be feeling left out   because the people who work in multinational 
car companies or large corporations have   a better chance at getting vaccinated earlier 
than other workers filipino workers especially   those working in the informal sector and small 
medium enterprises so unfortunately they have   limited chances of getting vaccinated and it's 
the vast majority of citizens who will miss out   citizens like joy pulta joy like many 
others work in the informal sector the mother of two supports her family by reselling   beauty products for two to ten us 
dollars per day in her neighborhood her family have already had 
their brush with covert 19   and having no access to vaccines 
is a cause of great anxiety high joy's mother-in-law was admitted to 
the hospital and died eight days later   joy didn't get to say goodbye 
as she was under quarantine foreign despite the pitfalls associated 
with turning to the private sector   indonesia took that route too the government 
announced in february this year that they were   drafting regulations for a private 
vaccination scheme named goto royo uh initiative ostensibly the program is designed to enable the 
employees of companies to obtain vaccines as a   way to restart economic roles but in fact you know 
the beneficiaries also include the directors and   executives so there's a lot of self-interest 
involved it's unseemly because you have a   situation where more well-connected individuals 
have basically preferential access to vaccination   vis-a-vis regular citizens who 
are not corporate employees   the government since the beginning of fundamental 
focus on economy first also they want to recover   their economic sector and that's why 
they do under this uh scheme they want to   vaccinate their workers this scheme 
against the public health strategy   with the pandemic wrong moves can cost lives what 
else went wrong in indonesia and the philippines bringing vaccines into the country is one thing   getting the vaccines into the population 
is another after inoculating its health   and essential workers indonesia had planned 
to target the younger working population   before the elderly i do not see any problem with 
that logic indonesia's working populations right   now is around 130 million so it's quite big so 
it's very important for the government to ensure   that this large proportion of the people receive 
vaccinations to support the economic recovery   but it was a controversial decision going against 
who recommendations there is a document from   the scientific advisory group of experts on 
epidemiology back in november and it details   several options that countries can take when they 
distribute the vaccines they go to the length of   mapping out who are the vulnerable population 
who must get first what other options can you   exercise i think that approach should have been 
taken rather than the approach of the productive   population must be first i think rather than going 
to directly to the the healthy population first   the equity principle must be uphold and 
you go to the ones who need the help most   and plants especially controversial 
ones needed to be communicated well   indonesia's population is very heterogeneous and 
those who live in cities those with different   levels of education those with different exposures 
to science facts those with different exposures   to policy making and then those who live in 
rural areas i think the first principle is to   understand that we are actually not communicating 
to singular group and then thereby not only in   languages but also in approaches in in materials 
um whether you go through radio or through social   media or through television or to flyers i think 
those types of continuous approach in different   angles of communication needs to be strengthened 
in bakassi anastasia was eager to get the vaccine in the philippines communication is a challenge 
too as each city has its own vaccine regulations joy encountered difficulties when trying to book 
a vaccination appointment in her city malabon in some areas we have horror stories 
of people waiting for eight hours   just to get complete an appointment and then 
after that you have to wait for months to   become but in my case i did not experience that 
in my case it's very easy seamless so i think   it depends i think on the local government 
unit but the fact that it is erratic means   it's an even meaning that it's still it's 
in a problem because it's a standardized   there is still pockets of inefficiency and 
then actually efficiency which is not good   my thinking is that the national government gave 
too much leeway to the local government eunice or   probably put the burden on the city government 
to inoculate their citizens and i think that the   slow progress of the immunization program 
shows that there's some miscommunication   or there's some things that are not sorted 
out when there's a vaccine roll out in a city   and there's no organization between 
the national and the local government communication and organization issues aside 
both indonesia and the philippines were still   in dire need of vaccine doses early this 
year both governments had registered to get   vaccines for 20 percent of their populations 
from kovacs 54.1 million people indonesia   and 21.6 million in the philippines but kovacs 
itself had problems getting the doses it needed   one of the key challenges of gofax to getting the 
commitment and pledges or concrete donations and   support from countries because it's basically 
the whole world with needs of vaccination but   not enough supplies you're competing for the 
same pool of vaccines that can be produced by   the same limited number of manufacturers it's 
been challenging for the companies that are   producing because these are biological processes 
that cannot be scaled up very quickly you need   to ensure that the products are safe they are 
efficacious and they follow good manufacturing   practices what they did was that it created 
a supply bottleneck for the provax deliveries and this year a bottleneck grew into a serious 
problem the serum institute of india the world's   largest vaccine manufacturer had pledged 
200 million doses of astrazeneca to kovacs   but when india faced a devastating 
wave of covert 19 infections in april   largely due to the new highly 
transmissible delta variant   its officials restricted the export of 
vaccines in order to protect its own population   this meant that the philippines for one 
had to lower its vaccination targets   from 70 to 50 percent this year and indonesia too 
experienced a significant drop in vaccine supply stocks and to make things worse the delta 
variant has now caused the largest spike   in covert knighting infections in the country 
the delta farian has become a newfound epidemic   within the pandemic so many countries 
now has a new wave new suitcase   because of this delta variant if we put this 
context in term of vaccination the country who has   less vaccinated person or people is the country 
who more vulnerable due to this delta variant   with the covet 19 virus continually mutating 
and new variants surfacing the key to protecting   everyone is still vaccines the emergence of 
variants creates added pressure to see how we can   accelerate vaccine deliveries tomorrow we may have 
a variant that is even more transmissible or maybe   is capable of causing even more severe disease 
and that is why we have been emphasizing that   whether be it alpha beta or delta yes you 
need to increase your response capacities but even as poorer countries like indonesia 
and the philippines race to vaccinate their   populations there's light at the end of the tunnel in mid-2021 only one percent of people in low 
and middle income countries around the world   have received at least one 
dose of covert 19 vaccine indeed me the good news for poorer countries is that 
after inoculating most of their own populations   richer nations have stepped up their assistance at the g7 summit in june world leaders 
committed 817 million vaccine donations both indonesia and the philippines have also inked   deals with pfizer bioentech and are 
finally getting deliveries from august   the vaccine maker is sending 15 million doses 
to indonesia enough for around 10 percent of its   population and 40 million doses to the philippines 
for around 20 percent of their people orders from   other vaccine makers are also starting to arrive 
and more is being done on other fronts too in the philippines authorities have 
started trials on mixing vaccines based on the data that we have the 
efficacy is still high or maybe even higher   when we mix different brands together 
so sometimes we can use cyanobac for   example and get the second dose of moderna or 
pfizer it has been studied in other countries   what they're seeing is that it looks like it's 
okay the efficacy is still high i think it   would be an acceptable strategy especially 
if we have a limited number of vaccines on the ground organizations like the philippine 
red cross are supplementing the government's   distribution of vaccines they are bringing the 
doses to the public in special vaccine buses   well the kona bus will go to a particular area   where people are not aware of the program 
of the government that they can get it free   and that's that's why it's effective you 
go right to the doorstep of the people   local governments usually should welcome these 
buses because they can intensify the vaccination   in their area because if you rely on the centers 
or the vaccinations of the lg you are people will   tend to line a line up long which means that 
they can get the disease from each other right the tondo community initiative is also 
rolling up its sleeves to help residents   with no internet access to book 
their vaccination appointments we know that this community being poorest 
of the poor may not have the courage to   to be active in demanding for their 
rights to have access we found out that   even if there are vaccination registration that 
they cannot afford because most of them have no   cell phone they don't have internet access 
so tondo community initiative decided that   we will focus on helping the government on 
the online registration so we personally   each of the social workers goes to this community 
and encourage people to do online registrations over in indonesia vaccine manufacturer 
biopharma has started talking with china   about producing the synovic scene from scratch uh three school alumni associations have also 
come together to form centra vaccinasi serbium   an independent vaccination center run by 
volunteers to help inoculate the community financially decided to come here for her vaccinations with vaccine supplies increasing 
both indonesia and the philippines   can afford to be slightly more optimistic was to vaccinate 70 million people fully 
vaccinated by november 28th of this year   the country's vaccination centers we have about 
three thousand seven hundred i think almost four   thousand already that's vaccinating and we're 
able to churn out uh almost 350 000 a day   and the goal is to reach our target we should 
be vaccinating 500 000 a day so our only problem   now is really the supply delivery as long as the 
supplies are steady and every month we get about   15 million doses we will be able to reach our 
target plus or minus one to two weeks the supplies   will come and it will it will be enough to supply 
and inoculate the whole world perhaps sooner than   we think because now manufacturers are ramping 
up their capacity and the sooner that the supply   can cover the whole population the sooner we have 
a real hope that the pandemic will end the sooner   the world come together um to distribute vaccines 
uh equitably and make uh production available   in different parts of the world i think that 
will be our our light at the end of the tunnel you"

Russia is the first country to grant regulatory approval for a vaccine, but its decision to do so before completing trials has raised safety concerns.

happen to be new around here I am Trevor this is Anna we are the delightful travelers and today's video is going to be entirely different than any other video we've ever done there's we're trying to figure out how to manage everything right now so those of you that follow us regularly we are not currently in Romania I'm putting out a Romanian series but that was filmed quite a while ago we're actually currently in El Nido in the Philippines the whole point of today's video is to explain to you how kovat 19 this virus has affected us and our travels and tell you where we are and how we got here basically yeah we're trying to figure everything out so for those that they love you to follow along chronologically we will release those Romania videos that whole series still we're just not sure when yet and we have more videos after that so right now we're just trying to figure out the whole balancing act so how did we get to where we are right now in back in February we actually started off in Bali that was a very beginning of February yeah things in the world were not nearly as bad as they are at the moment we had no idea what was gonna happen of course it was on our mind and we were yeah I staying up up-to-date with the news and everything but we had no clue it was all going to affect us so badly you know we were hanging out with the endless adventure then so we just went back to the villa I lost my eye walking backwards trying to film them and this is they put up some videos on that if you go check their channel we have some videos and that that will come out at a later date but in Bali this was just it was just wasn't as serious as it is right now now then when we finished up in Bali we flew into Manila and even then we got to Manila this was early March of course people were talking about it but the only difference we could see in Manila was there was temperature checks being done everywhere you go actually thought we felt pretty good flying from Bali to Manila was very normally maybe asked us a couple questions but there were no temperature checks no forms to fill out it was very easy so we spent a few days in that big city of Manila and we did film some videos Oh Wow never in a million years did I expect Manila to look like this we actually have probably five four or five Philippine videos to eventually come out in the regular style travel vlog videos but after Manila we went to Corona and this was around like March 10th or something like that so still things weren't they didn't blow up like they did in mid-march so we got to Kuro managed to do a tour we had it we got some fun stuff I can't I absolutely cannot get over these limestone rocks that we what we looked at pictures for so long with the Philippines and that's kind of what you see look we did we didn't notice that chrome was probably emptier than it would normally be but still it wasn't it was quite normal overall it felt good we felt good about it but on our last day in chrome that's when the President of the Philippines came on to the news and announced a public broadcast to everyone saying domestic air and domestic sea travel to and from Metro Manila shall be suspended beginning March 15 2020 to end on April 14 2020 in two days the Philippines was going to lock down and all tourists had two days to get out if they chose to leave the country which was highly advised at the time so they said you have two days to get out no more flights even domestic flights so give me to get where you're going immediately so things yeah we're quite scary and concerning at the time but we did actually already have a flight pre-booked to forego from Carone to el nido which is where we are now just a nut more backstory we were planning to stay in the Philippines for a very long time the lockdown is for a month it will lift April 15th but we were planning to stay well past that in fact we were probably staying probably planning to stay in Southeast Asia until like mid May so we figured let's go to El Nido it's more touristic it's stocked with food there's expats here it's on the island of Palawan which is really big so we figured if weren't locked into town which we didn't know we would be we could maybe at least go around Paulo on a little bit if if we could of course so that was their thinking back and also as Trevor said being on a bigger island was more resources here at the time there were zero cases of the virus here on Paulo on the entire island as of now which is a few weeks later there's only been one confirmed case and he has left he was from Australia he's gone back to Australia and early to fully recovers now and so far there haven't been any other papers the Philippines have been taking this very seriously as well not like other countries aren't but they caught it really early and they've locked everything down in fact el nido has not been letting anyone in the last flight was basically the flight we got an open March 15th a correct so the town is locked down and it's cleared out so just by default we feel really isolated we've been doing self isolation as well so we feel like we're in a good spot but the town's taking it so serious that at night there's actually a siren that goes off at about 8 o'clock and looks something like this all right well everything has just changed is complete lockdown and there are now sirens this is crazy this is crazy all right [Music] I don't know but this is I mean again this is all preventative stuff there's nothing to panic about but everything has just changed we send out updates and it's completely changed yep nothing to say what are we gonna do walk up play cards or um play cards yeah oh my here we go basically that just means you have to get you know get back to your hotel and there's a curfew luckily we are with two other amazing people jumping places you probably know them well this is Chris and Carol of jumping places and well we're all we're hanging out every day now okay we don't know what we can do absolutely we hate to work it out but you guys kind of ended up here the same way we did right like he just figured this was a bigger island made sense yeah we were on that island called a low helo but we really didn't want to be stuck on the island minutes like here and yeah yeah and we found out each other we were chatting on Instagram and we found out we're out here so it's better to be stuck together yeah but yeah I think so have friends there in the Philippines as well they also plan to come here we've sort of planned it out with that the four of us could be stuck here together in isolation so we're kind of joined it basically our family now yeah so yeah it's just really it's we it's the positive things in that definitely meeting them it's great to have those guys here but in general Oh need I was so empty just walking around the town we can't get over it weeks off you know videos last year of our videos just in the past I moved to Beaufort like this place is a tourist this is one of the biggest tourist destinations in all of the Philippines it's usually packed with people when there's nobody here but I want to answer one question that I know you guys are gonna ask did we try to get home basically like when this whole thing happened and we definitely discussed it a lot we stressed over it for hours and hours and hours ourselves and with jumping places trying to decide what is the best move for us it was just super stressful but what we basically like we weighed the pros and the cons and for one most of the moment they announced that lockdown here in the Philippines all the flights sold out so we knew if we needed to get to an International Airport here in the Philippines we were gonna have to go to the airport every day with our luggage wait in lines around hundreds of other people that are really upset trying to get out they were so stressful and we probably wouldn't get on the flight I don't think we would and the prices like quadruple we were hearing at one point for jumping places to get to Brazil it was like seven thousand dollars so there was a lot of that we do talk about this just so you know every 20 I feel like every 15 or 20 minutes we're talking about the situation but just to go further with that so we knew it would be very hard to get out of in the first place it could have probably been done but very very stressful then we wouldn't even have been able to book a flight not knowing if we were gonna get out in the first place so we would have had to go to a different airport in on the mainland basically take a bus to Manila which is entirely locked down so you'd have to go through checkpoints and that kind of thing around buses with lots of people get to the Manila Airport and then try to figure things out from there and then we knew we'd have to probably jump a whole bunch of you know four or five different airports even to get home money having to come in contact with so many people being on planes that just sounded really dangerous to us and not a good idea yeah that was a big one so each day that passed here were we're thinking like should relieve should we leave we're watching coronavirus spread across Europe they took over Europe and now it's you know America the US for USA is like the epicenter for this so we didn't want to be in those airports and we just kept talking about how isolated we are here the towns doing a good job and where we are at because we were at accommodations where we had no access to outdoor so that was pretty tough in town and but where we're at right now I'm one day I have a quarantine pass and I'm allowed out to get provisions and one day I kind of just came up outside like 20 minutes outside of you know just by myself and just hit up a few hotels and just say like are you taking anybody you know because they have an outdoor space and pool and they had a restaurant and we were hearing at the time that there might even be a really strict lockdown where you're not allowed to get provisions a captain or marshal or and the Philippines would have to bring you food so right away we were like we should get in a hotel and be we wanted to get access to the outdoors we were just confined and we basically we had access to a walk we had a view of a wall no sunlight whatsoever we really however when they do two weeks with no sunlight no vitamin B not healthy at all did that for what a week yeah yeah so that was tricky so yeah let's Trevor said he went out and he found us this hotel that we're at now most places are not either totally shut down or not taking people and we really really love know that the really nice guy he said he'll take you only had two other jerks and he graciously agreed to take us in which was so nice of him but he said no more after that like four couples here and staff and that's it you'll see more of this place as we go because we're gonna try to do more update videos and more quarantine vlogs this can be interesting because we've never done that before but we do feel extremely grateful that we are staying where we are right now and I can't stress enough that we talked about this whole situation daily there's some people on Instagram saying you're not taking this serious all your hair taken here we are very informed read the news probably five times a day around the world we know what's happening here in the Philippines and our company in Canada and the US we are very informed yeah so we try to keep up-to-date with everything that's happening that about brings you up to date with our current situation as you are watching this video we have filmed this today probably a few hours before this is going to be live on YouTube here we are most up-to-date video ever yeah so yeah just bear with us cuz we're trying to figure out what to do we have three Romanian videos left and then we're gonna be in Bali for three videos and then there's a bunch of Philippine videos but we're going to hold on to those right now because a lot less people are watching travel videos because they're not thinking about destinations but people are into the quarantine videos because they just want to know what's going on so I think that's what we're gonna do maybe won't release videos like one one every Sunday every second Sunday where we might start dispersing from the problem videos and there we're not sure yet and if you guys have any suggestions please comment below we'd love to know what you guys think absolutely love to hear with you guys things we actually have a really cool video I have it ready to go today and it's on Dracula's castle in Romania [Music] but we're just gonna hold it for a little while longer so what you can expect it's probably every three or four days we're gonna release videos here about being under quarantine what we're doing that kind of thing but don't expect our regular videos are gonna be much more raw not nearly as edited as they normally are yeah there's probably not gonna be any music not much planning we don't plant well we plant a few things that when we fill them but honestly we just riff it as we go these are just gonna be videos pretty much within the hotel that we're at we do have a small access to a beach a beautiful view and we do need to still go to get provisions so I can take I just I I think I can take you along maybe both my try yeah well we can go out and get a few things at the store and which is very close and probably once every week I'm gonna need to go back into El Nido which we hear is a ghost town right now even more so to get maybe some groceries and things like that so I'll show you what our life is like definitely not what the purpose of rubbing anything in nobody's having a blast here and we're not just like floating around in the pool too you know with no toy with no cares in the world were definitely high stress levels but we're trying to make the most of the situation yeah we're trying to stay positive we know everyone's home right now we are stuck here we want to make content for people to watch for distractions that's why we're probably will still sprinkle in some of the travel videos with some of these videos but I think we've said everything we needed to say one more thing I was going to say is that if you were not following us on Instagram you may have no idea that we were here in the Philippines but if you have been following us you'd know this already because you've been watching our story so I highly suggest heading over to Instagram giving us a follow and then you can watch your stories there too yeah well guys if you liked the video make sure to hit the thumbs up it's gonna help us out hit subscribe if you want to follow along on our our Philippine quarantine kovin 19 lockdown I don't want to call it an adventure not a fun adventure leave us a comment we'd love to hear from you guys especially when we're just isolated like this maybe we can get a conversation let's know where you are where you're up to yeah wet your lockdown or 14 is like it feels really weird to do the ending right now but I guess I'll do it anyway alright guys that's it from the El Nido in the Philippines on lockdown wishing you not any travels at the moment but we hope your delightful yes be food she we were all thrown out we never know I guess [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]

sophia tamara cruz and today we are here with dr maria consor shaquison who sits on the national immunization technical advisory group for clovid 19 vaccine epidemiology today we're going to discuss the country's recently launched booster rollout thank you for joining us today though um i'll just dig right i'll i'll dive right in um so after months of debate the first question i want to ask you is after months of debate the philippines has finally cleared the use of covenanting boosters starting of course with health workers and seniors um someone who sits on the expert groups who have deliberated on this what does the data tell us at this point about why boosters are needed at the moment okay what does they tell us but more importantly not only the data in the philippines but the experience globally is that we need boosters or additional doses number one for healthcare workers simply because of the exposure the kind of exposure that they have number two for the senior for this uh initially we said for the elderly senior citizens which is 70 and above but but getting done implementation we said us again all senior citizens and then for the immuno complies why is this why it not in una is because um uh not necessarily because we think that they their uh immunity is already but in addition to that the fact that they are immunized maybe um the antibody or the immune uh immune response that is expected from their body didn't kick in as high or as optimal as the regular person or the person which is not immunocompromised and that is why they this sub population warranted an additional dose just to make sure that in fact they are protected right doc i want to ask you that please need another question um we know that right now health workers and seniors are the ones who are eligible to receive a booster but later on we expect that more groups will become um eligible to receive an additional shot what does this tell us about um the current vaccine effectiveness of the the shots that are available right now because um we're telling the puppy you know it's not really it's not really a question of oh they weren't effective additional those you know remember that when we started vaccination early in in february this year all of the all of the available vaccines were on an emergency use uh basis meaning not any one of them can in fact say uh beyond reasonable doubt that the effectiveness of of our vaccine is 12 months you know nobody can say that because everybody is still like on studying or waiting to see if in fact [Music] so given uh what we have now with one we know in the past months uh all of them said okay this warrants an additional dose that is are not singling out any brand of vaccine we're saying all of the vaccines uh whatever you took would uh you would need an additional dose and maybe later on a booster dose supply and a supply uh if supply is available you know when we say booster it usually means something that will boost uh whatever you have um uh when we started vaccination uh most the experts thought that uh um you know it will take 12 months 12 months and then you need a booster but right now what uh your experience is showing as a six months and then you need a booster so it has nothing to do with saying ah those vaccines are uh efficacious in the first place no we're just seeing more results as the months uh roll by right um i want to ask you about you know now that boosters are available because we talk about it not necessarily saying that vaccines weren't effective to begin with right like the data is just showing us that we're going to it it would be good to have another um additional dose but if we're talking about um you know what a vaccine is supposed to prevent right like for example it's supposed to prevent severe disease hospital hospitalization and death um the current two doses that we have right now still achieve that so what are we trying to achieve um what are boosters going to do now for for those who are allowed to get it and what are we seeking to prevent by offering an additional shot to people is it um infection severe disease what is it yeah yeah the bottom line is still prevention for hospitalization and deaths okay so the reason why and and i chose immunocompromise because that is easier to to explain you know the they are immunocompromised when they got their two doses we aren't 100 percent sure convert i mean even with the uh where their bodies able to produce enough antibodies to come to that level where protected and that is the reason why uh we're saying that let's give them an addition or a booster dose just so uh they'll be better protected uh rather than just because as i said we assume that maybe they both get to that level of having enough protection now for the health workers it's about exposure that they have to the um to the virus that is why okay we need to give you the booster those x months what about for our elderly population because they're currently also eligible to receive an additional shot and later on when we have more groups allowed yeah you know for the geriatrics group we actually had the debate on this um uh it is not to say just because they are old it means that their bodies are not working anymore right i mean there are so many uh senior citizens or maybe far sorry far more healthier than both um again it's it's the same argument it's the same argument that um their bodies may not have been able to raise the level of immunity that is expected of them um uh maybe because of the old age and that is why i'm trying to qualify uh that's why you said initially not just because you're senior citizen you know doesn't mean that you're not healthy anymore right that's why initially we said maybe even the older senior citizens like 70 and above but just to make sure especially as um um available and supply uh so uh during implementation it's really senior citizens the elderly seniors right um which i guess is also kind of why uh when the age stack um preliminary release of preliminary recommendation there is also a prioritization framework again so it wasn't like a free-for-all that we are allowing boosters it also followed again the a1 a2 a3 priority yeah i want to talk a little bit about the decision-making behind the decision-making process behind deciding when to offer boosters because in the philippines you're aware of course that calls for boosters have been made months ago and a lot of people cited as a lot of people reciting the experiences of other countries who have gone ahead um and also um we also know for a fact of course anecdotally we hear that other people have haven't um didn't want to wait for the go signal of the doh and they have gone ahead and just taken a an additional those anyway um so how is the government and its experts kind of balancing uh you know when they make their recommendations the timeliness of this recommendation so while also um sticking to what the data says and especially when like like i mentioned you you you expert groups sit down and you debate and sometimes there are conflicting views um and also the the the science is also always being constantly updated um as the pandemic evolves can you talk to us more about that and that is the reason why the vaccine experts you know hindi i mean they have to keep on reading and reading and keep themselves abreast all the articles that scientific articles that are coming out you know each one with with probably a different or an updated result than just a few days ago you know one of the first steps that we had to consider is um for you emergency use uh utilization like the license that we have um we had to make sure that there's eu eul for an additional dose it means that uh because as of the moment you know it's like any any product you know a registered product with say you have two tablets and then done you know so so it's not as easy as let's just give them three tablets you know that's if if that's not what the product is for then we have to be very careful so all the vaccine experts all the other all expert groups you know and looking at the um available um only time that we were able to recommend that we can in fact already give boosters to at least these sub-populations uh based on uh the results of of the studies that they have seen the philippines but globally and also and one important thing there is what also the um expert group from who or the recommendations of the wh o sage you know that carried a lot of weight um but if i'm not mistaken right doc that hasn't a full recommendation hasn't come out yet um we're still waiting for them to meet um because they they they endorse it for seniors and um of course they send china back and trying to form those who got that should get one more shot but for let's say the general population there hasn't really been there's no wh osage recommendation on that if i'm i'm not mistaken none yet for the general population i'm still speaking about our our subpopulations which are a1 and then a2 and then those who are compromised we're not even talking about a3 here because just because comorbidity doesn't mean that you are immunocompromised i want to ask you a little bit about you mentioned that we the experts looked at the experiences of different countries as well what did you see what did the experts see there that really convinced them to you know um say okay let's offer boosters in the philippines to the subpopulations right um you know um in many countries what they see now most or a big number of those who got a severe covet are the un unvaccinated next to the unvaccinated are those who have been previously vaccinated but are immunocompromised you know or or like really the as i said this so um elderly seniors and that is one of the reasons why um it was uh it was recommended or it was considered that they have those because of um the possibility that really their bodies were didn't reach the ma as i said the optimum level of uh protection with just the two doses right um i want to ask that makes an interesting point because i think um early on of course the the the question about whether or not a booster would be needed is something that's that experts have been talking for many months now and early on and up until to a certain extent up until now um one really important argument against a wide robot of boosters is of course vaccine equity and um in the philippines we've gone from you know very strongly calling out this vaccine inequity um up until a few months ago and of course you also know that the who said that offering boosters to like a large population or maybe you know um yeah with aggravated situation and then locally you also have a situation where millions are unvaccinated still um or not fully vaccinated at the very least so i do you see these two things as conflicting and how are we balancing um those two these priorities you know reaching the and vaccinated who you mentioned is always we've seen are the ones um who make up the most number of severe cases yet offering boosters at the same time right oh well we maintain and we still see to it that there should be equity as much as possible we still reach out to those who are unvaccinated now as far um we were um we were insured by our vaccine sar and the iatf that that there will be enough vaccine even though we offer boosters to the particular subgroups there will be enough how many are we talking about healthcare workers about a million about less than 10 million if we're going to give boosters to all two so that's an additional 11 million if we are able to reach all of them however as uh it stands um i don't think we even got into anywhere near 100 of 82 for the primary series so what am i trying to say is that um it will not jeopardize you know indeed a primary series booster apologies um sorry doc you were saying please continue um we maybe we can start where we left just the future um yeah i was saying i was asking about how how we're balancing those priorities and making if you see those two things that's conflicting yeah so i as i said it's not conflicting we're still prioritizing those who weren't vaccinated yet okay primary series exhaust moon allah and hopefully this uh three days uh that that the government uh set aside for for bakuna would have boosted the the number of people um who had the primary cities but it was was the primary concern of experts just supply because we've had enough supply for quite a time now right but it hasn't necessarily translated to faster up to a wider uh coverage among seniors so is it just about supplier or did you did the experts seek assurance for something else like other efforts to make sure that those who need primary doses are are actually showing up to the sides or was supply just a concern when it came to you know balancing these priorities of offering boosters but also you know when you think as a balancing of equity you know when you talk about equity it's like there's not enough there's not enough and and you're taking away uh whatever for for uh those who need it for the primary series now if we have enough supply then it theoretically uh you know we can still uh there will be enough to go around but then you are also correct um i think is um i don't know if you can call it vaccine healthy um initially because there are still places where in uh we couldn't even reach 100 coverage for um for the a2 and the a3 you know more effort by by the local leaders to see to it that that um you know the vaccines really get into the arms of the people and not only for the leaders but also for the citizens to do their part and submit for uh vaccination considering that they will not only be protecting themselves but they will be protecting their fellow also right um two different issues but both equally important um i want to move on a little bit to well it touches a little bit on equity still but it also involves of course a recent development that of um has worried a lot of people over the last few days is the who's designation of omicron as a variant of concern it's the first one after delta which we know is already highly transmissible up until then it's been regarded as the fastest and the fitness variant of this virus um you know some countries are are now thinking about okay uh opening boosters to the general population um in the philippines where vaccines are completely okay maybe we have to consider opening the vaccine the booster drive to um economic frontliners a4 who also make a pretty big part of the population so do you see that um you know could this affect how soon boosters are allowed for other priority groups like a4 or it's too early to tell at this point too early too early you know if there is the oh micron variant then uh too early to say that let's give everybody a booster uh uh because we'll be there you know um number one um [Music] sorry the doh said uh our target is 70 uh uh of the 70 okay so percent of our our uh population is eligible as of that moment so we are targeting 70 percent of that fully vaccinated then we have good melaban with whatever variant would come in right um doc i want to talk a little bit about the urgency of of getting boosted right because now you have um you know there's a holiday season coming uh you also have this threat of a new variant and then the fact that covet i mean the pandemic is still ongoing um so if i'm somebody who is eligible how am i eligible at this moment how might i be able to measure my need for a booster you know based on some of the risks that i face if it's not yet my time like should i be worried about getting boosted sooner um is it okay for me to wait if i'm not eligible should i still wait or should i try to seek that out yeah well first of all if you're not a health worker if you're not senior citizen and if you're not immunocompromised uh you're with what you have with the double dose okay secondly um you know from day one even with the double dose even though indeed in pinago we've been saying that um a vaccine is not the only uh protection that you should have you know we should still practice uh the cat standards like face masks and and well facial when i'm you know if i i feel so insecure well never mind if you laugh at me because i hate you but i will do so because i want to protect myself and then you know even though we're so so very tempted to go shopping and go to the mosque and go to crowded places please please you know we still have to be um very vigilant and and be protective of ourselves and and not expose ourselves unnecessarily so what i'm trying to say is that if your question is or yet may i enjoy a merry christmas yes you still can because you are you have that protection if you are vast and you still have the other um you know like like as the minimum public health standards in order to ensure that you are going to be safe right um you know while there's a lot of camera for boosters it's also really clear that there's a lot of questions that still need to be answered on its use and whether i mean when it might be really necessary for everyone at this point and time at the moment are there any possible or what do we still not know about the issues that we want to know um are there for example are there possible risks involved um yeah what are the unknowns at this point in time no the unknowns is do we really need months at one year or two years or five years you know um let me just clarify with you uh what the booster and what an additional dose means you know when we doses it means you are fully vaccinated okay how long is that full vaccination going to protect us so is it gonna protect us for one year if it's gonna protect us for one year then it means that you booster next year okay on the other hand what is it additional though vaccination [Music] in order to be called fully vaccinated you know we don't know that that is one of the things so even if you have the third dose fully vaccinated okay how long is that going to protect me again after having three doses to be called fully vaccinated is that going to protect me for one year or 5 years so we would know sooner rather than later so we're talking we're saying uh booster now after six months but really in the first place hindi alam may be alumni birds but i don't know if our are we really talking about now or do we are we really talking about in the first place and we would know sooner or later but is that the sense you're getting dog that um well is that the center great thing for example are boosters going to be annual or is this a three dose is the regular is the quote-unquote primary though it's like a regular regimen three dose we started this vaccination on the premise that the primary series is two doses long individual and then we said okay the two doses and the best scientific guesstimate is that it's going to last us for one year so our booster is going to be let's say march are fully vaccinated so angus surmo will be march next year that's what we thought you know and maybe that is still true for the general population but then against having another by virtue of little exposure in a1 and because immunocompromising became a booster at six months maybe for the general population it would still be done next year okay um as a final question doc i want to ask you just to zoom out a little bit what what do we expect boosters to do for the pandemic at this point um you know the course of the pandemic is trajectory is it supposed to help um keep this under control is it mostly for the individual that they have more protection what are what what yeah what might boosters uh effect have on the trajectory of this pandemic will help prevent hospitalizations and deaths kayanga in the first populations that we chose are those who are most likely to be hospitalized and who will die of kovid it changed the course of the pandemic probably um not but it will bring down our case fatality rate definitely and it will help it will provide respite for our already hospital workers so in that sense doc it's kind of the same we're trying to we're still working towards the same goals that we're that we wanted to achieve with a primary vaccination series which is to prevent severe disease hospitalizations and death but now we're seeing that um there's a student where a lot i mean more work might be needed yes because remember that that none of the vaccines ever promised 100 or even you know 100 uh prevention against infected from the covet nobody ever promised that the 100 promising is close to a hundred percent prevention of hospitalization prevention of the severe form of the disease of kovid right okay well on that note we'll definitely be closely following the developments especially as a new variant is of course um in the news right now and scientists are watching that very closely um we hope to have you again next time on the show doc thank you so much for joining us today um this is rapper talk please join us again next time i'm sophia toma cruz thank you sophia thank you

160,254GdlKEz5I,Philippines Opens Borders to Vaccinated Travelers as Covid-19 Eases,"The Philippines has reopened its doors to travelers from more than 150 countries with visa-free privileges, lifting entry restrictions for foreign tourists and businesspeople after nearly two years. It's a move to revive the battered tourism industry as the latest coronavirus outbreak started to ease. Foreign travelers will no longer be required to quarantine in government-designated centers upon arrival if they have been fully vaccinated and tested negative prior to arrival, officials said.

The government had initially planned to lift the ban on Dec. 1 but indefinitely postponed it as the more contagious omicron variant spread, which also prompted authorities to reimpose tighter restrictions.

President Rodrigo Duterte warned that unvaccinated Filipinos who defy orders to stay at home could face arrest. Commuters who have not been immunized were also prohibited from public transport in the capital region of more than 13 million people unless on urgent errands, for at least up to the end of the month. The decision has sparking protests from human rights and labor groups. 

“We’re done with border control,” Health Undersecretary Rosario Vergeire told a news conference in January, adding that government focus has shifted to preventing community transmission of the omicron variant

The number of tourists dropped by more than 6 million, and more than a million Filipinos lost their jobs in tourism businesses and destinations in the first year of the pandemic alone, according to government statistics. Tourism destinations, including popular beach and island resorts, resembled ghost towns at the height of pandemic lockdowns.

in self quarantine whether it be voluntary or by government recommendation some countries however are on a strict authorisation to stay at home or face arrest one of the strictest lock downs is taking place right now in the Philippines where there are police patrolling every corner and rumors of martial law there has been a lot of international media attention on the Philippines with reports saying somebody even got shot for breaking the quarantine rules to get to the bottom of how Street departed politics are we wanted to talk to someone from the Filipino governments and the deputy chief for operations of the Philippine National Police who's the third highest ranked officer within the National Police agreed to be interviewed by Asian boss this is the first time that anyone from the Filipino national police talked to a foreign media so we hope you watch the video till the end to get a different perspective you would be able to get elsewhere this is how the interview wins maraming salamat PO sign you or examine you menu and salami the reason why I wanted to talk to you two things because you understand that the Philippines is still under lockdown as we speak and that you have one of the most important and highest positions at the Philippine National Police is that right thank you for this opportunity Marie but we just like to point out that we are not using the word lap down here in the Philippines to contain the spread of the corona virus since it connotes something that is hard and with only still fear among our people the Filipinos are already scared of this pandemic so the government is cautious in using words and terminology so we prefer to use this as community quarantine una una Posada hat wit upon a new epoch American unabomb Union position admin responsibility Savion P well I am the deputy chief for operations of the Philippine National Police I am the number three in the hierarchy of the Philippine National Police at at the same time the commander of the Joint Task Force code shield which is the government's enforcement arm in the fight against kovat 1980 Task Force commander I am in charge of supervising the implementation of Streak health protocols crafted by our experts assess mandatory wearing a face mask whenever people go out of their homes observance of physical distancing and restricting there is a sorry travel of our people now we have at least well around 110 million Filipinos nationwide and we have 200 5000 police fest fidelity you took the helm as deputy chief of operations on January 20 2020 which is only a few months ago right so when you came on board did you ever anticipate anything like covered 19 happening in the Philippines assessing the current situation across the globe nobody seems to expect this to happen discrete but when yous about of this was happening in Wuhan China already making headlines our commander in chief president Duterte has already instructed us to prepare for the worst-case scenarios noting the proximity of the Philippines to China this is the reason why police and military personnel were rapidly and widely deployed to man the quarantine control points in Metro Manila on March 15 and they loose on the following two days and across the country in the succeeding days sign you open an appeal on hiring the PNP officer how did covert 19 actually impact the Philippines if you look to look into this socio-economic perspective I believe that this is worse than the combined nearly natural calamities but regular hit our country most of our people suddenly found themselves jobless income less and well totally dependent from the government's food and cash assistance but if you were look into this in the standpoint of peace and order there has been a significant decrease in the crime volume or sixty percent reduction in more than 22 months on the implementation of this quarantine rule if were to going to compare this with the last two months before the implementation of the community quarantine it is not worthy to mention however that despite the financial hardship that our people have been experiencing we have not recorded any single case of looping and we attribute this to the planning and foresight of our crisis managers as well as the cooperation as an understanding of our people marabunta on global audience watching right now who's very curious about how the Philippine is actually handling the quarantine in response to the corporate ninety so it's really great to hear from someone like you directly to get the first-hand account so could you explain to us what exactly are the current lockdown restrictions that are in place well we started actually with the ecq in the Mertzes March 17 gcq is the enhanced a community quarantine and any CQ is modified enhance community quarantine but the difference between the acq and the modified easy Chris that in ecq there are only few establishments are permitted to operate but the modified easy few a we loosened a bit and more establishments were a la were allowed so which means that it is more challenging for the Philippine National Police considering that more establishments are now operating and consequently more persons or vehicles are now outside and these are the things that we have to check in order to ensure that only authorized persons are allowed to be outside of the residents what was the direction and exact orders you receive from resident or charity on how to actually implement the lockdown well basically we we are implementing the guidelines given to us by the interagency task force through the conduct of our quarantine control points or checkpoints so first we have to know which subbasements are permitted to operate then who are the people who are members of the workforce of this establishment and through our checkpoint we have to find out whether those who are passing to our checkpoints are authorized or not and aside from that we have police visibility on areas which are a how to operate and one significant interventions that we have implemented is through the implementation of curfew which are initiated by the different local government units a nationwide so what does this mean for the average citizens of Manila are they allowed to go outside what if they have to buy essential items like food groceries or what have to have to go to the hospital is there any system you implement it to help people in this situation our national and local government officials also issued quarantine passes in order for one member of the household to be allowed to buy food and other essential items for their family but strictly during a particular period of time and place well most of this quarantine passes are fully are limited to the place where they are given so we discourage quantum pass holders to cross borders and in say they're advised to buy the essential items only and within the respected communities Anupam when apena come a-knockin challenge palace police force when it comes to enforcing this lockdown well hopefully the our main challenge is actually to prevent the spread of that the virus to save as many Filipinos from being infected and very strict there as a sari movement of these people and forcing them to follow the health and community quarantine protocols as you have seen since the start of our enforcement it started from around 8,000 violations but recently with the more police personnel and soldiers being deployed in the different areas prone to be to be violated on physical distancing it reduced to less than 1,000 violations so right now what we're doing is to accost them but most of them are just being warned and for those who are hard-headed and resisting and it's obeying our police personnel they're the one being arrested and the appropriate charges are being filed against them and it's the dense population also one of the challenges that their police yes of course that is true the population is one of the challenges but we have to work with it all of these constraints and other limitations are being considered but still we have that objective to attain that is why we have to enforce what what needs to be to be implemented so us for us not to waste what we have started for the past two months or so what's the police protocol an official response supposed to be if you see someone disobeying the quarantine well well the implementation of the Kuantan measures release that street but you see we really have to be compassionate so in most of cases we leave this up to our ground commanders to deal with the violators in case to case basis for example nobody is right mind would arrest a senior citizen who just wants to buy his maintenance medicine so or you know to go out to buy a meal for a hungry baby so are you allowed to use force if ever well the use of principle force is always the last resort depending on the situation on the ground at the course of deployment ation of the quarantine rules we come up with basic percepts or protocols which constantly remind to both our men in the public to avoid a desired computation for the public the rule is that one you should obey the quarantine rules and to obey the power of the people or respect the authorities enforcing them and for our men the rule is that for them to exercise maximum tolerance and respect human rights at all cost recently they're still in use that someone actually got shot by the police are you in a position to explain what exactly happened there or what actually led to that situation well there was an incident that happened and one of the checkpoints implementing our what have been guidelines but please understand that I cannot discuss it with you since the matter was already referred to our judicial authorities I see so you're just not allowed to talk about it or well since this is now being investigated I believe that here in the Philippines so we cannot just stop the of the case since it is not being investigated the numbers we have are that over 180,000 people have been cited for warranty violations and that over 50,000 people have been arrested are these numbers correct based on Auburn last latest data as of May 25 or on the 70th bay since the community quarantine has started there are more than hundred eighty two thousand violators recorded from March 17 of the speaker more than 107 thousands were one around 20 thousands were fine and almost 55 thousands were arrested these numbers are actually believed to be the highest in the world setting in Newport rocketboom arrived in Moscow and arrested us wealthy number of Paris only represents 30 percent of the number of recorded violators most of those arrested are repeat offenders those who they respect our officers in the ground and those who went out for the house just for the fun of it this arrests are necessary in order to send Stern's statement to the public that national government is determined to enforce the law because what is a stake is the public health which is serious issue of course other countries have their own laws but you see in this kind of pandemic we have to be strict on the laws pertaining to quarantine regulations otherwise it is our life me to stay that is why we really have to do this you know the economy is hurting we have sacrificed a lot so it is just but proper that we should implement to the strictest sense the law so that we can invade objective of what we are doing we don't sacrifice a that we are experiencing I didn't Tudor to repeatedly mentioned that he would enforce martial law in the country if necessary something in your motto by Metallica ito martial law subpoenas you know I believe that you have to understand the context and why the person 10 to 30 mentioned that during that time the number of editors continues to rise despite our repeated appeal despite our repeated explanation on how serious the threat of coral virus is and despite the repeated warnings well as the father of the nation we all feel the frustration and the piety of our president and we understand why he had to say and do something as a way of imposing discipline his children and it worked before the daily abrasive quality violators is as high as 3,800 but when more soldiers and members of the police elite force were deployed in the streets of the areas with high number of violators there was a steep drop recorded of quarantine believers since April 23 for one or two days after deployment and the number of returns just never reached the 2000 mark or even much less our president is smart he certainly knows below so from the start we do not believe that he would declare martial law with regard to this matter I think would be yours outside might be very curious about this they may be in their countries they have different they might have lockdown situation as well but it's not like there's a lot of soldiers military people on the streets or patrolling but why does it have to be so strict in the Philippines in particular in comparison to other countries you know other countries have their own way of doing things and the Philippines it is the life of the Filipinos that is a state so well we are sacrificing you know this quarantine is not good for everyone but we have to do this in order for for us not to have this pandemic come to worse that is why in in our minds in the law enforcement side it has to be implemented strictly so it will be followed and the goals and objectives of this program will be attained so I think what everyone is kind of in the same boat because other countries also pretty much have the same problem with the COBE 19 so I think there's still a difference in how different countries reacted and I'm so like curious why the Philippines is stricter in comparison to the other countries if it's the same problem yet well if we let the stricter probably we we have also cost casualties going to thousands you see so right now we have well it is around 800 something like that but if we were not stick on the implementation probably it would be tens of thousands that are already dead because of this pandemic do you actually know how bad the corner of our situation is in the Philippines right now well all right now we have I believe some 14,000 were infected and around the 800 if not mistaken died but if we did that implement district 1 pin procedures probably that that could be higher so that is why we have to do this and we have to continue doing this in order not to waste the sacrifices and difficulties hardships that we have we have been doing for this a quarantine the program critics and some Western media often accuse the Filipino government of being too highly militarized and excessive in their quarantine restrictions how do you respond to these accusations as someone who's actually on the ground enforcing these laws well a few days ago experts from the Philippines top university released the result of a study which states that this trick implementation of this enhance community quarantine has been critical in reducing transmission and deaths due to the karana virus we believe that this is a vindication the part of the president and his crisis managers a vindication on the part of law enforcers and a solid testament that we did the right thing amid unfair Precision's of militarized approach in fighting this virus the Ireland is unfair legations with the Western media is that it is the West where cases of coronavirus infection are high and here in the Philippines we are doing this because you want to save lives you want to save people so I believe that all what we're doing here is in consonance with the objective of this government to save people and we will continue on doing this as long as that we believe is appropriate to attain our goals and objectives in the end what's your biggest priority as one of the key people at the Philippine National Police and what is your long-term mission well the biggest priority of the government which I'm part of is to contain the spread of the carotids virus and save many Filipinos for infection especially now that we are gradually reopening our economy and gradually shifts to the so-called new normal so in terms of the long term mission our commander in chief our president is committed to defend the country from this unforeseen enemy and determined to save as many Pilipinas from being infected by this fatal disease our party will continue to focus on our mission by acting as if it is always the day one of the pandemic in the country until such time that the vaccine is discovered and everything is normalized there anything you want to tell the Western audience or maybe even Western media who portray the way of the how the Philippines is tackling this situation is there any message you want to tell them well it's not very easy for our government you know to plan all of these things that we're doing right now so it's a balancing up on the economy versus the health of the Philippine people and that's why we have this crisis management through the interagency task force to to plan for it and make Marisa recommendation and as long as they've come up with a decision based on science and based on the data that we have for the past days weeks and months we will pull support this one in order to implement this one and now will it really be cooperation support of it's in every Filipinos are here in the Philippines in order for us to heal as one and win this world so we need each and everyone's cooperation and support on this fight is there anything else you would like to get out there where you think the Philippine National Police might be misunderstood and you just want to clarify two things because I think on social media a lot of people are actually blaming the police but what's your response to that I think that the bill must know that the the law enforcement officers particularly Filipino priests is just implementing the guidelines being given by the policy makers or the interagency task force on the management of the emerging infectious disease here in the Philippines the Philippine actual police being the front line of this campaign is actually very much bull narrable on the infection we are not exempted in fact in our organization so far more than 270 among our personnel are infected and uh four died with this a corona virus but still while it is true that we cannot just see our family and we are most of us have been out in the field and cannot go home but feel we have to do this job and that is the essence of public service and what we need from the public is you know not really the recognition but for you too for all of us to cooperate and support each other so that we can attain the objective of this quarantine and other program being implemented by our government international viewers they would only get their news from big international news corporations but they actually never hear from the law and forces directly just like you and I think we are also the first international yet to be able to interview you so

179,MvNEP33fohQ,The Philippines’ Response to the COVID 19 Pandemic Learning from Experience and Emerging Stronger to,,2022-11-22,77,2,0,UCNTTTRCsrNvKRW6ywNlIpaw, good afternoon everyone so we're very pleased to be sharing with you this afternoon uh some of the key findings and Lessons Learned From the covid-19 pandemic allow me to share a little bit about the background of this project we actually started work on this project as early as December 2020. uh being one of the most disaster prone countries um in fact we ranked number eight um in terms of most affected country by extreme weather events according to the world Rex index in of as of 2021 I thought it was very important that we do Post disaster assessment uh very seldom do we do Post disaster assessment and so I think this is one of the reasons why um it seems like we always start from scratch whenever a shock gives us so I thought that if we do um document our responses and Lessons Learned From This pandemic it would help us learn from our experience and also help us manage future shots so I'm very grateful to the fellows who actually contribute them to this particular initiative um next slide please so um for this afternoon um actually we will be um sharing with you um about the book the status and impacts government policy responses um issue and concerns in in the pandemic response and Lessons Learned by by sector so I'll be providing the overview but as Dr baliseros mentioned earlier for this afternoon we're actually going to highlight um some of the sectoral findings specifically on Health by Dr ulip and um on education by Dr um or beta and also the macro responses and Lessons Learned um by Dr Maggie Gonzalez um so for this afternoon I will be focusing on the Philippines responsible 19 pandemic learning from experience and emerging stronger to Future shocks um which I co-authored with um of course a very excellent researchers Tina Ortiz Rita Vargas and art in our bonetta so um in terms of the objectives of the book the book was really intended to do the following examine the observable impacts of the pandemic on various sectors of the Philippine economy and Society document the government's response to the pandemic identify gaps issues and challenges in the government response to the pandemic and finally provide some recommendations to help decision makers craft and Implement better policies so as I mentioned earlier it's really to learn from our experience with a shop and hopefully help us manage future shots better um next so um for the theme paper um which uh we will be presenting um today um there are also um which as I mentioned earlier um was done by our team um Tina and Rita are actually here and we're hoping Arkin is also um uh watching um we also have several background papers that have been prepared by the different fellows and also our our current president of pibs as well as um Dr Sheila Shar who's actually the head of our rib let me just go back to the previous slide um so the first paper that started it all was actually the paper done by Dr ambrigo and and colleagues um including Dr ulip and Dr Francisco and um and Jana oy and that was the projected disease transmission health system requirements and macroeconomic impacts this was done um as early as April 2020 and and um what they did was actually to come up with some projections in terms of what would be the likely impacts of the pandemic um not just in terms of health but also in terms of the the economy and in addition to that um we actually have um the other background papers on Health by Dr ulip we also have the macro responses by Dr Gonzalez which both of them will be presenting today um findings on food Security in the Philippines by Dr Briones and um impacts on the Filipino migrant workers by Dr tabuga and Carlos cabero inequality and human development in the Philippines by Dr Navarro we also did this paper mitigating the impact of covid-19 pandemic on poverty um and then the next one is poverty the middle class and income distribution uh by Dr Albert Dr Abrigo Dr Kimba and Chana vismanos and the paper on education which will be presented this afternoon by Dr orbetta and crisis and risk communication by Dr Sheila CR and national and local governments fiscal response and role in recovery unfortunately we don't have time to present all of this so we've selected only um some of the papers to be presented this afternoon next so let me turn to a status and and impacts um as we all know um this has been a very big shock to the Philippines the Philippines placed 24th and 26th with the highest cumulative cases and deaths respectively among 236 economies as of June 2021 so as of June 2021 we've had 1.4 about 1.4 million um total cases and um about 24 000 deaths and um that has actually increased um so that as of May 24 2022 we have almost um 3.6 million cases and um 60 000 deaths next and among asean member states the Philippines ranked second with highest cases and deaths and biggest economic contraction in 2021. next so we actually experienced 9.6 contraction in um 2020. so what was the initial response of the government um as we can see as detailed here in the table um actually the government resorted to um um monitoring of the Philippine borders tighter screening of passengers halting a Visa issuance and restrictions on inbound flights um the interagency task force was also convened for the first time and in February flight restrictions were extended to other territories such as those coming from mainland China Hong Kong and Taiwan and in March as the first case of local transmission was reported restrictions on quarantines with different levels I'm sure we're all familiar with this the ecq gcq modified gcq um were actually implemented and notably the Philippines has been recognized as one of the countries with the longest and strictest lockdown in 2020. next please um however we find that this um restrictions and the people's Mobility coupled with the fear of Contracting the biomes hampered economic activities causing businesses to either temporarily or permanently shut down um immediately as a result unemployment Rose and hit a record high of 17.6 percent in the second quarter of 2020 or 10.4 percent for the whole year of 2020 um but 10.3 percent um rather meanwhile underemployment rate suddenly reverted to its 2018 level so the bar chart shows that the industry sector experience the most reduction in employed persons largely owing to the decline in the manufacturing sub-sector and the services sector actually also reduced by 8.5 percent owing to the decrease in employment in accommodation and food service so those are your hotels and restaurants Arts entertainment and Recreation information and communication and real estate activities next so in by 20 um by the second quarter of 2020 in the Philippines enter the session um with a contraction of 16.9 percent so that for the whole year of 2020 real GDP um contracted by 9.6 this was the deepest recession in history since post-war um what we experienced in in 2020 in the second quarter particularly quarterly GDP growth um dipped by 16.9 percent bringing the annual GDP decline to 9.6 in 2020. so what made our economy highly vulnerable our economy is largely reliant on the services sector and as can be seen the most bravely hit sectors are under the services such as the accommodation and Food Service activities transportation and storage which were affected as lockdowns were implemented next on the expenditure side only government spending posted positive growth in 2020 albeit still lower than that of the previous year gross Capital formation experienced the largest decline followed by household spending the consumer Outlook were also very low in the latter half of 2020 which was mainly attributed to the pandemic in addition to the scene increase in unemployment reduced incomes and faster increase in the prices of goods next piece and in the education sector schools were compelled to shift to remote learning so elementary schools are the most affected in terms of enrollment and overall there's a three percent decline in school participation in from basic education and um Dr um or better will actually be sharing the details about this um next slide so in the table we see that the private schools experienced um 21.6 decline in enrollment or equivalent to about 1 million um students so it was really the private sector that was the Private School attendance that was most affected by the pandemic next and in terms of the major mood of learning um we found that students were then compelled to rely on other modes of learning because of the lockdown so data showed that majority of the students in public schools relied on printed modules while those in private school shifted to Blended learning and this is how somehow reflective of the digital divide that exists in the country as shown by the fids 2018 data set and we see that there's a large um disproportion in terms of access to computers by income their sale turning to Poverty um as we would expect poverty incidents and magnitude would um is expected to worsen due to the pandemic reversing recent gains in poverty reduction so um using the actual contraction in GDP in 2020 of 9.6 percent the simulated poverty incidence among families um would actually um increase um this is um without without sap without the social assistance amelioration program and so we would see that the actual date is for 2018 um is 12.1 percent that's the proportion of uh poor families um because of the growth in 20 economic growth in 2019 that was expected to go down further to 10.6 but because of the pandemic is expected to go up to 16 and then because of the slight recovery or turnaround in 2021 um poverty incidents expected to improve a little better in in 2021 to 14 so this is um our sign relations showing the expected Trend in in poverty next so um we only have data actual data for the first semester of um 2021 and that would actually be shown in the green um line um showing that uh based on the official data if the poverty incidents based on the first semester date of 2018 is 21.1 percent um the data for the first semester of 2021 shows that it's just gone up 23.7 percent um the line at the bottom actually um shows the actual um data using full year so 23.5 in 2015 and 16.7 in 2018 and what we did was actually to append or um show our um sign relation results and what we're showing here is that by 2019 this is the poverty incidence among population it would have gone down to 14.8 percent but would have gone up to 21.5 percent by 2020 and then down to 19 by 2021 and this is without because without considering the positive impacts of social amelioration program on poverty reduction and I'll go back to sap later on unfortunately the data that we have right now actually do not distinguish between chronic and transient poverty and their previous Studies have shown that those are considered for at any one point in time um actually consists of two groups those who are chronically poor meaning consistently poor all throughout and those who just moved into poverty because of some Shock and uh as we can see and as we would expect because of the shock many families with them or many individuals or families would have fallen into poverty because of this shock and unfortunately we don't have that kind of information and that's something I think that we need to um address in the near future coming up with more information in terms of chronic and transient poverty so that we can actually um understand better the Dynamics of poverty and more importantly be able to formulate appropriate interventions because what we we have seen our previous study is that about half of those who are considered poor are chronically poor or consistently poor also out while the other half are just transient poor or those who are who just moved into poverty because of some Shock next piece so what have been the government responses next so um the the government has legislated um two um important um legislation pieces of legislation by anyone and by any hand too uh by any hanwan to heal or buy any hand to heal as one act um was enacted in March 2020 granting the president's special powers to combat the code with 19 pandemic and as of June 2021 the total budget allocated for that was 394.4 billion pesos and about um you know 96.8 percent has been dispersed as of uh June 2021 and we can see that most of it has actually been allocated to the swd and that's actually uh mostly uh sap and among other um subsidies to um to the individuals and Families in addition bayanihan two um or by any hand to recover as one act was also enacted and that was in September 2020 providing for pandemic response and Recovery interventions and the budget allocation for that was 240 214.1 billion and uh about 89 of that has been disbursed as of June 2021 and you can see that um for this particular um uh fund um a large part of it went to SSS next so what were the emergency measures implemented during the ecq um and these were anchored and emergency measures provided under the bayanihan one so we have um different cash assistance programs including the social amelioration program rice Farmers financial assistance program we have the covid-19 adjustment measures program for OFW and workers in the foremost sector implemented by the department of labor and employment we also have in-kind assistance um you know from owa Transportation food accommodation for our overseas workers um agricultural products to LG use by the Department of Agriculture we have the free bus ride program for health workers from the Department of Transportation laboring Sakai program and point-to-point bus augmentation scheme uh system from the mmda and food and non-food items provided by bswd in addition we have the wage subsidy for small businesses um implemented by the from the of this is under the small business which subsidy program for workers in the formal sector since programs provided by the Department of Agriculture and the department of trade and Industry the latter primarily for medium micro small and medium Enterprises we also have the emergency employment program so I think this Advantage displaced workers um project which aims to employ displaced workers and finally we also have um the program of SSS which provides Calamity loans um of up to 20 000 pesos next um so um we can see that um actually a lot of programs has been um have been implemented by the government and to assess low-income families displaced workers farmers and ofws among others who were affected by the pandemic and this chart just shows um how much is allocated um Target beneficiaries number of Target beneficiaries as well as the benefits given and let me just focus on the social amelioration program um emergency subsidies program um for this particular one there were two trenches of assistance given to um low-income families um and the first tranche uh covered about 18 million um families so you can imagine it's more than half of the total number of families and then the second trans covered slightly lower number of families on 14 million and the benefit given was about five thousand to um eight thousand [Music] um I don't have time to discuss all of them so I let me just go to to the next um slide um because this is something that uh we would like to to focus on because of the size of the program so this was uh the target beneficiaries of sap um were primarily for families registered in the pandavian Familia Filipino program or the four piece it was also intended to cover informal economy workers such as the self-employed small small scale producers and Distributors and also those belonging to vulnerable sectors such as senior citizens persons with disability pregnant and lactating women solo parents or versus Filipinos in distress and Indigent indigenous peoples I think you will already have a sense that um while this is I think very good you can already Imagine The Challenge in terms of identifying and locating all of this target beneficiaries um so that's one of the the major um challenges in implementing such a a big program covering um so many Target beneficiaries and as I mentioned the financial assistance amounted to 5000 to 8 000 depending on the regional minimum wage rate where the building fishery is is located next so um what we did was to simulate what would be the impact of this cash transfers from the social amelioration program and as we can see um here if you look at the first few um uh grows if the poverty incidence is projected to be poverty incidents among families is projected to be 16 without the social amelioration program with the cash transfer from this program it is projected to go down to 12.2 percent so very significant decline in poverty incidents because of the sheer size of the the amount the cashels were given as well as the large number of beneficiaries covered by by this program and similarly the poverty incidents among population would have gone down from 21.5 to 17.3 because of that cash transfer next piece so there were other government responses or Mobility restrictions um due to localized lockdown Community quarantines there was also efforts to improve awareness so there were a lot of information dissemination campaigns um there were General guidelines issued so creation of a national action plan primarily on test Trace entry and there was also Health System supports augmentation of human resources for health and expansion of facilities for treatment and isolation and protections including so um let me just share some issues and concerns in the pandemic response um next so for instance in communication issues we find that the communication interventions for covid-19 response in the Philippines can be characterized Associated incoherent big and confusing and the details are actually in one of the papers in this volume um as authored by Dr Sheila CR there's also lack of expanded and targeting testing and aggressive contact tracing so the country lagged in contact tracing and ramped up testing which are among the more effective response Strategies employed in most in most countries also the country was the government was late in implementing much needed preventive measures of the onset of the Health crisis the implementation of community quarantines became the go-to response Whenever there is an impending search of cases unfortunately lockdowns were complemented with weak contact tracing and testing efforts next um there were also um issues related to data so having clear accurate timely and granular data is important to identify appropriate response strategies and policies promptly unfortunately serious data issues were evident in the Philippines data issues were also observed in targeting beneficiaries for the provision of assistance to affected individuals and families which in turn led to delays in the distribution of AIDS so as I mentioned earlier you know um trying to identify and locate 18 million eligible families which was quite a challenge um inadequate consultation Republicans professionals and experts led to poorly plan policies that are in contrast with the advice of medical experts and also there's a lack of strongly coordinated implementation framework so vertical and horizontal plans and operations were not fully aligned so what were some of the lessons learned by by sector and the reason we're we're trying to put them all together is because we're hoping that from this uh we could probably manage future shocks uh better so um in the area of health and Community quarantines we find that imposing Community quarantives or lockdowns is helpful but not sufficient in suppressing the outbreak I will let Dr ulip discuss more um the other lessons and and findings in in the health sector when he does his presentation later today next in the area of Education I think our experience in terms of different learning modalities um is going to be um very useful um moving forward from from this pandemic and again Dr orbetta um is in a better position we can discuss the Lessons Learned in this particular sector next um and of course macroeconomic response is key not just during the pandemic but in terms of moving forward on our road to to recovery and um and what we've seen is that monetary easing public spending and certain demand substitution helped spur growth in some sub-sectors and Dr Maggie Gonzalez will be presenting us um the details um this afternoon as well now um let me just talk a little bit more about some of the other sectors because we don't have the opportunity to hear from the other uh chapters uh in terms of data ICT and digitalization we find that more granular data are necessary to formulate and Implement data-driven responses um the national government directly needs to strengthen digitalization strategies to improve the use and access to ICT and the government must accelerate investments in ICT infrastructure to prevent the worsening of inequalities in the education sector and the government plays a significant role in enhancing digitalization in the economy by supporting Financial Innovations to reach land bank and promoting digital payments in public transactions so this would help a lot in the distribution particularly of cash transfers the full implementation of the national ID system is a foundational digital ID system and it's linking to the existing social protection Information Systems is essential in ensuring the efficient and effective execution of Crisis related social assistance programs but let me point out that um you know having the national ID is not adequate to be able to identify and to identify eligible beneficiaries so you have to link it with existing Information Systems to better identify eligible beneficiaries next and in terms of social protection um uh social safety nets that are effective properly targeted and well distributed are necessary to help Filipino families cope with the damaging effects of the pandemic equally important or strong leadership and data-driven decision making and executing the pandemic response we also find that modifying existing Assistance programs instead of creating new ones with new mechanisms for implementation maybe a more efficient approach in crisis response and this would allow us to respond faster in light with the opposition of community quarantees the national government has also ensure that people have access to food and other necessities through massive safety nets programs and Advocate Universal Health Coverage can greatly help in future public emergencies especially health related ones and while emergency cash transfers and formal and food relief packages are needed to smooth consumption programs that will assist households to have jobs and we start their business are necessary especially if we want those who temporarily fell into poverty to be able to recover more quickly and move out of poverty emergency subsidies such as monetary assistance for the non-food items are essential to augment the needs of Filipino families during a pandemic and again this is something that's very important we always want to um be ready with a list of eligible beneficiaries for different programs so establishing interoperable databases across government agencies is vital in crafting effective And Timely policies during public emergencies and the national IED can actually provide that variable to be able to merge the different administrative databases and next and we also have the important role of local government units because the whole of government approach is necessary for implementing the pandemic response and um with that the communication as I mentioned something that's very important there's a need to harmonize messages used at the national local levels to ensure accuracy and consistency and a very important policies and protocols should be widely disseminated ahead of implementation dates so that everybody can adjust to new policies and and protocols and citizen engagement should be widely uh promoted and role of public policy information officers should be strengthened and um with that I would like to thank you and I'll turn it over to um Dr CR thank you

today we are joined by important guests it's the sixth month since the pandemic started and since lockdown restrictions were first imposed in the country so joining us today are representatives from the healthcare professionals alliance against kobit 19 or hpac and they represent the country's doctors nurses midwives and other allied health professionals they're the largest school addition of health workers in the country and if we recall they did a service to us a few months a few weeks ago when they warned us about the status of the country's pandemic response and what we need to do to fix that and strengthen it going forward so joining us today is dr maladin beruwar who is the secretary of the philippine society of nephrology thank you for joining us today doctor and also with dr berewar is dr pauline convocar who is the president of the philippine college of emergency medicine and dr lay camilin alfonso who is a technical specialist for the philippine society of public health physicians thank you for joining us today so um just to start off with the discussion it's been six months since the pandemic was declared in the philippines implemented lockdown restrictions we topped over 250 000 cases already and have counted um more than 4 000 deaths and i wanted to ask you doctors um what do you make of where we are in our fight against the pandemic versus um where you maybe hoped we would be we would have been six months ago at this point sugar dr lee um so where are we hi thank you for the question sophia so the question is where are we now in the fight against this pandemic after six months and uh there are so many layers to that question and perhaps one of the things that we can provide right now is in terms of the health response um we can give you inputs on that but uh not only that hvac has also been working on multiple streams in actually having uh by facilitating a whole of society approach in terms of moving forward with the response so um first perhaps in terms of our health response we have seen that at the start as all countries um have experienced nobody has been in this situation uh and uh no country was ever prepared for this and those were in a way expected but i believe that uh there have been progress especially since after time out in terms of um facilitating uh different dialogues with different stakeholders different uh actors that are involved in the health response to be able to come up with a more um united strategy so that we can all fight uh in in a synchronous manner so um i think um in terms of the response itself it's not not yet perfect but uh we think that much progress has been made the government has been working hard the civil societies have been working hard and um i know that uh each each family uh are coping but then um yeah uh the response in in terms of uh progress has has been um there has been progress made but uh we can still work um so dr lino you talked about areas where we can still improve um now that we there's a lot that we know about the virus now that we didn't know six months ago and at the same time you know we've also been able to adjust the response and improve it in in other areas but before we get into all of that uh you mentioned right that there are things that we can improve on um what are some of these things and that that um we should be paying attention to and trying to improve right um that's actually what we have been pointing out uh even since the start of the time out um what are the things we need to improve and we will we can elaborate on this um later is is the coordination mechanism from when a patient comes in um to do the covet response itself whether it's an inquiry about a symptom inquiry on when or where to have a swap test what to do if you suspect yourself or a family member to have one to have a kobit so we can still improve on that coordination mechanism that does not necessarily mean you'll be hospitalized right um and the second thing is uh we need to improve a lot more in terms of coordinating the different health facilities so that uh we we don't get overwhelmed in some while some remain that there are vacancies or so also we we need to coordinate well so that the the cases of kovid will not be lost and they will not hamper also the access to care to non-covet cases we can discuss this further with uh doctor yes um one thing that that was a big circumstance for you to issue for the group to have called for that timeout a few weeks ago was the reality that a lot of our hospitals were being flooded with the surge in cases and patients coming to um coming for treatment seeking treatment you all see what's happening on the ground right now um can you tell us what it's like okay so adding on to what lei has said um i think coming from a perspective of an emergency physician so where the discipline of we are a branch of medicine that receives really patience for acute and emergency care so so through this period of um from the time of the time out that we called for a timeout and then um having prepared for the potential influx again of patients coming from that short period of quote unquote uh rest uh um and we have to admit that there was indeed this decreasing trend of patience the number um at least however we have also observed that despite the decreasing number we have also still um we are still seeing patients that are still critical and emergent and who have not had access of care um from the community to another facility and uh so they do hospital hopping and that is not uh this leads to poor outcomes for the patient so um currently bed capacity is still at warning levels and um we have to understand that beds are not just numbers we also have to account for the capacity to manage those patients so um if i may if i may um discuss that emergency level or warning level and emergency level is different from that of the disaster level so when you say disaster level or we are already in a state of disaster that's when we we say that we are beyond our capacity to respond so currently we are in the response phase and even in this response phase we're still preparing for a potential disaster if these capacities are overwhelmed so um uh the numbers may be decreasing but the severity and the same severity of the cases that we see are still there and this is really uh these are really resource intensive so we consume um resources we consume we utilize health human resource and we all know that another issue here is that of the healthcare workers getting sick um health healthcare workers being exposed and that they need to be quarantined so it's not just a simple mathematical equation that one is the one there's a patient and there's a bed it you have to also understand so many other factors that that interplay um for the capacity or for the for the effectiveness of the health care system to respond to that case right now dr doctor um is that also the case that you see in in in different hospitals in your experience doctor um and dr uh um are are you also still seeing that uh steady influx of patients or um have you gotten some have you experienced and witnessed some at least some relief and and that that room to really still increase capacity of course taking out um the health workers and the limited number okay um well in our experience because i'm connected with a government hospital um there's still a lot of influence um in our emergency room and we still cannot accommodate everyone who is coming but in terms of the load um it's true um that after um the mecq um there's the lightening of um the number of weapons that are coming in the emergency room um but still the capacity is not um 100 so um we still need more rooms more beds and health workers to take care of these patients um i think also what we need to look at are diseases that are not related to the kobe 19 pandemic because most of the resources are now being focused on patients who have moving 19 but what about those patients for example who have also chronic diseases that they need to be taken care of so um for example patients with hypertension or patients with cancer or patients with chronic kidney disease um you cannot just ask people to play at home and because these patients also need to see their doctors so we also need to increase our capacity for um seeing this patient for example in terms of telemedicine so that is something that we need to enhance but what about those patients who were not able to consult um because they don't have internet access but about those poor people who don't um own the cell phone so how do they get seen by doctors um shampre they don't know where what to do or where to go they're going to flock to the hospitals so i think we need to try to throw um primary care right um and another note then i i want to ask you where do you understand the art right now uh sorry you wanted to add something dr day yes sofia if it's okay because he mentioned primary care already and i wanted that when we say where are we now in the response one of the things that we need to realize is that the hospital is the last line of defense so the fact that we are seeing still a lot of patients critically ill patients in the hospitals it's just the tip of the iceberg because 90 percent 90 of the cases recovered um data shows it's it's expected to be mild many of them will be well mild telegana some would just feel uh malay or anosmia and they're really walking patients and and um this one it means that if we're seeing a lot of patients in the hospitals we have not been doing well yet in the preventive aspect so the prevention part breaking the chain of transmission is something that that we need to address still in terms of moving forward um because um yes we the hospital is the last line of defense the first line really is first the people how people behave right and then secondly how we stop the transmission when a person say is at the workplace when the person now goes in a transportation um uh in a vehicle or when a person now um meets other the social circles that they have no so so these are the things that we still need to work on from the ship from the curative side and now shifting it to the preventive side and primary healthcare at the community level so there right um on that note as well um taking all these things that you see in the hospitals where as you mentioned is the last sign of defense and so that's one way we know whether or not our responses on the preventive side might be working um also taking from your understanding of where we are right now on the pandemic i'd like to ask you because there's been news of course recently about whether or not we flatten the curve or we're controlling it and whether or not um you know cases are still are really going already decreasing and on the downward trend um where do you understand we are right now in the pandemic how we speak are we turning a corner where are we on in terms of that curve personally if i may say i don't want to pretend that i am an epidemiologist and i don't want to pretend that i'm an expert in this what i can just say are observations based from my own personal experience as a clinician so i may not be the best person to analyze this data and and give you information and that if we really do have a decreasing trend if we're really doing the flattening of the curve i leave the experts to that because i don't wanna i don't wanna pretend uh understanding all of these analytics although as a doctor of course we um we do have to be abreast about latest updates about uh how really are we faring um with regards to our battle against this pandemic however as a clinician i do understand that different people have different uh perspectives as well as to how we really are faring so we have to also understand the context that some of these these are just numbers but we also have to understand that there is really a social aspect to this there's an emotional aspect to this a psychological aspect to this and these are not measurable so um if it's just a question on how are we faring against this fight um people may just give you answers as to numbers but there is really a big impact out there um uh with regards how covet affects us that currently are not put on paper or not even probably studied well and made made um made public so um i'm coming from a perspective of those healthcare workers are also getting sick what are the impacts psychologically physiologically and all those patients also who have been returning to work what's the impact to them what's the impact of the family so i think um we have to look for the further than just the numbers to say um uh that that uh that's just the measure or just the indicator for how we are faring yeah thank you thank you for erasing that important point because um i think one thing that and i agree one thing that's often overlooked is you know beyond the numbers how people are hoping with the pandemic because it's been six months it's a it might not sound like a long period of time but of course under the certain circumstances we have right now it's taking at all of course on everyone yes sofia before we leave the topic of flattening the hurt one of the things we're saying is that we can never have zero cases before we see municipalities because we work with different municipalities and we see them still post on their social media zero covid case or sometimes it also leads to shaming of people who who have been known to be positive because the goal left here is not to have zero cases maybe this year we're not going to graduate um and it will not magically disappear and even if there will be a vaccine suit which of course that's another story we will still have to cope with the presence of it and um the thing is uh when we talk of flattening the verb we want to shift the mindset that it's more than just flattening the fur but learning how to deal with it as many countries still are doing and even if initially they have been successful in bringing down the question now is how do you dance with it so it's not flattening the curve but hammering it and then dancing with it and and having safety nets in terms of um when do we actually uh declare a localized lockdown how do we balance this with um not just economic activity but the usual activities we have as normal families right because you know there are so many uh people who are affected by this and how do we actually prepare for it i think that's the most important thing it's not just zero cases flattening the firm but how do we make our environments our circles of influence ready how is your condominium is your condominium community ready if ever there will be a case because it's just a matter of time how is your workplace is your workplace covered ready how is your own family unit right do you have uh preparations in place so you know who to call to so it's really about being covered ready right right um and on that note no when we talk about preparedness and being ready because the pandemic isn't any ending anytime soon um i'd also like to ask you all about new developments that have taken place recently you know we see us looking at for example antigen tests which might help our testing capacity and then we also have measures like um reducing public the physical distance between commuters and public transport what do you make of these decisions taking place because i think one thing that's still present right now is at least that sort of mindset where um people are thinking you know economy or health but um what do you make of this and how do we overcome that kind of thinking well for our rapid antigen testing it really has a lot of promise because it is point of care testing and in 15 minutes you can get the result but if you look at the website of the philippine society of microbiology and infectious diseases or the fismit and also in cdc or centers for disease control in america um they're still not recommending it as a diagnostic tool um we need to do more studies on it um because the studies that were available um is that it has low sensitivity lower than itpcr so which means that um there are more um false negatives so of course we don't want that that um a lot of people are deemed to be not having kov19 when actually they do have it and that's what we call as a symptomatic transmission of the disease no because they were falsely diagnosed to not have it so um currently it's being studied and i think it's being considered um for that purpose but uh we still need to wait for the results of this studies before we can say that it can be adopted as a diagnostic tool for um kovid19 but it has its new test and we need to defer to our experts in the field of infectious disease to tell us where to use it and then how to use it again um because there are also other tests available so may gamma so we need to defer to our inspections disease specialists for that now regarding um the distance in public mobility vehicles or in the transportation um hpac um is still um firm on our recommendation that we believe that social distancing is very important even at this point in a pandemic so we would like to maintain social distancing of at least one meter if you look at the recommendation of the oh they are sorry um wh o they recommend uh one to two meters no um but i think uh we have already adapted the one meter um now if you um look at the doh recommendation it's also the same um one meter so um at this point in time cases you were also asking where we are at this point we are still in the pandemic there's a lot of cases um other people will say well because we have increased testing but that's not the point if there's no disease there's no positive result if you look at the testing in cebu or the results in cebu i think the cases there are going down and hopefully indiana will know it down surge no um so maybe the response is better i don't know but um we are we have been affected by the pandemic longer than cebu india asparagus is nothing i'm almost three thousand per day so meron parent we're still in the middle of it uh and yet um [Music] decreasing distancing so papa no i know the economy will have to um recover um but it's really difficult then to to say um without um balancing both because uh we want to take care of our health but livelihood is also very important and economy know but um as much as possible emperor we don't want to sacrifice lives just so um we can get uh what they want uh in terms of business growth and hopefully with the good balance of that so um i think my other colleagues can also say something about the one meter distancing right dr dr pauline would you like to add do that um for practical reasons of course i will always submit the science but for practical reasons we should look into other alternatives than just having the one meter distance as an intervention increase the the number of trips increase the number of public utility vehicles so there may be other interventions um that would not necessarily make us decrease the the distance just so we we may be able to accommodate these commuters so i'm coming from that perspective of um looking into the other interventions but uh we do uphold still in our college also in support of each pack that we do uphold that we have to maintain the one meter distance to um uh to give a message also out there that that we are still in this in this we're sitting in the middle of the pandemic and and uh it's too early to to decrease the the distancing as of this point not really would you like to add anything yes yes um uh yeah so in terms of the the dichotomy there's no dichotomy in terms of likelihood and health how can you have a good life but if you're not healthy the bad i mean if the father of the house gets sick then we cannot undo that and um in fact these are the things that we also consider when when we have dialogues with different sectors so for example hpa has been in dialogue also with the movies one coalition we were talking with the jeepney um gp groups you know economists also and and these recommendations have been made with with the proper uh data analysis not just to model like how how its impact will be in terms of the economic impact but also on the health consequences we believe that um in order to really uh to have good public policy uh these different stakeholders this different perspective should be kept in balance it's really not very easy to make these decisions so um one of the things for example that may not be uh may not be reflected by by paper or by by any forecast would be the unintended effects of certain policies so for example if we say all right we make it say 0.75 meters now and then next week half a meter then let's see how many people will die or how many people will get it let's monitor right so if people can decide on that then now others are asking oh if we can actually decrease or relax the physical distancing in transportation then maybe we can also do that in in restaurants maybe we can also do that in public gatherings or we can also do that etc etc so it can have unintended effects that may not be covered by those modeling studies and in this for example right now in in in many areas some of our kabbabayans think virus so by relaxing um we still don't know at this point it's still a very delicate situation wherein as dr dr pauline mentioned we're we're yet seeing a lot of patients and we are not yet out of that danger level to be able to dance with this kind of search of patients if there is unintended effects happen stepping back from that a little bit no um i think one thing i said that's really taking place of course um the latest show the latest example of it would be the proposal to well not really proposal but kind of policy in in some ways already to reduce the distance between computers and transport but behind that no stepping back from that it's really this discussion that's still taking place until now now that we're um six months into the pandemic about you know like like other countries we're trying to open up our economy and revive it because the livelihoods are also important of course but um there's still that debate about whether or not to prioritize economy or health um i'd like to ask you you know you also understand how many things affect a patient no it's not just a certain it's not just sickness or like germs or virus um how do we overcome that about that dichotomy about um health and economy because i think that's an important thing to touch on if we're going to really um find a sustainable way to keep moving forward can i take the first step i'm sure they can add also but this is also why sofia when we make recommendations we don't make them in silos in fact for example when we when we recommend these things like okay let's maintain the minimum standard because anything less than that is technically close contact right so so um if we say that we recommend this minimum standard then we have also proposals like let's now make the bike planes more safe let's encourage people now to do to bike let's now encourage people to walk if they can we also have recommendations like holding holding activities or opening up markets with a pedestrianized street say you you pedestrianize a street and people can come in and they can dine but they will be in open air so with with proper physical distancing in these six seconds restaurant that protects them and it reduces transmission by by 98 but at the same time it benefits the businesses so these recommendations are not made in silo and for us to be able to to uh move forward with the economy also then we really need the private sector the business sector to work with us because that is also our intention otherwise the doctors the medical professionals will just keep on firefighting and we don't want this because we're all in this together um for us in hvac we're not paid to do this at this point nobody is telling us we're paying us so this is what you should push or nobody is um having um you know our only intention if you can only hear our members it's just we're staying here because the filipinos still need us we don't want our patients to die we don't want communities to suffer and we want to care for our colleagues and we don't want to come to the point where we need to choose and each day that that we see that they their facebook posts they they leave their families and they pray before leaving their families all of this moves i said so please the business sector we want to work with you and um we hope that we can continue the discussion moving forward because uh yeah there's really no duality in this that's all right right no and um at the same time i think you you said it perfectly now dr lee your group has a lot of um solutions that you're offering to not just the public but you know people who make decisions like our business owners and at the same time the government um have you been able to talk to them about this help with consult help consult them and how to move forward are they still open to that as they were when you made the call for a timeout and to really reassess our response in august um i'll answer first um i think there have been um well there have been a lot of meetings already between hpac and other government agencies and also the business sector and um segura i might say that we are working together with them now it's hard to say that they are consulting us because we're not really the only experts here although we are a formidable group of more than 160 healthcare workers organizations but you know we have to work together with each other and i want to add also to what lee said i think another important aspect of the response to the pandemic um that we have not been um discussing would be communication so um because regardless of whatever policy we discuss whatever things we find out if we don't um package it properly and tell it to the people who matter then um our strategies will be useless and who am i talking about i think i'm talking about the people who are there in the streets the ones who are really affected by the disease because some of us who have access to internet who can watch tv who can um read the text messages or read facebook are the ones who are just safely confined in our homes but what about those people who have to go out every day because they need to work um they need to earn because they need to buy food no on a daily basis um that's why um it's really very important that there's a good balance between health and livelihood and to re we have to reach out to them so we have to teach them capacitate them that's why um i think our response should be lgu led so which means the pat no in the local government unit like in your barangay or in your city um there's already a system to take care of um these concerns from these people so that um nandu nayong first um line of response casing adapt last line in hospital but what's happening if people do not know where to go what to do then parana gigging first line of response they go to the hospital in dinaman hospital because um hopefully that the hospital will only take care of moderate to severe cases but those who are mild cases or those who don't have kovid 19 um on a local level right now um that's a that's a good point that you use no doubt because and i'd like to also ask dr lee dr palin about this when we talk about um how to move forward not we always mentioned a lot of it has to be led by local governments because that's really how we can prevent the spread um you know they're they're if you want if the hospitals are the last sign of defense they're also in the first line and so um i understand also that the both of you have a lot of experience when it comes to local response because you're both doctors to the barriers right if i'm not uh mistaken and so um when we look at our local governments and our barangays and communities what do you see there that we can improve on um and perhaps maybe some advice that you can lend to community leaders le pay i start late okay um thank you very much for the question sophia because it really um resonates with me the question on our focus before we even entered or we even had this pandemic so glaringly um the kovid 19 highlighted some of the vulnerabilities of our health care system uh that can never be over emphasized i've been repeating that message every so often that indeed we have to focus on the primary care aspect the interfacility transfers the coordination and the referral network or what we call in in a structure the healthcare provider delivery network however um there are really still disparities and inequalities that we can see across local government units because um by nature as as a country as an archipelago there really are differences as to access we have to also account for the differences um as to the economic capacity of the lg us however wherever you are in the country we have to understand that care should be standard care should still be quality despite these differences it should still be universal there should always be access to health it is a right so similarly access to emergence care should also be universal so for now um it does not happen because of these disparities because of this inequalities um we are pushing for um a unified referral network wherein we have to take into account patient navigation so this should be patient-centered looking at the looking at the situation at the lens of the patient coming from the homes the families to the communities and then the we have to give them a roadmap as to their common questions and where to go where to be tested where to seek help for treatment if needed but what happens is that for for now what happens is that um sometimes there are certain situations when the first point of contact may not be the appropriate facility and and that facility needs to be transferred to another facility which may be more appropriate or which may be more capable of handling the the case and sometimes they're left to tend for themselves they don't have access to emergency medical services it's not just about the vehicle itself but also the the healthcare workers should be competent in conducting these patients from point to point so that's where the hospital hopping happens that's where we see stories or we see cases where they share that you are the eighth hospital and it just so happened it's like a lottery that actually i passed by your hospital the first time and you said you were full but then again there was this vacancy for some uh for some reason even um the the possibility of a death in the hospital that's why there was a vacant bed and so that patient was taken in so it's it's crazy difficult to to handle cases like this it's for our local governments um maybe it's easy to get overwhelmed by all the demands that this coffee response is uh has brought brought all of us um but it's good to step back have a good analysis of the situation and look where where the bottlenecks are where the priority needs are uh when we say priority needs what what really needs to be addressed what is the bottleneck there and often there are many options in terms of interventions but not all interventions are the same and we know that in a local government you don't have um funds now unlimited uh it's the same thing as when you have a household you have to budget for how much to be spent for food so which interventions will be more soullet you know this is really good and how do you know how to know that what interventions chosen arsula is to really ask are these technologies effective uh because if they're not effective then it's a waste of time that's not so this is where the uh where where the guidance of the department of health comes in and um we also have the health technology assessment unit in in the department of health and this is this is now uh helping really say in terms of standards and usually the interventions the technologies and then once you've identified the priority interventions i think one of the things that's very important in this response is whole of society approach not just whole of government approach but but you know what we found out in covet many people want to help in fact for us everyone who's jumped in to help us donating their time their expertise they have been all volunteers and people rise up for such a time as this and it's our uh it's just such an honor to harness those kinds of uh collaboration between between uh the the government the public sector civil society and also to the private sector this is where the consultation happens if it has to happen not just stop down but also horizontally and this is where everyone can can talk okay you need this from the private sector we can we have this uh okay uh we need this from the volunteers we have this and it's about just connecting the gods and seeing all the resources and synergies and if there are questions for example i heard there are some um leaders who are not sure because you know the the health technology is very technical it can get very technical and um the question is who to ask who to reach out to and this is where many of them are confused and i believe this is also the contribution of hpac wherein um all of us here bring in different lenses different expertise nobody claims expertise monopoly encoded for example i am a public health person but i am working with dr berwar he's a nephrologist we are working with epidemiologists we are working with data modelers so there is that whole gamut of collaboration that is happening within hpa and in terms of bringing those guidance we are going to be um coming up with the updated unified clinical practice guidelines so that makikita put on an insulin and people don't need to read the thousands and thousands of papers technical papers scientific papers that that actually assess that it's very technical so um it's important for that when we assess what intervention should be decided on consulted with and and who to ask that we have these vetted information we don't we don't just leave it up to uh opinions or we don't just leave it up to uh this is what this particular leader thinks should happen this should be negative so that's um right right um and on that note as well you mentioned that you know the hpac is really in this unique position where um you get to hear a lot of what's happening in different areas no whether it be in hospitals in communities and businesses a lot of people reach out and try to consult you and you you connect those thoughts i want to ask you um moving forward um because we know of course the situation has changed a lot from where we were six months ago are there certain areas of those of our response that you think should be prioritized going forward and i just would like to frame my answer um in the perspective of emergency and how it relates to that of disaster and how we are because this really is um a pandemic is a case wherein we have to really define the the connection if we are in the emergency parts it's because we are still responding to it or we are already overwhelmed so therefore we are already entering the disaster pace um because the interventions are different but uh moving forward we have to have future proof intervention so we have to be proactive before it becomes a disaster and even during the disaster we have to also understand that we have to prepare for the next disaster um which may compound the problem of kovid so putting that frame in mind that this event of a kovid is uh this is just an event which may test the capacity of our healthcare system so we are in an emergency response borderlining probably a disaster because we have to also see behind us what our resources are and uh if we are still capable to respond so we have to understand that we have there are different um the different levels of of um measuring what a capability is of of of a healthcare system so that's why we have indicators say for example um dedicated beds for kobed isolation beds for kovid intensive care unit beds dedicated for kovid even the number of mechanical ventilators but there are many other indicators out there and even until now we're still discussing what other indicators um may need to be measured to really say that these are trigger points or red flags that we can say that we are um beyond capacity so moving forward we have to make sure that we are future proof as to these indicators and look also into the other um parts of the system although this is very technical but i apologize but i um i think this is very important that we have to uh be one in in looking at these indicators so currently that's one aspect that we need to to look into the second one is really utilization of data and um uh making uh use of that data uh as as information as a validated information for decision making so i think it was emphasized that uh the htac should be institutionalized being the the structure that um has the capacity to to screen this this evidences um and and it is a government structure and it is a regulatory structure uh that may advise us as to as to our response um capacity or competence in the sense of our health human resource as to are they trained enough like we are really advocating for integration now of although there's already integration of disaster management in disaster risk production management in the basic and secondary curricula but there's none specific for for these things in our undergraduate and postgraduate uh courses so these are specific specialties um that uh us just just come into play um after being specialized so there there's really not much um in um institutionalization of this curricula into our educational system so if i may ask you even sofia have you had training for emergencies when you had your your um secondary education or even your bachelorette degree perhaps or even in your master so we have to integrate all of these things early on in our educational system moving forward and and this should be also normative um we have to make sure that our families are prepared we have to make sure that our families are also resilient um god forbid there might be another pandemic of this magnitude well for me you know we've been already experiencing the pandemic for um six months right now so i think we should learn from our mistakes and that's what um dr pauline has said um we have to use evidence-based medicine at this time so it's not because something is available in the market then we need to use it we have to validate if it is something that we can use and if it will benefit the majority so um there are a lot of tests for example that are available in the market you know being promoted in facebook that people buy and you see people um you know posting that they've had this test done but actually um not because they've been approved by the fda then it should be also um it has to be adopted by the society i mean that's where the health technology assessment council or the htac comes in so um they will be the ones to decide so we need this group of experts um and then another thing um that is lacking for example in this response are basic services that i hope can be um given importance um later no as the as time goes on like for example um going inside the malls when you go there your temperature is checked but every store that you go to you have to log in your name your address phone number and then your temperature um i think it's possible for us to have like for example maybe a qr code so that each of us when we log in um and then it goes into the system and then they can determine where you are at what date at what time and then if a person becomes positive and they can track who these close contacts are and it's also very like for the businesses we want the businesses to to return pero how will you go inside the stores when you should go to the mall each store that you go to you have to log in and sign in but you're inside the mall already so what's the point so i hope there are just some areas where you can maybe scan something and then you know the system will know that you are there and um they are able to determine who are you or who were you in contact with at that time so um those are maybe people think very simple things but um it really needs cooperation from everyone and of course um budget from the government so that we are able to um to enforce them great dr d yes in fact thanks dr don for pointing out those um signatures you need to come into us those are deterrents and uh when we had this consultation you're surprised because uh dti does not require that it's really just the local government's trying to implement that but our question also we need to ask deeper what will you do with those forms in one of the malls so how can we do raising in that so we need to be more critical more analytical also in terms of the interventions so aside from that aside from just complying with this we need to take into account that these actually impact the economy right these are deterrents they they turn off customers from coming out so moving that uh moving that way really hpack's priority as we see um all of us we agree that opening of the economy is a big priority and in fact we have done a lot of work in terms of trying to align um align interventions regarding the same for the workplace for ict integra integration these stocks we cannot give the all the details but um what we're seeing is uh there are big movements uh but of course uh we are talking about a lot of problems that have been there even pre-covered and uh and we are quite hopeful that if we continue with this momentum we can have we can have a happy well christmas is just around the corner right and then a priority really when we try to open up the economy safely using evidence um driven um in evidence informed decision making and of course especially with empowering behavior coming from our people protecting themselves too not just a public policy uh then we can we can actually yes open up the economy safely and have uh have a better hope in the coming months great um on that note as well no there's a lot of uncertainty of course about where we might be going forward if things are going to be under control if cases will still be increasing a year from now um i'm just curious where do you think we might be or will we still be experiencing what we're experiencing today well i'm very optimistic i don't think so i think we will recover from this we will all rise from this no it might take time but um i think next year um will be okay but maybe not as before so maybe we need good risks and of course um social distancing current um but maybe the message that um i want to tell people is to keep washing your hands keep wearing masks and then social distancing if you have symptoms um consult the doctor or isolate yourself so napa telegram information dissemination so people will know what to do and um don't worry kaya tinto right now on that note then a last question i'd like to ask you to wrap this discussion up as well and you know there are a lot of because there are a lot of filipinos who also have grown tired still anxious regarding what they can do how to move around maybe some they can picking up from what dr burrower said some advice that you can give to help filipinos navigate the way forward the day tomorrow or like a year to come right yeah i think the beauty also of difficult situations is that it can bring out the best in people and um having worked uh for the past six months uh in in trying to help out align different responses um i think i've been seeing people becoming more kind uh to each other become more tolerant also open-minded and i think in terms of addressing a very complex uh situation like covet those traits are very important in terms of coping as an individual as a family as a society the filipinos are naturally resilient and moving forward this this can keep us afloat but at the same time while while we keep in mind those traits we don't let our guards down um for example i'll give a practical example i'm coming from manila and i have to visit uh i had to do do some um something uh some some errands uh in the province and even if they're my lola or i saw my lola i i refrained myself really from from from being in close contact with her because i i i didn't know at that time so those kinds of things were very hard uh but because the situation um is does not allow it yet then then i do it for her so it's about those kinds of empowering behavior in in um you know why you're doing this and you're not letting your guards down at this point in the pandemic because this is not going to be the same uh it's not going to be the same say next month and the next month even our recommendation for for relaxing the physical distancing it's because of the situation that's why we are recommending not yet it's not yet time so there again um it's about timing it's about empowering behavior at the right time um the right interventions at the right time and in four families how to cope with it is to be prepared let's be realistic uh for me i'm an optimist really i'm really an optimist but at this point it helps also to look at the worst case scenario so that if you know the worst case scenario then you will not you will not panic when it comes and you can prepare before it comes even if it's just about knowing which number to call if somebody needs help uh so you don't necessarily rush to the hospital or um who do i get in touch with if if this happens to me in the workplace things like that very practical things that that each person each family can can prepare for in terms of coping moving forward thank you and on that note i think um regardless of let's see whether cases are low or high no matter the numbers that we're seeing per day um the same advice still holds as i understand you know keep wearing your mask wash your hands make sure that you practice good golf etiquette and everything because those are some things that will really help carry us through at least for the foreseeable future no vaccine as i mentioned the open air activities parks eventually they can be safe places where physical distancing can happen and you add open air wherein the virus cannot be easily transmitted uh those things we hope that the local governments can support these efforts as we call from for them in the in the coming months as we open up so that um people will not be forced to be in confined spaces where in transmission is uh is high if you can look at your work places if you can improve the ventilation if you can hold um activities outside or if you can allow your workers to to um work from home all of these are practical interventions that don't put people at risk so we hope that things can be explored so that we can continue moving together forward not not not really um you know trying to uh uh yeah people are uh people might be uh fitting some people against each other but no we we are we have the same goal and these interventions are are safe are proven and and we can we can optimize those thank you right

The Philippines rolled out its long-stalled coronavirus vaccination programme on March 1, 2021, the day after Manila took delivery of its first batch of free jabs from China. Health care workers, police and military personnel were the first to receive the Sinovac shots, prompting thanks from Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Manila’s Food and Drug Administration approved the vaccine for emergency use on people aged 18-59, but 75-year-old Duterte has ruled out taking it himself because of his age. Authorities also advised against use of the Chinese vaccine for health care workers, citing its low efficacy rate. The Chinese vaccine has not been popular among Filipino hospital staff, with one survey indicating that 94 per cent would prefer jabs from Pfizer or AstraZeneca.

today we're speaking with dr anna ong lim dr eileen estina and dr pauline konbagar to discuss the philippines response to the coronavirus pandemic so far and how medical groups work to strengthen government efforts after a two-week return to slightly stricter rules under modified enhanced community quarantine for our audience dr ong lim is a professor and division chief of the infectious and tropical disease department of pediatrics at the university of the philippines college of medicine dr khanvakar is president of the philippine college of emergency medicine and dr eileen espina is a family medicine specialist and she's also a local health systems development consultant and specialist in northern summer so the three experts are part of the healthcare professionals alliance against covet 19 or hpac a group of more than 100 medical societies who work closely with government to recalibrate the country's pandemic response thank you for joining us today let's jump right into it so let's just backtrack a little bit no the group came together and made the public call to recalibrate our pandemic response what went on behind that uh because that's something that i think the public felt was unprecedented that hadn't really been felt before uh at least also within the context of the pandemic so how did the group come together and really unite and decided making that call i remember you mentioned that hospitals were being flooded but what were other aspects that contributed to that let me answer that sofia originally this was a call for a discussion among different medical professionals at the outset um just to try to figure out what we could do as a response to the increasing numbers of patients that we were each seeing in our institutions was really how do we stem the tide because at that point there were so many patients who were already in the emergency rooms and um a lot of the big hospitals were actually already issuing um notices and i guess um what i felt know as a participant in that at that particular moment was really um we were all thinking the same thing and we were just brought together by force of circumstance to share this particular impression that we needed to do something to stem the tide and because i guess the call resonated with so many other people it didn't take very long for people to jump on board and to buy into the idea now we have to do something as a group of medical professionals is it accurate to say that it was uh something unprecedented unprecedented also in the medical community i think so i would say so because um in most cases we usually work within our own separate teams like i'm a pediatrician i interact mostly with pediatricians and within our communities of course we're able to move but maybe to interact perhaps with the internists or the surgeons or the family medicine physicians but i'm very rare for us to come together to back a particular cause and we all know how big an impact hovid has had on our healthcare system that is so true no sofia that was drafted and then it was circulated among the different medical specialty organizations asking them if they would be willing to support it and it it just happened in a matter of hours and like sabina yes we will support it and at the president cannot just say yes on on his or her own that the board has to be consulted and and even the chapter presidents have to be consulted so tell them snowball in a matter of hours we had already had so many signatories societies the we have said the big eight under the philippine medical association wherein coming eight specialty divisions so under that eight specialty divisions some specialty groups so even the sub-specialty groups they they signed up and when we went live on august 1 the other healthcare professional organizations reached out and they said we want to be part of it so from an original coalition of medical professionals it became inter-professional so the nurses joined the midwives joined the medtech so and right now we are at 172 if i'm not mistaken 172 member organizations right now so we can just imagine um how many members those actually are to grow hundreds of thousands millions yeah exactly and dr elena you mentioned uh where we are at right now so bringing us to two weeks after he made that call how would you assess the situation right now the group mentioned seven points seven issues in the government response that needed uh strengthening and needed improvement after that two week return to a modified enhanced community quarantine would you say those were also successfully addressed um or what might still be lacking at this point i believe it's uh it's a work in progress it's a work in progress and but what is heartening to note is the very positive response of the different government agencies the especially those who were concerned the concerned government agencies now we call them symptoms and then we had a diagnosis to address them uh we're very receptive to the recommendations we have made and we saw that they are trying to accommodate them uh our recommendations into the existing plans so right now probably um gigging moving forward for hvac is to see to it how we can continue to support them in in whatever way we can in terms of our expertise and also to enjoying the public to help us monitor the progress know of the of the response if there's one thing that i would need to emphasize is that government cannot do this alone doctors nurses healthcare professionals cannot do this alone we really need the people we need the entire filipino people to be with us yes right so let's go um into detail on some of the issues that he pointed out that the group pointed out earlier uh two weeks ago because one of them was hospital work deficiency or a lack of health workers let's say and that's also something that was really tangible not you mentioned earlier that really propelled that call also to uh materialize and and formalize um the government's response current the main response to that so far was the one hospital command but um and that of course we know consists of setting up more beds expanding capacity expanding uh facilities dedicated to the coronavirus and also setting up a referral system do you think that this is an adequate response to the problem that you see at hand on the ground i'll try i'll try to answer that um sophia um coming from the perspective of an incident command and also coming from a perspective of a an em specialist um we saw uh from the very beginning that uh we observed some uh we were we were the eyewitnesses to a symptom of congested uh emergency departments congested hospital we saw the long queued queuing time patients whom we cannot admit that's why there's this call of some other hospitals to relatively uh close some of their doors is this really a bad problem or this is a distribution problem okay also we have to see it on the perspective you have to understand that a bed is just a bed it's a physical bed for it to be functional we also have to address the healthcare worker that's supposed to attend to that bed so union is a don it may be a multifactorial answer because it's not a straightforward answer as well because it's not just about addressing the physical number of beds or addressing the increasing the manpower or the human resources that go with that it's also about development of systems to the right provider to the right facility okay if you're not using that facility um in an up in up an appropriate way then there's really um inequity under city distribution problem so going back to the question on the one hospital command it's not just about the structure it's all about systems development and then um also addressing some other issues with healthcare worker distribution so picking up on what you said now dr convakar how do we address what you mentioned about having uh maybe no system or if not no system then no clear system for a normal patient let's say like me if i get sick what number do i call where do i go hpa okay um i think we need to also uh clear things up that uh there are already problems even before covet so actually there's this running joke uh among us that we don't also want to kobe dice everything our existing problems even before kobed and it's not really the absence of a system but there is a system but it's actually not just integrated into um into perspective like say connecting everything our battle cry was protect the last line by strengthening the first line because there seems to be this disconnect and then the community will also fend for themselves so there's there should be a paradigm shift as to seeing healthcare in a continuum hindi wedding you should see uh giving health care services in a continuum hindi patna the patient gets lost in the system when they just drop inside a drop to a facility and then what next because there's no more vacancy in that facility then that the hospital hopping happens so we wanted to have something like once the patient enters into any point of contact any health facility or to any point of contact with a healthcare worker you attend to that patient and make sure that that patient reaches the right facility and the right provider so union para hindi tahita although we know that there is already a service delivery network that's a healthcare provider delivery network that's really a program of the department of health and we have to understand also that we have already a law on the universal health care wherein there is a gatekeeper they will direct the patient to the right facility but currently there's no connect um clearly because of um the centralization of um health services to the local government units we really need to engage the community and our local government units to be part of this federal network so it's not just a stand alone this is a hospital problem and i'm full so it's my problem to solve it's not that so we need to understand that the community really has a big role to contribute if i may add sofiano wearing my hat now it's a gatekeeper the the family of physicians are are said to be the gatekeeper the primary care primary care strengtheners yeah the primary care providers talaga what is primary care it's it's giving care at the level of the telegram where at the community where the people are it's it's bringing health care to the people and it's it's it focuses more on prevention health promotion okay health education so you you question casino is that they can only access care quality care in the hospital setting has been prevailing for the longest time so with with kovid our statistics will show that 90 percent of cases or even more are actually mild 92 percent eight percent hospital care and yet people are flocking to the hospitals for for one reason or another people with covet or covet-like symptoms are going to the hospital and they're crowding the er so even care facility so that's what we're hoping the right facility at the right time for the right case for i mean we're not saying that maybe for you it's an emergency because really if you if you hear about kovid and you start feeling all those symptoms and you you don't really understand what's happening there is the fear and we understand it's the fear that's pushing the people to access care to look for care that that's that's a very victim in my training that it's the anxiety actually that pushes the people to seek consult more than anything else it's not the fever but it's the fear that what if this is kovid what if tomorrow i will die especially and we're still losing we're still losing a lot of doctors we just lost one recently she's really an asset to them and we're really losing a lot of people who who we feel they don't deserve they don't deserve it nobody deserves to die from this not just the with everybody and when you hear stories like that and then you have these symptoms and osmia and then you start coughing and then oh my god my neighbor died on my necks my children are still small and then a lot of things enter your mind and and i had a patient i mean she she's she's well educated but she called me in the middle of the night at 10 o'clock and then she was crying and i said why are you crying you only have an osmia i was like i only have an osmia i'm about to die no you're not about to die so that so one of the things that that hpac wanted to do was to educate educate our patients educate our kabbabayan about the illness what they can do to prevent it what they can do to keep themselves healthy what they should do when they feel something where they can go where to call what to do and that's the system that the pauline was trying to describe in a nutshell it shouldn't just be about going to the hospital but in the community level as well knowing who your birds are knowing who your barangay health station where your banana station is where your primary care provider clinic is and going there and seeking the care that you need right no mom but picking up on that no so in the context of kovid and really trying to instill that change in mindset because that thing that kind of thing doesn't happen overnight so let's say tomorrow i start to feel a cough and everything how does that translate to now um if i'm a patient and i feel all these things of course my natural inclination would still be to go to walk to the hospital so um what does i mean what was the proposed solution to that also to i think this is also something that will address for example the lack of health workers in certain facilities and everything in the overwhelming number of patients um how will we address that right now in the short term because there is a hotline that the people call there is also kovidkira i think it's a chatbot that that you can actually enter your your this it's a doh app that you can actually enter your symptoms and it tells you whether you have covered uh maybe you're having covered or not and where you can go then i i think the one hospital command also you can also call the number and it will also direct you so but but we're we're trying to um streamline a lot of things right now and and there is a call from doh to the medical societies if if we can also volunteer our time to demand the telemedicine um services but but that's still being ironed out as to how how it would be mechanics so i was just about to say that what's uh very encouraging about this whole discussion was when this was being proposed um the government agencies that we were talking to particularly the oh were very receptive and in fact um some of the proposals that came from the hpac team were already in place in the doh or in the other government agencies plans and it was something that really um came together and validated their assessments and encourage them to push through with whatever they already had in mind i guess we can say now this interaction between the professional medical societies and those government agencies um catalyzed maybe they're another result and their plans to really push through with some of the interventions that they already had in place sophia may add on to that please yes will you allow me okay um but then don't don't get this wrong as well because other people don't go to the hospitals anymore because they're too afraid to go there maybe they'll get covered from there so let me just put it in a way that when you're in doubt you should visit of course a health facility but we wanted to also um develop a culture that in an ideal setting uh if you are an emergency you should not go to the hospital on your own and walk from your home to the hospital because someone has to pick you up adequately equipped competent person to pick you up from the house if you're really an emergency if you're not an emergency then you may you may have a number to call it's a single unified number to call just to ask questions if you are an emergency that's what we call teddy triage you know we sort patients as to classification of severity and we'll be we will be able to guide you um to which facility you will visit so therefore you don't need to in an ideal setting you don't need to drive you don't need to walk in the process of you walking or going through that facility right so you know if if young ideal setting the system will look for ways for you to be brought to the right facility with a right provider even accompanying you from your house to that hospital or facilities but definitely not in the next two weeks not even the next month but we're we're hoping to to um reach that point i'm sorry but i have to emphasize when in doubt and you feel like you're an emergency you have a number to call and someone will pick you up in an ideal setting um we also would want um not to um neglect our non really you know the collaterals of this war the those and we're seeing a decreasing pattern of patients that seek consultant suspects that's really time critical so i'm saying here saying that it's still safe to go to the hospital if it is indeed an emergency and you need a doctor right picking up then on what you said no doctor um because these things are time sensitive um we you mentioned of course it it the we're in the process of for example setting those systems up for instance because it's not going to appear overnight but um what are we actually taking the steps to really implement that system put it in place uh and what are those steps that are being taken para making concrete new ideal system i'm very very happy that you're asking me these questions because i really want to answer all of them even before coping even before coving um we're actually i just gave a talk in the global emergency care um in the university of monash so they were asking us we are actually the philippines is actually a country of disaster specialists if i may say because we are visited frequently by typhoons by earthquakes and you know na um actually is this is this providence that hindi next and i was even asked by my resident in dallas what first for um earthquake and then think about the infection later because the sudden death uh in in in a very um strong magnitude earthquake will kill on site so but anyway going back we are disaster specialists and why are we not thinking about daily emergencies with regards our disaster response but our daily emergencies we can do something about so so anyway moving forward we've already started sometime last year mid of last year um we don't have an actual uh country assessment of what is the status of emergency care in the philippines so we were visited by who and it is uh it was a national assessment for emergency care because even the burden of care of these emergencies at the end of the day all cases chronic and even injuries they converge to being emergencies at the emergency departments but we don't know the cost we don't know the disability adjusted life years etc as indicators for this um burden of diseases and immortalities from there we are more interested in some other uh specialty focus but anyway that's the question so the bill for emergency medical services has been there for years oh yeah yeah so um it's done it's supposed to standardize all emergency medical services systems have you noticed that when you call an ambulance in your barangay it may look like an ambulance but are you sure that there are competent people to be with you in that ambulance so that's what i'm saying that the care should be continuous or it should be a spectrum of care that should be continuous from the house to the hospital or to your right facility so i'm sorry if it made the answer maybe lindsay but i'm really grabbing this opportunity to also advocate but it's high time um as i was saying um hindi blessing and kobe the duma but it only highlighted the problems that were there even before this happened right so let's just see this an opportunity not really on the on the negative side of things but it's an opportunity that it's really high time to focus on that part of emergency care right but let's just drill into that just a little bit more before i move on to other topics because we have a lot to cover and running the group was raised a lot of very good points um but just a little bit uh drilling in a little bit to that point um so meegan young built a congress that hasn't been yeah time to do that but um not to that's the long term kind of thing right but you know to to address the problem at hand right now that we see because i it's a whole process to get to get the bill passed right um for example when we're talking about that system that people will be able to be referred to the right place and everything um are we doing something are there concretes that's being taken to to institute that or one hospital command one hospital command lang bayonne or is there something that's being done to put up that that sort of system in place i mean you know so that people will also build a habit or or build i mean as you mentioned shift their mindset to something like that definitely there really are birthing part of this referral network that's being developed is really public education when is the best time to call and if we we even actually already have um i'm not so sure about this an executive order um addressing prank calls to that headline but anyway going back um currently the one hospital command supposedly initially initially it was um supposed to only address those hospitals that were closing and then also uh to address those patients who who go hospital hopping because they were not accommodated but then i'm not uh we're not claiming that it may be an offshoot or a product of um of the one hospital sorry one kobe referral network but that's what we're really intending to really communicate to government no no no we should not see the hospital as a stand alone or in a silo again and that and not connected to the community that's why um the initial words that we used um to explain the evolution of the the terminology was that you should expand the one hospital command but then wait wait uh it's not just about another hospital connecting to another hospital we should see to it that it should include now and how this will connect now to testing the tracing because some questions really are just i have this uh where will i go to be you know to have the test so but that's that for me is if you if you really look at that it's not a question of accessing hospital care it's just asking where do i go if i have these symptoms so it's now um that's the reason why it is now the one referral network so these are actually concrete steps which happened actually for the past two weeks london and they just launched in august i forgot the date they just recently lost last last thursday the one hospital command but um with the ongoing meetings uh no no they are calling it expanded one hospital command or one coveted referral network so it's it's a good thing but um it's also about habit and and uh habit to call and uh maybe public education as to when and how to use that system right so let's move a little bit to other areas now um you mentioned that hospitals are essentially the last sign of defense right and you want the communities to be able to have the mindset that you know there are things that they can do to avoid the disease and everything and the group touched on things like transportation and workplace safety um i guess coming into it it wouldn't mean first off would be huh better your health professionals how come you're all of a sudden talking about transportation and public transport and and then uh workplaces and businesses so um in in in line with that no at first glance it doesn't seem explicitly linked to health so why did why did the group target those things and what was the logic behind bringing those things into the fold in coming up with a recalibrated pandemic response can i try to answer that coming from the infectious disease perspective no um i think if we understood the way this disease is gets passed around then it will be very evident that all of these um aspects that don't seem to be related have to be addressed otherwise um we will not be successful in our goal of containing transmission so alumna [Music] does not just involve his home or his community we need to um leave our homes to earn our livelihoods and in the process we need to be able to get to our workplaces safely we need to be able to function in our workplaces safely so that when we get home we don't infect our family members so i think as medical professionals we had this realization that let's try to address where this transmission is coming from so that in the end those last lines of defense are able to function properly um intervention at all and since we identified doesn't exist in a vacuum we have what we call the social determinants of health health is is a product of the interplay of of our environment of the food that we eat the air that we breathe and and everything else and relating it to what has said now we need to understand how the virus is being transmitted from one person to another and transmission can happen as people move from one area to another and if we cannot also separate livelihood from probably in the first weeks the lockdown the lockdown was actually we wanted to buy time that was the very reason why we we had a lockdown in the first place because we wanted to slow down if there was not a strict lockdown that was implemented in march the the lockdown that was implemented was a way for government to put in the needed preparation to to prepare the hospitals to to to assess the capacity of of the health care system and to to address them like build testing centers train people etc so that but start to go out slowly whether we like it or not the virus is here it happens even to the best of us it's it's not because we were pabaya it's not because we were pasawai but maybe in a moment nah because you were touching something unconsciously you rub your nose and in indy it's it's a unconscious act and and in those unguarded unguarded moments so so so union so we we tried to understand sandbox we try to identify areas where transmission can happen and among those areas transportation was was one of those identified workplaces was one of those identified so sabin amin if we want businesses to open we have to make sure that the workers are safe at us in the workplace and then bring the infection home right and then infect their household so yeah we wanted to make sure that when we reopen people are safe and businesses will open and remain open right so interesting did not i mean in addressing those areas it's also a way to safeguard um you know a more sustainable way to reopen the economy um but picking up on that no just going again to another area jumping to another area one thing that was pointed out was also the issue of contact tracing until which until now admittedly um is an area where we're lacking um by many standards if you want to be technical about it put an email contactless and everything um so in your discussions no with national government and some local government officials dr eileen you're somebody who uh is a consultant offer for local health for local healthcare and everything um what were the gaps that you saw or that continued to persist over five months into this pandemic i was just in a house of representatives committee hearing earlier today and i had the privilege of listening to the presentation of mayor benji magalum the contact racing char and part of the work that he did was to conduct an assessment of the contact racing appreciation of the different local government units and uh as a result of this study he found out that a lot of lgu's are actually not prepared and they they don't have um an appreciation a deeper appreciation of the important role of contact tracing in cutting the chain of transmission so union problem so we're trying to catch up the the ntf through through mayor magalong as the contact racing charge is trying to catch up they're conducting uh capability building and in the uh version i think they will be given budget to hire contact tracers and to do training but in the meantime i would like to turn it over to dr infectious disease specialist [Music] it will take some time to get this off the ground so um i guess the mindset that we want to inculcate in each individual is first to consider themselves and the people that they need to be possibly infected already and so what you want is to convert that encounter into what is called a low risk interaction so that um the possibility of you getting the disease or transmitting the disease becomes um as low as possible so what does that mean this is actually just practicing the minimum health standards in a share which is keeping your distance making sure that when you're wearing a mask and if possible a face shield and keeping your hands clean so that if ever you inadvertently touch your face you're not putting the virus into a portal of entry now if that was the way you were um always operating day in and day out and you suddenly find out that i see dr eileen was sick when with the last time we met up [Music] now no i'm listening to you as i'm your target audience not me as a colleague here your responsibility yo your responsibility to make sure that even if you have contacted even if you're exposed making sure that that interaction may be classified as lower risk it's up to me and then it's also up to me to monitor or after exposure if i may develop the symptoms or not so proactive [Music] because it's a gentleman they really get the message even if um yeah even as doctors when we talk to each other it's about the the core of the messages so thank you for that inspire sofia sorry and and one more thing sophia no say an example i also have a responsibility it's okay so that this way in in our press con i mentioned about keeping a diary yeah of where you've been who have you been with every day so majority every day um two to three days before the onset of symptoms two to three days long where have i been monday tuesday wednesday if we have been responsible we have been wearing a mask we have been we have been washing our hands and keeping our distance the chances that we will be infecting others would really become lower and us ourselves getting infected is also lower but just an additional question to that no um so it's good to know that there's something that people themselves can do in the meantime um contact tracing but our medical our health workers and health groups hpac uh are they also working with uh for example um contact racing and bhagavir benji magalong and other local governments to help give that expertise and strengthen their response is that something that the group is actively doing too uh on a personal note no i'm i'm doing a lot of work with workplaces so we're doing training for contact training in in workplaces but but for lg use uh we have not really ventured into actual uh capacity building activities with them but that can be explored that can be explored let's just take a step back a little bit now because the two weeks has passed we're actually another uh august 26th today we're about a week into um general community quarantine again so less strict uh quarantine rules um how did how was your plan and all your proposals received by uh bodies like national task force the iatf uh and the duh too um are we still actively is the group still actively working with them how is the how are these solutions received because at the end of the day like caskets and agencies so sofia if i can try to answer that question um i don't think as a group we're making any claims the man to be the only um experts in the field but what i feel has happened um as this group has um taken off the ground is really to um show the different government agencies that we are available that they can um feel free to touch base with us we are very willing to share our expertise and our inputs and we can access the rest of the professional medical community to be able to provide um the expertise that they need no shampoo admittedly this is a health crisis but the movers are people who are not in health so there will be bound to be some kind of disconnect um tapas you can contact us and we can bridge you know that's that's been i think one of our primary roles the bridging the gap between the different agencies the different actors in this particular arena you know with health i mean of course with your expertise in health and understanding the disease normal um in mind but on that note then i think one thing that's interesting about the responses and the solutions that you've given as well as the areas that you you pointed out before is that um it captures what you mentioned a broad response to the pandemic right now um because it covers so many areas but while it's geared towards an infectious disease kovid19 do you see this perhaps as like a blueprint or something uh like a template of response that can be used for future emergencies but that must a country that is um that has experienced so many emergencies in disasters is this something that can be translated in a different setting who may really see my knowledge or may pandemically i will answer first actually when um when i was preparing the as early as march we were already using the disaster risk reduction formula for for this because um coming manga they are our practitioners we we have we we have been working and we who have been working in disasters we considered this pandemic as a slow onset disaster emergency at disaster serving emergencies we don't call it a disaster yet but once the system is overwhelmed and it leads to loss of lives it leads to loss of property and a lot of economic loss then it becomes a disaster so the things that we're doing now like calling for strengthening of the ict information communications technology backbone strengthening the emergency medical services ems ensuring the continuum of care from the community to the hospital coordinating and linking communities to to to each other and strengthening primary care these are all things that are part of the senbai framework you you send a framework no which which happened after typhoon yolanda uh really called for disaster risk reduction and and mitigation and like before in the hyogo framework that it was focused more on preparedness and response you you sending ion is focused more really on risk reduction and and mitigation so if we are able to strengthen our health care system and make it more resilient then probably earthquake um we will be better equipped we will be better equipped okay in terms of resilience as a people and in all the pictures of taiwan yolanda despite everything in spite of everything we have the capacity to always find the good to always find that that the tray of hope that the concept that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel so so you know you knew that's the one thing that that that inspires me to say that that yes we can rise over this and we can make ourselves stronger and we can build a more resilient healthcare system that can withstand any type of disaster in the future [Music] do you want to add any that you can see this has something that can be um some responses that can be also for example the referral network that can be tapped again that can be used again later on if needed during an emergency or or or a disaster yeah when i was listening to dr aiden kesey in disaster part even disaster framework that's what she was using i'm looking also at it at the perspective of being an emergency the discipline of emergency medicine but uh having said that hindi pueding i need to also see long answer is that there's always a health uh issue in all kinds of issues in the entire society so in paradise in essa the whole of society approach whole of community approach intersect or interdisciplinary approach i think this is the best example of things unfolding if i continue to live in my bubble i'll just stay in my emergency department and then wait for a patient because that's what i was trained for and that's my specialty but being a restless person and you just receiving um surge of patience you get to ask and then so um looking at it as a probable blueprint which may be effective also in some other possible scenarios in the future god forbid but i think this is one best example of a working um of a working whole of society whole of community approach of people getting together with different specialties bringing their own expertise into the uh into the the playing field and just working and actually it's just like another person um on somebody else's shoulder and cheering someone on shooting someone uh to continue to continue with uh with their own uh fight uh do not inspire before i'm done with the two weeks and we did not rest um i'm ready to go back to work the usual work that you really do but seeing patients yeah see patients because i'm that's that's we have our own specialties we are clinicians but they are also public health practitioners and all uh i think it's it's one good example of a thing that may be effective in the future but let me just get this across that um this may be debatable and dr ivy may agree or not agree with me but disasters even if they're of different uh nature is quite predictable in the faces so maybe dr ali may pick up on that because um when you plan for something even before the disaster happens you have to have a plan and sadly our natural disaster so what to do in a typhoon how to evacuate a building when there's fire when there's flood um or when there's earthquake but have we ever incorporated our response to medical emergencies or medical disasters into our plan and even like say uh yes everything is there except for example like bomb scare did you did you even consider that putting that in the plan but regardless of kinds of disaster the approach and the and the system of response have this similarities so when you do your drills when you plan your drill and when when you drill your plan a gigging muscle memory you know i know going next and again so that's what we're hoping to do um rising from this um experience of gogan and hoping that young learning we may be able to also on to the next generation hopefully this is really something at least it's a four-part cycle so it's you start with disaster risk reduction mitigation then you have preparedness to respond then you have the response phase then you have the recovery and rehabilitation so you just have to relate it to to everything so anxious uh right now we are in the middle of the response phase for for ncr but batanes batanes right now is zero batanes is in preparedness they go into response so hopefully while batanes is in the preparedness inaudible they close their borders that's how they they they reduce the risk that was their strategy this is just an example so in ncr for example at this point in time so if you have 100 cases then it's an outbreak you are at the very height of the response but it's the same cycle then once you're able to control it you go back to recovery and rehabilitation and go back again to this reduction and then oh wait it's the same for typhoons it's the same for an earthquake we have been preparing god forbid for the big one since i was a medical student right now right um so i mean picking up on what you said then dr espina because we're still in the response phase cases are still rising today august 26th um we already surpassed the 200 000 mark and at least in metro manila the epicenter of the pandemic here in the philippines um so do you think or would you doctors say that are we still losing the battle against government 19 um that are we still losing is your assessment from two three weeks earlier in the month does that still hold and do you see the country turning the corner anytime soon or is that is it too early to tell you know i i would say i i'm more hopeful this week than i was before the mecq was um declared and i'm taking off um from the fact that i saw how the different agencies were very receptive to the suggestions that were brought forward by um actually agencies but they were willing to listen so i'm really actually taking off from that perspective that people are willing to link hands and use their collective strength to be able to um respond to this crisis and if we're able to just keep that kind of momentum going just open the channels of communication just make sure that we support each other in the programs that we have and be willing to listen and change the situation right and i guess no picking up on that too over five months into the pandemic how are you all feeling now nah i mean the who recently said the pandemic is still going to be it's going to stick around for for the foreseeable future for the near future how are you feeding now do you have hope that will survive that will come out of this on the other side of course yes but you're how are you feeding now um also is it the same with doctor i don't know dr espina about uh the response also that were the response at least for let's say the the rest of the year um the current government response especially after the health groups really also lent their expertise then i have always been a an optimistic person i have always chosen to see my glasses always being half full and probably because of the experiences i've had in my life nah i always choose having a nika trio on the gray i choose to see the silver lining let me show you any version no um kidding aside no uh it's okay not to feel okay we will be hypocrites if you say that that we're happy that you know it's not a joke being cooked up in in our small world in our we're we're not able to do the things that you were able to do before you long for that and you grieve actually for for the life we used to had to have before before kovid and you asked yourself especially when you don't seem to see the end right now it's like when we were children and you keep on asking you're in a road trip are we there yet so to people out there listening it's okay it's okay to feel bad to feel sad to feel to feel angry it's it's part of of the process and um and we hold on we hold on and we we try to to keep ourselves positive keep ourselves sane and if there are moments now [Music] but after you cry you brush yourself off get up be beautiful and face the world again that's how i take it i take it one day at a time one day at a time right thank you for that no dr spina speaking of um one day at the time maybe on the last note on a parting note if there was one thing that you would really want to see in the media term in terms of perhaps response or not from the government or let's say the community people what might that one thing be one thing to prioritize one thing you really you if you want to see happen one thing you expect maybe you can start with dr pauline how are you feeling um well dr espino was talking i was tempted to say but there is also such a thing as a positive toxicity so it's okay not to be okay indeed there were moments especially with my experience so there were really moments when it was more about i want to go back to work because that's where i can contribute for i know for for to this fight and for and i'm not even thinking about myself at the time but i'm more thinking about those people who worry about me so i sorry if i fixate i i was fixated in that question but if there's one thing that i want uh right now as in right now i'm to be able to sleep peacefully make you selfish and a wish um and then for others to have also the same thing to be able to be at peace at night um and to be able to wake up in the morning and whatever it is that you were made you were you were born in this world to do be able to but i'm hopeful but not within this few months after um made you confusing and feeling commander maybe because i'm coming from a different kind of from a different perspective having having had that experience mm-hmm yeah doctor uh you know one thing that you want to see happen in a response in the coming months i um acceptance acceptance here to stay and we should all learn a new way of of life nah we might really need to wear masks for the next months even a year and um but you know for everybody to to accept that life as we know it before kovid will never be the same and we we just try to to make the most what's in front of us and be innovative in in in designing so how would i how would my life be from here on how how can i continue enjoying my life continue getting the best out of life with kovid so um what i wanted to see sana as part of our response is really more of cooperation and coordination across all sectors and across all levels because i think what i saw from interacting with the different agencies was really there was no monopoly of good ideas by just one person or one group maraming suggestions and in fact were already in there maybe not in the same way but following the same uh process or the same wavelength note and what really was needed was just bridging these ideas together getting them together so that it moved as one cohesive response i think that's maybe one of the frustrations of a lot of people they don't seem to see now so maybe cooperation across the different agencies cooperation of the public with government you know and coordination across all sectors so that we move all of this together my next is right now on that note we're also with you in and hopefully for the same things and hoping for a coordinated response and with the sleep soundly at night and also for people to you know accept that there are certain things that we need to change if we're going to live with the virus no and on that note thank you so much for joining us today nikki for your time and thank you for your service also we hope to have you back here with us again soon you

Webinar #10: “COVID-19 and Children: The Experience of Southern Philippines Medical Center, Davao”
Ma. Delta S. Aguilar
SPMC Pediatric Infectious Disease Specialist
June 26, 2020 (Friday) 12nn

How has the pandemic impacted on children?  Children may be hidden victims of COVID-19 as lockdowns have made it difficult for mothers to bring their children for regular check-ups or vaccination. Food may be scarce leading to malnutrition. Globally, child abuse has been reported as an effect of being kept at home under stressful conditions. Children may develop anxiety and not know how to express their fears and concerns.  Children may be afraid for the people who care for them, especially if their parents are health workers.

Children can also get COVID-19.  How do we care for children who get the infection? What should doctors watch out for in children who are exposed to adults with COVID-19?
The literature states that most children who get COVID-19 have a mild or even asymptomatic illness, there are new reports that some children may have a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)  can lead to life-threatening problems with the heart and other organs in the body. Early reports compared it to Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory illness that can lead to heart problems and cause severe illness

On the other hand, the symptoms of COVID-19 can mimic other types of infections.  How can we differentiate COVID-19 in children from other infectious diseases?
How about children with other types of diseases like cancer or rheumatoid arthritis who may be at risk for getting COVID-19?  How can we protect them?

COVID-19 and children will focus on how to protect and care for children during the pandemic.",2020-06-26,1304,12,1,UCgHMBsUeTBqZyG8dkGbbVKQ," [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and in our webinar series and with me as always is Mercado member of the Philippine health insurance corporation dr.

Delft Aguilar of the southern Philippines Medical Center you know Susi when I was you sick that is one that was one of my favorite hospitals of the oh yes it's fancy fantastic it's now the biggest prospect ants in the field very dynamic leadership in there and of course dr. Bombay grouse now you say no it's quite not about himself to talk about Kovac 19 and children a pediatric no less than a pediatric infectious-disease in the front lines no spearhead being the presentation today there's a little bit as an introduction stopping pokedex I just a glimpse of what's going on in the Philippines as far as forbid nineteen is concerned you have the figure on the right hand side of the slide showing the trajectory of cases over time we'd like to think we're doing better than before of course it's still a wish now but but really we're highly highly challenged dog Suzy and Doraemon and and simply because there are continuing delays in testing and transmission of results we're still not experiencing dog Suzy the enhancement of tracing it is so so necessary when you're looking at an outbreak like orbit nineteen delays in response therefore emanate from the delay in the collection processing analysis and transmission we're not able to respond as quickly as wisk as we can we have a lot of time now of roughly something like one to two weeks diminish from two to three weeks now some weeks ago there is variable capacity in responding to this pandemic across the archipelago because we have a decentralized health system of our others so the numbers from the deal each dashboard as yesterday indicate more than 30,000 cases more than a thousand depths okay and and we do need to do better tied up with each other in terms of a collaborative response we're very pleased you have an interagency task force fielding all of us and we have technical experts participating there but how I wish dog Suzy and Doraemon that the expertise being shared in the IETF will actually curl the disc on sensors coming from the experts so there's some confusion expert one says this and other experts says another thing another probe says this and another group says that by all means let's come up with the consensus so that we have one voice where are we now and what do we need to do we have a centralized health system and therefore we expect varying capacities across local government unions which leads us dr. C in a major message of this opening remark that if there's an immense need now to capacitate not just the Department of Health at central regional levels as well as the local government units the experts and academic institutions must address sometime soon and therefore we need to enhance the role now of science and experts I trust that the presentation today will see the evidence also on what southern Philippines Medical Center has been in relation to minimizing reducing OB deaths among children in that major medical center in southern Philippines the role of science and experts the sharing of knowledge and learnings as we will experience now in today's forum will be very very important moving forward in addressing this pandemic without further ado I'd like to thank this sense to will interact with you today and look forward to more public health discussions in the near future the bottom line really is helping each other in this time of pandemic helping each other in addressing public health concerns it's really the collaborative spirit depicted by pioneer and by Pope Francis as you see on the screen priming Salama we're looking forward to a very learning field session this noon this this afternoon and some bok pollen Oroku Saki neha many thanks dr. Suzy please unmute yourself oh okay thank you very much the immunity I think you're right now at this point of the pandemic you know when we started this series really there was a very big concern for clinical management because that was the time that we saw hospitals being filled up and not really knowing a lot of people out there not really knowing what to do and I think as we move into another face of the pandemic I absolutely agree with you that public health measures like contact tracing and better isolation facilities in local areas is going to be a key so we should really look for to toward a partnership on some other aspects of of the pandemic inspiring in terms of it says when taking care of a pediatric patient with non severe head symptoms is it essential to avoid direct contact with the child secretions or is less that those months old with cause or difficulty of breathing Plus at least one of the following symptoms can be classified a suspect could be 19 case with severe or critical symptoms except option a central cyanosis option be severe just in drawing option see positive Babinski reflex and option D lethargy so please put in your answers for we nearly have 50 option a and option B also has more than 50 respond that's moving on answers for these two provocative questions we will ask our research speaker to provide the correct answers towards the end of our webinar and then I will give the floor now to dr. Susie for the introduction of our resource speaker thank you very much everyone and hold on those questions in the poll because sometimes it's those questions well the speaker actively chooses the questions and I guess that's the way of the speaker saying these are the most important points we want you to take home from from this webinar anyway so we're going to talk about children and I think it's a great concern for everybody especially for those of us who are parents email or justice or listening because we've kept the kids away from from public places we shut down the schools and at some point in time school may open in a modified way but we would like to hear more about you know how does have it impact on children are there cases of children who get coded in the Philippines how about children who have other diseases who have to go to a hospital and could get infected with Co Viet how about exposure of children to adults and so many other so many other issues of our children who have immune system diseases what do we do to protect them those who are undergoing chemotherapy minami by intentando so for this afternoon we are delighted that we have been able to get from her very very very busy schedule a pediatric specialist in infectious diseases and as mentioned earlier she's coming out of the biggest hospital of the Philippines the southern Philippines Medical Center and she's here to share her experience and to talk about kovita 19 and children let's welcome dr. delta regular dr. aguilar welcome to our webinar it's afternoon Susie the cream on and everyone Davo is hot in the morning and rainy at night you know and you are you seeing a lot of kids who have go via in Davao we do have a share of B+ in Pediatrics but I think globally it's still minimally so we have only around 49 to date and we have only three depths Wow okay so that means we do have children who are getting kovat and children can die of coffee and um dr. Delta have you seen what they've reported in Europe and the US this sort of multi-organ inflammatory syndrome or that's like Kawasaki's disease have you seen that in your product in our practice I haven't seen one but we have cases who our children comes in with fever and rush apparently they don't test positive on coal beds so we are yet to see a case of the multi inflammatory system associated with kovaydin children okay great okay so we're not gonna keep the audience away from your from your talk please proceed with your presentation dr. Delta okay so let me share the slide okay so with afternoon everyone I would like to thank you P and Phil health organizers for this invitation reports were mainly on Metro Manila events and now this is an opportune time to hear what is happening further down south I will be talking about kovat 19 and children and the southern Philippines Medical Center experience the main bulk of the top sharing our experience in SPS in SPM sea as we respond to this pandemic so the outline of my talk will start with ghovat 19 updates SPM sea and Davos timeline our strengths and weaknesses are challenges and moving forward our future directions so SARS convey to which is the main virus of the corona cope with 19 is such a democratic virus that it does not discriminate the young the poor the old the rich in that saying children are not spared so we have kovat 19 cases in children so let me give you a glimpse of the global update according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard we have a total of nine point four total confirmed cases and around less than 500,000 deaths in 188 countries and topping from the list of confirmed cases by country is the u.s hull by brazil russia which the philippines round number 39 but third in southeast asia following indonesia and then singapore now in the philippines as of june 24 we have accounted 32,000 total number of cases with 1,200 deaths now for the pedicle with cases from the philippines situation as of june 21 it shows the breakdown of cases particularly for the pediatric age and it tells us that there about 2000 300 the bulk of these cases are from the 15 to the 19 h group while the deaths were counted among the 0 to 4 years of age now for age and sex distribution we see that there are more males affected compared to that of the females now covalent children our less frequently observed and that worldwide children are also less likely to be tested due to milk temptation of the disease most common symptoms are fever and cough other symptoms are sore throat difficulty of breathing rhinorrhea diarrhea vomiting abdominal pain fatigue headache myalgia and rush now this is an April 10 MMWR report that tells us that in the United States 32% of the population is made up of Pediatrics and among those who are laboratory confirmed cases with known age they have 149 thousand cases and one point seven which 1.7 percent of which are from the children that is less than 18 years of age compared to that of the adults the median age is about 11 years of age I will not go through lots of that statistics but it is noteworthy to say that most of those affected have history of travel and exposure to unknown kovat 19 patient and the most common presentation are fever cough shortness of breath and children now this mmm the boomer article also tells us there were about three deaths reported from this 2572 cases who tell us that most copied 19 cases in children are not severe and serious copy 19 illness resulting in hospitalization can still occur in another article this was the in China source of infection in children by Lou Lou and Lou this tells us that in the 70 2314 cases by the Chinese Center for Disease Control less than 1% of the cases were younger than 10 years of age seen the Wuhan Children's Hospital which was the pediatric referral center and that one ha children tested with about 171 or 12.3% confirmed case and males were more than that of the females as discovered with a median age of six point seven years fever was the most common presenting symptom and there was one noted death in another article published in Italy by peri branzino at all on children Ovid 19 in pediatric emergency departments in Italy children younger than 18 years of age had Covina only a tenth of the total number of patients 11 percent of these children and none died the mean age was three point three years of age there was a known exposure about 12% to appear to ill again fever was a presenting symptoms followed by cough difficulty of breathing there were also those patients who needed oxygen and respiratory support there were six coexisting conditions but zero death so this study in Italy is very important in which it compares all the other three cohort but it is suffice to say that the confident study in Italy as mentioned earlier failed zero deaths now let me introduce to you to my institution the southern Philippines Medical Center this is sort of the PGH of mindanao we are located in dub region or region 11 it is composed of five provinces six cities more than a thousand barangay 43 municipalities 11 congressional districts and SP MC has become a main referral center for challenging cases in mindanao now Espeon has a 1,500 bed capacity actually government hospital under the deeper hell a multidisciplinary academically affiliated medical institution with a century of service passion mission air for all we are guided by our beloved medical director and now recently appointed undersecretary for admin and finance the whole dolce vita now let me give you a glimpse of what SPM see bulletin is so the SPM see bulletin is updated daily and published almost daily with outcome trends of patient and confirmed in southern Philippines Medical Center they percept the number although positives are recoveries at death and yesterday we have about 411 total positive cases with about 30 deaths it also presents a physical presentation of our total positive the cases recoveries and death and the percentages of this cumulative recoveries active cases cumulative deaths per day now let me go through the double timeline did you know that the start of the big pandemic was from a big big case so the first pediatric scare in Colvin was in January 21 20 but a five year old boy with the history of childhood movement was admitted in Cebu and tested positive for pancreas a which was later sent to Australia for virus identification this turned out negative for service go veto now the first case in davao was reported on March 15 2020 this was a case of a 21 year old from pan token double Dora for the travel history from UK to Manila to the house February 29 thereafter the news from Metro Manila of local transmission Davao and was put under GCT now on March 39 2020 first plastic patient was admitted this one--it's of a 15 year old female at our attraction with the greatest in history of exposure it up with plastic things 30 our mayor in dice ara reported that there is already low cultures Chanin Davao and by executive order 23 placed an EC moving further on April 6th empty 26 out of the eleven confirmed deaths in Davao region was attributed to the matinecock filing a total of 18 ona deaths from positive report and about 2400 attendee this was a very important landmark in DA three because the Betina pipe Derby at Nora box that open the kovat 19 in Davao City on April 9 2020 we reported the first go case of an 18 year old Hodgkin Toma on may 9 20 20 we report the second death a 24 day old baby boy with neonatal sepsis acute gastric it is with severe dehydration an important 20/20 we have a third report of OVA death from a 10 year old filled with up and there - myocarditis and they're here on watchful waiting for our number of increased cases now they are pediatric kovat 90 confirmed cases are four people three mortality and tested about 577 patients and we have 47 confirmed patients as of July Tipu 2020 mayor in dice our executive order number 12 a stated that all private hospitals in davao city are not allowed to admit PE eyes and covenant positive patient the southern Philippines med and third shall be in hospital for severe and put in PU eye and a chance others available I shall give page before MC sis low name in Davao pediatric patients we received a transfer private spittle from an empty each dose by family medicine if they are be and exact red wrist that is based on probable cause mild moderate severe or couldn't prove it and what is unique in Davao City that all this category then I did areas these patients after their own pediatric Ovid 19 guidelines but of course this has been adopted um Catholic Society dream guideline on the screening assessment and management of pediatric patients with suspected poor control not disease 10:20 as of March 30 2020 and this has been submitted the office of the medical professional services and issued memorandum numbers now let me share to you the baseline characteristics of pediatric Kovach positive patients in southern Philippines Medical Center as of June 22 2020 we have a total of 47 patients with 28 females and 19 males mostly have declared history triggered at about 31 out of the 47 and 16 have no exposure as for age we have seen that each Tina fits into a teen adult affected by this covered them and that the least grouped affected where the new name was one month one each we have also reported that our length of stay would average about 18 days with the shortest reported attractive hours and longest at 31 days now for the symptoms parallel to the other presenting centers in other countries fever cough and difficulty of breathing and also diarrhea were the main presenting symptoms of our pediatric confirmed cases and we have 23 attend patients as well these patients came in with concomitant disease popping the deceased Association was acute gastroenteritis followed by a participatory tract infection and pneumonia now for the main laboratory values of this very positive patient we found out that WBC average was about eleven point two neutrophils was about 54 lymphocytes at 33 platelet normal at 355 CRP was positive a 3.5 LDH at 890 and serum ferritin at 520 for the radiologic findings 35 of the 47 patients presenting with unremarkable chest x-ray while 8% dead with pneumonia - presented with consolidation one middle of ammonia and one with purely fusion for complications we have reported pneumonia as the most common complication and we also have seen a RDS respiratory failure disseminated DB septic shock and neonatal sepsis now for the treatment options that we have utilized in our institution we have two cases that were given hydroxychloroquine plus as atomizing two odd cases with azithromycin and two cases with IV ihe now let me run through the pediatric Ovid 19 mortality report so we have three deaths now we've got 49 kovat positive pediatric patients our first case was an 18 year old male with Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy this patient is not originally from Daaga but stayed in our halfway house Capernaum for the chemo therapy session now the this patient has no known history of exposure but apparently since this is a teenager this patient was seen lingering around SP MC of which during the time was a hot spot for all Kovac cases the chief complaint was fever and chest pain and his chest x-ray showed bilateral pneumonia he stayed for eight days but succumb to death due to a RDS secondary to pick up teeth with hypoxia our second patient our second Kovac death is a 25 day old male with appropriate for gestational age he came he came from a very high-risk barangay 23c from Davao City and the history of exposure revealed that the mother and the grandmother the mother also tested Kovac particles this patient came in with diarrhea and fever and chest x-ray showed neonatal pneumonia this patient only stayed for less than two days and died due to septic shock secondary to neonatal sepsis you know new neonatal pneumonia acute gastroenteritis with severe dehydration multiple electrolyte imbalance our third death was a ten year old female with healthcare-associated pneumonia to consider rheumatic heart disease comes from Somali with a non history exposure patient came in with difficulty of breathing chest x-ray showed consolidated even pneumonia length of stay was 23 hours only and this patient succumb to death due to respiratory failure secondary to pick up the versus a RDS it congestive heart failure secondary to myocarditis so this worth three mortalities and this gave us very good lessons now let me bring you through our strengths and weaknesses we have identified that leadership human resources infrastructure and material resources systems and protocols and team collaboration as our strengths I would like to emphasize that southern Philippines Medical Center have strengths with our strong medical leadership and government control it is noteworthy to say that under dr. Yvette Burris our infection control head we have developed guidelines together with the adults and have instituted them in our medical center of which everyone is being guided our mayor has also been very supportive of our recommendations and double city was the first to respond to the medical call and the medical need for consults there were a group of doctors who have created al-qaeda which was patched with our 911 residents of Davao City can call this number being passed to a doctor and they're being consulted seen and prescribed with medications and provided with control numbers from 911 a veil of the meds and by them to our Davao pharmacists our mayor also have tapped the military to help in putting peace and order in the implementation of the lock and what is also unique in Davao City is that we have a very active Facebook account that tells everyone of the areas of high risk very high risk in Davao City so everyone can just access the Facebook and they can get the information and of course we are in partner with field health of which most of our copied suspects and covet patients recovers or are brought home with zero balance billing now we have strengths also in our human resources and we cannot discount the fact that our medical residents nurses nursing aides medics housekeeping pharmacy rad tech and guards are all still with us in this crisis we do not stop with our resource augmentation for buck up so as it is now southern Philippines still needs more of the human resource to help in this crisis and more so our department at but department of pediatrics it's a need of residency applicants now we also conduct human resource training as demonstrated with our PPE and donning and doffing practices and other preventive infection control measures we also provide them with psychological support there is a trunk line of which any healthcare worker can call and talk to and we have provided them with shelter transportation and service and even food from donors and from the dietary there are also areas in SP MC particularly the children's cancer unit to provide a free flu vaccination to all medical personnel staff patients and even carers now for those health personnel who get sick we have the personal health service monitoring and surveillance where they tray strap test and treat and we follow this guideline and of course we have strength in our infrastructure and material resources there's already been existing establish man we have a few renovations and did some of also innovations and there is also a treatment facility of which was opened recently last May 22 which is now being utilized as area for asymptomatic and mild Koval pediatric patients now for expanding test capacity we have four PCRs in a very dedicated personnel who helped us in the diagnostic a nasopharyngeal and orful engine swapping our material resources are also donated from private sectors of which we would want to commend and thank them for and we have also systems and protocols in place so cope with 19 consultation for residents of davao city has been disseminated through print radio and web media and that they can always access our 911 further instructions now we also take pride ancient we work with the other local governments and we engage with the do each in their coordinated activities and also we are one in networking as we extend our knowledge with the university of personal barcelona with their webinar series and Fujian medical hospital this webinars were conducted at least once a month Momo signing between ub mindanao and southern philippines medical center on joint intensive training program on south Kavita molecular diagnostics was also done last May 26 2020 now despite all those strengths we adhere to some witnesses and that is one search capacity and infrastructure we admit that with high sensors there will be laboratory testing capacity depletion and that we will also be needing more ICU beds more spaces for more patients the supply chain and depletion and disruption is one of our weakness despite all the supplies coming I'm sure we will get to a point that we will get depleted plus of course with all the travel restrictions the supply will come in a hefty schedule and we also recognize cultural resilience as one of our weakness when the restrictions get relaxed people tend to rely on cultural practices and I'm sure everyone is aware of some of these practices which also gives psychosocial impact now what about our challenges now southern Philippines medical center have adopted the virtual consultation or tele consultation of which is challenging for everyone because not all have the Wi-Fi not all can access the application and not all those how to engage in this digital technology she but in the telekinetic consultation we have waiver and consent and we share prescription after consultation research has also been a challenge at the height of the pandemic all the researches of our residents were put on hold and that even the ongoing clinical trials were put on hold another challenge would be aside from getting busy with kovat we expect that there will be dengue there will be through season and there will be cases of leptospirosis now moving forward for our future directions we have no choice but to adapt to the new normal and one of which is engaging our consultants in our residents and even the residents of davao city on telemedicine so we will be working remotely and of course vaccines are we any closer to a vaccine for the Asian vaccine development South Korea announced that they are in phase one and two so again this vaccine development is still a future that we need to wait for we are one with our national government and SP mc4 sees the need to build build build the creation of an infectious disease Institute and much more to the near future the completion of our southern Philippines Children's Hospital in conclusion the exact impact of kovat 19 pandemic will be substantial and pervasive rapid and sustainable kovat 19 response is crucial in decision making and management calls protecting health care workers and enhancing infection control measure should still be our top priorities and s BMC will need to adopt the new normal thank you very much [Music] [Music] right now obviously presentation thank you very much dr. delta aguilar for that again is Raymond said an eye-opening presentation I think you know we read about this mattina fight think twice or three times already on this webinar series and I think it's really not worried that we pay attention to some of these events that really create a big problem in in the community I mean in in Korea for example there was a religious event or in Singapore there was an influx of certain migrant workers so I think we all learned a lot from your presentation and we'd like to thank you for all the time and effort that went into putting that presentation together maraming salamat wha so we have a couple of questions let me fire the first question here named one from Jonathan so doctor is asking how was i VG given to your patients and for those who were given hydrochloric win did you have any adverse events okay so to answer the first question the IVIG was given to two patient one was a case of a disseminated tuberculosis so we exhausted bacterial intervention in terms of antibiotics and at that time it could not initiate hydrochloric win because of some cardiac issues so we opted for IVIG of which the failed health has assisted us so it was a very good move since IVIG has not been a new treatment of chaitra pediatrics it's one intervention we gave for sepsis so it was hitting two issues already one for unknown intervention for Kovac 19 and the other one particularly was for the infection for this disseminated patient the other one on the use of the idid on that other patient was also in line with sepsis so for Pediatrics it's easy for us to use IVIG as one of our last resort after an exhausting antibiotics because it's one already of the recommended intervention in terms of fighting infection as for hydroxychloroquine we only have to experience one it was started on the initial cases so when one China had recommended this use we adapted to it but in reality we did not really see good response about it we were not out rightly starting it since there are a lot of preparations to start hydrochloric win we have to make sure that the child has been cardio and pulmonary cleared before starting it so we started it as part of the intervention although we don't really know the exact effect but at that time and as we conduct by the Philippine pediatric society with bigger evidence that was one of the recommended then so alongside with the usual treatment of that particular case we gave hydroxychloroquine class as it's amazing right so it's really changing on the management is change yes quickly and that's why it's really so important to be updated and this webinar is really meant to help update our practitioners there's a question here about whether you admit mild cases of go via 19 patients and what kind of management will give them so in that paucity what is unique is that our mayor has been fierce on stating that all private hospitals will not accept complaints or children who present with fever cough diarrhea for that matter so in the initial stages of this pandemic everyone was so strict on these rules so everyone who presents with this would be assessed and minimal Diagnostics will be asked like CBC and chest x-ray should the chest actually reveal pneumonia all these patients we have the rich or poor and if you really wanted to be admitted are directed to s PMC therefore even mild cases are admitted and swamped so that's one unique practice in davao we do not discriminate anyone it's just that some of the well-to-do are hesitant to go so for those who do not want to be admitted we offer OPD wing for these patients and we give out numbers for them to call in terms of follow-up in case they really do not want to be admitted but again all the mild moderate severe and critical cases are suggested to be admitted and SPM see is open to all okay so I think that's a really a very good practice when we were looking at localities certain and localities that you've got a very strict referral network system because I think that's been the problem in many places where you know patients will go from hospital to hospital and they're not getting admitted because it's not clear so that clarity is very important there's another question here can you give so this is from emanuelle can you give a rundown of common clinical and laboratory findings for the pediatric patient so what did you see that was common in your Diagnostics so um the most common presentation remains to be fever and cough and once in a while we get diarrhea now for the common laboratory parameters it's really variable because most of the CBC can either percent with leukocytosis leukopenia or normal platelet so the CBC doesn't seem to be a very good parameter as to saying that that patient is Kovac because it can present either to be increased WBC or low WBC but one of our main link would be a chest x-ray so if the chest x-ray reveals pneumonia be it bilateral infiltrates or low bar or consolidation we direct them and we have high suspicion that this can be a coded suspect okay so the chest x-ray becomes a very important tool for your yes thinking about should I classify as kovaydin and Kofi another question here I'm on determination of cause of death were you performing any autopsies SPM see for children apparently no autopsies were done it was not allowed so most of our deaths were also at bias cremation for those who could not afford cremation the government gave support as for either a double bag metal a metal carrier or transportation as to where these victims or the families will be going to so biopsy it has never been done okay autopsy completely remind overdue there are not and I mean question yeah you know you have one of the highest the most well attended webinar dummy so many people are on the webinar right now you tube with a lot of questions I think it's particularly because of the pediatric ID specialty no were there any significant findings for or anything of that sort that was a read that the biopsy that was done or anything absurd for the pediatric patients pas um particularly for southern Philippines Medical Center we did not do any biopsy so I could not give further answer to that question but there have been reports as for a RDS and other damage but again for s Pam's experience we do not have any autopsy nor biopsy of our Cova deaths thank you dr. Delta there's a question here as to speaking the severe form of kebede 19 is very very rare listen children any force-wide that is so Dow and that's the age have sort of like a correlation in terms of defection or anything yes so most of the kovat 19 infection and children are really mild and those who went into severe cases really have comorbidity comorbidities there are um factors that they wanted to account with it one is they say that our cytokine storm is less because of our less chemicals in the lungs that is in terms of myeloperoxidase our interleukin 6 and interview content there are also other reports as to saying that we have decreased susceptibility because most of our immune system can cross protect us with other viruses so we have already been exposed and children are likely to adapt to these viruses already another possible reason as to its decreased susceptibility is that most of that experience by children are mild some are symptom free so the thing is they don't really get detected and another one is that because children have less high contact experience meaning we just stay home or they just they are interacting with children as well the transmission is also less so these are the reasons why we see that children are less likely to develop corvid 19 okay [Music] espousing the benefits of administering dexamethasone as a possible drug is that something that s pmc has included in terms of their management protocol is that something that you have been giving for pediatric patients for dexamethasone has always been used in pediatric here but the use of it still warrants as to what criteria will qualify for these patients to be given so currently for s pmc we do not have a case where it warrants the need of dexamethasone so again our treatment protocol would be addressing the complaint the diseases involved and should there be a need for dexamethasone then we are also open to using it but up in our past experience we have not used it yet yeah you know we were we talked about this last time Raymond but I just like to reiterate it not because you've got a lot of doctors out there who can advise the patient so because when the news on dexamethasone came out people thought they'd buy it over the counter and drink it no so please please please remind all your patients not to self-medicate to say when they see that they you know we're seeing so many of these cases where people try things because they saw it on the Internet and it can cause more problems than not and it's the doctors who can really tell the patients now please do not drink anything that is not prescribed by the doctor especially for Kobe 19 there's a question here doctora about just to clarify the treatment for children and adults is fairly the same I would say it's not the same because the direction of treatment for Kobe 19 in children is still based on the concomitant disease presentation so we still maximize the use of antibiotics and we treat as the symptom appear one-off for adults most of the co vid 19 probable severe and those two succumb to death really have a very challenging course so treatment wise it's quite different because most of them really are very stormy well that of children seems to be like a management case of treating the way the children presented with their diseases right so I'm just doing whatever we do already in the past yes so I think that's a very important point because there's no formula for the treatment actually you really have to assess the presentation on the history and if you have pre-existing disease then you'll have to take that into into account and therefore there's kind of like a very individualized way of dealing with with Kobe 19 in children array mode I think they're a couple of more questions you wanna take recommendations on breastfeeding there are multiple confusing guidelines for based on breastfeeding we allow breastfeeding and covet positive neonates and the mother just have to be aware of the preventive measures such as wear of the mask and frequent hand-washing so we do not we do not isolate the mom in the child just so there is sort of stopping the transmission of the disease but again we still believed that the breast milk has a lot more to give rather than the risk of infection so we just really have the mother of two okay we are part of the Solidarity trial of the wh also our adult counterpart and during the initial talks of convalescent asthma most of our consultants involve like the hematologist of the pathologists have already prepared guidelines and protocols on convalescent plasma so we are excited on this particular modality okay how did they manage their regular patients for what's the Pediatrics department completely inpatient at that point in time okay so um despite being a kovat center since there is only one large government hospital in davao that can cater also to the masses we cannot close SP MC and target as solely a kovat hospital we still cater non covet cases so we have the isolation facility of which patients who come in with fever respiratory symptoms in diarrhea are being entertained while those without symptoms like trauma or drowning or any without fever respiratory cough can go directly to our er so our team are divided to Cove it an unco victim so this residents have also zoning areas of which they will not interact with each other so there has been a process flow in s pmc were in there are Kovac areas and there are nonprofit areas and everyone are aware of it so for those really who needs consultation from s PMC please do not be scared because we have non phobic areas to cater for this case s and we have also isolated facility to cater for the couvade cases thank you very much dr. Delta you know we also heard about this zoning from the lungs Center from the Philippine General Hospital and from the same facility so apparently our hospitals are reconfigured now for places where one call Vietnam Callaghan in places where okay wait a union B Machado Javed there's a very interesting question here and I think this could be really very practical for families where you have a child that say you swabs positive and I've actually had a patient like this no now the positive view is some parent and then positive in child but both symptomatic now in Davao would you admit these patients or they just go home and stay in isolation and what they recommend for management of the child who tests positive with the swim again what is unique in Davao as I mentioned is that we have a very strict rule on Kovac positive so even how rich you are but if you are Kovac positive you will be directed to SPM see even a cinematic so the child with the parent comes to our Hospital they will be placed on our isolation facility particularly our temporary shelters Jim Pam that's what we call it so the symptomatic and those with mild symptoms are meet that there we all encourage if not encourage nobody has ever refused to be admitted okay that's great are admitted to s PMC yeah because what I heard was that in Cebu they were doing what was being done here in Metro Manila in the early part of the pandemic because there were no isolation facilities in Metro Manila if you were symptomatic you just go home so I think that's being done now in Cebu and maybe that principle that you're talking about would be very useful information also for our counterparts in Cebu who are seeing a great rise in a number of cases so whether you like it or not to get admitted to s BMC yes as long as you're tested positive with the swab okay so that's that's very clear no choice our doctors even doctors who work in a consultant in s PMC they have the capacity to stay at home they're isolated but they will be directed to symptoms can they still receive vaccinations immunizations or if not receive the immunization they can still receive all the vaccinations need they can still update or catch up their vaccinations but we would say that you give ample time for recovery so in most cases just like in any viral infection we recommend at least a month after the whole disease process that you get to resume to your usual Immunization Practices okay I think that's okay another very important point to make because a lot of parents are wondering about this about whether or not you can vaccinate so I think we have taken up a lot of time from doctora Delta maybe if you have one or two more questions Raymond we can yes yeah Ella may be seen in terms of the platform that you will be using how did you evaluate those platforms was there an emphasis or more privacy focus telemedicine platform that sort of thing and how do you disseminate that all across the different departments for ah okay so I'll just give you a things I've learned about it recently because I have not been involved with a telecon so team we utilize the WebEx platform and what do you should really do is they download the app they go through the question there is a Facebook account and they will be directed to that application and they try to give in what their problem is there is a waiver and consent form that they need to sign in although I'm not quite sure how they do it but according to my residents they make sure that it is reported and document and then after consultation they get this prescription it is the plan everything else will be okay so I think we are we're looking forward to more telemedicine telehealth three-month nao new wave okay so I Raymond you want to give our audience an idea of where everyone oh what's the representation of our participants for today yes thank you dr. Susie and following back to you we [Music] [Music] [Applause] and you are also because you have less than a year old with cause or difficulty of breathing plus at least one of the following symptoms can be classified a suspect will be 19 case with severe or critical symptoms except what is the except simple the exact is the positive Babinski reflex okay thank you thank you for answering our questions it's something that we often do [Music] we look forward to having you in future iterations of the webinar dr. Susie yeah thank you very much dr. Delta we have a few minutes so maybe I would just ask you to give some parting words for all our doctors who are out there in rural health units all over the country what's your message to them about kovaydin and children so as medical personnel we wanted that we encourage everyone to unite as one you wouldn't want to use heal as one because we don't want to get sick but we wanted to say that let us fight as one let us get ready to stand to find to isolate to trap and to treat and that kovat infection is real it affects everyone then our children thank you thank you very much well said doctor Delta and it's been such a pleasure to have you on the webinar we are very very proud of what you're doing at the southern Philippines Medical Center we have learned so much today from what we call the King City of the South not from the US and so much learning so much sharing that still needs to happen coming soon a mad person or a sinner you know Bill Torres Oh a banana it's a llama okay so next week okay this is a very interesting topic next week so I hope you'll join us many people don't realize that after you get severe codeine it becomes very difficult to fully function even if you survive so para- not a tonic survive negra Coburn we see all those numbers coming out that they recover but actually there are a number of patients who because of the severity of the Cove in really still continue to have difficulty breathing they need to exercise those lung muscles and in short they need rehabilitation so we are going to talk about pulmonary rehabilitation post severe kovin next week because we can't say that we've finished our job just because the patient survived no the quality of the life of the patient has to be improved and there are techniques and things that we can do to improve quality of life post Kovac so we're going to have dr. cell somebody who is from the Philippine heart center and he is going to talk about rehabilitation post Kovac so join us next Friday let's make this a regular a bit of keeping ourselves informed and of course learning from each other as we fight together imma be on Delta unite together against Kuwait Romano with you Thank You Sussie and thank you again for that I wonderful presentation dr. Delta we learned a lot especially with the how advanced and how state-of-the-art Putin managed Putin in yanaka with 19 cases especially at the southern Philippines Medical Center so maraming salamat puto on so again now reminder poor certificates will be handed and will be sent to your email inboxes only for those attendees who have spent at least 50% of the webinar duration and they will also be given a link to the webinar presentations for all webinar presentations and recordings of all of these webinars are archived and are also shown in the YouTube channel of TV ups if you go to TV you P that edu that pH you will see a link to our webinar recordings for so with that maraming salamat po please please continue to join us as we try to see someone of our you people help webinar series we are preparing for the next version of the series through a much more clinical perspective and we hope you also continue to join us for those webinars but at least for next week we will have a very special guest that we will be talking about rehabilitation from Colgate 19 so this will be very important for those you potty ma recovered patients from kovat 19 so thank you so much and with that we will give you back at least 30 minutes of your time this Friday have a good weekend and stay safe stay healthy and stay connected see you online [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] you"

a very good attendance today and with that we will proceed to starting a press conference uh proper let me introduce to you the the person who will okay the uh the person who will provide us with with the numbers the ones who who is uh responsible for churning out the weekly numbers of octa research he's a professor of mathematics and a biomedical engineer at the university of the philippines diliman he also served as coordinator for the computational science research center and became an adjunct faculty with the asian institute of management he was awarded one of 10 outstanding young scientists in 2010 ladies and gentlemen may we introduce to you dr guido david thank you yes hi good morning to everyone who attended uh thank you for attending so thank you ero thank you to the media partners hospitals government institutions and private organizations and i see some friends and faculty here so i'd like to begin my presentation so basically we just like to talk about trends that we're seeing right now in uh metro manila specifically so uh we're basically going to focus on uh you know what we're seeing in the national capital region so just a disclaimer so this is the current trend that we're seeing in ncr and uh even if we're looking at the 70 moving average which is the orange line depicted here we're seeing uh an upward trend in fact the upward trend is uh quite fast so up until february 16 the day after valentine's day or you know two days after valentine's day we're seeing a flatish trend of about 400 cases per day and then after that the cases started increasing and we're now at about 900 cases per day over the past five days um you will also see uh groupings of numbers that appear to be high like five days and this is due to the weekend testing uh generally numbers are lower uh on or after right after the weekend so we see uh two day dips here that's part of the pattern that we're seeing but the overall trend is an upward trend and uh just as a basis of comparison this is the trend that we saw back in july to august so this is when our numbers became so big in ncr that the health professionals had to call a timeout so at that time uh in late july we were still averaging about 1 000 cases per day then by the first week of august it jumped suddenly to about 2 000 cases per day now these things do happen we cannot predict sudden jumps like this uh sometimes it occurs when you know there's a several super spreader events but it could take one just one week to go from 1000 to 2000 if the trajectory is fast now we generally when we project we generally don't assume numbers to go that quick but nevertheless what we're saying is that it could happen now what happened is that since august the first week of august the trend has generally flattened out or i mean it's we didn't flatten the curve but the cases have leveled off and uh this is uh again how we're looking at the reproduction number uh right now we're seeing it at around 1.36 although there's reason to believe that this may be underestimated these are just estimates we have a range of reproduction numbers and again the reproduction number indicates how fast the pandemic is spreading and if it's greater than one it's spreading fast or it's spreading and if it's less than one it's slowing down and the higher the number the faster the rate of the rate that it's spreading so uh and in general this gives the average number of transmissions of an infected individual so if the reproduction number is one it means each infected individual will infect one other person on average okay uh this is how just as a comparison this is how the reproduction number in cebu city looked like uh over the past two months so hello uh so by before i mean just after the christmas uh the reproduction number was actually less than one then it suddenly grew in a matter of about two weeks very quickly it rose to one point eight and then it has stabilized since then and now it's actually decreasing this is the good news for cebu city uh the reproduction number there is on a downward trend hopefully it will continue going down okay but what we see here is that after the quick rise in the reproduction number in about two weeks then we start a pushback which is this is when the local government implements measures that will uh that aim to contain the spread of the virus so from january 9 they have already started uh you know implementing stricter measures as a pushback and the the effect of this pushback is that it will slow down the spread but the slowing down is is very gradual and during this process the number of cases will continue to rise because the reproduction number is still greater than one but as we reach this point uh the the pushback becomes stronger than the rate of spread and the cases well the reproduction number will start to decrease rapidly so here's another comparison this is the reproduction number for ncr back in july to august so we can see that before the timeout was requested the reproduction number was bouncing between 1.25 and about 1.7 and then it by the first week of august it had already grown again to 1.8 it was the highest and then when the me cq was declared or implemented then we see a well the reproduction number just decreased like a straight line it just started decreasing and decreasing and that is what we wanted to see even though the case numbers did not start to decrease significantly it would seem like case numbers were still high at that time and people were thinking that it was not working it was actually working because the reproduction number was going straight down and in fact it was at this point around end of august when we declared that the the ncr was flattening the curve that means the reproduction number was already less than one at that time or it was projected to decrease to less than one because sometimes there are lags in the measurement due to the testing so this is just a snapshot um this is not updated this was published two days ago just to show you the cities with the highest number of cases cebu city is still ranked first but as you can see the rate of increase has slowed down in fact it has leveled off more or less sorry about that but um and then there are several lg us in metro manila but most notably pasi city which you know is having a surge so we're going to look at the specific cases of the lg use in metro manila and we we grouped together the four highest um the highest uh four lg us with the highest number of cases and here we see uh question city with the green one pasai with orange light orange manila with a darker orange and makati with a bluish bar and we showed here the percent increase compared to the previous week and we see that pasa is obviously having a tremendous increase 91 increase compared to the previous week now what we normally look out for is uh an increase of about 40 it could be a little less could be a little more uh it could be more of course um which shows a significant increase and uh that 40 if it's on a two-week increase of 40 each week then we uh essentially flag uh this lgu as having a sharp two-week rise so here we have basa and marcati as having this sharp two-week increase based on the numbers so manila is also having an increase and question city is also having an increase but it may be slightly less than 40 percent at for example the previous week essentially had less than 40 percent increase so uh even though those are also having increases um we're not yet flagging those uh generally when we're seeing a 40 increase this is similar to what we saw in countries where variants were found to be spreading so in other words this is like a tracking mechanism to identify which places might have the variant uk variant or south african variant so here's the second group uh and you can see that the the case loads for the current week are very similar uh from for although the sharp rise that we're observing uh i think we flagged it in malabonta gig and we're not saying that the other lg use are not suspect but we're waiting for uh more confirmation basically but we're seeing also big significant price for example in nevada's there was a one-week rise of 205 percent and in it was a one-week increase of 80 percent so those are very significant increases but among these passing is would be the lgu which did not show a very significant increase we would consider the increase i would say it's slight but it's moderate so it's not a very significant rise and for the last group here only las venus would have a close to a moderate increase but it's not a sharp increase and as you can see some of the other lg's here are fairly stable or even decreasing as in the case of marikina had a decrease in cases mandaluyong had us 72 increase but it's only over one week so it's too early to tell okay so those are some of the trends that we're seeing but if we look at specifically some of these lg's uh like pasai this is the rate of increase that we're seeing in pasay and it's very significant so uh in the early weeks of february they were averaging only 20 cases per day and now the average is well you can see it's almost it's around 150 almost except for this one day here the i think the actual average is about 130 cases over the past week so you can see this is a very uh fast rise in makati we're also seeing an increase it's a little slower compared to pasay city here the average was 30 uh for most of february and then we have a short an increase and now it's averaging uh more than 60 cases per day so it's a it's a significant increase but not as sharp as in pasai just and just to compare the reproduction numbers for these three well ncr pasa and makati you can see the yellow line here shows the reproduction number in pasai it's already above 2 although it has started this well decrease but it's still above two and that's significant in makati uh it's almost at 1.7 and again in ncr we're measuring about 1.36 i checked endcoves.ph uh which is uh i believe uh they work with the department of health and uh they have a similar reproduction number for metro manila about i think they have 1.38 so we have it more or less the same they used a different indicator i believe on set of cases and just to look at the positivity rate this is the positivity rate for metro manila again this confirms the increase that we're seeing uh in early february we were only averaging four percent positivity rate which is a very good positivity rate we've been holding four percent since october and we haven't had an increase in positivity rate even in december uh it did not really increase but now we have seen the positivity rate go up to six and now it's almost at seven percent uh average so that is now above the five percent cut off of the prescribed by the world health organization so again the positivity rate confirms the increase that we're seeing and here just uh some projections um the uh green bars here are the number of daily cases in metro manila assuming that the 1.36 um reproduction number continues now we illustrated two other scenarios if the r increases to about 1.5 which it which it may already be at 1.5 or if it decreases to 1.2 and again the ideal reproduction number r is less than one but you know sometimes you know we can't have what we want but if it it continues at 1.36 the more or less 800 cases per day will reach about 1 500 by end of march so that will be essentially a doubling in the number of cases this will be a lot of cases but it will not yet overwhelm our hospital capacity although we would want it to slow down before then ideally but if the reproduction number increases to 1.5 and it may already be at 1.5 because there's a margin of error in the calculations then the number of cases will reach more than 2 000 by end of march and this will already be a lot of uh covet cases that the the national capital region will have to deal with this is a significant number similar to what we saw in august it will not overwhelm the healthcare system yet because of how fast it's spreading but eventually it will and the the white line here represents a lower reproduction number of 1.2 we're not yet at 1.2 but if we can hold it down to 1.2 uh by implementing stricter well well i mean not stricter measures but at least having a stricter implementation of of our health protocols uh among others then uh it will still increase but it will be manageable because it will increase very slowly and we will be at just around 1 000 cases per day by end of march and with the vaccine strolling out that will play a factor in the future not yet because we just have begun to roll out but it will definitely be a factor that will help us manage the pandemic even further once the vaccine roll out is in full play so i think that's it for me so thank you i think we'll have the questions after the presentations of everyone thank you professor guido now let me introduce to you the the next speaker ladies and gentlemen he is uh a filipino-american molecular biologist and a catholic priest he is a professor of biology and professor of theology at providence college in providence rhode island and a research fellow at the center of theology religious studies and ethics and at the university of santo tomas he is also uh he's likewise our octa fellow ladies and gentlemen may we introduce to you father nichole robles austriaco opi father ace thank you very much ero for that kind introduction and uh hello good evening from the united states so i'm the biologist of the team one of the biologists and so as you know yesterday the doh reported the first isolation of the south african b-1351 variant in pasay and so we thought it would be important for me to give you a backgrounder on the on the two variants that we are currently facing in the philippines the uk b117 variant and the south african b1351 here in the united states they're called supercoven so these are the supercovet variants so i would like to begin by just talking about what is a sarskov2 variant these are the most common variants that we are talking about today so there's an original wuhan strain that appeared over a year ago in china we then have the b1 variant the b1 variant is the variant that was responsible for the surge in the philippines in july and august so the philippine genome center has confirmed that that the surge we saw there was driven by this variant and the pattern appears to be that in the philippines whenever we see a surge the surge is driven by a particular variant that was introduced into the country so the once the the predominant variant today the ancestral strain is called b1 or d614g this is the most common variant currently in the philippines and around the world we now have also the b117 the b1351 and the p1 as you know yesterday we identified the p1351 south african variant in passai for the first time so this is a map of the geographical distribution of the three variants of concern as of a couple of days ago so the b117 variant is the most common variant it is now five found in 94 countries including the philippines uh the b135 variant was is in 48 countries and on this map you do not have the philippines colored pink yet because this map was uh was uh drawn out before the report and then the p1 variant the brazilian variant that appeared in the amazon thank god has not yet been identified in the philippines so in order for you to understand a variant you need to understand the virus so this is a a drawing of the sars kobe 2 virus and the virus on its skin has 75 spikes and each one of the spikes is indicated by the in the slide and this spike is the key that the virus uses to enter our cells so in this particular picture you have a virus that is approaching the skin of a human patient and our skin is covered with the lock that the key can fit into so if the law if the key is in red the spike protein the lock is called ace2 and ace2 is found in the respiratory system but it's also found in the intestine which is why so many covid19 patients often struggle with diarrhea so you have you have an infection in the respiratory system but you can also have an infection in the gut what happens is that when the virus approaches the human cell it will insert the key so it will take the sars cov2 spike protein and it will attach it to the human ace2 so you have a key and a lock and once this key engages the lock the virus is able to open the cell and enter the cell injecting the cell with its rna to make more viruses now to understand a variant you have to understand that the variant is a change in the key the variant is a change in the spike protein so on the left side of the picture you have the original uh spike protein the original key and here on the right you have several changes in the in the key in the b117 variant that allows it to open the lock more efficiently and the reason why this variant is able to transmit itself frequently and faster from one person to the other is because it has a better key and so the two variants we're talking about b117 and b1351 both have better keys and the key is able to open your lock which is why it's more transmissible so one of the things that we would like to highlight is that variants have triggered significant surges around the world so on the very top you see the pandemic curve so on the vertical axis you see the number of cases every day and on the horizontal axis what you see is the date and you can see that around january of 2021 so during the new year unit the united kingdom israel and portugal experienced dramatic surges that were driven by b117 in south africa you can see that when the 1351 variant became dominant in africa you had a significant surge that was higher than any of the original surges in the pandemic this is a particular hallmark of a variant driven surge so we when we speak about the b117 variant what we know now it is about 50 to 70 percent more transmissible so you can see higher numbers of people in a household who are infected when one of their loved ones is covet 19 positive and so it's higher it has a higher infection rate there's also data that suggests that it is more transmissible amongst children and this was first pointed out in the united kingdom because during their lockdown at the end of last year they still allowed their children to go to school and they noticed that more children were actually getting coveted 19 positive and it turned out it is because of the b117 uk variant so uh just so you know you may or may not know that the countries of jordan and the czech republic are currently suffering a surge each of them is suffering a surge you can see right after january you see the surge in the pandemic curve it's going up this is both driven by b117 it's been confirmed by genome sequencing and in both of these countries the governments had to reimpose lockdowns of different intensity to contain the pandemic now one of the things that is so striking if you look at the pandemic curve for region 7 central visayas which includes cebu city which my friend and colleague professor guido just discussed if you look at the curve you will see that the curve looks like many of the other variant driven curves and of course we know that the philippine genome center has confirmed that b117 is present in cebu in in the central vistas so one of the reasons why you see such a sharp increase in the number of cases is because of this b117 variant that is more transmissible and one of the things that we would like to highlight a one area of concern one reason for our concern is that the ongoing surge in pasai and the ncr has the hallmark of a variant driven surge as professor guido pointed out you are seeing dramatic increases in weekly numbers uh in many of the ncr and many of the lg u's of the ncr and when you see this pattern especially it's repeating itself in more and more lg use you are very concerned that what you're dealing here with is a variant and of course yesterday unfortunately um the doh confirmed that for the first time we have uh the first detection of the b1351 south african variant which drove the surge in south africa and many of the surrounding countries around south africa however the most concerning thing about the b1351 variant is that the b135 variant can resist the astrazeneca vaccine so this is a paper that was published at the beginning of february from a laboratory in south africa and the efficacy of the astrazeneca vaccine against b1351 dramatically in decreases from 70 to 10 and basically south africa decided to abandon the astrazeneca vaccine because it was no different than injecting water into the patients because with 10 percent uh protection basically most people would still be uh be able to get mild and moderate um covet 19. so this is the concern if we do not eliminate the b1351 variant in the philippines which was first identified yesterday in pasay the 17 million doses of astrazeneca that we have already bought but have not yet arrived will be ineffective against fighting this particular variant uh from south africa furthermore we would need three doses of the remaining vaccines because you would need one extra dose uh one booster shot just for the one three five one variant so i would like to end so i received the second dose of the moderna vaccine last friday here in the united states and we have already been told that we should expect to be vaccinated for a third time in september and or october with a new booster from moderna specifically to address one three five one and so i we uh we in octa thought it was important for the media to understand the impact of the of the first detection of the one three five one it is not just about pandemic control it is also about the impact of this variant on our national vaccine strategy uh that we have just begun so we have just begun and we have already been hit in the stomach by a variant that will will if it is not controlled if it is not eliminated from the islands will severely impact and make it more difficult for us to vaccinate the 75 million filipinos in order to acquire herd immunity thank you very much for your kind attention thank you very much father for that very enlightening presentation now we will proceed with uh our topic on vaccines as a segway from the previous presentation the next speaker is the chief of the section of infectious disease department of pediatrics at usd hospital he is the chair of the pharmacy and therapeutics committee at cardinal santos and chair of the international review board of the asian hospital is our fellow uh from octa ladies and gentlemen dr benjamin co doctor hello good morning everybody um let me try to share my screen all right thank you father nick for that introduction at least it will not make my my lecture more complicated um i'm i'm just going to give you guys a summary of what you need to know about colgate 19 vaccines and this is a picture of where we are globally with the corporate 19 vaccines and this is taken from the new york times you will see that there are not all of the vaccines actually go through um being approved some of them are abandoned by the manufacturers eventually but six have been approved into full use six authorized there are 20 but are still in phase 3 2 28 in phase 2 and 41 in phase one of the clinical trials it's important to know the various stages because pre-clinical testing is titled and we know for a fact that the pre-clinical testing is used in animals it's uh when we're able to demonstrate that um there is an immune response in animals and we're able to demonstrate the ed50 otherwise known as effective dose for 50 and lethal goes for 50 percent of drugs and vaccines and other biological agents in the animal models um then we know that it can be demonstrated in human beings so that's the only time that after there's an immune response and determination of safety and lethality and carcinogenicity and embryogenicity and mutagenicity in animal studies do we go into phase one clinical trials phase one are safety trials phase two are expanded phase three are efficacy trials and then of course there is the early or limited approval phase um which includes the eua and then there is the full approval um for the various vaccines and of course you have the abandoned phase i'm sure you also you're all familiar too with some of the vaccines um getting in getting paused eventually like for example aster xenic was one of the vaccines that were passed in some of the clinical trials because of adverse events but later on was allowed by regulatory bodies to continue with their clinical trials um it is the same thing with cynovap which had a pause initially but was allowed later on by um the regulatory bodies to go through the clinical trials because there were no problems actually it was not related to the vaccine so this is the status of approval for many of the candidate leading vaccines you will notice that they are all in phase 3 or for some of the vaccine trials a mixture of phase two and three of the clinical trials particularly for pfizer's bioentec and astrazeneca oxford vaccine majority of them have proven from from the regulatory agencies especially mature regulatory agencies for emergency use johnson johnson has recently been approved for eua from the us and this is um one of the better vaccines because it's a single dose uh vaccine it's a macrophage it's not only in the us that it has received approval but also in bahrain novavax which is one a protein subunit vaccine is not available yet but early clinical trials have shown that it is one of the more effective vaccines including um values that address the string that father nick was talking about on the b 1.35 um they're divided to different platforms the most common are the messenger rna which are pfizers bioentec and moderna the viral vector vaccines include gamma layers astrazeneca oxford vaccine the casino vaccine and johnson and johnson's vaccine um the sputnik v is unique in the sense that it uses two adenovirus platforms one the first dose uses adenovirus 26 and the second dose uses adenovirus 5. cancino biologic is a single dose as well the same thing as with johnson and johnson the others are the protein subunit vaccines one from the vector institute in russia and the other one is nova backs and of course you have the inactivated vaccines cyano farms cyanobac cylopharmacohan and the bharat and let me show you also in the next slide a summary of what the data show currently so so far the data show um that the number of doses for the various vaccines that have seen approval are on the majority of them are at least two doses whether they are given um three weeks apart like divisor or four weeks apart like moderna gamalia farm or they are given 12 weeks apart as in the new data for astrazeneca oxford in in order to improve its immunogenicity the two endpoints and i'd like everybody to remember that that our in the clinical trials are always one these two are the two endpoints one is the prevention of symptomatic clinical disease which means that you're not going to come down with any symptomatic clinical disease whether it's smile although it will not be able to detect whether you have asymptomatic coping or not so the two end points are one on the prevention of symptomatic clinical disease and the second endpoint on the prevention of severe disease uh i did not include the last column here on the prevention of dead but the data showed that none of those that received any of the vaccines resulted in death due to the vaccine so they did not develop problem and they did not develop any deaths from the vaccine if you look at the prevention of symptomatic clinical disease they have a different variety of percentages these are actually median percentages with a 95 confidence interval and i'll explain that to you in a little while none of them none none none of the vaccines um are able to demonstrate hurt immunity because it is too early in the clinical trials to demonstrate any form of heart immunity that's one um the second problem you will be we will get with um demonstration of herd immunity is um it's not approved in children and uh if you're going to talk about 70 of the population getting immunized i don't think that's going to be possible in countries where you have a very large population uh that are 18 years old and below if the vaccine is not yet approved in the pediatric population and third is the fact that for source unlike the other vaccine preventable diseases this is one virus that has an animal reservoir so this might pose a challenge later on into achieving complete herd immunity i would prefer to use the word herd protection um and then of course there is the issue of vaccine hesitancy you will have to remove the number of the percentage of people that refuse to get a vaccine and therefore you might not be able to achieve herd protection for the population at large with respect to philippine fba approval none of them have been approved for use except for three which have received emergency use authorization with respect to storage instructions the most ideal in areas like the philippines were in where in [Music] you need to use them you need to store them at two to eight degrees centigrade would probably be the viral vector vaccines the inactivated and the protein subunit vaccines only two of them will need to be frozen while fize's bio endec recommends it at -70 pfizer has applied for new stability uh refrigeration storage instructions which means that they have evidence now that it can be stored between minus 15 to minus 25 so they've applied uh for application for change in label with the usfda we will need for the usfda to approve that change before we can store it at that particular temperature so let me summarize the issues and perspectives on the vaccine roll out are the vaccines the solution to reopening the economy they're only part of it because we have issues on vaccine hesitancy and you have to remember that in any disease for that matter um prevention is only part of the solution the other part of the solution include um the address uh trying to address um the treatment to this particular pandemic this like particular virus in this particular pandemic and it's quite a challenge because we have no treatment currently and of course um the political issues child and children have barely started there is no approval for this age group there are two uh vaccines that have gone through clinical trials in children this are pfizer and cyanova but they're in the very early stage the question some people ask is why don't they start the trials in children as well the answer to that is that um there's a shortage of vaccine globally and therefore it's not prudent to start clinical trials in children until um there's access to uh vaccines in all age groups and then there's always fitting the numbers we say 95 percent for one thirty five percent fifty five percent for the other one and so on and so forth let me remind everybody that the timeline of the clinical trials are not the same there are differences in circumstances there's differences in recruitment for example for the vaccine nova backs they were able to demonstrate that there is um a certain percentage actually 60 efficacy against the south african escape variant because at the time that they were doing the clinical trials um in south africa this was already the virus that was this was the barrier that was circulating at that time and you see the difference also um with the astrozenica oxford vaccine in the clinical trials done out of the uk when they were doing this out of the uk they were able to subdivide the population and say that all right for the ordinary virus the surgical the the original starscope 2 it was 95.2 percent effective but with the b117 strain it was 85 effective only so it will depend on when the clinical trials were done the circumstances in the recruitment and the population of the clinical trials should be similar there is a major shortage issue on vaccine supply and then somebody has popped up the question on doing uh clinical trials and how ethical it is at the time when vaccines are already available and one will need to get recruited into the placebo arm and then of course there is the single dose for those who have already previous covet so this is interesting because um there are suggestions that patients who have had previous coping colbit may need single doses and the the data for this is very early and of course retrofitting other clinical trials for longer intervals which assassinate has done and glad father nick has raised the issue that um the astaxenica oxford vaccine actually when used in south africa for the b 1.135 strains has shown only 10 vaccine efficacy that is actually the data that came out so that is the reason why south africa put the ac vaccine on hold for a while in the country and then there is the development of single doses which are more appropriate because you know it's really very hard to make people come back and forth and of course the variants are here so we they're re-retrofitting and redesigning a booster shot uh that will address these variants there is a guide to when to who and when to get the vaccine that the who provides and those that are not indicated are those that the children that are less than 16 those who have allergies to polyethylene glycol or polysorbate and those who have anaphylactic reactions after the first dose of the vaccine otherwise aside from that anybody else can get it except that if you have certain conditions they're just special precautions or if you have certain diseases at the time that you are supposed to receive the vaccine or certain health conditions like pregnancy you may elect to defer it for those of autoimmune diseases diagnosing hiv cancer have undergone transplant on steroid treatment or at the end of life these are issues that you might want to get clearance from the attending physician or if you're bedridden in a terminal illness you may hope not to get the vaccine anymore my last slide is and i will borrow this from dr patrick morale and i think it is very appropriate at a time like this a choice to get vaccinated is almost universal the choice on which vaccine is personal let's not shame or feel superior to those who choose to wait as we do not walk in their shoes in the same day let us not smear those who have chosen to get vaccinated as they see it as part of the greater good everyone wants this pandemic to end and we are rational being and the choice should always be given thank you thank you thank you very much dr ko for a very enlightening presentation then for our last presenter may introduce to you uh he's a political science professor and assistant vice president for public affairs of the university of the philippines he's also the founder of octa research ladies and gentlemen professor ranjit wright yes uh good morning to everyone and uh thank you to our earlier presenters dr guido david dr benjiko and father nick ostriaco all of whom are um distinguished scientists in their own field and medical practitioner and practitioners in their own field and as of course fellows of the research before i start not and preface my uh discussion by saying that doctor research has been doing its monitoring uh since uh the start of the pandemic our first we've been observing it the whole of march and we came up with our first monitoring report no volume right uh yeah is there can you hear me guys yeah yes yeah okay yes so i'm going to say i was just pre-facing my presentation by saying that after research is here to provide for the public uh you know the best possible uh data on the state of the uh kovite 19 in the country and we've been doing this since march last year and we we started with bi-monthly monitoring reports in april and we've gone to weekly reports so again this has to be appreciated in a sense that we're doing this on a weekly basis and when we see significant changes in the trends people often look at the numbers at the end no but small as they may see and manageable as they may seem what we're looking at in octa is the trend and if the trend is going up we let the public know and uh we see when we see things changes we inform the public and that includes of course government and the private sector octa just like all other entities in our society our stakeholders want us to get to a new and better normal we want to open up the economy and at the same time not deal with the management the mitigation of this uh virus that has uh plagued us so this is the preface to my presentation and uh so we've heard the previous speakers and what we are trying to say is that we are number one uh in a early stage of a potentially serious surge it's we've we've dealt with surges before we have improved their capacity we have the philippines in general and the ncr is better prepared now to deal with searches both at the level of testing tracing okay uh isolation and even treatment as dr benjiko was trying to say okay but uh they're mitigating circumstances and elements to uh this particular search the new one says one is that we're dealing now with as father austria austria was saying um new variants that are game-changing variants not only because they're more contagious not only because they're more lethal but they have a significant implication on the rollout of our very important vaccination program be that as it may as we are in an early the early stages though um we believe that whatever is happening now in the answer can still be mitigated if we all work together okay the situation is still manageable what is required are uh is really timely and appropriate responses not just from government not just from our local government not just from the private sector but from us individuals and citizens so this is where we're coming from uh we see a significant uh rise in cases uh and it where at the time when we have identified serious variants okay now spreading all over uh the country and including the national capital region as to the prevalence of these variants we're still waiting for the new age we're still waiting for our epistemic or scientific communities uh institutions like the genome center to confirm but what we see is really what we see from the data from the numbers and as the professor david has pointed out the signatures seem to point to a possible spreading of these so-called more contagious and lethal variants next slide so we again the focus is on what we can do okay uh the first and foremost for us is that we go back to the basic the basics now the best science is telling us that uh if the national and local governments work together they can intensify testing racing and isolation okay and we believe that doing this and doing this well uh will actually help mitigate and possibly reverse uh the increase in transmission in communities whether it's the uk variant or the south african variant okay uh we can't go we cannot we cannot move forward without improving no and intensifying our testing tracing and isolation uh if we test and identify but we don't isolate at the local government level effectively the virus will continue to spread and that's why we're appealing to our local government units to be more vigilant to continue uh and even intensify okay the efforts are testing and raising praising will be very important here okay and as it has been important uh in uh in a sense no in other places around the country in minimizing the spread of certain variants okay we we saw that racing was very important in in mountain province uh we're seeing that it will be important in key cities around ncr and so we're we're encouraging local governments to continue uh testing tracing and of course to expand isolation second is while we are not advocating large-scale lockdowns we are all we are one with government that we want to open up the economy and find a proper balance now but given this the context that we are in now there's a possibility of uh a more contagious variant or set of variants becoming more prevalent uh it's incumbent on uh our local governments now especially in the high-risk areas identified by professor david in his presentation to use no localized barangay level lockdowns as uh was undertaken by pasa and we hope that very soon we'll get data to see if it was effective no and localized lockdowns might be um the way to go as far as containing these new buttons are concerned however we in octa as we have suggested uh and reiterated in all our monitoring other ports localized lockdowns are hard lockdowns in general are hard for communities so that's why we're advocating that these laptops are humane uh they're supported okay and that their localized but uh given a particular time frame and uh we feel that if effectively undertaken it could be a step to fight against this the spread of these more contagious variants next time next slide okay this is very important and we echo the position of the department of health on this issue also i mean while the lg has a particular responsibility both uh in terms of in terms of testing racing and isolation it's important that lg's also monitor and strictly enforce minimum public health standards such as the wearing of face masks face shield the enforcement of social distancing and of course the encouraging of proper hygiene at this point we really need to um to uh emphasize this now more than ever given the fact that there is a significant rise in cases we call it a surge in octa and that uh there are complicating circumstances because of the variance okay next slide okay so here's what we want to emphasize now based on the data that we have uh and the observations of uh the trends now here in the ncaa around the country and also uh reflecting on data uh in our last search here in the national capital region around august okay uh we believe that there is a surge okay it's in its early stages it's not anymore question of if but really how serious though this search will be so it is in this slide that we urge the national government to increase the capacity of our health care system or both not just in beds and bed capacity but manpower also okay and uh to increase of course testing i i think it's still an issue now we can we need to uh not rest on our laurels no and and further increase testing because uh it's only to test and we can identify infected individuals i'd like to add note that buyer surveillance is a key national concern now it's a national security concern the ability to do gene sequencing quickly the capability of both the national capital region and the country in general now to undertake biosurveillance it will be important capacity okay core competence as we move forward as we continue to manage uh this pandemic next okay uh i emphasize this now the national government needs to scale up contact raising not just in the ncaa but all over the country we know that it has improved a lot over the last six months it needs to further uh improve and expand uh over the next few months especially as we are now rolling out our or the you know phases of the early phases of our vaccine deployment program okay again isolation facilities are important okay and of course i emphasize is to improve lg u's uh capability to undertake surveillance so these are the elements in our recommendation that were standard in most of our monitoring reports but we feel that we need to reiterate this especially now that we're seeing massive increases in cases in the national capital region please take note now that while it is not yet in all cities we're seeing that the trend is going up the reproduction number is above one and that we feel that the virus is spreading and given that their variants already identified uh we suspect that many some of these variants know or that these variants or two variants may be driving the infection or the increase in covid19 infections in many of the lg us observed next okay during this time or period of search the private sector needs to realize that it it continues to play a very significant role okay uh and that is to reduce the risk of workplace transmission so now more than ever we have to be strict uh in the private private sector uh workplaces in malls you know most especially now it's not the time to loosen restrictions now and and to lose in our protocols for monitoring and surveillance now we need to be even sticker okay i've seen many business establishments because of the few that they got from uh the national government are now more lacks now uh as far as uh monitoring and uh monitoring compliance with minimum health standards are concerned and even uh you know basic uh taking up uh temperature and uh you know the writing down of contact uh tracing information so we need to to ensure that now we also need to encourage the private sector to increase testing while we're waiting for the vaccines to come to increase even more testing capacity we have now new modalities for testing the saliva test this one and and then we encourage the private sector to invest in their employees by increasing testing the more testing we that we can do for our workers the more more of them will come out and and join the eco rejoin the economy so we're we're we're batting for more testing we've increased it but we can uh do even more and the private sector can help in that next okay um this is a call really given that a surge is happening uh given that it still uh can be mitigated and uh it's still in its early stages we do feel now given the projections provided by professor david that uh there will be a significant increase by the end of uh march okay and given that uh a portion of this will likely end up in the hospitals are we encouraged though while the surge is still manageable we encourage all our health workers to get themselves vaccinated with the available vaccines uh provided by government uh we know that uh some of them already you know set have set their their minds on uh other vaccines that have yet to come but given the context that we have at the moment there's a window of opportunity uh before this surge uh hits our hospitals and that we encourage our healthcare workers to get themselves vaccinated while the situation as far as the surge in the ncr is concerned is still manageable so uh with that uh we opened the floor to questions okay okay i'm sorry the last point uh and um we feel this is important to emphasize and we know that our because of the service we've test conducted on kovit 19 all over the country we know that there's a very high compliance with minimum health standards public health safety protocols like wearing of masks in particular but we encourage our citizens now at this time when there is a rise in cases to go back not to being conservative and to avoid crowded enclosed areas uh to refrain from organizing social gatherings and to practice minimum health safety protocols like wearing masks and face shields now remember uh in our we are going to release uh in the next few days the results of our survey uh a nationwide survey on uh the use uh the practice of safety uh public health safety standards such as wearing a mask face shield and social distancing um initially i'd like to let you guys know that while most people practice the minimum health standards they don't practice it every day in fact a majority of people wear face masks but uh a a you know it goes down the number goes down uh as we talk about face shields and social distancing and these three basic elements of the minimum of minimum public health safety standards have to be met maintained on a daily basis on an everyday basis until we have vaccinations for everyone in place so we we want to emphasize this now there is a slackening off there's a deterioration in compliance as far as facials are concerned as far as social distancing is concerned and we saw it in the survey we will come out with the press release by tomorrow for uh all our media partners and lastly you know uh we'd like to emphasize that uh moving forward what we do as individuals no um no a citizens no okay is more important than anything government does in this period of search uh in the spirit of uncertainty uh and uh spreading variance what we do as individuals will spell the difference though as far as fighting kobit 19 is concerned so we we encourage our citizens to continue to do their share by being vigilant and disciplined in following the minimum health standards set by the new age we continue to encourage our citizens to take part in discussions like this to inform themselves of both the information about vaccines and to consider you know very seriously to get themselves vaccinated our last press release on vaccine willingness in the country is not very good now only 19 of adult filipinos all around the country in nature i survey are willing to get vaccinated 46 on the other hand have decided not to get vaccinated so it is in this slide that we encourage individuals citizens to take part in uh programs that will inform them about the importance of getting themselves vaccinated and we exhort the department of health to roll out over the next few weeks given that our vaccine deployment program will take some more time to hit the regular citizen to start informing citizens about the importance of getting vaccinated so with this i'd like to end our presentation and open the floor for a discussion thank you yes uh thank you very much professor rai will now open the floor for uh questions we have a lot of questions in the chat room and would like to go over them one by one but aside from that you may also raise your hand and have your questions uh live and just just prompt us for so that you may you may speak and uh we will provide all of the participants with the presentations that were given by the various presenters and we will uh email them to you for those who have not registered please register and we will provide you the materials with that we will proceed with our first question for uh father nick father since indipo effective astrazeneca south africa variant and ncrcts bought many so my response to that is that we still have a window of time to try to eliminate the b1351 variant from the ncr and i'm hoping over the course of the next couple of weeks we will actually be able to do that if we are not able to do that then we will have to have another conversation about which vaccines are available to replace the 17 million astrazeneca doses that will become useless in the philippines of course this is uh this discussion will depend upon the very limited supply of vaccines overall so right now i'm hoping and i am praying to god that the passai city with 77 barangays in an ecq-like lockdown will be able to contain the spread of that variant but we will not be able to know because until for another week or so because from what i understand from the news um genomes from passai have just been sent to the pgc and it will take us what a one week turn around to know what the extent of the 351 variant in that lgu thank you father and then for ncr or some mountain province or cebu yes thank you for the question so if we base it on the reproduction number actually the reproduction number in pasay is higher than in cebu and in mountain province so in cebu city it peaked at around 1.7 to 1.8 in pasai it was already above 2 it's now stabilizing a bit but definitely the rate of infection is faster in basae compared to mountain provinces i don't have the exact numbers in mountain province but it's about similar to what we saw in cebu city so it means that something is driving it faster now of course if we look at the entire ncr it is averaged out so the reproduction number seems lower we we're seeing it at 1.36 it could be up to about 1.4 or even 1.5 but it's lower because some not all lg u's are experiencing this surge so it's mostly concentrated in pasai and a few other algaes surrounding basai i mean parts of these lg's and in northern luzon so i hope uh sorry northern metro manila so i hope that was helpful okay for father nick what is the window period before the new variants become dominant if the reproduction rt holds thank you for that question in order to answer that question we would actually have to model the spread of the variance in relation to the current dominant variant in the philippines the challenge is that we do not have adequate data because in order to do that you need to have extensive genome surveillance even in the united states here they are struggling to model that properly however in the united kingdom in denmark in several other countries that have been able to do so it takes about six to eight weeks from when the variant is first detected for it to spread uh to become dominant as in more than fifty percent and what you will see it's accompanied by a surge in cases as the as the variant becomes dominant so the r will start to accelerate for example the b117 just by simply becoming more dominant will add a 0.5 to the existing r because it's just so much more transmissible so uh we do so in summary we cannot do that modeling in the philippines because we do not have adequate numbers but from other countries six to eight weeks from when it becomes uh first noticeable which would be which we therefore expect sometime in april [Music] thank you very thank you very much mother would you advise the cancellation of astrozenica and change the lg orders to more variant efficacy of efficacious vaccines from bilisan one that's an excellent question i don't have an answer for that because if you cancel the vaccine that's the only available other vaccine that we have um and if they're for arrival uh there is other there is actually no other vaccine that is more um that will address the same problem unless we we have one that will address the b point one point one three five and uh correctly if i'm wrong father nick there is currently no vaccine that has completely addressed that particular variant so uh the who actually recommends that if you have um any of the vaccines just administer whatever vaccines you have and provide it in the meantime um we are hoping that most of the vaccines that arrive that that have been ordered do arrive because that's the only way we can accelerate pushing the uh the immune response of many of the the people that should receive the vaccine but uh i don't think we can cancel it i'm not i'm not sure we're in that position to be able to cancel the vaccines at this point because we only have one vaccine that is present there are data that show that that inactivated vaccines however are more work better actually uh against divariance strains uh and theoretically the inactivated vaccine should work better than the viral vector vaccines and the mrna version vaccines so we have the inactivated vaccines currently so let me add to uh dr cole so there is evidence from brazil it has not yet been published which is why it's so difficult to assess but there is there is data in the news reports from brazil that the cyanovac vaccine that we actually are already deploying in the philippines is effective against the b1351 variant from south africa so i know there has been a lot of debate in the philippines about uh you know the lower efficacy of synovac which is an inactivated vaccine and inactivated vaccines historically have lower um efficacy rates but they're their protection is broader because as dr co pointed out you are injecting the entire virus into the patient so the other the other vaccines you are only injecting the spike protein or a little part of the spike protein and so what happens is a slight change and your vaccine is now very poor but with the attenuated virus you are injecting the entire virus so even if there's a slight change there's the rest of the virus that you can attack and so again uh you know surprisingly given the conversation in the philippines i when when people ask me at this time uh which is better synovac and astrazeneca i say given the identification of the b1351 variant in passai in terms of the long-term goal you might want to pick sign of act over astrazeneca because even though the efficacy for cyanobac is a little bit lower than uh astrazeneca it will protect you against the the b1351 while astrazeneca will not now let me also add to uh to dr benjamin koh one of the things that we do not know uh is whether or not even astrazeneca will prevent against severe disease or death for b1351 this was not reported in the data and as dr co pointed out you know you would rather have some protection so any vaccine will stimulate your immune system somewhat and so if we have 17 million doses of astrazeneca and we we we have to use them then maybe we can go ahead and deploy them in areas far from the ncr where hopefully we would be able to limit the spread of the three five one [Music] hey thank you very much are there any data available about the efficacy of cyanobac vaccine against south africa or uk variant so as i mentioned as i mentioned we have data from brazil that has yet to be published that suggests that the cyanovac vaccine is effective against the b1351 and the b117 does not actually experience immune escape which means that the vaccines are actually effective all the vaccines remain effective against the b-117 and this is about the biology of the change in the spike protein i'm very honest with that that's the reason why the south africa variant is called escape variant okay based on what what father nick was saying and i i did not want to venture on the uh the data because there's really it's not been published yet um the data from brazil has not been published yet but there is evidence that it is actually more effective for the attenuated vaccines the inactivated vaccines against the variant strains if astrazeneca's efficacy decreases against supercovet variant does it mean the other vaccines which use a stranded dna technology like astra will not be as effective too so i think my best way to respond to that is by not focusing on the delivery system but actually what is delivered so as uh ben dr koh and i mentioned the larger the target that is introduced in the patient the more effective that uh vaccine is against variants so astrazeneca is trying to it's it's a it's using an adenovirus delivery system but it's only introducing the spike protein um and so you can imagine that if a uh double-stranded dna delivery system is able to deliver more than the spike protein then it would have a higher resistance so it's not necessarily higher efficacy it's not necessarily the the delivery system but the target that is being delivered that actually decides how effective a vaccine is against variants there's a question from johnny cinon uh dr johnny sinon that's eight stop does not recommend to 60 and above and hcw working in covid areas your reaction to this please any of the speakers um yeah i i think the the answer to that is well that i was basically explaining that in the clinical trials you see some of the clinical trials are selected which means that when you do a clinical trial you only select certain patients uh 18 to 59 years old was the target patients that most of these clinical trials were conducted in and except for of course the mrna and astrazeneca has also the same problem that um they they were not powered for patients that were more than 65 years old so that became an issue in europe um with respect to sign of act there is absence of evidence because of the clinical trials being limited to 18 to 59 years old but uh you have to remember that the absence of evidence of efficacy for seniors is not the same as the evidence of absence so absence of proof is no proof of its accents so just just because um uh they they say it's 18 to 59 based on the data that they have but it's because they did not conduct the clinical trials in more in those more than 60 years old so they didn't look into that and it should work the same way i would think it would work the same way a healthy 65 year old may have um better immunologic response than a 30 year old who is not um healthy in the in the real world situation uh and that that makes our immune systems differ in various ways remember if you just use the age as a factor and say okay 18 to 59 if he's 35 years old but he has diabetes chronic heart disease he's oppressive agents and that's a different that's a different matter to content with and i'd like to add to dr cole so i'd like to add that the data from israel that has the population wide enough vaccination strategy so they have they have vaccinated nearly half of their entire population and the earliest data shows that the elderly who were included in the vaccination strategy even though the clinical trials were not as extensive they did not show they did not include as many elderly when they extended the the vaccination to the to the entire population they saw very similar bio biological responses so you know just because you're old you're still human and so it's not expected that you turn 16 you become an alien so the biology is the same so and that is what we're seeing i mean this is something important to to tell people who are not scientists as dr coe pointed out we can we have expectations because we understand the biology of people so um we cannot recommend because there's insufficient data but we can expect similar responses in in our lolas and lolas and this seems to be bearing out in israel thank you very much for dr david how long before the surge spills over to regions three and four well uh that that would be an interesting question right now it hasn't spilled over in the entire metro mandalay yet so so uh but but it's spreading slowly i mean it's spreading quickly in the the areas affected like in pasay and and of course in malabona bottas area and the how we answer that will depend on the effectiveness of the localized lockdowns being implemented in those areas because we understand that localized lockdowns are there to stop it from spreading we know of course that malabon and nobotas are very close to bulacan areas basa may be close to fairly close to cavite uh right now it hasn't spread to for example as far down as montenelupa yet so so it it could take some time but it depends on how quickly it spreads out so we can't really uh give an exact answer there the modeling there is very tenuous uh but but if it does spread quickly it could get there you know within this month within march so i mean that would be one possibility i mean it's possible to get there to spread that quickly to those areas within this month okay thank you for professor rai are you not in favor of mgcq by the end of march now we're not suggesting that the situation is still manageable what we do um suggest is that we all take this rise in cases all around the ncr seriously we need to adjust our behavior government needs to adjust its strategy and intensify testing tracing isolation it needs to intensify or it needs to accelerate now and but in a very efficient manner the deployment of the vaccine for the most important resource of our healthcare system are doctors our nurses and other healthcare workers i'd like to put in no no uh some framing land for uh everyone for the our media partners so octa is not suggesting either not to take one vaccine or the other what we're talking about are is what we learned from the efficacy and safety based on research but uh we are one where there's a solidarity in octet uh as uh as a group to say that the best vaccine is the vaccine that's available now we need to get our own health workers vaccinated we need to get through our priority list as far as the bachelor is concerned and whether it's astrazeneca or cyanobar okay it's still better than not getting vaccinated at all so this is our our basic position as a group yes there are differences and nuances to each of these vaccines but they can be used they will be effective uh and that we encourage most especially our healthcare workers to get vaccinated given the window of opportunity we have at the moment and given the reality that um you know there is a surge evolving in the national capital region and we want uh you know the our most precious resource now our health workers protected uh from the possible uh negative effect of this third okay thank you very much again uh uh professor wright from kai sent maxum ball of freeman cebu hello there in cebu dr rai your opinion paul of continuing the use of public schools as isolation centers like what is done here in cebu city which the vice mayor calls as jurassic you know i i the situation in cebu is particularly worrying because uh you know cebu is first of all let me pre-face the possible is better prepared to deal with research in fact most local governments local government units need to observe what is being done in cebu you know the the last time they had the surge it was very hard they didn't have the resources was still its nascent stage and you know the testing placing isolation was still not in place but they are in place now and cebu is uh you know fighting very hard to deal with this uh vicious surge that has hit them cebu city in particular okay and uh i leave it up you know i respect the position of the cebu city government they have to use us you know resources okay uh to deal with this search the idea is to try to reverse the search mitigate transmission it will require us using facilities uh why not no and i leave it up to the best judgment of cebu government to deal with uh to decide on these issues we respect that in octane but the idea here is that cebu is doing it its share now cebu city officials healthcare officials in particular have been very very heroic now as far as dealing with that surge in their city is concerned we have a fellow deno uh dr brian limno who is uh really a uh a frontliner and sibwen is telling us that you know the healthcare system in cebu has been working double time now to try to deal with uh the impact of the surge let's not close down even many local governments if surges happen will that need to will require using all available facilities to deal with the surge include if it requires uh converting schools into quality facilities then uh if that's if that's needed then we support all of that but the idea there is so how do we deal with the search and see boy is doing it very well now they've gotten hold of it it's still not yet they're still not yet out of the woods but i think it's more controlled now than it was three weeks ago when it was surging and cases were increasing now they're managing and we congratulate the cebu city government the cooperation between civil society private sector and the health especially the heroic doctors and nurses in cebu city who are you know 24 hours working day and night now to ensure that the lives are saved okay thank you thank you uh second to the last question addressed to dr koh from ptv's sweden velardo ramirez if a person has already received certain vaccine but later on it proves to be not too effective against a supercovet variant would it be safe to get immunized with another vaccine brand that has a higher efficacy rate versus a super coveted variant i don't understand what you mean by saying that how you will be able to prove that it is not going to be effective uh or how it is less effective that does not mean that you're going to get sick or somebody else gets sick but um let's let's put it this way um if you get immunized you must complete your immunization okay for that particular vaccine so if it is a two dose vaccine for example for sinova cyanobacter you must complete the sign of app there is no interchangeability study which means that you cannot shift from one platform to another platform just because another platform has arrived so you started with suddenly pfizer arrives and you want the physio vaccine you will have to complete what you you started first if you want to get a different vaccine from a different platform there are no studies that show that it will be more effective if you keep getting vaccines um but there is also no overdoses for vaccines so with that you can select to get another vaccine after you have received and you have completed your first set of vaccines okay thank you enough i'll answer your question yes yes doctor and a follow-up question jnj vaccine is being used by south africa in place of a z astrazellica should we get these doses as well i think i answered that on private message i said good luck to us i took us mean some time to even just get signed about um i don't know if we're we will be able to get that vaccine as well um let's remember something that there is a shortage in vaccines globally because um manufacturing we give it to more people than how many of the vaccines can get manufactured and i think that is one of the gaps that we have in the country that hopefully i was saying that if we if we had a manufacturing plant and that would have been advantageous for us but um it it it's actually difficult to just put up a manufacturing plant for vaccines locally but uh and that's where you see the advantage also of certain countries like india for example where nova backs um has all of their vaccines manufactured in in india and certain other countries that have advantages for their vaccines where they have a lot of manufacturing sites but to answer that question um good luck to us if we are all going to be able to get a johnson and johnson version vaccine okay thank you dr co and with that we would like to thank all our presenters from octa research and we would also like to thank all our participants who have uh gathered in this activity and we will hope to see you in another presentation of the research for uh upcoming uh reports on kovit 19. thank you very much everyone have a good day thank you so much thank you you

All Foreign Nationals entering Philippines but before we get started please like this video and if you haven't subscribed to my Channel Please Subscribe and hit that notification Bell I always welcome new subscribers let's get started in this video I'm going to discuss the travel requirements for vaccinated foreign tourists going to Philippines first you need to determine if you are going to need a visa if you are a national of a country included under executive order number 408 then no Visa is required however if your country is not included then you will have to apply for a Visa online you will have to use visa.gov.ph now contact the Philippine Embassy covering your residence for additional documents for applying for a Visa for purposes of this video I'm going to classify foreign Nationals based on whether they are being required a Visa or not so there are specific countries listed under executive order number 408 so this is important because Nationals from this list of countries are not required a Visa but you will be entitled to a 30-day free stay in the Philippines please take note if you are coming from Visa free countries the Visa is free and you are entitled to stay not later than 30 days in the Philippines for foreign tourists the first classification are those Nationals of countries included under executive order number 408 and these are specific countries you will be entitled to a 30 days of visa-free stay in the Philippines and there is no charge to the Visa and you will get the visa upon arrival it will be stamped to your foreign passport the second classification are foreign tourists and these are Nationals who are not included under eo408 so you must apply for a 9A Visa abroad from Philippine consulate covering your residence you must also use the new online visa system and you must pay the visa fee the next requirement is that you must have a foreign passport that is valid for at least six months meaning to say your passport is not expiring within the last six months before the date of your travel also return or onward ticket will be required for foreign tourists and the ticket must not be later than 30 days you can always extend before the expiration the next requirement is that you must have e-travel registration if you are going to Philippines and the purpose is to provide a digital or printed copy of the barcode for express lane purposes now if you are an unvaccinated passenger you can still enter Philippines but you must provide negative tests within 24 hours of departure or upon arrival if you are 15 years old and above now if you are vaccinated you must provide acceptable proof of vaccination booster shot is not required to be fully vaccinated so if you are fully vaccinated you don't need a booster shot and you won't need a negative test to enter Philippines who needs to present a negative antigen test so here are the travel rules you must present negative antigen tests prior to departure or upon arrival and this is required for all Filipinos and non-filipinos 15 years old and older here are the specific requirements for the negative antigen test for unvaccinated passengers and this is based on iatf resolution number 168 so the requirement is that either you must have a remotely supervised or laboratory-based rapid antigen negative test result and this antigen test must be administered and certified by a healthcare facility laboratory clinic or Pharmacy or similar establishment also the negative test must be taken within 24 hours prior to the date and time of departure from the country of origin or first Port of embarkation in a continuous travel to Philippines excluding layovers provided that he or she has not left the airport premises or has not been admitted into another country during such lay over the rule is that the negative antigen test must be presented by Filipinos and non-filipinos 15 years old and older what if you fail to present a negative pre-departure testing you will be required to undergo a laboratory-based antigen test upon arrival at the airport the Philippine government will consider you a fully vaccinated individual for covid-19 more than or equal to two weeks after having received the second dose in a two dose series or more than or equal to two weeks after having received a single dose vaccine here are the acceptable covet vaccines in the Philippines biotech Pfizer convidesha vaccine epivac Corona Johnson vaccine moderna Nova wax Oxford AstraZeneca Pfizer community Farm cyanovac Sputnik light and Sputnik 5. another requirement is

appeals or those who are using injectables they have to access those services from our clinics regularly so during the lockdown they cannot just access those services so some of them have to stop using contraceptives that they used to get this is metro manila eight months after the lockdown health centers across the country were finally able to provide family planning information and services to communities they could once again conduct house-to-house visits and fulfill resupply requests for various forms of birth control but over 15 months during the pandemic such services were derailed the lockdown might have reduced the spread of covet 19 but it blocked the mobility of these healthcare providers and their clients likewise women who needed these services couldn't make their way to the health centers many women saw their birth control supplies run dry people stay at home especially during this pandemic they will really be very sexual they will exercise their sexual activities more often if a husband and wife cannot even afford buying a condom and they do a lot of sexual activities to pass the time or out of boredom chances are that the woman may get pregnant lockdowns were 100 all over the country for nine and a half months from march to december of 2020 in a survey that we did 60 to 70 percent of women their major problem during the pandemic was unplanned pregnancies an extra 214 000 unintended babies were born in 2021 all over the philippines that's an increase of 13 from the year before these children were born in a nation already overwhelmed by 1.5 million births a year thirty-three-year-old mafia harupai is determined to battle the pandemic's threat to family planning [Music] huh the moment restrictions were eased mafia applied for a special pass she spent the next five months delivering free birth control to a local community [Music] all the pills were donated by private companies foreign [Music] having no access to contraception can have tragic consequences foreign um [Music] it's illegal for teenagers to buy contraceptives from drugstores without parental consent prior to the pandemic teenagers could still get contraceptives from either government health centers or from community health workers these sources which generally come with contraceptive counselling don't require parental consent but with the disruption in these services marjorie supply dried up and now at the tender age of just 15 margaery is the mother of a four-month-old baby margaery represents a chronic problem in the philippines that's been exacerbated by covet 19 lockdowns in 2020 it's estimated that 18 thousand teenagers ended up getting pregnant due to the reduction of family planning services during the community quarantine [Music] the lockdowns meant schools shuttered for over 600 days and education programs were put on hold while learning moved online teenagers like marjorie found themselves with more time on their hands it is very risky for this teenage adults and mothers because most of them are at risk of having anemia sometimes with gestational diabetes preeclampsia or hypertension and for those of infants they tend to have a low birth weight mentally will make them depressed especially taking care of a young infant they sometimes commit suicide and sometimes it's not only themselves that are in danger they also try to kill the infant because it's deemed a burden to them there are two types of boots computer a hard boot is when the power is completely up to the system in question and the starting the machine since giving birth marjorie juggled schoolwork with taking care of a four-month-old daughter [Music] an artist the burden of caring for the child is so great many times you don't have support you don't have parent support it's a very heavy job of actually rearing a baby it means that a lot of young people are dropping out from school and once you drop out it's hard to get back the internal demands of parenthood at that very young age is so great that even if you have that enabling community around your teachers probably your friends etc it's difficult difficult foreign but in order for marjorie to continue schooling jersen the father of a baby had to drop out of is only 17 years old and he tries to make money with odd jobs [Music] the country already has the second highest teen pregnancy rate in southeast asia it's estimated that during the pandemic teenage pregnancies rose by almost 22 percent inadequate sex education and the lack of access to birth control coupled with no school and spending more time around their peers led to a surge in unprotected teen sex the philippine education department had planned to launch a new sex education curriculum but the rollout was derailed by covet 19. [Music] if a lot of our young people get pregnant early and they get stuck in child-rearing child bearing our economy will really be affected because we will not be able to have more stable income or profit from our employment industry during the course of 2020 we probably saw between 40 to 60 000 birds among my norse the problem there is if you cannot get a family planning method it's a 10 percent chance for these adolescents to get pregnant again for decades the philippines have struggled with rapid population growth its population more than doubled since the 1980s up to 1980 the philippine population was similar in size to thailand but 40 years on it is now at least a third larger than its asean neighbor access to birth control has always been a complicated issue in the philippines for years advocates and lawmakers struggled to pass a law promoting the use of modern contraceptives however the church and like-minded opponents stalled its legislation reverend father jerome ceciliano is one of the leading voices against the law to promote the use of contraceptives the teaching of the catholic church is only about natural family planning so when we see artificial methods we view this as against the natural process of procreation the artificial methods of family planning are also not 100 effective even those using condoms for example turned out to be pregnant even those using pills also turned out to be pregnant the church's stand on birth control held sway for many years in the catholic majority country [Music] but in 2017 all legal roadblocks were finally lifted even long-term contraceptions including hormonal implants and iuds could be given out free to everyone all of this is part of the responsible parenthood and reproductive health act or rprh which is envisioned as a means to slow the nation's population growth the major impact of the rprh law is that it has made it a policy that the philippine government the state will provide universal access to family planning and other reproductive health services at the start of the implementation of the law there were four million filipino women using modern family planning methods by the end of 2020 it had doubled to 8 million [Music] but the pandemic struck and all the hard-earned gains were suddenly in danger of being wiped out now that restrictions have eased mafia has been distributing birth control pills to four villages [Music] [Music] m despite the offer of an interuterine device or iud free of charge hershey decided against getting one this after her friend warned her about the risk of developing ovarian cysts from iuds [Music] hershey plans to rely on government-sponsored stocks of contraceptive pills despite not knowing if there will be regular deliveries as and when there are lockdowns for some women backstreet abortionists are heaven-sent desperation and ignorance force women to put their faith and their lives in the hands of those they barely know [Music] hmm [Music] in the philippines all abortions are illegal and in this staunchly catholic nation it's also widely seen as a sin but driven underground backstreet abortions remain as popular as ever after months of lockdown with her husband and no access to contraception mary jane has been left with an unwanted pregnancy she feels her only way out is to rely on marika to help her abort according to one study for every month in community quarantine induced abortion cases are likely to soar by an additional 17 000. [Music] it is mary jane takes a handful of pills from the midwife marika these are cytotec they're abortion pills containing the banned drug misoprostol after the drug is consumed marika will administer pincer strokes on mary jane's belly these will crush the three-month-old fetus foreign after a few minutes mary jane starts to bleed foreign [Music] [Applause] later mary jane's friend will help her bury her three-month-old fetus in a shallow grave near her house [Music] induced abortions in the time of pandemic basically it boils down to poverty of course for sex sometimes incest rape for those who don't have access to post-abortion care it's very dangerous for these women these women who had illegal abortions usually can have hemorrhage their uterus might be taken out unnecessarily because of the infection or worse due to hemorrhage they can die of the illegal abortion done on them for those who have no means for an illegal abortion there is another option sell the baby in the philippines unborn or newborn babies are being traded under the guise of adoption social media is rife with posts from expectant moms looking to give up their baby and couples looking to adopt [Music] undercover asia puts up a plea on facebook to appeal for a baby to adopt within a week we have two responses from so-called bee moms or birth mothers [Music] we arranged to meet one of them she's six months pregnant but already prepared to sell her child foreign [Music] [Music] prior to pandemic illegal adoption has been really rampant but during this time illegal adoption has been through online basically it's easier it's more accessible and it's faster the department of social welfare and development or dswd implements the country's adoption system but since 2020 the dswd has received just four complaints of illegal child trafficking we do not have the real numbers of those cases of illegal adoption there could be many cases but it's just that it's not reported to us [Music] social media usually pedals unborn babies when it comes to buying babies already born manny is the man to go to he's a middleman matching childless couples with poor families who have infants to sell manny organizes deals including the price time of exchange and the fixing of paperwork since the start of 2020 manny has sold over seven babies on the black market foreign through another middleman like manny undercover asia is introduced to a mother who's looking to sell her newborn the 47 year old called herself nancy permanente foreign nancy lives with a mother who makes just three dollars a day working as a garbage collector [Music] the price on her baby would amount to three months of their household income nancy became pregnant during the lockdown endless covet 19 lockdowns kept nancy away from vital sexual reproduction health services [Music] foreign official adoption in the philippines is a complex process that takes years pandemic travel bans court closures and stay-at-home orders for government workers have made the process even harder birth mothers desperate for money or unable to add yet another child to their brood resort to desperate measures regardless of the consequences it could be physical adoption it could be sexual adoption because there was no assessment done thorough assessment done to really ensure that these adoptive parents are really fit to take care of the child and to provide for that child there is the tendency that this children who were illegally adopted may also be abused [Music] [Music] 14 days after undercover asia spoke to nancy she finds a buyer for her baby they're a childless couple from manila she's paid 196 u.s dollars and the baby broker takes a 20 commission [Music] on [Music] unwanted pregnancies aren't just burdening poor families in the philippines they're also putting a strain on a healthcare system that's already stretched to the limit by the pandemic [Music] um as a result of covet 19 lockdowns 34 year old hershey gonzalez has spent 19 months in confinement with her unemployed husband with no regular access to birth control hershey is now expecting her ninth baby [Music] and [Music] m i think the trend in the number of pregnancies will continue we are expecting more women to be getting pregnant because the environment is conducive for reproduction and we will be handling a lot of pregnant women out of the lockdown dr jose fabelier memorial hospital is one of the world's busiest maternity wards this manila hospital is known as the baby factory before the pandemic more than 2 000 babies were delivered here every month but when covert 19 hit about a third of the maternity wards were shuttered midwives gynecologists and nurses were diverted to the front line to battle the surging number of covet 19 cases starting january we are supposed to open up but the omicron no barian came in and we are again on a limited capacity mode if it is already full in our maternity ward they can no longer refer high-risk pregnancies to our hospital because there's no more space [Music] with limited or no access to maternity wards during the pandemic it's a perfect storm for impoverished women like hershey for those who have more than five children they are usually at risk of having hemorrhage after birth because near uterus is overworked and these women having nine or more they are usually under nourished most of them have anemia have diabetes hypertension they also run the risk of having low birth weight babies premature babies there is our numerous but not wanting to jostle with others at maternity hospitals hershey is opting for a home birth foreign 19 has swung a wrecking ball into the philippines family planning services it is likely to buck the philippines decade-long decline in birth rate with an expected surge in pregnancies after the pandemic [Music] hershey welcomed her ninth baby into the world [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] it's been two weeks since mary jane had a risky illegal abortion while she survived the abortion and escaped the economic consequences of an unwanted child the abortion left an emotional imprint which he could not erase

cities in the lone municipality were found to have a variant of concern also 645 or 67 percent of the overs of the returning overseas filipinos were positive for a variant of concern on october 17 6913 new cases were were recorded bringing the total reported cases to two million seven hundred twenty thousand and three three hundred sixty eight of which three percent are active cases 95.5 percent are recoveries and 1.5 percent are deaths looking more closely at our active cases 94.62 of these are either asymptomatic mild or moderate cases 5.37 percent or 4383 cases are severe or critical for october 17 the top five regions contributing to these new cases are ncr regions for a car two and three the top five areas contributing to the new cases are negros oriental isabella quezon city pangasinan and cavite nationally cases have been going down since our peak in early september the daily cases saw a decrease of 23 or negative or minus 2335 from the previous week disaggregating our epidemic curve into the major island groups and the national capital region plus areas it can be observed that all areas have peaked and are at downward trend while all island groups and ncr plus showed peaks this september 2021 visayas the till line showed a flat trend in cases during this period we are at moderate risk case classification with a negative two-week growth rate at negative 44 and a high risk average daily attack rate at 8.26 cases for every 100 000 individuals down from 14.71 in the previous three to four weeks most regions are showing negative two-week growth rates however majority remain with high-risk average daily attack rates region 9 is the sole region with high risk case classification national ic utilization rates at moderate risk at 62 percent car and region 2 have both total beds and icu utilization rates at high risk six other regions have either beds or ic utilization at high risk and these areas are region 9 11 3 caraga 5 and barn the national capital region shows a negative or low risk two-week growth rate and a high risk average daily attack rate and is currently at moderate risk case classification the other decrease to 12.28 per 100 000 population in the recent week its cell systems capacity is at low to moderate risk with total beds and icu utilization at 44 to 59 utilization the national capital region the seven day moving average decrease shows a decrease as cases in the recent seven days have decreased compared to the previous seven days by 533 cases or 27 percent we also look at our national death curve weekly debts have been increasing since the last week of july debts peaked mid august and had been on a decline since we see 100 deaths per day since april of 2021 the month of august recorded the highest number of fatalities with 5055 or 163 deaths per day partial data for october have recorded over a thousand deaths translating to 69 deaths per day to end i would like to highlight the following key messages the national and most of our regions are at moderate risk case classification however several regions will covet 19 bed or ic utilization at more than 70 percent we should continue a strength and local response in all areas to hammer down on daily cases as we safely reopen the economy mobility will increase but maintaining the detection to isolation intervals at four days or furthering further shortening this can counter its negative impact we should be able to ramp up vaccination coverage of the a2 and the a3 population which will have the most impact on our hospitalizations and fatalities over to you john ramirez for giving us the national situation for our major questions we go straight to the question of sri lanka from the philippines star her first question is you mentioned poisek that planning is underway for the implementation of booster shots to immunocompromise seniors and healthcare workers is there a target need to start it upon foundations we are already planning for this we are preparing actually additional doses for immunocompromised individuals senior citizens and health care workers so this third doses and food and drug administration an emergency youth authority series of a primary series nothing is another related question from gregorio may we get uh's reaction regarding the crowding in various areas uh following these incidents incidents are there chances that ncr will be reverted to alert level for soon or there will be additional restrictions like children's mobility similar questioning oh hi mark fatalco and lee you say yes thank you uh for that question alert levels nothing so science no we have metrics to determine what type of alert level and some area so alibaba intervention for the reminders another question from sheila how many miners are now master listed for vaccination last friday event and registered uh yes no so we do not have any pre-registration because we do not have the specific registries for each of these comorbidities so we do not have any uh master list we are going to get this thank you for you said the next question is from aiko miguel of unt people her first question is have we received reports of a fee among the pediatric injury sector on friday a similar question from gregorio how many 12 to 17 years old would commodity have been vaccinated already what kind of adverse events were recorded so far similar question with rafael yes a total vaccinated as of october 16 it was already at 1509 uh as of october 16 at 8 pm uh as to the adverse reactions report though i would just like to question all of you i'm going to give you the overview or the brief details officially reported vaccinations but after two hours they were able to manage it normal blood pressure is allergic reaction but uh it was managed at negra soldier allergies stress related no was determined to be stress related because of the vaccinations but again let me caution all of you it's not official yet we still need to input that into the vg flow of the food and drug administration thank you for you said for her next question for how many doses of vaccines are allotted in areas outside ncr this last quarter of 2021 are we confident that cases will continuously go down until the end of 2021 by ramping up over 19 vaccination uh yes now when it comes to the allocation of vaccines i think it will be best if secretary galvez will be the one to respond to that but as to confidence vaccinations so we are looking at as we ramp as to the number of cases this is very uncertain actually for the next question it's from donna pacifibu and the philippine daily inquirer the first question is how is our covet vaccine wastage management ilana estimated the hindi garment at a normal reason yes not so as off today uh it's twelve thousand nine hundred seventy doses to be exact on uh and uh most of the reasons would be atom temperature expressions stage of our vaccines for each of their local governments and this is slowly replacing us contact raising applications and local the next question is from red men goss of the many times the first his first question is health reform advocate dr lechon said no more than 100 000 tests i'm going to make him assured what is your take on this considering that voh has been time and again advocating for a risk-based testing regime positivity rate uh the ideal really according to who standards would be five percent and less than five percent or less we need about 100 000 or more tests to be done in and we already announced and it is not positivity which is also a sign of declining cases so we remain uh to be in that position this is not a reason for us to be complacent at this point the next question his next question is has questioned the data hospital capacity and view each saying full capacity on the ground in a hospital capacity from the infirmaries to level 1 level 2 and level 3. aside from these metrics or this database that we have operational units hospital in i see you it's 21 days at the minimum and it can even take longer that we are able to decongest already the words but the icus are still a little bit full among food 171 facilities at critical risk 87 facilities at high risk 109 facilities at moderators and 844 facilities at low risk 61.5 percent or 2728 icu debts are currently occupied 46.14 or 9731 isolation beds are all currently occupied forty six point forty four percent or six thousand nine hundred thirty three ward beds are currently occupied so the tournament is a national capital region an occupancy among the 159 health facilities is at 43 percent eight facilities are in critical risk ten facilities at high risk eight facilities at moderate lease sumeron hokaming datos but in terms of the national capital region as well as the other areas gatekeeping indicators and local governments especially here in the national capital region when we did our shift in policy detection to isolation as soon as you detect a case and you immediately isolate them from transmissions a community and that is the key from seven days to just four days right now so it's really something that has contributed well it was a national capital region of course meron silang active case finding continuous testing and uniting panilang isolation and quarantine patients and referring patients to our facilities national capital region last march and april of this year and moderate cases and asymptomatic cases of for the next question is from ac of cnn with the less restrictive alert level 3 do we still further do we still see further improvement in the number of cases alert level 3 national capital region begins in determination and assessment of alert levels a specific area cannot stay on that level for long either either admission maybe after a week we can be able to give you an challenges or gaps encountered moving forward yes no so rafi actually very smooth young flow now processes for this uh first few days of this pediatric vaccination again in the town hall with the parents and the physicians but of course and there are still many things to be improved just the cases that we look at we also look at the health care utilization hospital surveillance report when were the samples taken was this part of retrospective sampling again uh yes the samples were taken recent no recently i do not have the specific months as to when the samples were taken but we will be posting in the viper group but these are recent faces the next question is from greg gregorio my employers down and implementing no vaccine no salary policy it's the department of labor and employment to provide us with the response to this but let me just reiterate to the public uh hindi podpath basis and that was verbalized by the department of justice incentives and encouragement so hopefully hindi poet i defer to the department of labor and employment on the response for this thank you for your second question to the additional doses or the third doses as part of the primary series in our list of vaccines that we currently use hepatitis b for example cannot mount that appropriate immune response to just these two doses immune system so that's the difference between booster and additional doses and let me just clarify and recommendations and plants are underway is for the third doses and not the boosters we need to wait for the full recommendations of wh o sage by november recommendation for this booster doses yes just to give you the recent samples were from september of 2021 you know sabaya surveillance nothing september 2021 in some polls nothing and we will see you on friday thank you julia thank you for you said and to everyone see you inside you

261,WayZ2hvCO4g,How Covid pushed the Philippines’ biggest bank to go digital,"For the largest bank in the Philippines, embracing digital required a culture shift. Paul Siy, CTO of BDO Unibank, shares how digital technology and AI hold out promise for future banks. https://tinyurl.com/4c3hcvtn #Huawei #TransformTalks #Transform #WhoAreWe #ThisIsHuawei",2023-06-23,200370,30,0,UCtjV1_XU6gvPYyreaFScxBQ, you can't teach an old dog new tricks so goes the Western phrase meaning that for some people they're simply resistant to change and taking on Fresh opportunities well not BDO UniBank there's certainly a big dog they're the biggest bank in the Philippines and a relatively old job I should know on the same age as they are but here at the intelligent Finance Summit organized by Huawei and Shanghai when we spoke to bdo's head of infrastructure and operations Paul C he said they definitely learned new tricks in this era of digital transformation it's had to for this edition of transform talks while a thought leadership interview series I asked Paul what bdo's challenges had been and how they'd adapted it was very difficult in the beginning when we started during the pandemic we did not really have any tools in terms of being able to provide Digital Services in terms of let's say working from home or even providing our staff the necessary capabilities so that they can work remotely we changed all that very quickly during the pandemic we were able to deploy tools that will allow our people and our systems to be accessed remotely we beefed up our digital banking capabilities so that our clients if they choose to transact with us either digitally or in the branch can do that so it was it was challenging so one of the things that we did was we moved to a new data center we built a new data center infrastructure we allowed data to be replicated from one data center to another which was as you know as a bank it's it's very important that your data is preserved whether it's running on data center a or date Center B and you could easily switch between those two areas once your application either goes down or you want to switch quickly to another data center the other thing that we did was really beef up our digital banking capabilities one of the things that we saw during the pandemic was a large frankly the the spike in the volume of users using mobile banking probably when from the normal to about two to three times that in a span of weeks through necessity through necessity because um because of the pandemic there was a lockdowns I think most most cities most countries experience that and the only way that you can transact and do transactions was digitally so what productivity gains has all this enabled you to have as a bank and for your customers and consumers well one of the things that we recently deployed with Huawei was the Wi-Fi we we put Enterprise Wi-Fi in a lot of our locations you can just imagine all of our users used to be connected via a cable right now they can work more freely with the Wi-Fi that we put up with with huawei's help uh the other thing that we've done was going back to the data center scenario where we replicate databases from one data center to another without any lag and that that has really helped us a third project that we're working on now is moving our backups from the old traditional tape into storage media which will allow us to really manage a lot of the risk and also the ability to quickly backup and restore a lot of the data that they might need it's interesting you've obviously really adapted to these changes and embraced them and as a result given a better service are you surprised that not all banks or Legacy Banks established banks have been quite so agile well one of the things that I've always sort of prophesies or at least you know shared with my team was a change in culture right frankly the the the four years that I've been there the first two years was really focusing on changing the culture changing the culture of the team changing the way the team thinks and it's really breaking down the ability to accept change change is is key especially now I mean just look at what's happening in in the technology world with the implementation of AI you know the speed at which technology is changing is just amazing right and if you as a an organization is not culturally adapted to change you're going to have a very difficult time adapting to the changes in technology and to the changes in the world there's a kind of adapt or die isn't there and what will AI do do you think you mentioned AI That's clearly going to bring even more changes right what would you look to Huawei to do to assist you on the impact of that one of the key things that we're looking to partner with Huawei on is it's really putting more AI into into the storage into the networks that we purchased from Huawei uh maybe looking at more adaptive capabilities in terms of looking at where the faults could be where the problems might lie or or predictive analysis in terms of if there are issues that will happen in the near future it would alert you in addition we're looking at other ways that we can use AI we have we're trying to build chat Bots now that are very much conversational you might think that you're talking to a person when it's actually is an AI bot behind it and it holds a lot of promise

So allow me to introduce our  speaker for this afternoon. Our  speaker is Associate Professor  at the Ateneo the Manila  University Department of  Economics. He specializes in  applied economics and has  published in the areas of  international migration.  education, poverty, and  inequality. In 2014, he was  awarded as outstanding young  scientist in the field of  Economics by the National  academy of Science and  Technology of the Philippines.  He's a board member of the  non-profit organization Social  Weather Stations And he  obtained his doctorate in  Economics from the University  of the Philippines in twenty  11. So let us all welcome our  speaker for this afternoon. To  talk about COVID-19 and  inequality in the Philippines.  We have Doctor Geoffrey M  Ducanes. I now give the virtual  floor to Doc Jeff Okay, ah,  good afternoon everyone. Let me  just share my stream first.  Okay, so good afternoon again,  and ah, thank you for attending  this seminar on the impact of  COVID-19, on inequality in the  Philippines. Ah, before I  start, ah, let me first  acknowledge that ah, this  presentation is based on a  short paper I wrote for ah,  Oxfam. That will come out as a  chapter in a forthcoming book  on the impact of COVID-19 in  Asia. That will be published by  ah, Bluesberry India. Ah, I  wrote the paper before the full  year 2021 vice results came  out. And before the micro data  was made available. So in this  presentation, I supplement that  ah chapter I wrote with some  analysis of the two thousand  twenty-one ah PIS or family  income and expenditure survey.  This will be the outline of my  presentation. So first, I  motivate the presentation by  giving a quick background of  the impact of COVID-19 on the  Philippines economy and why  there is reason to believe that  inequality could be  significantly affected because  of it? Next, ah, recognizing  that many of the attendees now  are students. I give a brief  description of the different  measures that are used in the  literature to measure  inequality, and also describe  the different data sets I use  in the analysis. This is  followed by a discussion of ah  my hypothesized ah transmission  mechanism from the pandemic to  inequality. And then after that  I go to the main results. So  first ah the short term impact  of the pandemic on inequality.  By short term I mean the ECQ  period. And ah so this was  until the the first semester of  ah two thousand twenty-one. the  2021 Pfize covers mostly a  period that ah I do not count  as being part of the short  term. So that is the period I I  examine next. So the period  shortly shortly after the ECQ.  and then ah third, I describe  the potential of the pandemic  to drive longer term inequality  in the country. Ah I end with  the summary and a few policy  recommendations. So most of us  are probably familiar with  this. But for the benefit of  the fubo may not. So the  COVID-19 pandemic has exacted a  very heavy economic toll on the  Philippines. It has caused the  largest year on year GDP  decline in the Philippines  economy. Ah in in the in the  recorded history. Ah  Philippines GDP data goes back  to the after that Second World  War. And ah and the ah nine. 5  or 9point6% decline in GDP in  2020 was the largest ever  recorded. It also put a halt to  the country's longest streak of  consistently high GDP growth.  just to compare the 9. 5%  decline of Philippines GDP in  two thousand twenty is the  largest in Southeast Asia. Ah  Thailand's economy contracted  by 6. 1% and Malaysia's economy  contracted by 5. 6%. So those  are the next ones. And though  ah Philippines GDP grew by 5.  6% in 2021. This means that the  country's economic output in  two thousand twenty-one was  still about four point ah 5%  lower. And more importantly ah  the perk person output was  still about 7% lower than they  were in two thousand nineteen.  the employment impact of the  pandemic was equally severe as  might be expected. After  reaching its lowest level of 5.  1% in 2019, the annual  unemployment rate more than  double to 10. 4% in 2020. As  you can see from the figure,  and even in two thousand  twenty-one, the unemployment  rate was still about 1. 5 times  the pre-pandemic level. It was  not until ah, fairly recently,  that unemployment rate went  back to the 5 percent level.  And many  of those who remained  employed during the pandemic  also worked significantly fewer  hours. According to the ah  International Labor  Organization, the Philippines  lost the equivalent of 7. point  two million full time jobs in  2020 and three point two  million full time jobs in two  thousand twenty-one. Based on  data from the Philippines  Statistics Authority and other  sources such as the Social  Weather Stations. For example  just our own observations, we  know that all of these has  increased poverty and hunger.  And in this presentation, I  also argue that it has likely  also increased inequality  immediately and possibly in the  medium to longer term. Um, I am  aware that the two thousand  twenty-one Fis report showed  that inequality as measured by  the income genie, continued its  decline in two thousand  twenty-one. But I will show  later why that is an incomplete  picture at best. And that  underneath  the focus has shifted to  relative deprivation.  example, poverty incidents  among families has declined  from  if you look at the earlier  ones, for example, if if you  look at the, the MTBDPs before  two two thousand four, there  was hardly any measure of  inequality. Maybe just one word  or one sentence. It was not  until the 2004 to 2010  Philippines Development Plan  that there was actually a more  substantive  but there are now many  embilical studies arguing that  the causation also holds in the  other direction. That  inequality itself impacts  economic growth. Inequality is  also seen to affect other  things. Such as how investments  are allocated, ah the size of  the market, and even fertility  rate among others. There is  also now a large literature on  how inequality has caused  social political polarization  and how it may be responsible  for the rise in populism. And  of course, ah, just simple  introspection tells us that  what matters to people is not  just what they have, but also  what they have relative to what  others have. So in other  ah inequality itself relative  ah the relative standing of  people is a function of  people's utility function.  The most well-known measure of  inequality is the genie ratio.  I'm sure you have heard of the  genie ratio. We typically  associate inequality with the  genie I guess in the same way  that we associate for example  photocopiers with Xerox or  toothpaste with Colgate. The  reason is not clear why the  genie is so popular. But it the  likely reason what people say  is that it's because of how  well it can be depicted  graphically. Via the Lawrence  Curve. So the graph in this  slide is the Lawrence the the  orange line is the yellow  curve. So for the sake of the  students ah if you rank the  population from lowest to  highest income and then plot  the cumulative share of the  population against the cumul  perfectly equal so that the  poorest one percent of the  population ah ah owns one  percent  line of perfect equality. The G  ratio is just the area above  the the Lawrence Curve, the  above the orange, the orange  line. And below the line of  perfect equality. Divided by  the area below the line of  perfect equality. So it goes  from zero to one. Ah from  perfect equality to the most  extreme inequality. When only  one person or household has all  the income However, the genie  has its limitations. So for  example, ah, ah, scholars in in  the measurement of inequality  say that the Generation is more  sensitive to changes in the  middle of the distribution than  changes at either extremes of  the distribution. Uh it also  doesn't have the nice, the  composability properties that  other inequality measures have.  The composability, meaning, for  example, you might want to  measure the contribution of  different subgroups of the  population to inequality or the  quality of version parameter  that you can include or you can  adjust to make your equality  measure more sensitive to the  extremes ah relative to the or  to to the bottom extreme or to  the ah top extreme.  So, the coefficient of  variation and also the tile  index, also popular inequality  measures, they are special  cases of the general entropy  index. Other measures of  inequality include, of course,  comparing vessel or quintile  shares, a special case is the  palma ratio, which is just the  ratio of the top 10%, the share  of the poorest 40 percent. Ah,  the Philippines Statistics  Authority, when it reports an  inequ  is the data used in the  computation of official poverty  and inequality measures. Ah but  it only comes out every three  years. Though I was told that  ah starting two thousand  twenty-three it will be done  every 2 years. Every three  years, it's generally fine.  When the economy is running,  more or less smoothly. But it  is a very limited ah use in the  estimation of the impact of  COVID-19 on inequality. Because  2020 was very different from  two thousand twenty-one. And we  only have the fights for two  thousand twenty1. The year 2020  was the height of the pandemic.  And the movement restrictions.  Ah and the economic impact of  the pandemic because of this  were most severe in two  thousand twenty. There, as we  know, there was a big change  from 2020 to 2021 in terms of  the movement restrictions and  the openness of the economy.  So, relying only on the Pfizers  that tell us what happened to  inequality and even poverty  because of the pandemic. The  second data set is the annual  poverty indicator survey. This  is done twice every three  years. It contains a broad  income variable. So not as  detailed as the as the Pfize.  But it has many non-income  variables. There was an E in 20  20 which was conducted in July  close to the height of the  movement restrictions. And  finally, I also used the Labor  Force Survey. Ah, which is the  official source of unemployment  and labor force. Participation  statistics in the country. Also  under under employment. The LFS  is conducted every quarter.  just to show what was happening  to inequality before the  pandemic. So whether you look  at per capata income or per  capita expenditure the  generation has been declining  since since the year two  thousand. But most especially  since 2012, up to two thousand  eighteen. If you measure it  using the other inequality  measures I mentioned earlier,  the Atkinson index or the ah  general entropy index, you will  get the same results. But this  graph also shows the  generations for two thousand  twenty-one. So here you see  some difference when you  compare the income and  expenditure genies. There was  an obvious decline based on  income. So from 43 to 41. 7.  But it was more or less flat  based on expenditure. I will  discuss, I will discuss this  more later.  There are various channels to  wish the COVID-19 crisis could  have impacted inequality in the  Philippines. The first one is  to the differential  to finance, education, and  utilities, then their loss of  livelihoods could potentially  exacerbate inequality. a second  potential channel is through  the additional restrictions  that were imposed during the  strict lockdown. Which were  biased against lower income  households. For example, the  extended prohibition of public  transportation during the  initial the initial ECQ meant  that workers who did not own  private vehicles and we were  beyond reasonable walking  distance  table. As you can see, only  about 1% of households in the  lowest income quintile owned  cars or jeepneys compared to  29% of those in the highest  income quintile. The ownership  of motorcycles or tricycles  which are more limited forms of  transportation in terms of the  number of passengers that they  can accommodate or that this  they are allowed to travel is  more equitable but still highly  unequal. So note that  households with no private  vehicles would also have  greater difficulty going out to  purchase food and other basic  necessities during the ECQ.  Another example of ECQ  restrictions possibly  contributing to inequality is  the prohibition of face to face  classes and of young children  going out altogether during the  ECQ. Which potentially  disadvantaged working women  with children who had to spend  more time doing household  chores and supervising the  schooling of their children.  This is specialty this is  specially tour of women who  would did not have a housemates  or or some bahays or yayas. We  present evidence of these also  later. A third potential  channel is to the unequal  access of households to  technologies that for workers  would enable work from home  arrangements. And for students  would allow access to online  schooling and online resources  during the pandemic. These  technologies include ownership  of computers, tablets, mobile  phones, as well as broadband  connection. Lack of access to  technology for online education  could disadvantage the future  earning potential of affected  students. Thus, ah, having a  long-term impact on inequality.  We likewise present evidence of  this unequal access to  technology later. Since there  was no fights conducted in two  thousand twenty Gene ratio  measures of income comparable  to those presented earlier is  not available. But in the two  thousand twenty, APIS conducted  in July of of the year, and  which asked questions about  monthly income in the first  quarter, which was mostly  before the pandemic. And in the  second quarter, the beginning  of the pandemic and when  lockdowns were a strict test,  the data shows a higher  inequality during the pandemic  monthly household income  declined across all income  quintiles during the period.  Though the decline was ah  slightly higher in percentage  terms for the lowest quintiles.  Which is why there was a higher  inequality.  Inequality increased at the  beginning of the pandemic  because of longer skilled ah  workers who were more likely to  belong to because of the loss  of of employment among lower  skilled workers We were more  likely to belong to lower  income households. So they bore  the brunt of initial job  losses. This is related to the  first and second transmission  channels I mentioned earlier  Since the sector's most  affected by the pandemic and  the lockdowns in the second  quarter of 2020 were wholesale  and retail trade which lost 2  million jobs, construction,  which lost 1. 4 million jobs,  transportation and storage  which lost 1 million jobs, and  manufacturing which lost 800,  000 jobs, and these are sectors  where workers mainly occupy  jobs requiring relatively lower  levels of education.  So we did a different study,  trying to teach out the effect  of the ECQ unemployment  outcomes using what is called  the difference in difference  analysis and taking advantage  of the selective imposition of  ECQ and we found that its  effect was mainly in reducing  hours work rather than on  reducing the probability of  employment. But more relevant  for this presentation, we find  that the effect of the ECQ on  our sport was somewhat unequal.  It was higher for meals than  females, highest for those in  the youngest age group, 15 to  twenty-four years, compared to  those in the older age groups,  25 to 40, 40 to 50 nine, 16,  and above. And higher for those  with incomplete ah  post-secondary education and  those with complete college,  those with incomplete college  education. Compared to those  who finished college or who  finished post-secondary  schooling. And we think this is  because degree or diploma  holders are more likely to be  in jobs amenable to work from  home arrangements.  In another study, looking only  at women we found that the ECQ  affected women with children  more than those without  children in terms of the  probability of paid employment.  So the ECQ reduced the  probability of paid employment  for women with children by  significantly more compared to  women without children. And  nation we have is that ah is  the increased care  responsibilities of mothers  during the ECQ. Given that  children are forced to be at  home and to do distance  learning.  So now looking at the impact  after one year So this means  that after, this means ah,  during the first semester of  two thousand twenty-one. So we  look at the power, the income  poverty statistics released by  ah, the PSA based on the Fis  data for the first semester of  two thousand twenty-one. So  this is just the first semester  of two thousand twenty-one. But  first, a digression. Ah, the  most widely used income poverty  measures are the three foster  Gleer Torbec indices. So, ah,  poverty incidents, poverty gap,  and poverty severity. Poverty  incidents is just a share of  households or individuals who  fall below the poverty line. Ah  ah, the, the table on the right  is just illustrative data. So  for instance, so here you have  three countries, country A,  country B, and country C with  ten households each. Ah the  cell entries are the per capita  incomes of the household.  Assume the poverty line is 5000  pesos. Then the poverty  incidence is the same for the  three countries. So for for  each country, there are three  ah households that fall below  the poverty line. So the  poverty incidence is 30%. The  second FGT measure is called  the poverty gap. Or the the  poverty gap. So it's a measure  of the shortfall of the total  population from the poverty  line. For two countries with  the same poverty incidents, the  one with the higher poverty gap  have poor who are farther from  the poverty line on average. So  looking at the table once  again, the poor in country A  are collectively 3, 000 pesos  away from  incidence in in poverty gap.  The one ah with the higher  poverty severity indicates that  there is more inequality among  the poor in that country. It's  also the same as saying that ah  there is more extreme poverty  in that country. If you compare  country B and country C you  will notice that there is more  inequality among the poor in  countries, C, compared to  country B  based on PSA competitions. And  it show poverty incidents in  the Philippines during the  pandemic. Reversing a decade  long pattern of  of 2021 compared to 2 thousand  eighteen. On average, based on  the higher poverty gap  first half of 2021 based on the  higher poverty ah severity  index. And and these  differences are significant at  the 10% level of significance.  So they're they're more poor.  The poor are farther from the  poverty line. And there is more  inequality among the poor.  Now, looking at the full year  2021 FIS data again, this is a  mixed period. So, there was an  ECQ in April 2021. but the  second half of, of two thousand  twenty-one was more open. One  interesting thing is that, you  see a somewhat different  picture, when you look at  income inequality, and when you  look at expenditure,  inequality. Ah, so there is an  argument among scholars, as to  which is the better measure of  income. There are people who  argue that expenditure is a  better measure. Because, ah,  it's, it's more accurately  reflects ah permanent income  which is the true standard of  living And for detailed ah  data, some people also feel  that ah expenditure can be  computed ah more accurately. Or  can be ah collected more  accurately. Because ah people  believe that, people are, are  more likely to misreport income  rather than expenditure. Of  course, in the official  statistics, we  you get different results.  Again, there seems to be a  clear decline from 2018 to 2021  when you look at income  inequality. The left panel. But  when you look at expenditure  inequality, it was really flat.  Based on the genie, there was a  slight decline, very, very  small decline. But based on,  the Atkinson Index, with  inequality of verse parameter  equal to two, which makes it  sense to the bottom of the  distribution, the inequality  actually increased slightly.  Another thing to note is that  the change in inequality even  if you're looking at the income  genie is very different from  the from the previous periods.  In the in the previous years,  In the previous years, ah,  inequality declined, the genie  declined because ah, income  across because as income across  ah grew the incomes of those in  the lower vessels grew faster  than the income of those in the  higher deciles. This time the  incomes declined almost across  the board. So except for the  second ah decile. And the  reason the income genie  declined is that delicious  vessels had their incomes  decline more. Especially the  tent decile. If you look at the  expenditure ah at expenditure  it is different. The poorest  decile suffered the highest  decline followed by the top  decile. In absolute values ah  you you get a U shaped  relationship. So it's high for  the poor for the poorest  decile. Ah goes down and then  goes up again. And it's  actually ah gets close to the  to the peak for the tenth, ah,  or the richest decile. Some  other features of inequality  have changed. As I showed  earlier, based on ah,  expenditure, there was hardly a  change in the measured  inequality between 2018 and  2021.  But you see an actual change  when inequality is the is  decomposed by group  contribution. For example, if  one decomposes the per capita  expenditure inequality by  region, what we find is that  between regions inequality has  declined. But within the  region's inequality has  actually increased. Ah, this is  likely to do with the ECQ  affecting some regions, namely  NCR Calabarzon, and Legion  three, more than others. So the  average incomes across regions,  basically, this means that the  average incomes across regions  have, have their gaps, have  valued their gaps, but within  regions, there is evidence  that, inequality have or  inequality has increased.  You can also decompose  inequality by source of income.  So if we decompose inequality  by source of income, we also  find a notable change. The  contribution of so you can  divide the household income  into a wage income which is  salary income, entrepreneurial  income, and then other income.  Other income will will include  for example, remittances.  That's the major part of other  income.  if  you if you decompose ah  inequality by ah by source of  income what you find is that ah  the contribution of wages to  total inequality has increased  but the contribution of  entrepreneurial income has  declined. And and I I I posted  that ah this has to do with  many businesses that being able  to operate ah normally in two  thousand twenty-one. Including  malls, ah malls, big  restaurants, and real estate  businesses, many of which are  owned by the country's rich  families. On the other hand,  many small entrepreneurs  engaged in community markets  including Vibrant Community  Markets.  and perhap s, this is the reason  for the decline in, the  contribution of entrepreneurial  income, In addition, Perhaps  which inequality increased  because the ECQ favored ah wage  workers who can do their jobs  remotely. And these are mainly  the college graduates who  typically have higher incomes  to begin with.  I now describe the potential  for longer term impact on  inequality of the COVID-19  experience.  As we know the COVID-19  pandemic and the ECQ suddenly  forced students in all grade  levels into remote learning  mode. And and given the short  time, the education system and  teachers have had to prepare  the quality of remote learning  is likely inferior to to the  face to face learning that was  in place before the pandemic.  Ah and this has a potentially  negative impact on the future  productivity of the cohort of  students whose education were  affected by the pandemic. And  that's on future inequality. Uh  moreover, because access to  remote learning, resources is  highly unequal with less access  to those from lower income  households, students from lower  income households are likely to  suffer greater learning  deficits.  this table shows ah ownership  of ah personal computer or  tablet, cell phone ah broadband  connection, TV and radio by  household income queen tile in  two thousand twenty. Ah it  shows ownership of ah personal  computer and tablet is  tremendously unequal. Ownership  of ah cell phones which is  likely inferior to personal  computers for remote learning  purposes. Is more evenly  distributed but still favor  those in the highest income  quintile. One fourth of  households in the lowest  quintel reported not having any  cell phone. access to broadband  connection was even scarcer and  also unequal. With less than  half of all households,  reporting having this type of  connection. Access to mobile  data is not available from from  the Apis data but is also  likely to be highly correlated  with income. Even TV ownership  is still unequal with close to  40% of households in the lowest  quintel. Reporting having a TV  compared to 95% for those in  the top quintile. The AGO only  reported owning a radio. By the  way, let me acknowledge, our  student, Simon Dubaco, for,  for,  of poor children is affected  disproportedly because of  substantially less access to  learning  to work from home opportunities  and online training  opportunities. Again, this  could impact both ah short term  and longer term income and  non-income inequalities as  well.  As an immediate response to the  COVID-19 crisis, the  Philippines Congress enacted  the Bayanihan to heal as one  act in March 2 thousand twenty,  which among others sought to  provide to 18 million  low-income households and  emergency subsidy amounting to  between 5000 and 8000 ah pesos  for 2 months. So this was more  popularly known as ah DSWD ah  SAP for social MLA relation  program. Later the Philippines  Congress expanded  which was targeted to affected  OFWs. This table which is  computed from the FIS, shows  the incidence of benefits from  the four programs described  above, as of June 2 thousand  twenty. Of course, the programs  extended beyond June thousand,  June 2020. But the three months  from April to June 2 thousand  twenty, were very critical as  this was the, as this was the  period when the lockdowns were  most severe. And the  unemployment was at the, at the  record level. As of June 2  thousand twenty, only 46. 7% of  household of households  reported receiving a cash  grant. And though the incidence  of staff benefits was  progressive, meaning lower  quintiles, larger share  benefiting, it was perhaps not  progressive enough. As 45% of  households in the first and  second quintiles still did not  benefit. As of June 2 thousand  twenty. The Dole programs had  relatively fewer beneficiaries.  Campos aggressive as of June  2020 with higher income  quintile households having a  higher share of beneficiaries.  Well this this is to be  expected as higher income  households typically have  better educated workers who are  more likely to to be informal  sector jobs. Because camp  targeted ah formal sector  workers. To pad which was for  informal sector workers was  more progressive but still only  a very small share 1% or of  households in the law of  reported benefiting from the  program as of June two thousand  twenty. Acap was also  regressive as OFWs typically  come from higher income  households. And of course the  as you can see from the last  column the the the percent of  households receiving Acap is  also very very small. So to  conclude ah the COVID-19  pandemic has exactly the heavy  toll on the livelihood of many  Filipino households. I  presented evidence that some  subgroups of Filipino  households were more affected  than others, likely increasing  income and non-income  inequality in the country in  the short term, and potentially  in the longer term. Inequality  that existed prior to the  pandemic, such as, in access to  Social Security, in educational  attainment, in economic  opportunities, and access to  digital, digital technology has  contributed to the unequal  impact of the pandemic across  households. Most workers from  low-income households in the  country are in the form are in  the informal sector. Thus  lacking access to social  security and unemployment  insurance during the crisis.  Additionally, being in the  informal sector also meant that  they had difficulty availing of  government support but relied  on government databases in  identifying beneficiaries.  Moving forward, improving their  access to social and  unemployment insurance will  provide them a crisis safety  net and reduce the like of a  similar crisis in the future  exacting as much suffering in  the country. Ah there are  already many existing models of  how to expand social insurance  coverage for for informal  sector workers. Such as by  subsidizing social security  contributions for low income  earners. And by simplifying the  process of registration and  providing limited time tax  exemptions for micro, small,  and medium ah enter who  registered your enterprises and  workers. Narrowing the digital  divide is likewise critical in  pampering the rise in  inequality in the post COVID-19  era. Increase reliance on  digital technology via blended  learning for instance is likely  a permanent feature of the  educational system. Subsidizing  learning gadgets and access to  internet for students for lower  income households. Perhaps as  an attached program to the  already existing conditional  cash transfer program for  children. And pregnant from  poor households will reduce the  likelihood that they are left  behind. In poor in poor  communities, ah student access  to the internet can be provided  via community hubs such as the  Barangay Centers. Workers have  to be trained in digital skills  or more broadly in 21st century  skills to capacitate them to  engage in new employment  opportunities including remote  employment opportunities. And  also for entrepreneurs to allow  them or to enable them to reach  new markets that have emerged  in a world more reliant on  e-commerce. the long period of  time it broke from when the  government support programs  were announced the time the  benefits reached their intended  targets also have added  avoidable misery to the  pandemic. The problem cited was  the outdated and incomplete  database on which to base the  identification of  beneficiaries. So moving  forward, there is a need to  design the delivery system for  government support in times of  emergency to reach intended  beneficiaries quickly.  Utilizing digital payments if  possible. Transparently and  fairly. The design should be in  place before the next potential  national emergency utilizing  the national ID system,  registration that is now  ongoing, combined with other  government databases such as  the DSW displace Tahanan went  where proxy means testing is  required. Ah so undertaking  these actions will help ensure  that those who were behind  before  So, thank you very much, Doc  Chef, for those valuable  insights. Ah, showing the  relationship between or the  impact of COVID-19 on  inequality. At this point of  our program this afternoon, we  now open the floor for  questions. So, we have three  ways. Ah, you can raise your  hand so that I can call you.  And then you can personally ask  your question. Or you can also  type your question in the Zoom  chat. And I will read it. And  then to our participants  joining us in Facebook, you can  also type in the comment  section. And we will also ask  those questions. So to get the  ball rolling with respect to  our ah Q&A we have a first  question. Coming from one of  our Zoom participants, Mister  Steve Chavez. So the question  of Steve is the following. If  contribution to inequality by  entrepreneurship has declined,  then should it be interpreted  that income from  entrepreneurship has increased  because it shortens inequality?  should I answer no, Jenny?  Okay. Yes, Doctor Jen. Florence  yours. So, what it actually  means is that, the, the, the  inequality in, in,  entrepreneurial income has,  declined. So this can, this, I  mean, based on, based on the  observation, this likely  happened because the big  entrepreneurs such as for  example, the the owners of the  malls, the owners of big  restaurants, as mentioned  earlier, the owners of real  estate companies, their incomes  has declined during the during  the pandemic, especially during  the ECQ. At the same time, the  entrepreneurial income of a  lower income households, such  as those who engaged in,  vibrant community markets, for  example, has increased. So, the  combination of those is what  has made entrepreneurial income  more equal, which reduced its  contribution to total  inequality.  And we have a response. Thank  you Doc Jeff for answering that  question. And ah our  participants Steve thanks you  for that clarification on that  particular matter. Now we move  on to the second question. And  this is from Mister Carl  Galvez. Also a Zoom  participant. Hello Sir Jeff.  What does the data say if any  with regard to inequality in  education outcomes in basic and  higher education. And how can  we study it?  outcomes in terms of ah  performance. There's there's no  data yet. But outcomes in terms  of participation that you can  get from preliminary data you  can get from either the labor  for survey. Because that's done  quarterly. So you can monitor  what's happening more  frequently. And also to some  extent the annual poverty  indicator survey. But only up  to June two thousand twenty. Uh  Unfortunately, because of the,  based on the APS, you don't  really see any effect yet,  because, ah, ah, the APS was  conducted in July, when the  schools were having their  break. So when they were asked  whether they were enrolled or,  or not. Ah, or whether they,  they, ah, stop schooling  because of the, in, in the past  6 months. Ah, it, you cannot  really ah, capture yet, ah, the  effect of what happened during  the, in the following ah,  school year which is which was  when the main impact of the  pandemic occurred. Uh but again  just based on the observation  and also based on ah ah  preliminary analysis of the LFS  data. And just based on the  enrollment data that that that  was reported by by DepEd in two  thousand twenty. If I remember  correctly in K to 12, there was  a decline of about more than 2  million  ah, ah, or to, to skip  schooling, again, because of,  no, or, or poorer equality  access to remote learning. So  thank you Doc Jeff, for  answering that question. Again,  we invite our participants in  Zoom and in Facebook to ask  your questions. Uh at this  particular part of our program.  While we wait for that next  question. So allow me to throw  the the third question. Uh so  my question is after seeing how  the situation is right now. Um  what would you think would be  the urgent piece of legislation  or policy that would still be  doable as we close out the year  twenty twenty-two. With  respect, you know, minimizing  the adverse impact of COVID-19  on inequality.  So, I think I think their  ongoing efforts now in in  Congress. I I know that for for  example, there are moves to to  put in place unemployment  insurance. I think that that  will be a a big step, towards  improving ah social protection  for ah for ah lower income ah  households. and and definitely  if if there was unemployment  insurance in place, already, in  the country, before the  pandemic, the impact on poverty  and hunger will will not be as  bad. In other countries for  example, where unemployment  insurance was in place like,  some of our, Southeast Asian  neighbors like, Thailand, for  example, the impact of the  pandemic on, on, on household  welfare was not severe. So I  think, because that one's  already ongoing, the  unemployment insurance,  initiatives. I think that one  can be, ah ah pursued.  and and and related to the  earlier question of again there  there's not been a lot of  there's not been much of an  examination on on the on the on  the impact on the granular  impact of the pandemic on  enrollment. Uh perhaps now  there's more data by by DepEd  to see who who have dropped out  maybe some assessments of have  already been done as to what  was the impact on on learning  outcomes. And I I as soon as  possible ah  ah that may have occurred in  the learning of students during  the two years that ah they were  ah doing remote learning. So  either through ah tutorials ah  or or through ah ah  supplementary materials or even  on the job training. So I think  this should be ah done as  quickly as possible as soon as  possible so that ah this court  of students do not suffer the  long the long term impact of  the pandemic on their  productivity. So thank you Doc  Jeff for answering my question.  Now ah we have a raised hand  and I give the virtual floor to  Doctor Carl Handok of the UP  School of Economics. Doctor  Carl the floor is yours for  your question. Uh yeah, thank  you. Sorry, Jeff. I'm driving  and I'm malapit ng magcoding.  So, I'm taking the side  streets. So, again,  congratulations on the very  insightful presentation. I'm  really it's nice to know all  these things regarding poverty  and I have been crunching the  numbers myself And the curious  thing that I saw in your  presentation is that inequality  from 2018 to 2021 has decreased  spite of increasing poverty.  But  Poverty would have been higher  had ah you know poverty  incidents in Barm not  decreased. So there's a large  around 20 to 30 percentage  point decrease in  to ah income inequality. it's,  I, I'm curious to hear your  thoughts on the types of policy  that can sustain this poverty  this this huge poverty  reduction in farm. And if there  are any differences between  like, current policies that you  see which are in place and  other future policies which you  think can help sustain this. So  just curious to hear your  thoughts Jeff on this. Thanks.  Yan. Um I think that the the  large decline in in poverty in  farm it it merits further  examination. Uh I have not  looked at it deeply myself but  I think there's, I mean, I will  wait for the data, the, the  combined, the the the LFS data,  to see whether, ah, it's a,  it's a real change, it's a real  poverty decline, or something  more ah, artificial because of  some change in data. The only  possible thing that ah, I think  can account for, ah,  a larger decline in poverty  as  workers, agriculture, by giving  them ah lands. If they decide  to work as farmers.  So, yeah, nothing new, the  same, the same thing,  increasing the culture  productivity by providing the  necessary infrastructure  support, and also research and  development, and those things.  Thanks, Jeff. Thank you, Doctor  Andoc and thank you Doc Jeff  for answering the the question.  Um now we go back to the Zoom  chat as we have additional  questions. Uh we have a  question from Adrian Mitchell  Galano. How did COVID-19 affect  inequality in  to visit your, your doctors.  Especially the, the, the senior  citizen, because they were not  allowed to, to go out. This  means that, the only people who  can access, ah, ah, health care  were the people who who are,  who, who, who knew doctors, who  can call doctors, or later on,  who had access to ah, what do  you call that? Ah, ah,  telemedicine. Because ah in  late two thousand twenty1 ah,  the Department of Health  already made ah, tele  telemedicine more available. So  again, because, so, so the  pandemic affected the ah,  access to, to, ah, healthcare  in, in that way. That, that  poor households who had ah,  less access to communications  technology, were able to access  ah, health care less because  they couldn't access ah,  telemedicine  Thank you, doc, Jeff. So, in  the interest of time, we are  down to our last question. Ah,  so this last question is from  Mister Tommy Lazaro. So his  question is, which regions are  affected most by the impact of  COVID-19? And do we have  regions where the situation has  not changed at all?  At the height of the ah of the,  of the lockdowns, of course,  the most affected regions were,  ah, the regions where the,  where the lockdowns were  strictest. So these are NCR,  again, NCR, ah, Calabarson, and  also ah, Region three. But, but  mostly Calabarson and NCR. So  if you measure the effect, for  example, in terms of, ah, hours  work ah, lost. In terms of, ah,  ah, ah, full time equivalent  employment loss. The most loss  were in NCRN ah Calabarson. So  in that sense, ah, they were  the most affected regions. This  is also the reason why, ah,  when I showed earlier, the  contribution to ah, inequality  by region, the, the, the, the  contribution of, ah, of the,  between groups. Has ah, ah, has  declined. It's the within  region inequality that has  increased. The, the, the  between regions in inequality  has declined because ah,  relative the incomes of the  other regions, the incomes in  NCR and Calabarzon, they  dropped more. Or they dropped  by a bigger percentage. So  thank you Doc Jeff, and yeah,  thank you for, your  presentation, and thank you for  also answering those questions.  Ah, for those whose questions  weren't ah, asked in our Q&A,  ah, you can send them ah, via  email or to our social media  platforms and we will ah, send  them to Doc Jet. So that they  can also be answered. Ah,  eventually. So again, thank you  Doc Jeff. Now, I would like to  request the admin of the  Economics Department to kindly  start sharing the screen again.  So we would like to invite  everybody to our next webinar  Monopoly in Philippines Labor  Markets and its implications on  gender discrimination.

About the CCI-Hub:

The CCI-Hub is one of the main components of the “Global Partnership for improving the Food Cold Chain in the Philippines"" project, implemented by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) together with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines (DENR).

The Philippines’ Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) has been selected as an official partner of the project and as the national entity to host the CCI-Hub at its central office located in Metro Manila.

The CCI-Hub serves as the project's main platform providing an ecosystem of technical resources, training, knowledge sharing and stakeholder collaboration. Its main objective is to increase adoption of best practice refrigeration and related services as well as communication throughout the food cold chain and to ensure a long-term impact of the project.

About the “Global Partnership for improving the Food Cold Chain in the Philippines"":

One of the most pressing issues in developing countries is a faulty food cold chain, which results in massive food loss and underserved communities.

To address that problem in the Philippines, the project aims to identify, develop and stimulate the application of low-carbon, energy efficient refrigeration innovation technologies and business practices for use throughout the food cold chain (CC) to increase food safety and food security.   

It is funded by US$2 million from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), with US$25 million in co-financing (in-kind, grants and loans).

the beams bus this is the vaccine information management system uh vaccine administration which is uh being uh spearheaded by the dict together with the doh the gilg and even with the pnp yes sir we will be able to capture the different vaccinations in the different areas uh it will be blended initially as i mentioned it will be digitized for those who are uh more advanced but for the less advanced areas then they will this can be uploaded to the digitized form form that is being implemented and overseen by the ict or honor all right thank you no further questions thank you chertoff thank you madam chair good evening to everyone i just would like to ask this question with regards to the scheduling of the inoculation for those who will have their second dose secretary galvez earlier on reported astra seneca would be arriving by may and by the time we hit april all astrazeneca vaccines have already been uh given out so given the schedule of the second those six to 12 months six 12 weeks 12 weeks and the arrival of seneca by may i think uh do we have a schedule for the second dose or the strategy would just be we fire away for everyone for the first dose then we'll just wait and see for others to take their second dose mind you astrazeneca they're already four hundred thousand inoculated so what would be the scheduling and eight to thirty two days uh interval that's why there are already those who started the first week of march are already doing their second dose for the city we had reserved the second dose so of the 600 300 lanco and uh but for the astra seneca from kobach's actually that was uh expiring may 31 and given that uh the uh the benefits outweigh the risk uh and with the uh blessing of the wh so we decided to give the uh all the 525 time may or june the interval for the astrazeneca sir is six to 12 weeks and there are studies which show that the longer the interval between the first and the second those the better the immune response so we are con confident that the vaccine for the second dose for uh astrazeneca will come in uh may and uh later part of april and uh part of may and we will be able to give the second dose for honor we will we are expecting actually a uh bigger number of uh 900 000 doses so that will cover our toes that will be coming we will ensure that there will be uh reserve second dose already for uh we have to factor in the second dose of this uh vaccines uh astrazeneca and sinova if we could only get more of the j and j the johnson and johnson single dose what what do we have there buffett i think it would be more comfortable for everyone and they have not just been uh producing they're still doing the clinical trials as far as i know it has not even submitted an emergency use authorization but our vaccines are is doing a negotiation of how if it will be able to take some jnz vaccine sometime end of the year but it will all depend on the supply that will be available worldwide but i'm sure the secretary galvez will be able to i just would like that uh please explore that possibility of the jnj dose being a single dose it's more comfortable for our constituents [Music] and they will fall in line so i think uh we have to meet uh one million mark maybe this early april first week of april so we we could continue on so in madame chair i'm just very much concerned with the second dose uh scheduling and uh hopefully we could get more of the johnson and jones on single dose vaccine thank you thank you diaz eric um let's hope for that this uh sharon garin i saw your hand a while ago you are now recognized you have not the floor yes sharon well i just wanted to comment because it's because when we when uh secretary it's it's quite surprising for me that we're uh when secretary galvez presented the number of vaccines included there actually the private donations no and then we're actually including in our program in which the government is primarily responsible what we are expecting from the private affairs and in fact we even impose conditions on the private and how the private these private donors will will use their own vaccines parang the provisional property and under the constitution and you and your deprivation of property because we make them donate and we even tell them i mean as long as there are guidelines but i i understand it right they cannot do whatever unless the government finishes with their with their own prioritization i i'm not sure if i understand it right because everything we do we do for uh we do for the lowest of the economic device in the poorest of the poor and and all those that are compromised and everything but uh we keep on extracting donations and everything from the private sector but we should also give them the proper respect because it's dying and and i'll just continue with my comment mama um it's it's quite surprising for me actually in even four months ago but it's a year already one year anniversary at a time and we cannot be an ojp forever in this job many people are dying and uh it is our responsibility i mean the legislative but i feel responsible because this i cannot accept now this is the kind of country that i will leave to my son uh sana for the oh all the agencies let's i mean let's let's finish this this this pandemic and be proud of what we have done okay because right now i am not really proud of it and and that includes the work of this executive fight sign upon let's be proactive in mahavana manta is a mother i mean we can only do as fast as we can with the laws that we have delivered but it makes us feel like we need to intervene they are very adamant in our congressmen today because they they they do see it in the in the grassroots and they they feel it and they they feel responsible so santa paul let's work together in a minute and let's be more proactive because we have not done a good job this year thank you chair thank you um sharon um let's hear a comment from the oh you said rosette you have the floor thank you madam chair and good evening for our honorable congresswoman sharon garin first for um private sector naman hindi naman po sila fedding ma una they have to go through the tripartite agreement now why did government decide uh respond to this but during the initial stages of negotiations one of the primary objectives of government is not to create competition between government and the private sector that alumni attend at the private sector they have the funds so private sector national government and they cannot also procure at that level of funds that we have because pressure on private and higher and then when government buys objectives the competition will not be there ma una lang i think vulnerable and then private sector can read very well uh follow suit already and they can procure and uh do this uh inoculation among their employees so indonesian objectives we take note of the comments of the honourable congresswoman sharon green regarding the other factors in our response in government like contact racing and the others we're trying as much as possible very hard efforts already coming from all national government agencies just for us to stop the spread of these fires over to you madam chair okay thank you you said is there a follow-up question from representative charon green is there any question it's just that you know we we asked too much from them i think uh we asked them to donate and then we even put restrictions in there but uh you know it's no excuse you're trying hard try harder mom it's no excuse that we are failing and we are performing worse than the rest of the region uh we owe it to our people in the months ago uh trying hard then let's try double or people and i i see like a department of health who's not after the health of the country you know fda that's not you know willing to to give uh food and drug administration to his to the covet-related cases it's it's just a noise i don't understand okay thank you the next interpolator is congressman bonsantai you see around congressman bon sentai are you still around yup yup still here okay you have no no floor come on reset no mention jana there was restriction based on the on the on the part of the private sector because [Music] the private sector in the government sector did i understand it correctly now you know statement yeah uh you rossette can you please um repeat what you said or clark some clarification and that matter please damn chair uh good evening for congressman bonsantai uh yes sir that was one of the objectives why we had to do the prioritization framework and had to request from private sector that we finish first our first three sectors of our vulnerable before they can have their procurement for their vaccines although we all know that they have already pre-ordered and that they would start already by june 1. a prioritization we always ask for uh the private sector's help in everything a vaccine you never vaccinate in a manner of people who the god the national government are considering to be vaccinated in fact came from donations and not from purchases of the the national government and now all of a sudden when we realized can you please respond yes madam chair uh from the outset uh the private sector was not restricted to procure it was just a request coming from national government that the prioritization framework be followed that's why their procurement was scheduled in the middle of the year because that was the estimate of national government that we can be able already to start inoculating our vulnerable sectors so as of now illinois inoculating government sectors have we finished inoculating all our front liners our medical front liners for them you said marina you recognized you said marina you're recognized kindly and mute thank you madam chair uh honorable congressman the jobs that we have done is already 700 000 and we have uh finished almost 50 percent of our priority listed the a1 workers in front line health services uh just to clarify people healthy healthcare care workers these are the workers in frontline health services living in close settings [Music] no is i just like to give the response and then maybe you said near knock and add to the inputs but based on the framework that we have done the prioritization framework this is based on science and evidence and the prioritization framework is based on the fact that these people who we have prioritized are more exposed more vulnerable and has that uh uh increased probability of dying from the disease that's why we had health care workers and then senior citizens those with more bids the essential workers are on the fourth of our priority so ebik sabih and they are also valued in a scale constant exposure and nothing health care workers maslama taipong senior citizens when in fact the national vaccine deployment program's objective is for us to reduce morbidities and mortality so that we can be able to manage our health care system framework uh it's based on science but pero neon currently among the active coveted 19 cases in southeast asia number one filipinas with 124 680 so you know based on science that and specific surges that are happening because oh no no i'm not talking about the surgeries not their country there's there are there are increasing cases in other countries i'm talking about southeast asia indonesia which has a bigger population than the philippines has 22 326 we have 24 680. malaysia only has 14 19999 myanmar only has 7 397. thailand only has 1348 [Music] [Music] yes madam chair um i think there are implementation issues and we are really cognizant of that fact no specially for the local government's response so these are all contributing it's something that has to be done as a whole national government local government i should be able to step up para pumae iuspo natin so these are implementation issues and we constantly review that and try to address these uh issues a madam chair the actions were all based on science but uh after a year and uh and looking at where where we're at right now okay um thank you thank you fba and doh will um see to it that uh they will observe the timeline that we asked them a while ago um may we have the last interpolator um congressman kaloy zarate of bayern muna um first question though hello impossible seneca but they are not actually required so uh inaudible and private sector they will be required on vinilin and they will have to donate to the government [Music] that's my first question can you please yes as far as i know madame chair uh good evening for our congressman zarate as far as i know astrazeneca requires that the procurer or the private sector provide this assistance to national government uh maybe you said near enoch and elaborate on the other negotiations that are being done with themselves thank you 50 percent going to the national government but this came the initial talks were just a uh token from the private sector that they're willing to share their uh goods that they have procured to the national government uh i am not party to the supply uh agreement uh but uh yeah they were not forced into donating the 50 abolition range 20 50 80 but eventually they decided on 50 for the private sector but the fourth after the first batch i don't think it will be still the 50 to national government so it will deploy it will now depend on what will come out of the supply agreement between the doh the npf and the private sector install u50 thank you thank you a private sector so malabas this is just a mandatory token as part of the ongoing negotiation required under the law but private uh died as pointed out by the honourable guarana this is actually principally the uh duty and obligation of the national government to inaugurate [Music] private sector because they have the funds indeed despite the fact that uh available funds no those have been illinois but still a question uh private sector and lg snapping so i don't know if you say closet and or you suck me or not and comment on that um we were abandoned by the national government yes you have the floor thank you madam chair uh honorable azerati actually that's the main objective of national government uh to provide to all of the citizens of the country and even secretary galvez mentioned this to the private sector and the local governments do not spend for vaccines anymore you just spend for the additional logistical requirements so that we can have this kind of a rational funding for vaccines we can uh have some more assistance coming from you but of course we also understand the intent of the private sector because they would want to speed up uh vaccinating their employees so that they can open their uh businesses so you know but through a tripartite agreement but if we can have the choice to be inoculated by the national government and thank you i used to say madam chair national government federal you can also understand telugu the situation of the private sector while the other jurisdictions other countries are already ramping up their vaccinations face no we'll let them defy you know then the other day the private sector can uh procure vaccine a twin so it gives a false hope to the private sector uh directional millionaire private sector but that's that's contrary to the law on uh copyrighted vaccination act of 2021 then tripartite madam chair no comment yeah your honor i'm not privy to the discussions how about you sacrosanct uh we do not have a madam chair uh and honorable congressman zarate uh we apologize but i think we do not have any authority to uh comment on this after that statement that they can procure a twin uh the other chambers of commerce no officials of the chambers of commerce already say okay we will now i know uh uh inoculated healthcare workers or the others not even elderly people at this point previously it cannot be used with a senior citizens no and only extra seneca can be used to either help workers or senior citizens can you can you give us an update on this madam chair yes uh thank you madam chair in terms of the adverse events following immunization we are monitoring that and it is being reported the most common are young increasing blood pressure tapushing soreness and swelling at the at the injection at the injection site so monitor nothing and upon the worst case at this point just we have a surveillance and response team that is monitoring a common uh uh side effects uh of course there was a uh mention of a coincidental death if you heard the lupa case uh involved it is really being investigated all uh serious adverse events are supposed to be investigated and deported uh within 24 hours there's a response and is a team called the regional adverse event following immunization committee after the regional then it is raised to the national adverse event following administration committee that looks that further uh considers the causality that has been uh reviewed by the regional adversity owner uh thank you madam chairs uh last question uh [Music] it's not only the doas and the national government that is monitoring the adverse event even the drug companies for a part of their eu and that wraps up our discussions and the vaccine program oh we now go to the other matters congress kimbo i thank you um actually but i'm chair um but after 10 hours of listening to everyone i felt like um it's my duty to ask this um actually uh this has to do with the reporting methodology of the uh a few days ago on uh reported new cases was seven nine nine nine okay i can't remember conan pacha nyon but i remember the number it was seven nine nine nine anyway my concern is that i actually knew that it was going to be seven nine nine nine 24 hours before it got reported allegedly from someone from the uh saying that tomorrow the report is going to be 7.99 indeed the reported number of cases is 79999 so as a private citizen actually um i was crushed but again [Music] quote unquote in carrying over cases the average alibaba the total in two days is um ten thousand or down payment seven nine nine nine uh i guess you'll have to take my word but i really saw the text 24 hours before and uh having said that would you have an explanation for that i'd like to answer you each you suck mirna oh you suck a rosette kindly answer thank you madam chair and good evening again to congresswoman kimbo uh first uh the department of health has always been transparent with their numbers uh we have this major platform that we use the cprs with the povidkaya where it is only accessible by the different implementing units and we never did averaging whatever numbers would come out that is what we have reported since day one actually there was this time that even the office of the president called on us and they were asking if we were doing this because numbers were fluctuating during that time that our reports had not been managed yet or hindi so we did we do not do that we want to show the actual numbers per day now as to what you have said congresswoman stella and we we're trying to identify the source coming from our team from our kobe uh surveillance can quick action unit so we have implemented measures already starting from that day we have discussed this with our team and we have warned every one of them about this leakages that has happened for these past days and we know that sagrado amano mironaten and we do not want this uh initial information being shared already while we have not reported officially is so these are the things that we do but we have implemented measures where we have limited the access to data of our team we only have our data managers handling the data now hindi napuna mission the rest of the team and also the top line numbers that we have every day members for anticipatory actions at applying numbers would be me and the secretary and of course our director of epidemiology bureau so we use yeah yes ma'am if this thing happened if i saw the text hours before on the same day considered leaky on but i'm telling you i saw the text 24 hours before it was reported in fact i saw it even before the report for that day for the day before um was released so in other words seven nine nine nine was for march 29 alibaba even before the report for march 28 was released what time do you report uh we have this uh process where allah is let's start with what time do you report to the public six people four o'clock in the afternoon okay so and then so right before that um what's the penultimate step meaning what's the clearance you report to the secretary what time would that be uh it would be shared with me around two o'clock one o'clock in the afternoon for my client foreign number of cases nah echo consider for that day what time is the cut off quesadilla all the labs report to you right so i know surely there's a cut off he picks up him um but beyond that cut off he called considered and for the following day yes ma'am the process would be we extract at one pm and then we clean the data from one to seven pm seven pm at upline numbers and then the next day uh in ayushna young continue was the duplication validation for final three runs so the entire cycle is how many hours four that would be less than 24 hours 1pm from the previous day yes and then um there's like uh about 24 hours of processing yes and then it gets reported three hours later yes ma'am so what you're saying comment breach which i saw it 24 hours before it picks a bm i know i don't play mcdonald's when we had our sharing of our top line numbers because it's not always we were able to discuss with the team nobody wanted to say of course we tried to tighten the security uh among our staff already managers and what is our assurance that there is data integrity a well-merol validation system for this data integrity so you know for assured daily know that it is being validated there is the duplication there is also further verification with the implementing units all right yeah um are there are there other questions um constella oh thank you are there other questions from other members um i was reading the final report uh entitled the impact of the kobe 19 crisis on households for the national capital region of the philippines dated december 10 2020. by the economic policy research institute unicef umvp they did a survey of 3600 households and i was just concerned about the uh i think on the at the outset and the onset uh what were the i think the main questions were what were the main reasons uh based on the survey accordingly all of the filipinos interviewed were compliant but as counter check what they did was they interviewed also the neighbors and 3 out of 15 or 1 out of 5 reported that their neighbors were not compliant or violated so that's about twenty percent and which did not comply okay but eighty percent complied which is similar to the sws survey of september 2020 uh 20 80 one out of five complied which is why you compliance a nagging [Music] uh on the on whether uh that was the real reason or not because i i would rather believe in problem parenting apparently only us in congress does the weekly testing and i checked with other well of course other than probably hospitals government offices similar even the senate by the way i checked with the union the senate does not have a regular weekly testing even for those employees who have to report physically so findings is a question city where most of the government offices are located 67 i think the only reason i believe is because we do testing which is the concept of the if you're going back to work at least get tested once a week uh secondly um i was listening to the report of secretary galvez and two things struck me first well among other things he said vaccine security and it should be high time that we make our own and we do support that we have always believed that one of the requirements for a healthy health system is a strong system where we create our own vaccines ritm i believe was uh has the capacity but only on a very small scale uh level i think for tubercular in other vaccines and i think we we do believe that's an important component and secondly he mentioned green nationalization in integration of the field health system because when this was uh evolved in the development of our health system because this pandemic will definitely not be the last problem thank you very much at this point i'll now turn over a chair to our hardworking and beautiful chairperson uh representative angelina tan thank you vice chair uh representative sandra rigel so before we adjourn i would like to thank our members discuss no uh the whole components of kovid response to our treatment up to the discussion of the vaccination program and the most controversial one which needs action immediately is the issue on ivermectin manga resource persons uh yeah sorry i manifested that i wanted to make a manifestation okay very very quickly yeah so i just wanted to enjoy the doh to really look into using behavioral science as an approach to designing your public policy uh particularly on the issue of the vaccine and you know getting more of our constituents and more of our mahabhabayan to get themselves inoculated it's really about ascertaining i mean how our constituents behave and how to get them to follow and uh as a policy of making full use of our human resources particularly our creative industry sector so uh madam chair i just like to enjoy the doh to look into these two sectors uh from our creative industries for collaboration as you design this communication strategy for inoculation in the vaccine one is advertising i think they would be very very valuable allies as you come up with your taglines for the vaccine as well as the visuals that you're going to be cascading to the public and number two apart from advertising i would like the doh to look into communication design so it's a basically among uh graphic designers and graphic artists snap in the country and they're actually organized they're called communication design association of the philippines and these two sectors advertising and communication design would be valuable allies to the doh as you encourage more of our countrymen to get themselves vaccinated and just by working with these two sectors by extension you're also going to be working with the film sector the music sector and even visual arts so please please use vergara i echo and i kid you not i'm not uh making you bald or anything since i started this pandemic so please kindly look into these two sectors and uh finally there are two government agencies that i hope doh can look into uh collaborating with for your communications one is the design center of the philippines and two is item so they're both attached to the dti but they are largely untapped government resources who you can collaborate with because they have good networks in the private sector in designing the communication strategy uh for the doh because even if you have all these vaccines available and as we've heard in all these other lg use now the vaccines are there but there are no takers so like i said the experience of a seven percent uh vaccine confidence in my district it's probably not unique to my district maybe it's the same for many others that are out are outside of ncr plus and so i think that's something that we really need to work on inspiring confidence in the vaccine and doh kindly kindly used uh the most valuable assets that we have which is our creative constituents are our creative filipino people please enjoy their support so that you can also accomplish your objectives efficiently and effectively madam chair thank you great thank you doh please take note on uh the recommendation of uh vanessa i think uh and is screening 94 then we are planning we accord the philippine medical association is coordinating with the poor deport uh with the prc professionals professionals is in close coordination among with the department of health no recommendations uh kindly uh right uh to uh the doh and then we have we still have naman yousek mirna ah yusek mirna please take note on the recommendation of pma actually this region i'm in region 4a i was able to discuss that to our director that we partners with private health facilities because the afternoon vaccination of all the health facilities especially hospitals expedite our uh rolling out non-vaccination covering simultaneously and up to a3 or a4 in the coming months i think in the tama observation rural health unit another factor that we need to consider is assistance on transportation no at least in my district i uh i promised those at the oh those who are living in far flung areas now barangays will provide transportation support the owns scheduled uh priorities no members of the priority is now scheduled for vaccination so maraming problems that we encounter in the ground uh that doh should address regarding this uh vaccination program okay thank you so much for uh doc benny thank you for your time for and participation paul ah again on behalf of our speaker speaker will work hand in hand with the executive uh in order to uh assure not young gaps currently that we encountered in this coveted response will be addressed in terms of legislation but [Music] there's so much room for improvement on different aspects from testing contact tracing to implementation of vaccination programs and treatments no now um very critical for young like kannina's representation hospitals not and specialty hospitals and referral centers i hope that we were able to prepare no uh so i hope thank you congrats this meeting is now a joy thank you so much thank you hi everyone thank you paul thank you god bless everyone

[Music] ambassador philippine ambassador to the united kingdom his excellency antonio lagdameo sir uh oxford university in paramasiguro um as we said is in the forefront of international efforts for research and to develop a vaccine and oxford university gender institute and imperial college london is among the front runners in coveting vaccine development in the world as you know secretary roque our sub-technical working group or sub-twg on vaccine development of the interagency task force for the management of emerging infectious diseases is on top of efforts to look into possible partnerships with bilateral partners who have coveted 19 vaccine development in the advanced stage and also willing to locally manufacture their vaccines in the philippines the philippine government through this sub technical working group has been in close co-op collaboration with several countries and international organizations that are engaged in the development and manufacture possible povid19 vaccine and the philippines has had talks with some foreign vaccine rnd institutes and manufacturers who are ahead in the race for covid19 vaccine we have also the government has also signified its intent to participate in both the world health organization solidarity trial on vaccines in the gabi kovacs facility now uh our embassy here in london we have been in touch with the department of business energy and industrial strategy which is their government agency in the uk responsible for coordinating efforts to research and produce a vaccine and also with imperial college london to obtain more information on covet 19 vaccine development i have actually met three times in july august and september with the asean together with the asean london committee with minister of state nigel adams of the foreign commonwealth and development office to discuss the uk's vaccine development and access of asean member states to the uk's vaccines well in these meetings with minister adams he has always highlighted that the uk is making good progress in developing this vaccine but also emphasize that the uk government is cautious with its language and is trying not to over promise and under deliver on the date and commercial availability of the vaccine however he said there would also be a possibility that this vaccine will be available at the end of the year or the first quarter of 2021. he also repeated the uk's commitment in making the vaccine widely available and affordable [Music] for our part we also welcome well together with the asean ambassadors here in london the uk's one million pound contribution to the asean coveted response fund i myself shared that the philippines has created our department of science and technology vaccine export expert panel which is a group of technical experts and scientists who are tasked to identify evaluate and recommend possible vaccine candidates for the philippines as part of measures to ensure vaccine safety and efficacy by the way also secretary robert roque during this meetings of asean london committee with him minister adams profusely thank the many brilliant health workers from the philippines who are working in the nhs and he expressed sadness that some have passed away from covet 19 in the line of duty at the beginning of this covet 19 crisis um well as uh you know um the uh the trials uh of at oxford the vaccine trial was halted in early september after a participant in the uk displayed an adverse reaction it has since been claimed that the adverse reaction by uh experienced by the participant in the vaccine may not have been caused by the vaccine itself so they have cleared phases one and two for human trials and are progressing now to the third phase where it is being tested on a larger number of participants and well before the suspension the trial testing had been positive so the results of the trial showed that initial trials on 1077 british adults found that the vaccine induced strong antibody and t-cell responses which may further improve after a booster injection so this discovery is very promising because several separate studies have suggested that antibodies may fade away within months while the t cells can stay in circulation for years so so far the uk has already signed deals for more than 340 million doses of the vaccine so the total stockpile means that if the vaccines all work there will be more than enough for every person in britain to have fives most of the vaccines require two doses to be effective and well the uh they have assured us uh also that the uk uh well they have 48 million pounds to finance school vaccines for lower income countries and the world health organization has said that 172 countries and multiple candidate vaccines were engaged in talks about joining the initiative so they so they will uh they have promised that it will be available for for other smaller countries who are like us let's try again you secretly bet david which refers from the time frame and through now nothing minimum health standards classification framework so i think objective is to open up the economy safely it's also nothing to win uh we open the economy safely economy control transmission and adequate preparedness and capacity objective is we allow the predictability and sustained economic activity so we want to be more sustainable in our economy so parasitic objective number one of controlled transmission and average daily attack rate and two week growth rates transmission escalating is as much as possible we maintain the previous risk classification paracomas stay volume protocols in an ltu and then uh datipog inagawanaten every two weeks madrid declassified next slide for nothing uh elemento i am measuring transmissions average daily attack rate so uh volume probability that an individual will become ill within a defined population in a time period measuring two week growth rate it's an amount two week growth rate for i mean how quickly the number of cases are changing over a period of time so average daily attack rate so the higher the risk the higher your adar men average daily type rate the higher risk of infection by dimple 10 in two week growth rate from positive one to week growth rate to matassa non-two-week growth in a two-week growth rate so uh stabilization area whether minimal low moderate high or critical [Music] surveillance capacity community level core care staff contract tracing capacity tracing and isolation and your referral coordination so next slides health care utilization isolation beds facilities uh using data that they have in their own local government unit and then we come up with the final classification that is announced by our president so um step one is previous classification the next step for step two is foreign is we get the cross tabulation of the risk from the average daily attack rate and two week growth rate and then uh metadata information capacity at the minimum health standards so in this case for a proposal number for this area is still to maintain the risk classification of mgcq next slide on on the process back the thing pose a recommendation and classification i hope you can join us paul for the open forum [Music] media may have lots of questions no and finally secretary harry classmate thank you very much for

the national government or the deaf ed in order to alleviate the plight of these parents who are struggling to teach or to balance the teaching of the children using the modules okay thank you very a much question from tristarada of cnn philippines what does the palace think of doj's decision to start its corruption probe on bureau of customs bureau of internal revenue land registration authority and bpwh did they relay back at bodhito well fully supported [Music] investigated or will it be part of offices that will be investigated what can be any of this can this work goku be investigated or will it be part of offices that will be investigated [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] foreign my question is sound bite first on that and then second is is he still going to announce by your own final decision gcq status metro manila and some other places because when we had the press conference proposal appealed on 28th and the announcement the final decision what is the final decision uh and will will the president be uh announcing it or kaionapo well uh as we announced the president announced it's subject to appeal at least [Music] final decision [Music] advisory okay sir um marinpo on a monitor and i think interviewing you with one of the radio stations and then you said that the theater this is with regard to the price cup of the testing and then you said that the pwg has already finished its uh recommendation and it's up to the president to sign an order uh to impose a price ceiling on the testing cost first question sir is what is the proposal of the twg i know you're going to say that there are other available testing facilities but focusing on the people pwg recommendation what is the recommendation what is the price cap that they are suggesting to the president and is it important to put the price cap to cover testing [Music] i cannot preempt the decision of the president but what i can assure you is the tapos uh responsibility on the twg than the uh on paperwork's office of the executive secretary uh so it's safe to say sorry that we will impose a press cap from all indications and why is that and why up to 2000 [Music] um what is the inclination of the iatf and the government uh till year end you see you're opening up tourism tourist spots in terms of community quarantine do you think it would be safe for the government to just stay in gcq at least in those areas of economic activity we don't want to um rule out a change in classification for december depending on thank you very much joseph rachu yes sir our next question would come from a guy wearing two hearts today um boho news today and bohol balita daily news this is rick obedento sir yesterday the afternoon post a lot welcome sir afternoon attorney lucas and varquez and sir henry my question is that all people are facing restrictions one of these is the coffee hours the recently the provincial capital provincial government the governor the panel louisiana have given the leeway to the local government units municipalities and barangays to craft their own ordinance and implement that on different hours for example here in panglao they have 12 o'clock to 4 in the following day in table around 10 o'clock to five usually in the beginning we have an executive order nine in the evening to five pm but because some lgos claim that they want to go back especially here in panglao and other towns nearby towns because you know police tourism of course they are nighttime there are some the industry is for example the entertainers and the industry is already down what i mean is that the reason is already done so do you want to revive the economy so we have different coffee hours now do you think do you think that there is a need a uniform uniform for few hours because a lot of people i have interviewed they say that they are confused when they go this town there is there is that the nine to four in certain barangay into bigon about 55 from here there is eight eight in the evening to six so as an island do you think i don't know how to because the provincial government has given again the freedom to lgos to craft their own curfew hours because according to the governor as claimed by the mayors they know more the situation of their [Music] [Music] would you care to comment on the question giving the mayors the authority and the call since they have the discretion um over their areas uh when the mayor fails to provide a special um uh curfew or hours in his area then but we feel that nine to five is already the restrictive one so if they don't want to follow the nine to five size bini begin an opinion okay thank you governor um and before we continue cigarette question henry chu soy sir thank you very much for your hospitality um he is the owner of the uh helen resorts group of company employees we have two resorts here and uh we should be employing almost 1200 employees but because of this pandemic today we are only employing 60. or not and so my suggestion is this is more of an education to the boholanos and to our employees how we will not we will not be infected with this coronavirus because machado it has been tested in burrata in my pc we have only 30 to 50 arrivals from manila now in illinois almost here or not because they require also pc artists so this pc artist is very few people is willing first you have to pay four to five thousand and then uh the inconvenience the hustler went to the hospital of going to the whatever or what clinic so if this suggestion like for example sibo which is mgcq restriction because mgc q2 mdc is just the same so there should be no more restriction for more people to come and more people to come meaning more employees we can employ [Music] [Music] uh it is cheaper and the results are out by 10 to 15. it is being pilot tested perhaps testing we go back again to you secrecy yes secretary mj blanca floor of daily tribune question on kobe testing the department of tourism is appealing for a price cup on rtpcr and antigen tests to enhance tourism revival when will the palace issue the executive order for this release on price ceiling for kovid tests well as i said no that's for the uh final decision of the president already blanca flor questions on vaccines there are circulating text messages which claim that kovid 19 vaccines are being sold in uh philippines for fifty thousand per shot [Music] a resolution urging the executive department to support the campaign which seeks to suspend provisions under the trade related aspects of intellectual property rights she said the move will ensure universal access to affordable and safe kobe 19 vaccines will the palace heal her call it is a treaty obligation that we entered into in good faith which we have to comply with [Music] equitable and affordable vaccine okay um our next local question would come our next local question would come from a radio station this is dave responded the ytr uh we just want to follow up uh any update on the alleged corruption uh involving investigation on rd lto uh victor indeck uh sir pino bayana punatinyan [Music] the decision of the department of budget and management to tag the funds for a congressional initiatives in the 2020 national budget as for us for a later release he said even crucial projects in pursuit of the executive branch agenda had been left hanging due to the dbms policy any comment on this lopez the senate has released a summary of the statement of assets liabilities and net worth of the senators for 2019 will

https://facebook.com/yahoolifestylesg",2022-03-22,877,7,3,UCGFwGipBAxSdFQc43aCgr4g," So, the government has actually followed
the recommendations of the WHO in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic
by focusing on aspects like test, trace and treat. So with respect to testing, of course
we know that nobody actually had enough resources to make sure that there would be enough RT-PCRs available
for the number of people who needed the testing. And so, one of the things that had to happen
was to ensure that laboratory facilities would be available,
the reagents would be there and make sure that we had distribution
networks available so that different parts of the country
could access testing. With respect to treat, of course, there was a focus on making sure
that the staff were trained, we had enough people. The hospitals would have the facilities to be able
to isolate individuals who were infected with COVID-19, and that was a challenge,
which I think was quite well met. I think there was a lot of focus
on making sure that hospital-based care was going to be consistently available. So, a lot of effort was placed on defining the capacity of the hospital system with respect to
what would be allocated for COVID-19 beds, the kind of staffing
that was needed, making sure that there was enough supply of medications
and other personal protective equipment. However, with respect to tracing,
we know that we would have wanted more resources directed towards that, but there were efforts to get it online. Efforts continue.
But I think we can do much better. We keep hearing about contact tracers,
ending their contracts. And I think that just goes to show
that this was not really embedded into the infrastructure. The public reaction to some policies
has been mixed. The mixed reactions generally come from people not being able to understand the context about certain policy directions. So, I think a lot of effort really needs
to be invested in communicating with the public, talking to them about why certain things are being done and what the expected outcomes are. There have been some policies
that have really been supported by the public like, whenever there's a surge, people are really looking forward
to an announcement that a community quarantine would be implemented.
But for certain other policies, like right now, there's this discussion about No Vaccination, No Ride
or mandatory vaccination in the workplace. Those are obviously going into the realm
of affecting personal liberties. So, there are no easy answers to that. I think this needs to be
a matter of continuing dialog. I think if people feel like their reasons
are being heard, that they're being given options, then we’ll probably get
a better reaction from the public. So whenever there's a discussion about getting a policy online, a lot of it typically has to do with
how do you make sure that people are allowed more mobility
without increasing the risk of transmission? So, for example,
with the No Vaccination, No Ride policy, the considerations included the need to allow more people
to access public transport but at the same time realizing that we had limited options available. But we have to also think about
are we actually allowing or are we actually able to provide everybody with the opportunity
to be vaccinated already, has access been equal? So maybe when we get to that point,
we can say that the only reason why you're not vaccinated
is because it's your choice. Then, a policy like that might make more sense. So, on the question of whether the IATF has been effective in actioning COVID-19 mandates, I think it's useful to have a structure like that because you have the key people, the key decision makers available within the group so that the communications don't have to go across
so many different levels and you can actually get that plan online
in the shortest possible time. I really got to appreciate the fact that you had
all of these decision makers available at a single time conducting a discussion
on various aspects of key issues. But I guess we're all still learning about this pandemic
until now, and I think the
the real issue is that we can only work on or make a decision based on what's available
in terms of the knowledge at that time. We know that the IATF actually is in charge
of crafting policy, and the implementation is taken care of by a lot of the different agencies
and the local government units. So, I think it would have helped if there was more input from the LGUs. Of course, they're represented in the IATF
but there are so many different LGUs with different capacities
and different realities on the ground, and I think that's really a problem. So, maybe in those instances
where people think that the response was not adequate or could have been improved,
I think, maybe one way to think about this if you consider the context,
was that the best possible decision at that time, and I'd like to believe
that usually the answer is yes. So, with respect to the core strategy of the IATF, I think if you look at how
they've been making their decisions, the goal has really been to make sure
that we have the least number of deaths, and this is the same goal
that many different countries have. And at the same time, balancing this need with respect to healthcare outcomes with the need
also to make sure that we have a working economy. So, that's a difficult balance
to achieve, actually. Any new administration that comes in will need to be able
to get the public to buy into their policies by making sure that communication is a focus. So, I think the new administration
can focus on two critical things. First is investing in the telecommunications
infrastructure that supports healthcare needs. We want to be able to count on information
technology, to capture data, to record data, to share data. I mean, if you think about the way
our vaccine records are constructed now, something very simple
doesn't need second thought, but it's a struggle for us to get that information
into the hands of every individual. I think it's also going to be very important
for the incoming administration to think about how they can better support
healthcare professionals. So, make sure that the people who are already here
get what's due to them, and also make it more attractive for people
who are thinking about a career, to consider healthcare professions
and staying to help the country. One of the solutions is really to make sure
that universal health care is implemented. With that, a patient can expect that at any point in the system, there's going to be a way for them
to get their needs addressed. And so, if we can fast track implementation of this system, make sure people can access it, then we can expect
that there will be a more efficient solution to the continuing demands of COVID-19
and all these other healthcare problems. So, in comparison to different countries
in the region in Asia and even globally, I think one of our big pluses
has been keeping our mortality rate low. I think this is really a tribute
to how well our healthcare professionals have been able to manage the cases
that come their way in the hospitals. But I wish we had the resources
that other countries had with respect to tracing, because this would really have been able to limit
the cases that we've had to deal with and allow this to focus
what resources we had on the more severe cases. I think our healthcare system will do its best to handle
another large scale outbreak, based on the response of our healthcare
professionals. I don't think we can count on many more beds
being available or more resources being available, and as much as I wish that we had more people, that's going to take time to train. But I think the public can always count
on best effort from healthcare professionals to carry us through any crisis. So, from what I've observed, our government's plan to exit
the pandemic is pretty similar to what other governments are thinking about doing,
shifting from a pandemic emergency response to a mindset that thinks about COVID-19
as something that will stay and learning to live with it
to the best extent possible. So, just thinking about how you deal with other diseases that continue
to be a problem like dengue or measles, life doesn't stop
because those diseases are around. We just need to be able to figure out
how to manage them while allowing people the mobility
that they need to be able to function in society. So unfortunately, COVID-19 is a lot more contagious. So, we need the help of all of these public health
measures that we can put online so that we can contain it, at the same time
allowing people to move around. So, the new government
can think about how to make what we do now more efficient in the effort
to be able to live with COVID-19. If you think about public transport, for example, there can be a lot of interventions
about making sure that it's less crowded and we make it less likely that people who take
public transport are going to catch COVID-19 as they go about their daily routines. We can talk about making sure
that regulations are in place so that air quality is much, much better,
and people don't have to give it a second thought that they might get COVID-19
just by being out in public. So, when we think about when the Philippines
is likely to return to normal, I feel like there are two important issues
that need to align. First, we need to get people,
more people to be vaccinated, and then second, we need to get the virus
to cooperate and not mutate any further so that the protection that we can expect
from vaccines continues to be in place."

About me:  My name is Teacher Gio to my students and Gio to my friends. I left the USA over 4 years ago to travel SE Asia and live a better life.  Follow my journey as I travel around The Philippines reviewing different islands and cities.
My channel: Reviewing different islands and cities in The Philippines as places to visit or live, condo and apartment reviews, dating advice, how to travel and live inexpensively in The Philippines.",2021-01-20,7826,,120,UClMlXTxpTNMZRE4AEjlc5RA, okay guys so we're back at it today is january 20th 2021 got some more news coming out of the philippines and some news internationally about travel even if you have the vaccine what it's gonna look like stick around okay here we are guys back to another news update we're going to touch briefly on things going on in the philippines and go on to some more international news that has to do with the philippines as well and also just internationally when you're traveling about first thing first coven 19 death toll in philippines passes ten thousand um i'm not going to get into the whole article and everything i'm just going to leave it at that okay next up philippines to buy 20 million modern of vaccine doses as covid 19 cases rise yes cases here have been rising i've noticed every time i turn on the news i see cebu going up in cases hopefully things aren't heading back towards another strict lockdown in cebu we'll see what happens as of now i haven't seen anything um but they're aware of what's going on but this is good news because with the whole chinese uh vaccine thing with the 50 effective uh effectiveness and a lot of doubt a lot of people don't want anything to do with these chinese vaccines even the in the philippines here so that's pretty good news again all these articles are going to be down in not in the description but in the comment section um i just have too much stuff already in my description to put them there uh next up uh they found uh i think it was last week they found one person in the philippines who had come back um from overseas i think uh the middle east and they had the new strain that had been found previously in the uk and now they found out that uh i think maybe seven more or eight more people that were on that same flight also have uh that new strain as well so it's now stating the 13 who had contact with the filipino with the new variant test positive for covid19 the original person just had uh or or was asymptomatic um but it look looks like they have tracked it down but um who knows if this thing is out and about and spreading now we'll see um another news article um it just keeps getting better i tell you uh talking as bad as coughing and spreading kovid 19 indoors research suggests however if you're wearing a mask and we'll see how it would make a difference unsafe to stand without a face mask two meters away from an infected person who is either coughing or talking so i guess if you think you're talking to somebody and you guys are within two meters of each other that's not safe um yeah again i'm not going to dive really deep into these articles too much okay so here's where we start to get interesting we got uh emirates and i don't know how to pronounce that somebody can correct me i'm gonna butcher it etihad etihad airways chosen to trial coven 19 travel pass so here we go we were talking about this possibly coming about and here we are travel pass is an app that allows travelers to manage certifications for any kovid 19 tests or vaccinations a traveler may have taken here's a look of the features of the app itself and further information on the first rollout of the newly designed mobile application um so i i want again i'm going to leave this down in the comments but interesting interesting for sure but it gets more interesting you'll see in a second here and then we also have american airlines launches health passport for international travel to the us so with the new u.s testing requirements set to come into effect later this month i think it's the 26th somebody can correct me if i'm wrong they will become the first carrier to introduce a health passport for inbound travel into the country airlines will be launching its verifly app for passengers to utilize to confirm testing and other coven 19 travel requirements for their flights to the us beginning january 23rd here in the video is where i plug uh one of my affiliate links and not just because i do make a small bit of money from it at no additional cost to you but it's just the way it is now uh it's probably going to be mandatory almost everywhere that you travel to that you have to have travel insurance i kind of like travel insurance anyway a little better than even if you just have a health insurance plan because it covers you for trip interruption um you know theft things like that that normal health insurance is is not going to cover that additional stuff so links are down in the description guys uh for the travel insurance so get your quote today uh moving on here's here's the part um that cracks me up because even in the philippines i had previously reported and told you about a news article where the philippines says even if you've had the vac vaccination guess what when things do open up you're still going to have to be tested you're still going to have to quarantine when coming into the country so i know a lot of people were waiting on it and saying hey i'm going to go ahead and get the vaccine even though a lot of people may not have wanted to get the vaccine but they thought by getting the vaccine that they could it was uh an instant uh way to get into a country and now we're finding out that it's really not doing a whole lot of good if your intention was getting it to travel um and here we go vaccinated travelers will not be exempt from travel restrictions there you go so being vaccinated won't be the golden tickets travel yet there has been a lot of talk regarding immunity passports and preferential treatment regarding travelers who had been vaccinated but now leading health authorities and governments are sounding the alarm this may not be the case in 2021 and this is why i have said that i don't think the philippines is gonna open this year i really don't um i know a lot of you hate me for that i'm sorry but i'm just being a realist after being um optimistic so much of last year i kept thinking okay it's going to open up next month this can't go on much longer and uh what happened here we are in 2020 uh i keep getting confused 2021 january already in almost in the books and nothing has changed whatsoever in fact the only thing that's changed is we have new strains coming out that have made it even uh worse as far as uh it's spreading and vaccines are rolling out but here we are it's it's not uh helping any as far as a travel goes so again recent events over the last couple weeks have shown that those who have been vaccinated may not see any benefits this year when it comes to travel restrictions being lifted so i don't want to tell you to write off the philippines for this year that is not what i'm saying i'm still being a little bit optimistic that it could possibly open maybe after the summer maybe in the fall maybe the last quarter i don't know guys i don't know your thoughts and comments uh go ahead and comment down below let me know what you feel i did a poll the other week and most people feel like it's not gonna open until 2022 now it's not any kind of official poll it really doesn't mean a whole lot other than what you guys think personally um so yeah again all these uh articles will be down in the comments section i always list them down there and uh just let me know what you guys think so what's going on with me lately um i've announced this uh in several videos in my live stream geo in the philippines is going to start to um pull back a little bit i'm not really going to concentrate on this channel as much as i used to i will come out with the news updates um i will come out with a live stream once in a while most of my content is now only going to be available with a youtube membership or over on my patreon account those videos are basically duplicates the one that goes on patreon the one that goes on youtube membership probably the same so either one you join your part of the action and that's where i'm going to concentrate most of my videos and i'm working on other projects that have made me just a lot busier guys and i just don't have time i also feel like the philippines with it not even opening up possibly this year i think less and less people are that excited about watching stuff on the philippines other than news updates now because realistically they know they probably aren't going to get here this year and we're just in january um latin america central america you know south america uh other different island nations uh even out here you could possibly get into thailand indonesia and at a at a later date here in the near future i think um what else maldives out here but other than that there's not a whole lot going on maybe sri lanka i think i heard but other than that everything else really is central america south america islands that she can get into australia is already coming out saying they probably won't even be able to leave australia or travel uh until 2022. okay so uh that's the news update and uh we really touched briefly on the philippines and went more into international this time around and just an update of what's going on at you in the philippines channel appreciate guys uh you watching as always i appreciate it so much don't forget to hit the subscribe button and hit the bell notification that way you are updated every time a new video or a live stream comes out and uh hit the thumbs up i do appreciate it guys and i'll see you next time [Music] i know you're on a road

Feel free to share but do not re-upload.",2020-09-01,45726,,76,UC3XaG-7UVi2vD8ZZEMNnnpw," THE TUKLAS LUNAS PROGRAM  OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, WE HAVE A LIST OF MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED PLANTS THAT,   THROUGH ORAL HISTORY,  WE KNOW HAS PROPERTIES  TO CURE VARIOUS ILLNESSES. WE DISTRIBUTED THESE PLANTS TO UNIVERSITIES WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE TUKLAS LUNAS PROGRAM OR THE DRUG DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. IN THIS PROGRAM, WE ASSIGNED PLANTS THAT THEY WOULD STUDY ESPECIALLY PLANTS ABUNDANT IN THEIR PLACES. ALMOST TWENTY UNIVERSITIES ARE INVOLVED IN THIS, AND THE FIRST THING THEY DO IS TO STUDY, THEY WOULD IDENTIFY AND EXTRACT THEY WOULD CHECK THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS. AFTER THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS, THEY WOULD TEST FOR THE TOXICITY AND THE HARMFUL EFFECTS. AN EXAMPLE IS THE ASTHMA PLANT, WHICH HAS AN APPROVAL AS A HEALTH SUPPLEMENT PARTICULARLY FOR DENGUE. HOWEVER, SINCE IT WILL BE USED FOR A DIFFERENT ILLNESS SPECIFICALLY COVID-19 IT STILL NEEDS AN APPROVAL FROM THE FDA FOR CLINICAL TRIALS THE FIVE-LEAVED CHASTE TREE HAS BEEN REGISTERED AS A REMEDY OR A MEDICINE FOR COUGH AND RELATED RESPIRATORY AILMENTS OR SYMPTOMS. BUT THAT IS APPLICABLE FOR COUGH IT STILL NEEDS CLEARANCE FROM THE FDA THE TRIAL FOR THE FIVE-LEAVED CHASTE TREE IS READY THEY ARE PREPARED, WE HAVE FUNDS FOR THE TRIAL, THEY ARE READY FOR THE CLINICAL TRIALS, THEY HAVE THE APPROVAL FROM THE ETHICS BOARD. THE STUDY ON VCO STARTED IN THE LATE 1990s  THE LATE DOCTOR CONRADO DAYRIT CONDUCTED THE STUDY. HE CONDUCTED TRIALS ON HIV PATIENTS IN SAN LAZARO. THE ONGOING CLINICAL TRIALS ARE CONDUCTED IN TWO PLACES ONE IS AT THE PGH AND THE SANTA ROSA COMMUNITY HOSPITAL. AT SANTA ROSA THE TARGET SAMPLES ARE 90 PATIENTS. OUT OF THE 90 TARGETED PATIENTS, WE ONLY HAVE 30 PATIENTS. WE HAVE DIVIDED THE SAMPLES FIFTEEN ARE TAKING VCO, WHILE THE OTHER FIFTEEN ARE NOT TAKING VCO OVER 28 DAYS. ALMOST HALF OF THE PATIENTS WENT HOME AND WERE CURED OF COVID-19. WE JUST NEED TO STUDY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF VCO. VCO, ASTHMA PLANT,  AND FIVE-LEAVED CHASTE TREE  HAVE ANTI-VIRAL PROPERTIES OR LET’S SAY ANTI-BACTERIAL PROPERTIES. IF WE LISTEN TO SUGGESTIONS FROM PEOPLE, SOME ARE RECOMMENDING VARIOUS PLANTS LIKE TURMERIC, MORINGA, ALTHOUGH I HAVE NO IDEA IF THESE CAN CURE COVID-19.

the humanities and social sciences south africa swedish research council for health working life and welfare sweden ministry of science and technology taipei taiwan and korean social science research council republic of korea british council and as far as our multinational corporations are concerned they include eu india platform for social sciences and humanities and we are soon going to enter into a collaboration with the european commission also and we are part of the international organization which are united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco association of asian social science research councils international science council and science council of asia uh as dr purchase very rightly sad that it is first of the three webinars that we have planned to take place in the month of october november and finally in december with which we are launching our collaboration and the topic that we have chosen is very much related to the the problem that the entire world has been facing since november december 2019 so we are beginning with stories from social science communities in india and the philippines and the kobe 19. the next conference the next webinar will be taking place on social protection and i'm very very happy to share with you that in the month of april may icssr gave a call uh on kobe 19 itself we received almost 1200 proposals against the calls and taking cognizance of that united nations also included us and i made icssr to co-chair a social protection steering group created to advise on the development of a united nations research road map for the program 19 which is to be commissioned by united nations and uh it was to be launched at the u.n general assembly uh talking about the major concerns uh we know that there are more than 38.7 places in the world nearly 0.5 population of the entire world so far has got infected by the disease if i talk in terms of the death it includes almost more than a million deaths now which is 2.8 percent of the total infected population whereas 19 million population has nearly recovered from the disease a number of countries have got their own stories in terms of the the proportion of population getting infected by the disease then the death rates itself the recovery rate itself and there have been important issues related to vaccine development of vaccine or medicine for the disease and number of social science issues pertaining to economy at national sub-national and global level supply chain number of psychological health related issues problems related to continuance of education right all those issues have been flagged so i would not like to stay much between the audience and the very learned speakers that we have for today the another prime concern that economies or the societies have talked about are related to the proportion the populated population getting infected by this disease and the the death rate of the population the health infrastructures within societies and the nation which have been cause of concern as far as india is concerned at this stage 0.56 percent of the population which is at 7.3 million people have got infected and our death rate thus far has been 1.52 percent and 111 000 people have died because of the disease i was looking at the statistics for philippines also nearly 0.3 percent of the population has got infected and as far as death rate is concerned it is around 1.8 and then there are number of countries in asia europe and other parts of the world also i was looking at the statistics for mexico also which is one among the worst sufferer in terms of the death rate where death rate stands at 10.2 percent at front date so with these words i welcome all the contributors today and also the audience which has joined us i'm told that number of collaborators of icssr from all over the world have are also joining us number of research institutes of icsr and their faculty have also joined and got themselves a register and i am told that a lot many academicians researchers and research administrators from philly points have also are also joining us on this afternoon so i leave it to professor guha in fact to take the proceedings further and start with the presentation thank you very much thank you very much i think dr aguha hi i am if that if it does not happen to you then you all must probably not be living in the philippines thank you very much dr portus and dr malhotra for for this initiative of bringing together these two countries today's webinar will inquire into perspectives and covet 19 responses of the governments and social scientists in india and the philippines as mentioned by during the welcome this is brought to you by the philippine social science council and the indian council for social science research the indian council for social science research provides grants for projects fellowship international collaboration capacity building survey and publications and others to promote research in the social sciences in india it was established by the government of india to promote research in the social sciences meanwhile the philippine social science council is a non-profit organization of professional social science associations in the country doing social research and also includes in such institutional material instructional institutions in the country it has 14 regular member associations representing the varied social science disciplines and around 40 associate member institutions in the country to start with our conversation today may i present to you our first speaker who is a popular person in the country both in the in the public discourse and in the media he is a medical anthropologist by profession he is a professor emeritus at the university of the philippines in diliman quezon city and in addition he is a clinical professor with a with a college of medicine at the university of the philippines in manila where he directs a graduate degree program in medical anthropology and lectures with graduate program in genetic counseling and in bioethics he's also an affiliate faculty of the college of science and with the tri-college philippine studies program both in the u.p dilemma our resource speaker has also served in local and international health committees in the department of health of the philippines the world health organization and has been a consultant with the various organizations including the unicef danida european union the ford foundation the rockefeller foundation in 2012 our speaker was appointed as a national academician and a member of the national academy of science and technology which is the highest advisory body to the government on science and technology his appointment as national academician includes a citation that summarizes his commitments and quote his scholarly work provides the foundation for his social development advocacy and policy development work which he sustains by ensuring that scientific knowledge is effectively communicated to various stakeholders including policy makers community development workers health professionals and the general public ladies and gentlemen join me in welcoming dr michael tan from the philippines doctor thank you dr agua and a minute i'm trying to okay can you see the powerpoint yes okay i'll go ahead i'm not able to do a slideshow on this computer but uh i think it should be readable so let me it is treatable right dr portus yeah it is okay yeah so let me uh proceed we're under a bit of time constraints both doctor just be learning myself unfortunately but i promise he might get this done in 15 minutes no okay i i chose to talk about governance culture and kobit 19 in the man uh kobe 19 management philippines i thought this was the best way of dealing with one of the more important [Music] okay is dr tan there dr tan you're not uh i think we lost you i'm sure it will not take very long time for dr tan to join us again dr portus yeah um let me see is dr greg around also is he also having a problem you know i'm not having a problem yet let's uh take a dr tan i'm sure he's lagging in now uh this is the kind of internet connections we have here in the philippines i'm not sure whether the same thing is happening in india also so we always have a joke in the philippines if you are not cut off on the air or if you don't hear uh sound of animals on the background then you are not from the philippines yes dr tan i think is back okay i'm back yes thank you very much go ahead dr tan thank you am i getting through yes sir yes sir yeah so let me tell you i'm sorry about that no yeah i don't think i should repeat from the start i just wanted to point out that one of the problems we have oh no there's a notice that saying connection's unstable is that the management of mid-19 the philippines has been controlled pretty much by the military uh most of the people in the interagency task force are men and many of them are military men and uh this can be problematic now let me see uh i'm sorry again okay and we're talking about very punitive quarantine rules now that we're in force so for example uh in some urban poor areas residents were not allowed to even sit in front of their homes that was said to be a violation of the rules children and the elderly were the most affected but so too were migrants and temporarily stranded individuals people were not from manila and what we're really talking about is governance without cultural competence and this was shown uh this is an example in may when they actually sent armored personal carriers into one of the barangays in tondo at barangay's village as well as some 200 police on on motorcycles and this is to implement the quarantine rules and to do mass testing i think this is the height of cultural incompetence because after that people were so fearful of quarantine and of mass testing and then of course people were arrested for violating rules they were kept in the gyms at least there was some distance thing that was uh enforced in here i'm sorry here uh yeah and the problem of course is uh combined with the with with the punitive measures were of course impunity there were double standards they've been exposed in the mass media uh of officials being very very strict but from within their own ranks breaking the rules i don't need to elaborate too much on there what was particularly disturbing was that if anything was being quarantined it was quarantined into civil libertation on top of all those lockdown violations was a growing quarantine on civil liberties a new law an anti-terror bill has been passed that allows warrantless arrests and detentions the country's largest media network has been closed down supposedly for breaking some laws around foreign equity journalists and others critical of the administration have been arrested sued or killed and i and this just happened this week a very tragic convergence if you look at the covid19 discourse and what's happening elsewhere an urban poor activist reyna nasino was pregnant when arrested uh some months back her child river was born july and separated from her after a month those are the rules in the philippines and the child died this month of pneumonia separated from the mother reina was granted the three-day furlough to be with the child at the wake and the funeral but this was modified to three hours at the wake on wednesday yesterday and three hours for the burial which will be tomorrow this picture i thought was atrocious she was at her daughter's wake they brought her in in ppe because they said that she might pick up the virus and bring it up to the j to the detention centers but look at her she was in handcuffs no is this the way you go about consoling someone who has lost a loved one all of this of course has been in the name of kobit 19 the kobe 19 emergency yeah despite a relatively east early response we have southeast and east asia's highest number of defections forty four thousand reported infections and six thousand deaths with the continued increase of between one thousand five hundred to four thousand cases each day and then people's response a recent nationwide public opinion survey from pals had a 20 91 trust rating for the president up four points from the last survey leading many social analysis analysts including the polling firm itself to wonder what exactly was just what's going on it's interesting that halfway across the world that's our president his fellow populist brazilian president bolsonaro also known as the tropical trump uh whose kobe 19 policies have been as bad as the u.s presidents reach his highest approval ratings in august at 37 of course trailing far behind duterte but to still considered very high for brazil an analyst proposed that people were content because they had received financial assistance so too in the philippines one of the explanations there about the high approval rates for the president was that one tranche uh that took three months to be distributed perhaps help his ratings even if this tranche was accompanied by allegations of corruption so much so that the national government itself decided to remove the second tranche distribution from local government officials my point here is that populism puts people in power and it has actually been fairly easy for such leaders to keep a country hostage by fears and promises of redemption through authoritarian governance and this is why i wanted to give this narrative to suggest that we really need to interrogate some of the measures that have been banded around there is a global health security index that was produced last year trying to look at the preparedness of various countries and if you look at their criteria they're all biomedical you talk about pathogens about epidemics about a robust health sector commitment to improving national capacity and financing and adherence to norms and these are fine and yet if you look at this look at these five criteria should it be surprising that at the top of the global health security index meaning these were supposed to be the countries that would be the most prepared for health emergencies united states united kingdom netherlands australia and canada and we know of course the u.s is now in uh has one of the biggest problems with kovit 19. the uk is not that much better off uh i gave number six to ten as well just something to think about i think we social scientists have to look at uh the many factors that come in and yes they rank they're quite high and some of them are doing very well but some are not doing well at all the landsat medical journal uh the kobit 19 commission issued a very interesting statement recently that gives 10 priority actions to deal with kobit 19 again heavily biomedical but at least they refer now to the need to protect vulnerable groups which i understand is going to be the second webinar that pssc and the indian council be holding they refer to long-term financial reforms and justice in the access to tools to fight kobit 19. missing in the global health security index and in the landsat statement are references to culture and to governance as well as the culture governance interface as we see in the interactions of popular leaders populist leaders and citizens so my point here is that we need more qualitative research agendas that capture the full picture that allow more voices to be heard and that are analyzed with an understanding of the power relations that affect the research responses meaning the survey responses i suggest that it's time to to bring back raymond williams structures of feeling way way back in 1954 mainly used by arts and humanities but i could keep thinking that in relation to kobe 19 we might want to talk more about gathering narratives that capture those structures of feeling which refers to the different ways of thinking dying to emerge at any one time in history it appears in the gap between the official discourse of policy and regulations the popular response to official discourse and its appropriation in literary and other cultural texts i've argued that we should be looking at all the different representations of covid19 including cartoons including jokes including songs which might be better at this point to pick up the public opinion that people have we need as well to document examples of kovic 19 management that are both compassionate and scientific reports have come out about women's leadership throughout the world countries that are headed by women seem to do much better and i think also in the philippines despite a rather dismal situation there have been local officials mayors and governors that made the difference because they had the heart you remember passing mayor when public transport was closed down he suggested that he could bring out the tricycles so he looked for ways to help the poor when they lost a loved one he arranged things with with general parlours for free cremation their narratives are really part of the structures of peeling that transform and that are transformative thank you and good afternoon thank you very much dr tan for the very interesting presentation and up to date presentation actually what's going on in this divide of the philippines importance of governance cultural sensitivity developing more discourses in other forms and of course the need for compassionate and scientific work that we have to do thank you very much for reminding us of the tradition of the social science to now let us hear an insight and reaction of dr grigorio del pilar dr del pilar is the president of of the national research council of the philippines and the chair of the nrcp division of social sciences with roots from bulacan in central luzon dr del pilar is popular among the scholarly circles as an advocate for the use of filipino as a medium of instruction and in the daily professional communication he has supported the use of filipino as language in research and translated mainly of his research work in filipino his namesake dr del pilar is associated with a philippine hero general his great grand uncle dr greg obtained his a b psychology from the university of the philippines  laude and his doctorate in differential psychology mentioned tres honorable avec felicitacion pardon me for my french from the university de paris nanteri in 1998 he served in the executive board of the world association of personality psychology and he's a fellow of the pambansang samahanza and the psychological association of the philippines ladies and gentlemen join me in welcoming dr greg del pilar dr greg please i am an advocate of the use of filipino in academic discourse and as well as in everyday discourse in government and in education and for this reason uh well that means that i've been delivering my dogs you can hear my that only dogs that you are really from the philippines broadcasting now it's okay dr greg oh goodness well we were having uh dr dan and dr aguha both uh fell off the air and now my dogs are raising such a ruckus out in my carport very nice background yes well hopefully they will quiet down a little while anyway um so yes this is uh i welcome this opportunity to speak in english once again i miss it sometimes not too much but here we are okay you're still audible uh dr greg they're coming very good okay so you can hear me despite your background all right yes good thank you okay i am a personality psychologist and so therefore even if i am the chair of the division of social sciences and the national research council of the philippines which encompasses the uh 13 different very comprehensively the different disciplines in the country my comments will be naturally colored by my background as a as a psychologist i will first i would like to comment on the puzzling findings that dr tan mentioned regarding our president duterte president duterte and bolsonaros and brazil bolsonaro but first before i do that i would like to well uh um dr tan's reference to raymond williams uh work on structural feelings is not something i'm very familiar with but what it has recalled what i recall on the basis of that uh of his brief discussion on it is something from from freud i i clear my throat there because i know that uh even among psychologists uh today psychologists freud sigmund freud is not the most popular however despite what we might say about his theory the fact of the matter is that there are aspects of freudian theory that have been verified by very rigorous experimental methods i am referring i am referring to his theory of the unconscious it has been shown that uh a lot of psychological processing really takes place at the subconscious level and we know from personal experience that we have very we are able to verify we can see uh intuitively this makes sense to us because we know for example that it is true that we can sleep on a problem usually if we are preoccupied with a problem or it happens quite often that when we are preoccupied with a problem we sometimes are able to resolve it after after sleeping on it and this is the reason why we have that expression sleeping on a problem and we do know that some important scientific discoveries have come about as a result of dreams in other words our minds continue to function at a subconscious level even as we are not aware of it and even as we sleep all right that's number one and then other than that uh we also are familiar with experiences of suddenly having a feeling that we can't explain um we're fine and then all of a sudden we're blue or we're discouraged and we don't know why and the reason that psychologists give to explain this is that there is actually an accumulation of events that we perceive at the not fully they don't fully enter our consciousness it could be a remark that somebody made it could be a site that we saw and uh and it is registered at a low level of consciousness so that we're not aware of it but because of an accumulation of these negative uh of these perceptions that affect us negatively then we get that feeling we get that feeling of being discouraged or blue a negative affect that suddenly because of the build up now reaches our consciousness but we don't know why so these are the these are uh findings from freudian theory which i think can give us some insight as to why as to why um we have these puzzling findings about the popularity of populist leaders now that we see that dr tan cited in reference to the philippines and brazil and i would like to bring in at this point a theory from social psychology this time and i will share my screen this is the theory by this is the theory by carl festinger cognitive dissonance theory is a classic one of the classic social psychological theories and um well i will give a little explanation of this for those of you who are not familiar i i beg the indulgence of those who are very familiar with this theory but i think there are some of us who might not be very clear on what this theory deals with all right the theory in brief says that opposing cognitions or behaviors produce tensions for example the cognitions that i smoke or the behavior that i smoke when put together with the knowledge that smoking is bad for one's health reduces tension in us so the individual is motivated to reduce attention by changing one of the cognitions or behaviors for instance he can say or he can change his behavior so that he now knows i no longer smoke because smoking is bad for one's health the two cognitions are now consonant with one another and as a consequence the tension the psychological tension is reduced or i smoke because smoking is not really all that bad for one's health once again here the two cognitions are no longer opposed to one another the larger the dissonance the larger the change in cognition or behavior now the classic laboratory up to test a cognitive dissonance theory the predictions of cognitive dissonance theory is you have two groups both groups are given a boring task for example they're asked to fill out uh random numbers in sheets of graphing paper not with their with their multitude of uh of little squares you fill that out with random numbers that's the task giving you or they're asked to stack cubes one on top of the other so that to find out just how high the cubes can go before they fall so this is unquestionably a boring task for most people correct now the two groups are then uh treated in a different way that is to say one group is given are told that they are given twenty dollars as a reward and another group is given a reward of one dollar for reward excuse me these are american examples because the original experiments were carried out in the u.s um okay um afterwards the groups are asked to rate the pleasantness of the task now which group do you think would rate this boring task higher on a pleasantness scale most people would say it is the twenty dollar group but the fact of the matter is it is the one dollar group that gives it a higher rating the 20 group would give it a lower rating and the explanation is that there is a higher dissonance produced in the one dollar group why is that because they know i'm doing this boring task uh even as i'm being given only a one dollar reward all right so they give it an honest rating a low rating on the other hand i'm sorry they give it a high they give it a high rating because they have to resolve the dissonance no i'm doing a boring task but i'm given such a lousy reward this is because it is a pleasant task that's what they tell themselves on the other hand the twenty dollar group uh know that this is a boring task but since i'm giving being given twenty dollars i'm doing it anyway but it's still a boring task so the greater dissonance is produced in the one dollar group and as a consequence they fool themselves more they change their cognition about the pleasantness of the task so how does this relate to to the situation i want to explain that is to say why are populist leaders uh rated very highly dr tan gives uh an explanation uh it is it has to do with the with their uh the dynamics of authoritarian leadership they're able to assure the populace and so forth i'd like to go a little deeper and say or to propose a mechanism as to why that works we have to recognize we have to recognize that even if we might think that we are not under high tension in this situation of the pandemic there are many people who are under high attention right but i think there also are a lot of people and there might be some of us who would be in this category who think well the pandemic is there but it's really not affecting me too much what we must recognize is that a lot of the tension is at the subconscious level i propose that a lot of the tension is at the subconscious level we get to find out that a lot of our friends have lost their jobs have lost their businesses there is the uncertainty about health about the the health of our friends our own which cannot be treated because the hospitals are full to to to the rafters of cases dealing with kovid so all of these tensions we don't know how things will develop in the next few months in the next few years all of these even as they are not recognized at the conscious level in my view they build up so people are under high tension whether they're aware of it or not and therefore when they are faced with the question of whether they are satisfied with the performance of their leaders what are your cognitions and at the subconscious level you're under high tension okay and then if you are told you have a weak leader you have a leader who does not know how to lead this is a situation of dissonance and your tendency is to say no my leader is fine he can deal with it he can deal with it so that is how the cognitive dissonance is resolved um this is the this is why we find puzzlingly leaders uh like duterte and bolsonaro have high ratings despite the fact that they have not really uh performed very uh commendably so i would like to end my my reaction by uh joining dr tan in in suggesting that we need to we need to uh come up with stories more positive stories but i would like to frame this in more general way i think we need i think the the what social scientists can do one thing that social scientists can do is to put our efforts in into communicating communication with the public because the more the public is informed of objective uh of objective facts the more we tell them why they ought to wear masks not just uh we don't stop but just say you cannot go out without masks but if we explain why if we explain social distancing sufficiently i think this will go a long way in dispelling fears and that this will produce greater confidence in the population so that they can they can have less dissonances dissonances at the subconscious level are perhaps the most dangerous ones uh if we are able to bring dissonant cognitions at to the to the to consciousness and then examine whether these dissonant cognitions are valid or not i think we are we would be able to uh find uh our way to more valid conclusions this would increase the confidence of people to confront the situation more realistically and as a consequence would be able to better decide would be able to better input into policy making speaking their minds uh bringing their complaints to the authorities and being able to reason uh to reason as to why these should be attended and how they can cooperate in advancing correct solutions better solutions to the pandemic i apologize that i'm rushing like this i have a meeting at three o'clock i will definitely watch this on on facebook later on because i'm very interested in what our indian colleagues have to say thank you very much dr edward for the interesting presentation i think our two speakers from the philippines have captured the important discourses we have in this country related to kovi from anthropological perspective to that of issue of governance to that of the politics of it to the psychology of it these are in the awareness of many of our social scientists in the philippines thank you very much gentlemen now we go to the other side of the world we of asia we go to south asia to listen to our colleagues how do they see all these things as well from their own perspective but before we proceed with that we invite our viewers to join the discussion by sending their questions through the comment section on the facebook live stream we will take them up with our panelists later during the open forum as the time will permit so at now let me introduce ours our second resource person and the first one coming from the indian side a person who is very accomplished he is a director director general sorry at the research and information system for developing countries a new delhi policy research institute supported by the government of india he was a global justice fellow at the macmillan center for international affairs at the yale university he has done his phd in economics he works on issues related to development economics involving development finance he is also on the board of the reserve bank of india has authored or edited 10 books apart from contributing chapters in edited volumes and publishing several research articles in several prestigious joy artic in sev research articles in various prestigious journals he has served as a visiting professor at the jawaharlal nero university and he had been a developing country fellow at the university of amsterdam and the visiting fellow at the institute of advanced studies in shimla and visiting scholar at the german development institute he is also on the editorial advisory board of the ids bulletin ladies and gentlemen join me in welcoming our colleague from india no other than dr chatur vidi dr chaturvidis thank you thanks a lot uh thanks professor agua it's such a pleasure and honor to join you here i must at the outset congratulate uh professor vk malotra the member secretary of the indian council for social science research and uh dr potus from the philippines social science council for arriving at this partnership and and embarking on this magnificent journey immediately after uh closing the bilateral agreement and as dr porter's very rightly described the dynamic leadership with icssr has enabled icssr to become more active and as professor malutra listed there are several bilateral engagements they have come in which which are all going to supplement the wider global understanding on social science research and its uh great possibility of influencing the policy making so without further ado i must also congratulate and thank uh uh dr michael tan for uh for very very impressive uh presentation today highlighting the policy challenges that are there and also uh uh suggesting a way forward and i'm uh grateful to um dr uh del pilar for uh suggesting as to what social science research can actually do and and this is what i feel and my presentation actually starts with this very idea of what exactly we can contribute with and and how social sciences can actually supplement the wider efforts so uh what i'm trying to say is what uh dr del pilar stopped with and my first point is very much his concern about communication and in last six months or so india has seen a very effective communication by the government on what exactly is the nature of the crisis led by the prime minister himself uh the story of covet handling in india is is a very impressive account of very effective communication uh emphasizing on the usage of the mask uh suggesting quarantine suggesting uh isolation keeping physical distance leveraging the strength of india's film industry leveraging the bollywood stars leveraging uh social leaders leveraging industrial houses etc to communicate so physical distancing etc but not exactly forced wherever required police had to uh act but effective communication has been one very important dimension the second point that i want to bring in uh is the effective communication between the ministry of finance and uh the central uh bank of india so the fiscal and monetary policy convergence is uh is is is a reality and and and has happened very well both the ministry of finance and the reserve bank of india have worked together uh to tackle the crisis and this is not the end of the story professor agua if you see uh there were also very impressive convergences that have happened uh so we have n number of uh science technology institutions uh leading uh of them are 11. so a seamless convergence between science technology institutions led by the principal scientific advisor was the single most important achievement for us where all the scientific institutions could come under one leadership and could go forward the second important convergence that we saw as you can imagine with the more than 30 entities in india with states etc it was very important that the central government the state government and the local governments they all converged their action at one point so seamless flow of information across these administrative entities for for so many people uh is is is something that has happened uh in a great uh seamless convergence third important convergence that i want to talk to you today is about the idea of leveraging the strength of the traditional medicine with modern medicine how you converge them and and and and it was uh it was emphasized that the people um the indigenous communities have been using these uh medicinal and aromatic plants and i'm very glad that uh dr bhushan patwathan is also in the panel and i'm sure he would love to bring out this dimension of this great convergence that is happening and this brings us to the cultural connect uh uh being a a british colony at some point we picked up several practices which were not a part of our culture and so handshake etc and and the traditional style of wishing people uh bringing in the cultural dimensions of keeping the shoes out of your home the hygienic concepts that traditional indian societies always appreciated they all had got blurred in last 70 years or so and this crisis has given a new cultural connect uh in terms of how we go forward so these are the broad points that i would be talking in next 10 minutes to you uh apart from emphasizing on evidence-based policy-making so around the clock leadership by indian council of medical research collating evidences together and cooperative federalism uh bringing in the role of the civil society organizations bringing in the role of the community and community participation in we going forward apart from the government led processes so prime minister from day one has been saying that communities are important people are important so people-centric uh corvid strategy was the crux of this whole story that that is there and uh and dr agua the results are here on my screen right now uh if you look at per million deaths that are happening uh uh our telly is not very different uh uh you would realize that with such a huge population in india the deaths that have happened the losses that have happened uh are minuscule in terms of uh the uh huge strata of indian society uh from whom development uh parameters in the last 70 years have remained completely out of it and and the development and industrial model emerged in such a fashion that uh migrations had happened over the last several decades and when this crisis uh hit us reverse migration started towards the rural areas and and that quantum was huge we were afraid if these people would be affected but village village communities have emerged as the most brilliant communities in india and the crisis was averted the villagers exercised restraint and we could go forward and as a result now you find the addition to the new cases is continuously declining and the story is emerging very well uh the peculiarities distinctiveness and strengths are are now being leveraged as a positive feature uh if you look at the size and the area and the population the diversity of cultures the democratic society that we have the new faith that people have acquired in the governance model and the science technology innovation connect that have come up be that with information technology pharmaceuticals or biomedical uh technologies that have come up and and if you see india and philippines lot of similarities out there dr agua which are largely in terms of both of us being democratic societies both of us using technological labs the corvid kaya in philippines to guide the individuals about the infection in their surroundings and keeping them also alert and unaware of how dimensions are are there gdp growth has largely been affected in our respective countries and economies but if you see uh the awareness that came in uh was largely from the beginning and and india could ban all travels from china right on 2nd of february itself so indian government acted very fast right in january we started unbundling the sequence of events in china and and the failure of chinese quarantine agencies so we started mapping all that out very early and this uh has helped us in a major way uh in terms of coping up with the crisis and ensuring medical supplies uh etc uh they came up in a major way and uh led by the prime minister's office the state governments and the ministry of health in particular could bring in civil society health workers citizens uh the sti centers the science technology innovation centers the media and even connecting the village heads uh with the process and prime minister addressed two meetings with the village heads panchayats as we call them and and you find that this effective communication emerged as a major uh uh sort of connector uh so e gram swaraj portel uh uh that has happened and that that's what pm addressed right in april itself and uh and you find that uh a very timely and detailed information was settled in fact when parliament is not in session india has the system of passing ordinances so right in april itself uh with the help of our planning commission we call that uh niti niti the national institute for transforming india uh that passed inputs for uh getting ordinances cleared and dr ramesh chan who is our member agriculture in the nithya yog made an effort to ensure that agriculture produced from farmers is free from all the locked down processes so even within the lockdown the farmers have emerged as winners and as i told you earlier they have emerged as contributors to india's gdp growth they were allowed to freely transact and and subsequently much more legislations have come in to enable farmers and the village society's participation in the process impact of education and initiatives by government is another important dimension that has come in and more and more uh uh uh sort of uh battle they were taken up by the school teachers because uh all the schools were closed down colleges were closed down so how education system works and none other than professor malhotra knows it best here in this panel because they have been involved uh professor bhushan but huda knows it best universities schools they all could cope up with the e-learning and that has emerged as a successful story for us easing market anxieties was equally important and the reserve bank of india and as i said uh they constituted teams and and you would not believe but more than 200 people were logged in a hotel uh to run a 24 7 all the e-transactions that were happen so without any disruption fintech and digital technologies could work and sometimes we don't realize but billions of transactions happened in these months and these 200 people were logged inside a hotel in mumbai which is our financial hub for uh enforcing these transactions so a lot of i.t support a lot of commitment and dedicated workers have gone in and and government also announced uh tax concessions the interest rate deferments and uh and uh several of the uh concessions including the delayed uh filing of uh penalties etc that that have come up some of them have been waived off after supreme court has intervened so quite a few new initiatives have come up in fact the reserve bank of india also allowed the long-term repo operations uh targeted long-term rep operations that that came in uh the support for mutual fund and several other schemes for small and medium enterprises their new classification was announced specific measures were announced for msmes and that could bring in if you see the stimulus it could address the requirements of the daily wages it was it would it could address requirements of microfinance msmes india has a huge informal sector the issues related to banks and farmers and much more important to that was the food supply how do you ensure food supply in a lockdown situation so a lot of civil society organizations came up and india has a very vibrant civil society under agua and that could that could contribute to this uh whole process and if i say a fiscal stimulus that will announce two of them 1.0 and 2.0 they could provide the variables to industrial and economic community and as the reserve bank of india's report suggests next year we are going to bounce back and an economy is likely uh to get the necessary traction that is uh needed direct benefit transfer has been a singular success for government and rupees 6000 were given to all the farmers in the previous fiscal year that remaining exercise could continue specific programs were initiated in village areas for construction so that jobs can be can be created and as a result you find that a lot of things could be achieved and as i said in the beginning it could not have been possible without leveraging the strength of science technology and innovation and and this is what i have been discussing with professor malhotra uh for for long now to connect social sciences with hardcore sciences something that dr porter's also referred to and i think she's absolutely right that we need to see how hard sciences and social sciences and humanities converge and we understand each other and take uh policy analysis forward so uh var on covet 19 had a lot of issues related to innovation startups and lot of startups came up and as a result india could contribute india could reduce the whole cost of operations that were there and science technology played an extremely important role i talked about uh the kaya that philippines has but arrogance a2 was india's contribution and success we are also part of the global vaccine development initiatives 21 of them are there india is part of all of them uh three of them are now very close to a final induction and india is part of that global effort we are also part of the clinical trials that are on uh i uh ayush related initiatives have also been encouraged and uh protocols have already been introduced there the government is also trying to bring in administrative uh leeway at the district level at the uh so localization of the strategy is another important dimension uh dr agua that i want to uh identify as a key success story uh until and unless central government empowers the local governments without that nothing can be achieved and fortunately from day one prime minister uh emphasized on bringing people at the center and local administration at the center and that could happen very well as i said india also tried new leaves out of its past ayush and ayush related products were identified there were several people who relied on our traditional medicines and and uh somehow uh under the influence of western countries we had completely forgotten the strength of our own medicinal and aromatic plants and they were revived prime minister publicly uh uh came out in favor of it and as a result you find a sequence of uh meetings and uh discussions and media sort of features on uh advantages of plants which can be leveraged for giving immunity for giving vitality giving you protection so you find that apart from yoga and yoga related features many more dimensions came in for re-energizing people as i said civil society organizations played important role grassroots organizations came up they did extremely well a sort of cooperative federalism with the states held several new dimensions came up in terms of supporting it but this could not have been achieved dr agua without rehabbing clarity on the development initiatives itself and this government could get that success because in the last five years they built a huge ecosystem uh for uh delivering what is called as a digital payment platform a bhim bhim as it is called in india the clean india drive uh keeping the hygiene and cleanliness up their national biopharma mission the biometric identified accounts and direct benefit transfer to them neighborhood first policy of connecting with our neighbors people-centric development civil society traditional knowledge startup etc they have played i know i'm running out of time i would just quickly uh run through my slides then uh care beyond borders is something uh another success the prime minister has added to our whole portfolio he called up the sark leaders we have some of our best neighbors who are not always very cooperative but in this hour of crisis uh we extended and india announced the support of 10 million dollars to our neighbors and and we also uh uh sent out uh several million doses of hydroxychloroquine uh we also extended full support on uh uh to our brothers and sisters in africa mozambique and many other places there were several uh leaders who personally congratulated india and and have identified so the short point here is that the south south cooperation the partnership with the fellow developing countries and and uh it was unique uh crisis this time because the distinction between the north and the south blurred away the vulnerabilities of the north were thoroughly exposed and and so were of the south so how uh interdependence and global partnerships are of great significance is is very important and that's the reason why i uh right at the outset congratulated uh icssr and the philippine social science council for this partnership the pandemics are not going to stop they are going to be there and unfortunately with irresponsibility and technology infusion the vulnerability of other countries are extremely high so how a pandemic network can come up among countries how social scientists can bring in more clarity and more understanding on issues i think is important so as public health crisis unfolds we need to see how social scientists can can cope up because the impending part of it is the economic crisis the public health crisis uh the uh ideas that are there as you very rightly mentioned uh dr agua in terms of social distancing and communication so how we encourage governments and and other agencies to uh to communicate etc uh so so with this uh uh i would stop and i would uh thank uh uh both icssr and professor guayu and your team for giving me this opportunity and for your patient caring thank you thank you very much dr sanchez that's an excellent presentation i'm sure our colleagues from this side of the world is thinking the difference of how you are doing things in your country and in our country and probably the nuances of similarities but i think this is what we would like to accomplish actually in our conversation today thank you very much we'll get back to you i think uh people are starting to pour in their questions to all our speakers and of course to our executive directors joining us here next uh our next presenter will be coming from the indian side as well he's an accomplished scholar and i should say accomplished orator as well no he is a biomedical scientist who is a fellow of the national academy sciences of india and the national academy of medical sciences in india he was director of the interdisciplinary school of health sciences university my apologies for the pronunciation there he has been member of important national committees of the university grants commission of all in the all india council for technical education the council for scientific and industrial research science and engineering research board at the department of science and technology the department of biotechnology and indian council of medical research he has worked i think he worked a lot he worked on several policy making bodies including task forces of national knowledge commission the planning commission and he serves also as consultant of the world health organization in geneva our next speaker is editor-in-chief of journal of ayurveda and integrative medicine published by elsevier and is on its editorial boards and he is on the editorial boards of many journals he is he is a recipient of many awards on eurasia and he distinguished themselves on that particular field by winning numerous awards both in the country and abroad and he is also judge he's not just a scientist he's not just a researcher he's also judged as a best teacher i think many of us can relate to that easily and uh he authored a lot of scholarly books integrated approaches for health and innovative approaches to drug discovery as among the publications he made and have received excellent reviews he has received several research grants and has guided 19 phd students eight indian patents he's a holder of two us patents and over 120 research publications and 7 200 citations i do not know if i knows the word rest with all the things he is doing in here so ladies and gentlemen it's our honor to join to bring to you and join us in the conversation dr bhushan patrawardan thank you very much for joining us good afternoon thank you can you hear me yes sir yes sir you're coming loud and clear and um sorry for my conversation [Music] nrcp dr portis executive director pssc dr michael tan uh former chancellor university of philippines uh dilemma and of course dr mario who has been very very actively uh comparing this webinar you know uh also my colleagues from india dr vikki malotra member secretary i say cesar and dr sachin chaturvedi who just gave a wonderful presentation i was very happy to listen to the both the presentations from philippines side you know they are very thought-provoking and i must compliment both the speakers i'm happy to witness a very active bilateral collaboration between icssr india and the philippines social science council uh pssc uh the purpose of mou between icssr and pssc is to develop a better understanding of social sciences and humanities in india and in the philippines through collaborative research networks of social scientists free and open exchange of relevant information and several activities are being planned as a part of this mou and this webinar is one of them you know i hope that the webinar series uh very very appropriately named as stories from social science communities in india and the philippines and kovite 19 this will strengthen the collaboration between the two countries india and philippines friends have so much common in our civilization in our culture even in our customs you know businesses foods traditions medicines health practices spiritual practices so much commonalities you know we can learn so much from each other and we can work together to find solutions to our common problems as well as for the rest of the world i truly enjoyed the scholarly thought-provoking presentations by dr tan uh and uh continuing with that i just wanted to share some of the thoughts you know in india we have successfully used traditional medicine as mentioned by dr sachin chaturvedi that includes ayurveda and yoga for and also simple home remedies uh with simple spices herbs medicated hot water uh nasal applications of different kinds of oils especially sesame oil uh the steam uh inhalation uh gargles with simple things like turmeric you know uh they are being extensively used in india and such simple and safe interventions have been found to be very important in improving immunity and to facilitate shedding or reduction of viral load in controlling further progress of the disease and also prevent further complications kovite 19. yoga has been found to be useful to improve respiratory efficiency and mental health recently minister of health and family welfare government of india has added a section on ayurveda and yoga protocols for prevention and management of mild cases of kovite 19 this is of course in addition to the non-pharmacological measures which all of us practice such as physical distancing wearing mass washing hands and sanitization etc as well as the modern medicine protocol for moderate to severe cases of provide 19 also exist you know so we are coming out with some kind of integrative approach wherein best from traditional medicine and best from modern medicine are brought together for the in the best interest of people you know and this has provided very practical affordable and safer solutions for people at present i am happy to tell you over 60 clinical trials on traditional medicine which we call it as ayush systems of medicine and its acronym ayurveda you know all put together there is a ministry independent ministry of traditional medicine which is called minister of ayush of the government of india they have come out with this protocol it is a very unique integrative protocol wherein you find one protocol about modern aspects and one protocol about traditional aspects and both are endorsed by the government of india where we'll be very happy to share our knowledge experiences and explore this kind of a bilateral collaborations you know uh to further these causes as mentioned by professor malotra uh you know the uh i icssr was co-chair uh for a social protection steering group created to advise on the development of the united nations research roadmap for covet 19 recovery you know this report will be very relevant for the second webinar which both of you are planning i wish to congratulate pssc and icssr for organizing very successful webinar that has attracted large number of participants as a biomedical scientist i must tell you that modern medicine or only medical care is not sufficient because health in many aspect primarily i believe that has also very intensive social relevance so social sciences play equally important role along with medical sciences if you want to really manage health effectively medicine is different but health you know social aspects become extremely important and i hope this webinar will attract many other collaborative partners to join this series and further expand our academic collaboration again i will try to end uh by giving you best wishes in your language as well motivating uh sorority and uh with this i wish the webinar and both the organizers all the very best namaste namaste namaste thank you very much was a very very interesting discussion i'm sure our colleagues in the philippines are shaking their head on your discourse about a traditional medicine yoga it seemed to be a taboo in this country in the height of the video thank you very much sir for very enlightening made i i think this is the importance actually of a cross-border discourse because contexts are different we are doing uh things are done differently but nevertheless i think the focus of all our resource persons this is about people yes and it means also on how do we care with people despite the differences and culture traditions and distances i think there are a lot of things uh coming up to many of our friends uh joining us in this webinar uh our questions are coming in here probably we can uh we can have a little time to join each other for conversations and to share our views of course i also encourage dr portus dr malhotra to join us in this conversation this afternoon let me just start uh i think we have a question in here uh for uh dr sachin let's start our team is picking up the questions now from our facebook uh live very active conversation in there um i i this is not a question for dr sachin but rather uh comment on how how basically a traditional medicine has been integrated uh in your healthcare system and i i think it has been mentioned also by dr patuardan that you know the traditional medicine had been part of your approach and i i think from this part of the globe we were so surprised of that uh because the loss then our president was saying there's nothing much we can do except for the development of the vaccine you know and the medical field we're saying no no no you cannot you cannot just go on you know herbal medicines and other things and that had been a big debate could you just enlighten and add us on that and how the government is basically responding to it because we listening to your professor agua this is an excellent question and i must congratulate whoever has posed this question because if in india anyone can answer this question best is none other than professor bhushan yeah is heading a committee of uh scientists uh constituted by the government of india to spearhead integration of not only these two streams but also to address how the learning and teaching of the medical sciences can absorb the nuances of the two of these streams as uh you might have observed his comment uh in the chat box uh he has just commented that the two streams are to uh be leveraged in a way that we get best of both so uh uh somehow the colonial past has been so strong in so many countries that we see only the best discovered ideas and uh progress as a panacea for our troubles and problems the idea of applying modern science and technology for our traditional knowledge is something that professor bhutan bush for more than 20 years now and uh and i had met him almost uh 10 or 15 years ago or to discuss this very issue when he was knacked deep into this and in fact uh later he was in mauritius when the president of mauritius consulted him on what kind of approach we can really have so i would very much request him to take the floor and explain yes please enlighten us on this because it's really a big debate in this country but we have a strong tradition as well of traditional medicines different parts of the country how come that uh you know it's not filtering it to the centers of power but in your case it seems to be there's a seamless endorsement of putting together these things dr buchan would you like to enlighten us on this and we have a lot of scholars in the country that's following us on this thank you thank you dr sachin for that introduction and thank you dr uh for this uh kind uh opportunity dr mario uh let me tell you that uh covet uh has brought both modern and traditional on the same level playing field because kovid is as new to modern medicine as it is new to traditional medicine so there is nobody is having upper hand you know for example if we talk about cardiovascular diseases obviously modern medicine will have upper hand you know they have advanced surgeries they have advanced medicine but for kovid nobody has anything so everybody is at the living playing field so that's the first point second point as rightly pointed out by dr sachin you know we cannot continue to go under the influence of monocultural dominance that whatever is coming only from one particular thought process is only true when we have our own knowledge system when we our own culture when we are on history when we are on practices how can all of a sudden we forget everything and start thinking that what is coming from the west is only good you know from west whatever good is coming we will take it but we also have something good that we can give it not only to west but also for our own people so this is what is the basic idea and it was not easy even in our country to push this idea let me tell you bringing this protocol as a national protocol a separate chapter on traditional medicine was not easy task we have to work very hard for it we have to do several scientific studies we have to bring lot of empirical evidences put together to convince scientists what we are talking about is not only about traditional knowledge but we are talking about based on empirical evidence which are testable and we have done that at present there are 60 clinical trials happening in india which are controlled clinical trials you know and at top medical centers in india wherein we have shown the early trends are showing that early interventions with simple remedies help people to prevent disease and also help progression of the disease to more severe cases and this means that we are reducing the load in the hospital because people will be able to recover faster and that's what we want you know economies like ours you know your country also you know we want easy and affordable interventions you know we can't afford to get our people every time in expensive hospitals and give them expensive and that also question mark safe medications you know question mark safe medication why i am putting question mark if you look at all the medications including hydroxychloroquine where is the evidence i'm asking where is the evidence because even rem deciver if you look at the recent clinical trial published in jama they are saying there may be statistically significant evidence but there is no clinically significant evidence what does it mean you know and why we should buy this expensive question mark safe medicines when we have simple home remedies simple steam simple gargle with simple spices you know and you may choose your own tradition you know need not choose what india is using because every country they have and especially philippines you have such a rich tradition you have such a rich knowledge you have such a rich repository of biodiversity and herbal medicine you can choose your own materials but the point is if we are able to use that at the early stage you can prevent unfortunately if you get disease still with simple remedies you can help virus to shed early you can help virus clearance from throat is traveling to lung that process can be controlled and so that the load on your hospitals can be reduced even if we are able to do this i think we are doing a great service to our country and to our people and this is the attempt which we are doing in india and if now we are getting little bit of success i will say only little bit of success because in india there is still a very huge dominance of western medicine and i belong to western medicine i am a biochemist so i am not saying that from that perspective i don't differentiate medicine from western or eastern perspective i look at medicine which is something which is beneficial for people which is affordable by the people and which is safe for people you know so from wherever it comes you know it is fine for me evidence based medicine but evidence also we should ask this question who will decide what is the evidence that also is question and my last point in this is absence of evidence should not be interpreted as evidence of absence and so for many things in traditional medicine you may not have so-called evidence which today's modern science may call it as evidence but you have experiential evidence you know so evidence-based medicine that e did not be only of experimental evidence but it also should be experiential evidence so that's what we try and you will find that many reflections of what i am talking about are in the current editorial which i have written and which i have just posted in the chat box which you are free to share even on the facebook and i know that this is not a simple subject but we will have to work this together you know countries like philippines and india where you have strong traditions we should feel proud of these traditions you know but at the same time we should not get into the mode of self-pride and past glory we have to take science modern science with us and travel on the scientific path for betterment of the human kind that's what my uh short message bill i'm sorry i was little longer and this is not typically only social science uh perspective but as i told you health is something where science and social science must converge together nobody in isolation can address problems of health thank you very much thank you very much for that note uh dr buciano you are just fueled again a big debate in this country because it was really at some certain point at the height of uh of uh kobe 19 and one of the local government where the tradition of esteem inhalation as a traditional medicine actually endorsed it to the public and you know develop a package of it and send it to different communities and that was highly criticized by the medical profession in this country and i think dr tan came as among the minority voices on this how i wish we have medical practitioners like you in this country but i think you are just uh encouraging a big debate in this country again because this is something we truly miss and people were saying we abused it we experienced relief from it for long long time and it was handed to us through generations then suddenly we are told oh you cannot use it now you know kodi this fatal kovid is different i love this debate and his discussion i want to tell you that we all of us together you know those who believe in science those who believe in humanity must come together and change this narrative today we are being given this narrative that modern medicine is the only answer modern medicine is answer for emergencies you know for acute care but for prevention for immunity what what modern medicine can give you to improve your immunity so there are two ways to combat kobe one way is to give antivirals and other way is to empower your body to increase your immunity to increase your mental capability to heal yourself so both are important you know and we should adopt both why it sounds so logical and so easy for you you know listening to you but uh here seems to be very very complicated how i wish that dr tan is here to share he has a problem connecting with us one more complicated and it is even more challenging in our country as well so you should not feel that yeah but that will be a very good discourse yes uh dr portugal our conversation please that's right i find dr bhushan epitome no an epitome of the fusion of the physical and the social sciences you know being a biomedical scientist here you are promoting alternative medicines you know um well the philippines is not a stranger in terms of uh you know also promoting alternative medicines we use herbal medicines you know and there are a lot of uh stores also selling this but our problem is that we are controlled by big pharmaceutical industries so i think that's one of the reasons why we cannot fully um utilize all of these things in nature no um there is a big uh uh advertisement now knowing in facebook that you know we can gargle with salt we can use hot water we can use lemon but these are not really uh taken seriously you know and i think because there are trolls in facebook and there are trolls in the social media that will prevent us from believing this no so that's the situation here in the philippines now there's a strong and well-funded pharmaceutical industry you know that will not make us use all of this alternative to western uh eastern medicines so we're really in a bad situation and hopefully we can you know your stories about your uh exploration of all of these herbs is really very encouraging and we hope we will learn from you and we will you know try to do something about our condition so i i could imagine uh dr tan would really love this discussion we have because dr tan published the book on herbal medicines in the philippines actually he's an authority for that but again you you're right dr portuguese that you know when the big pharma gets in and the medical field is also funded and supported by the big pharma who really don't like to use these uh traditional medicines uh back home yeah yes i want to make one point about big pharma let me tell you because i also work closely as consultant to many pharmaceuticals so i have seen pharma industry closely you know i am basically a drug researcher my main bread and butter comes from drug research you know so but i must tell you that at the highest level in pharmaceutical industry the realization has come now in them that our business which is based on agonies of people cannot be sustainable so they are changing their models from curative to prevent you the new models which pharmaceutical industries are talking about they are talking about more about immunology they're talking more about inflammation they're talking about prevention so this realization has come to them but obviously they have pressing needs to increase their profitability and so for some time at least we will have to face this and we will have to together try to change these narratives you know thank you thank you very much i don't want to rub the salt so much on this traditional medicine discourse and the big pharma but there is one big issue i think that both countries shared uh india and the philippines has a lot of overseas workers you know coming working across borders and different parts of the region how is government coping up uh with our foreign workers indians working different parts of the world got stuck in there because in the philippines as you all know a big part of our our gross national of our national income is really coming from overseas filipino workers who had been affected terribly by the pandemic and yet the the ability of the government to support them becomes a big question also nowadays so may we know the initiatives undertaken by your government from that guy from that perspective dr sachin or dr malhotra might like to share in the conversation on that professor would you take this question okay sure thank you i i could supplement that later okay thank you very you i just sent a message there are some people waiting in your waiting room of the zoom so can you ask any of your i.t manager uh doctor ago i have taken clear so welcome people people are waiting there okay thank you very much but second i think uh on this whole issue of migration and the efforts that governments are making in terms of addressing the challenge uh there are two three different dimensions that in india we have seen first and foremost is that with the lockdowns prevailing all across the world several of the indian citizens were stuck outside and as i told you that right from january we had started very closely monitoring china's response to several of the global though uh the who delayed a global alert but we ourselves have had started taking measures and uh government introduced what now is a very popular uh phrase of one de bharara so under one day bharat india launched a major uh exercise with the millions of indians stuck outside uh were brought back home and and and this was a huge number by the way uh and uh and under this uh hundreds of flights were operated not only for indians but also for some of the neighboring countries uh uh they were stuck in latin america and in all parts of the world so that was one major exercise that was done the second was when people came back as i was also telling you that the migration was not only international to us it was also domestic migration so government started working on several issues of preserving domestic migration professor malhotra would tell you he himself led a mega research program on covet within which they have encouraged social science research on the psychological framework the mental agony the job losses the opportunity of connecting with technology and n number of social diameters so that's the second layer but within government initiatives as i said continuous communication with heads of villages could bring in the decentralized approach on managing the migration crisis and the people affected by it the third label uh which was equally important was to share the medications that were needed for isolation and quarantines that were needed so under this lot of tests were done like for instance not only for indians stuck outside india but also for some of the countries where the pandemic was huge so several of the blood tests were done by india through our own diagnostic kits to strengthen the crisis management that was there professor thank you very much uh dr said yes yes to add few things to what dr sachin has already talked about one is that one day bharat he very rightly said that the indians who are settled or who were settled abroad they were brought back to india through those kinds of measures and it did help some of our neighboring countries also that's one thing on migration two issues one is international migration and uh the migration within the country and when people went back from the metropolitan cities or major towns back to their villages or let's say semi-urban areas it was termed as reverse migration i mean despite being a student of economics i'm compelled to understand that the the issue behind migration was not economic in totality right there were other issues also for example anxiety psychological reasons feeling unsafe and one important thing in the initial phases of the pandemic perhaps people were not too sure that the facilities that exist if we get deceased we would be soon taken to a hospital these kind of i think psychological reasons led to reverse migration and secondly when in the middle of the pandemic the prime minister of the country talked about nirvana that is self-reliant india i think he was referring to the very model of economic development and he was talking about that why should people need to travel uh 1500 to 2000 kilometers away from their villages and seminar urban areas too to earn a livelihood for themselves and for their families i mean maybe i mean if we talk in terms of purchasing power parity expenditures which they by spending close to their villages and close to the places of their origin can bring a livelihood to them and to their families i think will be a better alternative it is in this context that the self-reliance and the new model of the development has to be interpreted and this is this is what i feel because when researchers i know many many agencies in india have gathered their statistics on the opinion of those who have reverse migrate migrated to their villages would they be interested in days to come to come back to the metropolitan cities where they were they are earning their livelihoods before the pandemic so their responses have been that at least 30 to 40 percent they have said that they would explore other opportunities in fact close to their points of origin so this is this is i think a fundamental thing and that would need for the researchers in days to come so uh migration of course was not the whole issue big arising out of the economic compulsions there were other compulsions also and i believe that if people are confident that the economic development is reaching every nook and corner of the country and they have some opportunities close to their places of origin i think in in course of time we may have lesser migration than we have witnessed in the past thank you very much dr malhotra probably we could ask the comment on the migration thing from dr portus knowing that the philippine social science council houses also the migration center in the philippines dr portus would you like to give a comment on that on the migrant workers are we attending to it and what is being done today and the challenge yes as well thank you yeah but before that uh i'd like to cover everything i see some questions in the chat box addressed to our filipino speakers now the first one is to dr del children of tender age are the worst sufferer what is the effect of cognitive dissonance in children in the pandemic period with philippine context well i'm not a psychologist but i am a communicator and i think what i can share in this aspect is that um you know we had an advertisement before i think most filipinos will remember this uh it's called samatana magabata in the eyes of the child no and the message is that whatever you show to the children that's what they think is right you know so when they see people or their parents quarreling or their parents cursing each other or some attitudes of their parents that are not really to be seen not by these children or they think that the children uh the the children think that that's the right thing to do so i think that's where cognitive dissonance is and as a communicator i think it will be good to really communicate not to the children but to the parents on how well we can really raise good children in this world okay on the second question the conduct of qualitative researchers have been negatively impacted by minimum health standards regulations like social distancing etc and a suggestion on how qualitative researchers can move forward within the context of these limitations well that's that's a good question because i think being a qualitative researcher we have been experiencing this not as a quality qualitative research we would normally like to go to where the action is to see the natural setting and to really feel what the uh informants feel know and to see their environment but yes that's right given the pandemic we are not allowed to do that now but i think it's not because now we are prevented from doing it but it's because our risk not should should really not be exposed so it's i think we abide by that no but one thing good with researchers and social scientists is that they adapt to the situation so now we have really fully developed our systems and procedures in conducting online research so i have several researchers being conducted now and they are all qualitative researchers but we do online fgd we do online key informant interviews we do online surveys and um well i don't see there's much difference in the results it's just that you know uh there's this um problem with us not seeing the actual setting but the use of the cameras and the use of the internet now has really narrowed down this gap so yes uh while there is pandemic we still know persist as researchers and we do our uh interviews and activities online and we are able to do it now even in the remotest place and in fact is one of our research coordinators and you know i was so amazed that uh he was able to go to the mountains and we were amazed to find out that one of the indigenous i i think my own this is an indigenous community now which is wired we are able to do this now so maybe you can share something about that thank you very much mom uh well very briefly we create uh i think it offers also opportunities for us to do qualitative research because we can find ways to connect communities which we never thought before that could be done so what we're trying to set up now is a conversation on fgd with students that we put them online and the interviewer is coming from manila so i think that creates uh a new way of doing uh this kind of research uh as uh as dr tan have mentioned they have to do on different narratives of people during this crisis so yeah to to move forward our discussion thank you very much dr portus for sharing uh we got the question from uh dr hemant kumar uh what is it that we could learn from the philippines in terms of fighting uh more effectively and fighter kovid and a jobless scenario well in in the philippines now that is still a very very big debate as we are still at the middle of the crisis what is certain is as far as surveys are concerned hunger and people went up there were so many uncertainties that people see in the future and the government is trying to count on providing support to communities but we all know that this is not also enough there are initiatives here and there but i i think we would rather reserve a full uh discussion on this one on our second webinar actually because uh our second webinar for dr kumar will will focus basically on the issue of how do we attend to people directly during this crisis so that would be the focus of our next webinar on the issue of social protection and we will be inviting scholars from both countries to tackle on that issue as we tackle also i think later also on the next sessions we will have on the issue of economic stimulus package being prepared by these two countries but thank you for raising that issue um for now in the interest of time how i wish i can continue this conversation uh with us uh but just before we close uh our session this will be a question for uh dr sachin dr malhotra and of course dr portus that we would like to hear your final words and the final thoughts on this uh this is a question i would like to post to everybody and i think people are don't want to be stuck so much with a crisis they want to move so the question i would like and probably could be your wrapping up statement for our webinar uh if the crisis is an opportunity to innovate or introduce new ways of seeing acting and working what change would you like to see in our post pandemic world probably we can may i invite dr sachin then before that dr if there's an opportunity to innovate what is it that you would like to see acting or working that change that you would like to see in the post-pandemic world dr sachin uh uh thank you uh thanks a lot uh professor agua it is it is uh extremely pleasant to um be part of this uh initiative and as i said in the beginning and i whenever you were mentioning uh uh dr agua about the internal debates in philippines on traditional versus modern medicine i would very much request you to begin contributing papers as professor malhotra mentioned that the idea is to engage in discussions so i would very much like to invite you uh as a as a sociologist uh to uh uh to contribute and reflect on the nuances of these debates in philippines how you see uh the the challenges and what kind of possible uh traditional medicines are there let us focus on on on health to be very specific but later on we can we can work out so uh in my uh perspective the way forward should be to understand uh we going forward in terms of leveraging uh science technology and innovation for our work uh as a social scientist trying to see how that can really help for instance i also mentioned about fintech and fintech contributing the technology in the finance sector is helping bringing in financial inclusion for everyone so how philippines and the society can achieve this in a major way i also had an opportunity of of seeing the communities that are there in philippines uh particularly the coastal areas where uh much more sort of convergence india and philippines may have because we have recently introduced coast led development program in india so how coastal communities can contribute to that these are some of the areas which fall very much into the overall strategies and philippines is also part of asean so with that our bilateral and the regional cooperation comes in in a major way for us to go forward and we share a lot of commonalities as uh professor bhushan patwathan mentioned so i think it is important and there are several synergies and commonalities complementarities that we can bring together for collective benefits so so in my view we can combine some of these areas for a greater analysis and greater understanding thank you very much dr sachin that is well said may i go to uh dr portugal mamo that yeah yeah the question is what i want to see post covered okay yes um i don't think we'll go back to our past no uh i don't think kavit will get away in the next three to five years so we should embrace it while we look at it as something that has devastated our economy we should also look at the more positive sides like there are also positive sides people began to you know uh work on their hobbies they become gardeners cook they embroider they crochet so all of these things that they were doing they were not doing before you know they are able to do now and families now i think because they are all locked up inside the house no they have now the reason to bond and they become closer and they converse a lot no in my family you know this is the only time that you all really get to sit on the table and say anything and uh you know get to know each other's day and we're all working from home so it's it's it's nice to know that you know you're surrounded by your children where before know they just you know they go anywhere so you when they come home it's night time and when they go it's very early the morning so we don't have any conversation at all but now that they are locked up now we have a lot of time to converse and we have a lot of time to really get to know each other well so i think um we're we're seeing a world no that will embrace kovid no i you know as dr patuardon has mentioned we don't even have evidence that rem disappear will be a good vaccine so uh it's really difficult to say that it will end so my outlook is that let's embrace it no and let's turn the negative aspect into something more positive so we researchers we social scientists are you know in fact enjoying it because you know we are able to go to india virtually we're able to invite you without this pandemic maybe we it will be difficult uh to conduct this uh or to mount this webinar because you know you have to travel or we have to travel there we spend a lot but now with the technology uh we are really more connected but of course uh technologies have their pitfalls like my young you know just went in the beginning no so i think that's also part of you know adjusting to this situation hopefully we'll get better connections and hopefully there will be continuing um and pre uh uh adoption to this technology uh our children are of course uh experiencing difficulty because of this now you the digital and blended learning and the parents get to get a lot of stress because they're the ones responsible in monitoring their children but uh i think our government our department of education is trying to correct this and hopefully there will be more measures or more policies now that will make the technology work not only in education but in all other aspects of our human life so kovid will be here let us embrace it thank you thank you very much dr portus you are right my wife is very happy actually during the pandemic i have not traveled outside of our home for the last seven months yes it's a blessing for all of us dr malhotra please thank you professor guha in fact it has been a very nice session today and we could listen to different viewpoints also and different viewpoints or some stage do appear to be converging and diverging also that's one thing secondly i feel we are talking about normal going back to the normal that existed or will there be a new normal also and new normal will become normal in a few days time that's that's another thing and i i do think that there is going to be a lot of change in our thinking the thinking on health and hygiene as uh dr tan very rightly said culture and governance they are going to have a tremendous change uh thinking on education there were times we were talking about online quality of online teaching there are times now we are talking about high standards of online teaching and uh dr porches was making a mention about that i do feel that international relations international institutions right they are going to have tremendous changes in days to come and maybe new collaborations and new partnerships will see many changes secondly the data that appears before us today in in the form of stories i think stories need to be further supported by evidence the data needs to be verified in days to come and that would be happening so i see a lot many collaborations in the world not only taking place in the area of research but also in the area of health and hygiene so they are going to be the points for tomorrow as i said under athena the learning from india can be or the prime minister of india is that that in place of few towers of development will have vast fields of development and opportunities for the greater number of masses so there is a new understanding on environment also i think which has grown during this period of six months whether polluting the environment first and thinking of the remedies thereafter and investing heavily or spending heavily on curing the environment or what could be the possible solutions before us since dr porchu was making a mention about family bonding getting more deep and intense we have an evidence which contradicts that statement also i know number of papers have been published which talk about uh domestic violence during the pandemic times right so so evidences are quite diverse in nature and i think in days to come there'll be further more researches and maybe if there are instances of moving away from the journal statements or the general findings then the reasoning behind those findings would also need a little little more underpinning and a little deeper evidence behind it so with these words i'll thank you all for being with us and making so nice and so touching presentations in fact not only euro diet but also i mean touching you everywhere your mind and heart both so i i see i have i've started our con we had started our conversation with our philippines partner by saying that you look too good while smiling and i would like to repeat that sentence that this world must be very healthy it must have hygiene and it should be smiling all the time as you people are smiling right now before i ask so all the very best i'm looking forward to have two more sessions with you and number of wonderful presentations projects and and i will emphasize joint publications i said it in our conversation earlier also that whatever is being presented is to be finally converted into a publication and this is a relationship must be taken i agree i agree thank you thank you very much thank you very much dr malhotra what a very interesting message you have uh given us and the prospect of the cooperation between the two countries the greatest challenge for a facilitator and a moderator and session like this is to provide a synthesis you know and how would you synthesize sets up it's a wonderful presentation so substantive presented by our speakers i might not be able to do justice to all of that but these are some of the quick points that came to mind when i was listening to all our speakers as we battle with kovid there is an important role on political leadership i think both countries affirmed that because they have different experiences then there should be a convergence of governance in fact dr sachin habito it should be a seamless convergence in governance then the issue of cultural connect and disconnect of what we are doing i think that has been shown by speakers from the two countries then also the issue and the question we raised how do we propose policy what do we mean by evidence-based because what is evident might be changing from one perspective and one experiences as well and i think we have to interrogate the facts related to it then the next is in the question of where is people in all these questions that we would like to do i think our colleagues have emphasized at the end of the day this is all about our people and they should benefit out of the debate and they should benefit from the researches that we are doing i think our colleague also in india and partly here in the philippines have talked about the rule of science and technology you know the more we should use it in the service of humanity especially in the height of this crisis then it has been said that while we have to do the localization of our strategies because people at the end of the day are in our local communities let us not also forget the need for global solidarity and of course an interesting perspective i'm sure it will be taken up in future discussions it's really the issue of dependence on medicines and the discourse on traditional health you know and the modern technology and medicine and how do you combine this for the benefit of the people i think in both countries there are really clear debates on all of this and how this being deployed and i think uh social scientists and both divide could really profit more on this issue and if you'd like to pick up again that there we should not allow the monoculture monocultural dominance because i think at this time of the crisis we have to encourage a perspective of diversity of people and of culture because at the end of the day this is about we in the social sciences would like to contribute in building a just in the humane society the crisis is just a test of our solidarity this has been a very interesting afternoon for both countries for both organizations the philippine social science council and the indian council of social science research this is our first and we are coming up again future activities in the coming months so please follow us in our website and it will be announced in both organizations the next that we have lined up actually as initiatives that we would like to undertake in the coming days one would delve on the social protection issue during this time upon them i think there are rich experiences that you could imagine uh both countries could share what worked well what did not work well and how the social scientist also contributed on this discourse then on the third that we would like to do is the issue of the economic stimulus package you know everybody is talking about it but if you ask people in the street they actually don't understand about it it seemed to be a discourse up there left to people economies like dr sachin but how do we filter it down and what does it exactly mean for ordinary people that may uplift their problem on mental health because like as i've said in this part of the world people are just so worried what is the prospect of the future for them of course uh as mentioned also by dr malhotra there will be future initiatives that both collaboration likes to produce from publication to joint researches and other more we could explore because there's a lot for us to learn from each other and this is where the vibrance of the social science is coming to the picture of course i'd like to thank our resource person so in despite their busy schedule really tried to join us in this very important discussions we have we would like to thank also those who followed us in this webinar on our page especially those who asked questions and for joining us for this timely and relevant discussion today i hope you have profited much from our discussions we are not here to provide answers to all questions we are here i think a social scientist as we always say we are here a good discussion is a discussion that generates great questions and that's i think what we have achieved for today for everybody that joined us in this webinar we also request everyone to accomplish our brief evaluation form to help us improve uh in the way we are running this event as we will be coming up with future activities still the link to our evaluation is flashed on your screen but it will also be flashed on the website that we are using for this conversation only those who are able to submit the evaluation form will be given certificate of attendance the evaluation form will remain well they say five o'clock we can extend a little of it because it's almost five o'clock here in the philippines uh for people to be able to fill up that one again those who would like to follow this webinar we will be posting uh on our web the recording of this seminar we asked everybody that would like to review on this discourse and would like to share it also to their colleagues that the the video conversation during the seminar will be made available to all of us i think i could only say at this point thank you very much for everybody for joining us today and for the two leaders of organizations the philippine social science council headed by dr portus and the indian council of social science research for bringing together this initiative we are so excited to look forward at the prospect of this cooperation again as they said in crisis it will bring us opportunities and for us in the philippine social science council this is the opportunity that we're able to stumble in the midst of the covet crisis on that note ladies and gentlemen thank you very much i think it's now a good afternoon in both countries we have finally come and concluded in here and this is uh mario agua from the philippines saying thank you very much for sharing with us to all our research persons to those who followed us in the conversation i hope that you find this activity of ours this afternoon a productive thank you very much thank you very much may i take this opportunity to also thank dr badukar now he's been very supportive in coordinating this summer dr madokar how are you hi thank you so much thank you everybody thank you

philippine government to obtain a travel insurance for all foreign tourists entering the philippines for tourism or business purposes here is the actual interagency resolution number 160b so let me read this for you all foreign tourists must obtain prior to arrival a travel insurance for covet 19 treatment costs from reputed insurers with a minimum coverage of 35 000 u.s dollars for the duration of their stay in the philippines let me just provide a clarification regarding the coverage of 35 000 us dollars 35 000 is the coverage you don't have to shell out 35 000 to get this travel insurance although you will have to pay a premium the premium is very much lower it could range from 50 to 200 or more depending on the coverage and also please make sure that you are getting the insurance from a reputable health insurance company if you are a traveler from the us contact your health care insurance company regarding coverage overseas i'm going to show you this video on how to buy the appropriate travel medical insurance as i've mentioned this is a requirement to travel in the philippines so what do you need to get there are two types of insurance travel insurance or travel medical insurance let's look at the coverage trip cancellation loss of luggage medical and emergency for travel insurance usually pre-existing health conditions are not covered but travel medical insurance will also cover trip cancellation loss of luggage medical and emergency and they will also cover the pre-existing health conditions what do you need to get you will have to get the travel medical insurance that will cover loss of luggage trip cancellation medical emergency and also covet 19 treatments let's try this insurance provider square mouth and i am doing a 60 year old coverage or travel insurance coverage with covet 19 treatment costs so let's enter the basic information your trip itinerary for 30 days let's say i will be leaving on april 1st and returning on april 30th and my main destination is philippines just enter the necessary information and then you will have a code that will be shown to you later on so let's say april 1st let me enter the correct information so please bear with me okay so here for the traveler info you also needed to provide your country of residence for example united states and your state of residence and citizenship and the number of travelers for example one traveler and your age is 60 years old okay so the policy search will also include coverage for coronavirus pandemic so if you look above here you will have an option to include covered 19 treatment costs let's move on for example you wanted a cancellation coverage and you wanted to cover the amount of your trip for example four thousand dollars and let's assume that you have already paid so just enter the first deposit date and let's search for policies let's see the different codes here on the left side you can filter and add coronavirus pandemic so this represents the medical coverage for cavite 19 you also have an option to add pre-existing medical condition now let's sort this from price low to high so we can find affordable codes for your travel insurance coverage so here there is coronavirus pandemic coverage and pre-existing and we are able to find 125 dollars and find the medical coverage it shows here the medical is 75 000 which satisfies the 35 000 minimum coverage for travel in the philippines so just find the coveted 19 medical coverage and the medical minimum amount of coverage there's also an option to start this further so let's go ahead and let's only sort for medical or covet 19 medical coverage because there are some codes here that do not provide medical coverage for copied 19. i would advise you to screenshot everything that has medical coverage and the minimum or the amount of coverage before buying this travel insurance make sure that you screenshot everything before getting the actual code so when you print the actual policy it may not show the covet 19 medical coverage however i advise you to a print or screenshot all of these benefits so here i'm only showing copy 19 medical coverage and pre-existing medical so it's up to you to select the code that is best for you and you have several options so screenshot everything before buying and then check the full policy detail and then if covet 19 medical coverage is not shown on the policy itself you can contact the customer service and ask them that your policy includes covet 19 medical coverage and also show the minimum coverage amount or the actual amount of your policy but let's see this one it's in subai insuboy.com and let us get some codes let's say you are traveling on april 1st and you will be staying until april 30th and then just enter your primary destination let's say philippines and the policy maximum just enter the amount let's say fifty thousand to sixty thousand dollars so we already satisfied the minimum requirement of 35 000 u.s dollars and also enter the necessary information also your age affects the amount of the premium the higher the age the more expensive the premium now let's provide the location here the mailing address and the coverage area anyone can get a coat wherever you are and it is not only limited to us residents or u.s travelers going to philippines so you can enter any country after entering all the information let's see the code here it's around eighty dollars or eight eight dollars and look at the underwriter they are reputable insurance companies and on the left side you can put a check on the kovid 19 coverage and there's also quarantine coverage due to covet 19. it's up to you so you have different options depending on your coverage but what we're looking for is the kovid 19 coverage you can sort this to the policy maximum fifty thousand to 60 000 coverage this is the medical limit coverage and it's actually lower if you wanted to check out other codes it's 61 here good for 30 days so make sure to also check the deductible so deductible here is 250 dollars so this is your out of pocket amount there are so many options to choose from so it all depends on your age the deductible and the coverage and exclusions if you have any other questions or comments please post them down below and i will get back to you as soon as i can thank you guys for supporting my channel and if you haven't liked this video please give it a big thumbs up and if you haven't subscribed to my channel please subscribe and hit that notification bell i always welcome new subscribers i hope
