38,TIGrlq6tjlw,Why Aren’t Indonesia And The Philippines Getting The Vaccines They Need?,"""There is a glaring global inequity in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. As of Aug 12, 2021, only 9.6% of Indonesia’s population and 10.8% of the Philippines’ population were vaccinated as compared to rates of 50% in the US and 53% in Europe, according to the Bloomberg vaccine tracker. \n\nThis stems from wealthier countries like the United States, Britain and Singapore having had the funds to invest billions in pharmaceutical companies to supercharge the urgent development of vaccines. Such countries were entitled to priority access to the vaccines once they were available.\n\nThe concern, however, is that large unvaccinated populations make for potential breeding grounds for dangerous mutations of the coronavirus to emerge. To address the problem of vaccine nationalism, the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) was set up, funded by wealthier countries, philanthropic and private sector contributions to help countries get more equitable access. Both Indonesia - which in July briefly overtook India as the epicentre of the pandemic in Asia, with record new infections daily - and the Philippines have signed up to COVAX for vaccines, although there is a supply bottleneck due to high demand. \n\nBoth countries have struggled to get hold of vaccines from Western pharmaceutical companies, and as a result turned to China in mid-2020 for help with Chinese-produced vaccines like Sinovac and Sinopharm. This has raised concerns over how it might obligate both governments in bilateral issues - but it also meant delivery of millions of doses well ahead of what other vaccine makers could promise.\n\nOther headway has been made: In June 2021, world leaders at the G7 summit pledged US$870 million in vaccine donations globally. And in August 2021, Indonesia and the Philippines are expected to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, enough for 10% and 20% of their populations respectively.  Indonesia-based vaccine maker Bio Farma has also started talking with China about producing the Sinovac vaccine from scratch.\n\nWATCH the full Insight episode of  Asia's Vaccine Disparity: What Will It Take To Inoculate Southeast Asia?: https://youtu.be/GUVKWAEO_hY \n\nALSO WATCH:\n'Herd Stupidity'?

86,sbZaGnfy_YE,Arrival of AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccines from the COVAX Facility 3/4/2021,"'Villamor Air Base, Pasay City\r\nMarch 4, 2021\n\n“Let me thank you, to our key partners in the international community represented by their ambassadors tonight.  Their cooperation in public health is very much needed.  Positive engagement is very much welcome,” President Rodrigo Roa Duterte stated as he led the Philippine government in receiving the 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City. \n\n\nThe arrival of AstraZeneca vaccines marked the first round of allocated doses from the COVAX Facility and the second batch of vaccine shipment that already arrived in the Philippines.\n\n\n“As I have said before, these vaccines should be treated as a global public good.  The need for international solidarity and cooperation cannot be made clearer than this pandemic because…no one is safe globally until everybody is safe,” President Duterte stressed in his keynote message after viewing one of the crates containing the vaccine doses and inspecting an actual vaccine vial during the presentation of AstraZeneca vaccines to the government. \n\nThe Chief Executive directed all concerned agencies to actively institutionalize and sustain the whole-of-government approach in addressing the country’s COVID-19 situation, as well as assured his fellow Filipinos that the government is working to ensure the immediate and equitable distribution of vaccines to all communities throughout the nation.\n\nHe also appealed to his ‘kababayans’ to get inoculated as this would further prevent the spread of the virus and gave his assurance that the available vaccines are safe.  At the same time, he reminded the public to continue observing and practicing health and safety protocols as the country waits for the arrival of more COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) Representative to the Philippines Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe also delivered his opening remarks where he announced that the consignment received by the Philippines on this day will be followed by up to 4.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines scheduled to arrive in batches before the end of May.  These vaccines will protect 20% of the country’s population during the year.\n\n“Together we are stronger and today’s arrival in the Philippines of the COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX Facility is a testament to the strength of collaboration, cooperation and compassion.  It is a testament to the power of working together towards a common goal in the spirit of partnership, equity and solidarity,” Dr. Abeyasinghe said. \n\nCOVAX is the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator – a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatment and vaccines. \n\nIt is co-led by the WHO, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), alongside the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) as key delivery partner.  Its primary aim is to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as to guarantee fair and equitable access for every nation in the world. \n\n\n\r\n\n*****\nConnect with RTVM\n\nWebsite: http://rtvm.gov.ph\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/presidentialcom and www.facebook.com/rtvmalacanang\nTwitter: @RTVMalacanang\nYouTube: @RTVMalacanang\nInstagram: @RTVMalacanang'",2021-03-05,4487,98,14,UC46YJ9p0d6MSUXRZFRZrwGQ,RTVMalacanang,2008-07-25,587000,16515

108,K3odScka55A,Why you can&#39;t compare Covid-19 vaccines,"'What a vaccine\'s ""efficacy rate"" actually means.\n\nSign up for our newsletter: http://www.vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nIn the US, the first two available Covid-19 vaccines were the ones from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. Both vaccines have very high ""efficacy rates,"" of around 95%. But the third vaccine introduced in the US, from Johnson & Johnson, has a considerably lower efficacy rate: just 66%.\n\nLook at those numbers next to each other, and it\'s natural to conclude that one of them is considerably worse. Why settle for 66% when you can have 95%? But that isn\'t the right way to understand a vaccine\'s efficacy rate, or even to understand what a vaccine does. And public health experts say that if you really want to know which vaccine is the best one, efficacy isn\'t actually the most important number at all.\n\nFurther reading from Vox:\n\nWhy comparing Covid-19 vaccine efficacy numbers can be misleading: https://www.vox.com/22311625/covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-johnson-moderna-pfizer\n\nThe vaccine metric that matters more than efficacy: https://www.vox.com/22273502/covid-vaccines-pfizer-moderna-johnson-astrazeneca-efficacy-deaths\n\nThe limits of what vaccine efficacy numbers can tell us: https://www.vox.com/21575420/oxford-moderna-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-trial-biontech-astrazeneca-results\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what\'s really driving the events in the headlines.

285,AsVVeTaSZxE,Arrival of Two Million Doses of Sputnik V Vaccines (Government Procurement) 11/08/2021,"'Villamor Air Base, Pasay City\nNovember 8, 2021\n\n“Let me express my gratitude to the Russian government for the continued supply of life-saving COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines. These deliveries affirm Russia’s commitment to achieve local vaccine equity and improving vaccine accessibility to countries, especially the Philippines,” said President Rodrigo Roa Duterte as he led the Government of the Philippines in receiving more than 2.8 million doses of Sputnik V vaccines procured by the national government at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City.\n\nThe President, together with several Cabinet members and Ambassador Marat Pavlov of the Russian Federation to the Philippines, inspected the vaccine crates containing the doses and affixed a ‘Resbakuna’ sticker in one of the crates. He also received the ceremonial turnover of a Sputnik V vaccine vial during the program proper.\n\n“I deeply appreciate Russia’s efforts in fostering cooperation in various areas including the fight against COVID-19. Goodwill initiatives, such as this vaccine donation and others, demonstrate the strong ties and friendship between Russia and the Philippines,” President Duterte underscored in his keynote message, while also acknowledging the different government agencies and other institutional partners for ensuring a steady supply of vaccines in the country.\n\nThe Chief Executive urged everyone to work together to put an end to the pandemic that has greatly affected the lives of Filipinos and the country’s economy for almost two (2) years now.\n\n“Rest assured that this administration is committed to securing safe and effective vaccines for all Filipinos. On this note, I appeal to all our kababayans to cooperate and do their part to help overcome this pandemic. The government cannot do this alone and we need your active participation by getting vaccinated and strictly following the minimum health standards,” he added.\n\nToday’s arrival of more than 2.8 million Sputnik V vaccines is one of the biggest shipments of Russian COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines and is expected to benefit more than 3.5 million Filipinos. This brings to a total more than seven (7) million doses of Russia’s COVID-19 vaccines supplied to the country out of the target of 10 million doses.\n\nAmong the attendees in the event are National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19 Chief Implementer Secretary Carlito Galvez, Jr., Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Eduardo Año and Senator Christopher Lawrence ‘Bong’ Go.\n\n****\n\nConnect with RTVM\n\nWebsite: http://rtvm.gov.ph\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/presidentialcom and www.facebook.com/rtvmalacanang\nTwitter: @RTVMalacanang\nYouTube: @RTVMalacanang\nInstagram: @RTVMalacanangConnect with RTVM'",2021-11-09,3067,106,0,UC46YJ9p0d6MSUXRZFRZrwGQ,RTVMalacanang,2008-07-25,587000,16515

These included  restriction of movement, closure of establishments where close contact among individuals was  unavoidable, curfews, social distancing in public places -- later on wearing of face coverings and masks  were mandated. Seniors were restricted from leaving their homes. Classes were suspended. Travel bans  were put in place. Thousands of Filipinos lost their work and were repatriated. This led to loss of jobs and  devastation to the national economy. \nThe past year has been marked by tragedy, frustration, anxiety and mental suffering for many due to the  virus, and due to non-pharmacological interventions that had to be put in place to control transmission. \nIt has been a challenging year, and there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Finally, a pharmacological  solution: vaccines that were under development - are now available for us. There are more than 130  different vaccines that are being studied and it is certain that the technology for vaccine production will  improve in the coming months and years. \n\nUnfortunately, the Philippines, as a country that has not invested in vaccine manufacturing --- is part of the  majority of countries in the world that have to ""wait for their turn"" to buy /receive a sufficient number of  vaccines to prevent serious illness and death and slowly restore economic activity.\n \nHow many Filipinos can be expected to be vaccinated this year? What is the projected time of vaccination  for health workers and seniors. When will the general public start receiving vaccines? When will vaccines  become commercially available? What is the role of the local government unit? What is the role of the  private sector? \n\nWhat countries are into vaccine production and seem to be willing to collaborate with us to  get more vaccines in place at the earliest possible time? These and other questions about what would be  reasonable expectations for vaccine roll-out will be tackled in our Webinar entitled:  \nCOVID-19 Vaccines: Naiinip Ka Na Ba? \nStay Safe. Stay Healthy.
