0,jPs4_MeuX7U,"I love being a conspiracy theorist.  Maligned, slandered, hated....but still right üòé"
1,jPs4_MeuX7U,Politicians who pushed these injections should and must be held to account
2,jPs4_MeuX7U,"My husband nearly died of a massive heart attack after his second shot,  both our moms and my aunt had strokes, our best friend died from a heart attack,  my brother in law developed AFIB, I developed severe neuropathy and people in our neighborhood have also suffered adverse affects like these...everywhere we go, or random people we meet, or aquaintences all say the same things.  This is no joke!  Shame on them for crimes to humanity!!!"
3,jPs4_MeuX7U,"Just disregard the word ""rare"" because all of my vaxxed patients are injured and suffering."
4,jPs4_MeuX7U,"Dr John Campbell has constantly pushed for the truth, hopefully other nations news stations will follow ü§ô"
5,jPs4_MeuX7U,They forced you to choose between heart failure or Lose your job.
6,jPs4_MeuX7U,I guess all they so called conspiracy theorist before were right after all
7,jPs4_MeuX7U,What can go wrong when Dr BILL GATES ( by the way who has no medical degree at all ) makes himself the top Epidemiologist in the world ?
8,jPs4_MeuX7U,"This study is seemingly minimising the the number of those affected. I've heard, and it has been stated in the UK parliament by Andrew Bridgen MP, that studies showed that adverse events were 1 in 800!"
9,jPs4_MeuX7U,"Can you imagine how many would not have taken the jab if they knew this, the government cannot be allowed to do this again."
10,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"You're brave to discuss possible side effects from the 'Jab', John. I'm downloading this video just in case is dissappears. Thank you, Dr. John."
11,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"I'm in tears here after listening to Dr John Campbell.He is the first person to explain what has happened to me after having the COVID vaccine. I spent all my savings trying to find answers for severe burning and pins and needles and muscle weakness straight after my 2 nd vaccine. (No NHS drs available at that time) Diagnosed small fibre neuropathy. Not one doctor admitted what I was saying all along, that the vaccine had caused this!!"
12,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"i'll never forget how people treated me when i told them to avoid the vaccine.. i was already disollusioned with the world before 2020, and what followed just confirmed my disdain. glad theres still some people out there taking it seriously and talking about it"
13,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"Prof. Robert Clancy is an international treasure. Humility, humor, compassion, curiosity and of course great knowledge and skill. In a time of confusion, ignorance and pettiness it is a relief to hear him talk, giving hope to many people suffering with debilitating illness. Long may he live."
14,-Ea3UwYZnrA,Dr Campbell is a man of honor. He did not sell out to big pharma like so many other doctors and politicians. I wish you the best of everything. Thank you.
15,-Ea3UwYZnrA,Finally a brilliant review by Professor Clancy based on REAL research! All Doctors need to hear this to help their patients!
16,-Ea3UwYZnrA,Biggest psyops ever perpetrated on human mankind. Great work john.
17,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"I'd suffered with CFS for 15yrs at the time of the onset of the pandemic. My gut feeling told me not to get the vaccination, but I was given a really hard time about it. Thank goodness I listened to my gut! So thankful for this information üôè"
18,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"I‚Äôm a retired veterinarian. 

I could see from the start that mRNA had the potential to cause constant antigen production. 

Reverse transcription was taught when I went to vet school, 40 years ago."
19,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"Prof Clancy is a legend with his discussion relating the jabs and also alternative treatments for C-19, however he was widely censored and silenced in Australia for the last few years. He did a fabulous interview in 2021 on our national broadcaster in Australia discussing the ‚Äúhorse‚Äù medicine and the interview was wiped from the internet. So glad to see him on your channel uncensored."
20,2IXl4qJGrRk,He got more vaccines than all Texans together!
21,2IXl4qJGrRk,It seems reckless that they would even allow him to get that many shots
22,2IXl4qJGrRk,That is one Guiness Book of records that will never fall.
23,2IXl4qJGrRk,"Wow, this dude‚Äôs 5g signal must be off the charts!"
24,2IXl4qJGrRk,A young Italian woman was accidently given a Covid-19 vaccine batch by a nurse that should have been divided (into 6 shots?).  She became critically ill and it took her many months to recover. I think that she still has side-effects from the overdose.
25,2IXl4qJGrRk,He took all those shots so you don't have toüòÇüòÇüòÇ
26,2IXl4qJGrRk,The fact that you can get that many that frequently is disgusting
27,2IXl4qJGrRk,"The researchers analyzed his blood chemistries, which showed no abnormalities linked to his hypervaccination. They also looked at various markers to evaluate how his adaptive immune system was functioning, according to the study.

The adaptive immune system is the subsection of the immune system that learns to recognize and respond to specific pathogens when you encounter them throughout your life, Miller said. There are two main cell types in the adaptive immune system, T cells and B cells.

In chronic diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis B, immune cells can become fatigued from frequent exposure to the pathogen and lose the ability to combat it effectively, Schober said. Hypervaccination, in theory, could have a similar effect.

However, that‚Äôs not what the researchers found. Hypervaccination in this case increased the quantity (the number of T cells and B cell products) but did not affect the quality of the adaptive immune system, according to the study.

In total, the man got eight vaccine formulations, including mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, a vector-based vaccine from Johnson & Johnson and a recombinant-protein vaccine from Sanofi.

While very interesting from a scientific perspective, individual case studies like this must always be taken with a grain of salt, Miller said. Public health recommendations, which are based on very large, randomized control trials, are what people should look to for guidance, she added.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends Covid vaccination for everyone ages 6 months or older in the United States, following the vaccination schedules outlined on its website. Last week, the CDC updated its guidance to recommend an additional dose of the current Covid vaccine for people 65 and older.

Less than a quarter of adults and only 13% of children in the US have gotten the most recently recommended Covid vaccine, according to CDC data.

Covid hasn‚Äôt disappeared, and neither have vaccination conspiracy theories.

CDC drops 5-day isolation guidance for Covid-19, moving away from key strategy to quell infections"
28,2IXl4qJGrRk,"Doctors here in Australia would not allow someone to get vaccinations within the appropriate time frame. You definitely wouldn't be getting two, one in each arm at the same appointment. So my question is, how did he access this many vaccinations and why did the doctors allow it?"
29,2IXl4qJGrRk,Question is who let him get all this?  You mean he don't have records of getting this.
30,geXKovieb1E,It‚Äôs crazy how the majority of the population don‚Äôt have an inner monologue and don‚Äôt question anything.
31,geXKovieb1E,A good friend of mine aged 39 died last March. He hadn't had Covid but he had three jabs to stay employed despite my warnings. He thought I had jumped on some QNON bandwagon and asked me if i was an antivaxxer. I said NO I'd had all my vaccines but wasn't going to take this one as it was untested. March 4th last year he sat down in a chair to read and died. His wife went to talk to him but he had just gone without even a sign or noise! It was heartbreaking but an autopsy showed massive blood clots to his heart and brain. His funeral was horrible and people who had once shunned me are now wondering if they have made a huge mistake. I don't feel superior or even say see I knew it because it was terrible the way they put people through mandates and put pressure on them to 'save grandma!'
32,geXKovieb1E,The risks are NOT small. Bloody lies.
33,geXKovieb1E,The adverse events aren't rare. I know 3 vaxed injured people.
34,geXKovieb1E,"i did not take vaccine,.. i'm still alive,....!!"
35,geXKovieb1E,I never took the Jab. Nor did my 85 year old mother. We are both healthier than most people that took the Jab. I guess you can say we are PURE BLOODS.
36,geXKovieb1E,"If you have to be persuaded, reminded, pressured, lied to, incentivized, coerced, bullied, socially shamed, guilt-tripped, threatened, punished and criminalized ‚Ä¶ If all of this is considered necessary to gain your compliance ‚Äî you can be absolutely certain that what is being promoted is not in your best interest.‚Äù ‚Äì Ian Watson"
37,geXKovieb1E,This doesn't even talk about the turbo cancers and the psychosis.
38,geXKovieb1E,When will media outlets like this grow a conscience ?
39,geXKovieb1E,"Too late, harm has been done."
40,im3otpqYAiQ,The dude makes it sound like Myocarditis and pericarditis are just minor health conditions. What a joke
41,im3otpqYAiQ,Glad I made it through the gaslighting.
42,im3otpqYAiQ,‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt find anything else that was alarming‚Ä¶.‚Äù This is actually comical. Aren‚Äôt these enough??
43,im3otpqYAiQ,Didn't they destroy doctors careers who said this 2yr ago .. ?

45,im3otpqYAiQ,No one regrets not getting it

48,im3otpqYAiQ,Take the number of instances. Multiply by 75000
49,im3otpqYAiQ,Duh we said this on day one and the mainstream news called us conspiracy theorists lol such a joke
50,IMRTSwb3hCs,"I didn't get the shots but this whole experience permanently ruined my trust in the system. I don't care how many studies they do, I'll never ""trust the expert"" ever in my life."
51,IMRTSwb3hCs,What about those giant rubbery clots found in cadavers?  Could you please do a report on that?  They've never been seen by embalmers before 2021.
52,IMRTSwb3hCs,17 mill around the world rare ..... üôÑ Thats not called rare thats called crimes against humanity
53,IMRTSwb3hCs,Chris it‚Äôs not extremely rare. And you pushed that shot to no end!
54,IMRTSwb3hCs,But they said people were just conspiracy theorist remember lol
55,IMRTSwb3hCs,I‚Äôve met so many jab injured here in Australia. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ‚Äúrare‚Äù at all. Many years on they are still suffering.
56,IMRTSwb3hCs,"How long until it goes from extremely rare, to rare, to common?"
57,IMRTSwb3hCs,"Just watch Dr.John Campbell , he‚Äôs ahead of it all"
58,IMRTSwb3hCs,My favorite part about being a conspiracy theorist is not getting myocarditis.
59,IMRTSwb3hCs,IT'S NOT RARE
60,YVFAvoeFahI,Those who questioned and didn't get jabbed will never get an apology. But they have peace of mind knowing that they haven't got poison locked within their system.
61,YVFAvoeFahI,I agree with himüòéPeople should be the only ones Who Control their own BODY üíØ
62,YVFAvoeFahI,APOLOGY??? I want criminal charges filed.
63,YVFAvoeFahI,"The fact that the drugs quite obviously were not subject to an adequate peer reviewed clinical trial process along with that billions of people were denied informed consent is all kinds of illegal.

The definition of ""conspiracy"" simply means two or more people secretly agreed to carry out an illegal act.

Therefore, the entire thing was absolutely a ""conspiracy""... less the theory part."
64,YVFAvoeFahI,I don't take apologies. You are all an enemy to me. You tried to murder me
65,YVFAvoeFahI,I remember when ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù wasn‚Äôt a thing and if you told anyone they looked at you so strange. I‚Äôm glad of my decision now seeing the massive amount of injuries. And as I expected..the injured don‚Äôt have a voice. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
66,YVFAvoeFahI,"Stuff your apologies, and save it for the people who died!!!! The next life is not going to be bought or anything else that is what you are doing to get through this world üòâ"
67,YVFAvoeFahI,"don't feel sorry for us,we didn't take it lol"
68,YVFAvoeFahI,"It's not rare. We were threatened. Lost jobs, family, alienated, denied, ostracized from society. We were treated like 'terrorists'/criminals. We deserve compensation. The injured deserve 'reparations'."
69,YVFAvoeFahI,Not rare. Quit saying rare.
70,LfmhYVCCGhc,If you dont see theres a problem at this point you never will
71,LfmhYVCCGhc,"Joe Rogan is right ! 
Imagine defending Phizer in 2024‚Ä¶"
72,LfmhYVCCGhc,The fact that Joe Rogan is correct.  The ignorance of people that don‚Äôt do their own research ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
73,LfmhYVCCGhc,The only thing painful to watch is this show.
74,LfmhYVCCGhc,But we have increased death rates and loads of people have some new kind of blood clots that can be as long as a calamari. There‚Äôs something going on and obviously no one wants to take the blame so things are being silenced as long as they can.
75,LfmhYVCCGhc,Unfortunately the people that have died can't comment in this section
76,LfmhYVCCGhc,"""I'm just some idiot who tells jokes for a living. Nobody should listen to me."" -Joe Rogan"
77,LfmhYVCCGhc,"If you completely ignore VAERS and every other database worldwide and live in an alternative reality, then yeah, these covid injections are the best and safest vaccinations ever."
78,LfmhYVCCGhc,Dr Campbell here in the UK started off being in favour of blanket vaccination.  He changed.  Study from Australia - myocarditis and pericarditis went up by 65% after vaccination.      This was before covid actually entered Australia.    I'm super happy if you think the vaccine is great and suggest you keep on taking them.
79,LfmhYVCCGhc,How much are you getting paid to toe the state line?
80,mkZ1MabMEZw,This must have taken forever to grow that beard and film.
81,mkZ1MabMEZw,"Pfizer before covid: $60 billion in profit
Pfizer after covid: $122 billion in profit"
82,mkZ1MabMEZw,"Since most VAERS entries are entered by doctors or pharmacists, we can conclude the entries are accurate.  Since it takes nearly an hour to complete a VAERS report, we can also conclude the VAERS data is a small proportion of the actual events since most doctors will not spend the time to report."
83,mkZ1MabMEZw,Favorite VAERS factoid is how one entry says a vaccine turned the recipient into the incredible hulk.
84,mkZ1MabMEZw,"Sure wish doctors were this passionate about getting people off junk food, alcohol, and cigarettes."
85,mkZ1MabMEZw,Would love to hear your take in a Nuremberg trial setting.
86,mkZ1MabMEZw,I'M NOT READY FOR THE NEW WIGSüò≠üò≠
87,mkZ1MabMEZw,Thank you for informing us that VAERS is severely under reporting.
88,mkZ1MabMEZw,You should also say that most doctors didn‚Äôt even KNOW about this site and are being bullied/fired for bringing up red flags about this.
89,mkZ1MabMEZw,"My dad had a bad reaction and then collapsed 48 hours after receiving the booster. 
Cluster of skull fractures, bleeding in the brain, seizure upon arrival at the hospital, flown by helicopter to different hospital where he remained for 1 1/2 months. 
He‚Äôs now using a walker, trying to get back on his feet. His memory and general mental condition is coming back well, but he‚Äôs still messed up.. He‚Äôs 67 years old, had no serious health issues his entire life, was on no medications, a runner that was doing 6+ mile runs 2-3 times a week. Ran the NY marathon when he was younger."
90,u9sfVoHhIfM,I remember the fear on the faces of the grocery store staff who were working at the time when all of us were ordered to be home. The vaccine changed everything - for the better.
91,u9sfVoHhIfM,Being a Boomer means never having to admit you are wrong and dying before the disastrous consequences of your hubris are fully realized.
92,u9sfVoHhIfM,Agree: the public pushback on public health measures has made things worse for future pandemics.
93,u9sfVoHhIfM,"I admire Dr. Offit and agree with him, in principle, that the availability of vaccines in record time was lifesaving. I lost one relative to covid and nearly lost a friend who spent 36 days in the hospital because he hadn't yet decided whether to get vaccinated and ended up being severely ill. Many of their friends did get vaccinated after that ordeal. HOWEVER, I'm disappointed this podcast didn't mention a legitimate reason why some would have bristled at the mandate --- that by then, many people (Kyrie Irving among them, I think?) had been infected already. Also, was there irrefutable evidence that getting vaccinated would ensure you weren't contagious to others? I don't believe there was, so to portray it that way could have been more harmful than helpful to those at highest risk of death. This is why people are skeptical of public health now, myself included, and I would never have said that pre-pandemic. Some things were amazing and some things were handled very poorly, but at least Pfizer has raked in billions, right?"
94,u9sfVoHhIfM,"Where there is risk, there must be choice"
95,u9sfVoHhIfM,"Thank you for this thoughtful discussion, it‚Äôs good to reflect on some of what we went through (though we may wish to forget).  I‚Äôm grateful for much of what we learned and accomplished, still heartbroken about the loss of life before, and especially after the vaccines.  

I recently watched a great lecture by Johannes Krause from the Max Plank Institute on historical infectious diseases and human evolution.  He focused on recent research into plagues caused by Yersinia pestis, such as the Plague of Justinian, and the Black Death which killed 40-60% of Europe.  

It gives one pause to contemplate the possibility of civilization facing another infectious pathogen evolving with a mortality rate of Y. pestis, given how our recent pandemic revealed the power of fear and denial to drive human behavior."
96,u9sfVoHhIfM,"I am grateful for the vaccine.  I pushed hard to bet vaccinated as early as I could qualify and I succeeded in completing the  double vaccination three months before I got Covid.  I was pretty darned sick, but I did not die.  I was a 79 year old diabetic with asthma and high blood pressure.  Despite all that I survived.  I probably should have been hospitalized but not many people were leaving the hospitals once admitted.  Instead I doubled my asthma inhalers and rested as much as possible.  It took three weeks to be able to change the sheets on my bed by myself.  But I survived at home.  I attribute that to the vaccine."
97,u9sfVoHhIfM,"This is utter nonsense, and Paul Offit, who for a time actually flirted with reality, has apparently started getting worried about his paycheck. Congratulations to you all for destroying people's trust in public health, and this discussion seems to imply that you don't have any idea why."
98,u9sfVoHhIfM,The CDC messaging was abysmal and WHO was worse.
99,u9sfVoHhIfM,3:50 ‚Äúwe had to flatten the curve‚Äù
100,KBvys-kcJi0,I would like to thank the D.A.R.E. Program for teaching me to resist peer pressure and not experiment with drugs.
101,KBvys-kcJi0,I like how they ignore literally allllllll of the other evidence in young people. And only relate it to the latest booster. This is strictly damage control
102,KBvys-kcJi0,"Some of us have been screaming this for 3 years now....and we were mocked, ridiculed, and silenced on social media. So nice of the MSM to catch up."
103,KBvys-kcJi0,Pretty sad that everyone waits till the tv box says it‚Äôs dangerous.
104,KBvys-kcJi0,I don‚Äôt know anyone who regrets NOT getting that poison cocktail.
105,KBvys-kcJi0,"Still unvaccinated, and couldn‚Äôt be happier. ‚ù§üôè"
106,KBvys-kcJi0,Still unvaccinated and healthy as ever thank you Jesus ‚ù§Ô∏è
107,KBvys-kcJi0,The truth is slowly trickling out
108,KBvys-kcJi0,One thing about being a so called conspiracy theorist is that I will not have to worry about any of the side effects
109,KBvys-kcJi0,So glad I was able to resist the pressure to get injected with that garbage.
110,H0Y7sUfLFEA,"Being jealous of the US, especially for something healthcare-related, is a weird new feeling."
111,H0Y7sUfLFEA,"As someone who lives in Brazil (with a comorbidity), the fact that you have to beg people to get vaccines in the US is mind blowing to me. I have no idea when I'll be able to leave the house to walk my dog once a day without having a panic attack."
112,H0Y7sUfLFEA,"To all the young adults with anxiety: it is okay if you need moral support for your vaccine appointment. My mom came with me for my first dose, and since she was already vaccinated, they even let her stay with me through the whole process. But even just having a trusted friend or family member in the car with you can be a huge help."
113,H0Y7sUfLFEA,"Hang on, you guys are getting donuts?"
114,H0Y7sUfLFEA,"As someone who had covid last year and just got vaccinated, trust me, the vaccine side effects are WAY less painful than actually having it."
115,H0Y7sUfLFEA,"As a 27-year-old musician, I got my appointment within an hour of them going up this week, because I. WANT. TO. PLAY. SHOWS. AGAIN!!!"
116,H0Y7sUfLFEA,"Sent this video to an ""I'll do it later"" friend, now his first appointment is tomorrow at 10 :)"
117,H0Y7sUfLFEA,I'm 24 I work in Health Care and I got my first vaccine in December and the 2nd in January. Getting the vaccine and see everyone of of my coworkers get the vaccine had been incredibly helpful with my anxiety
118,H0Y7sUfLFEA,"I had a ""mild"" case back in October, I no longer get winded going upstairs as of last month but my sense of taste/smell is still... Off. Foods just randomly taste rotten some days. Covid sucks, y'all."

124,the81FQoAUI,Still waiting on part 2 How the Vaccine Side Effects Work
125,the81FQoAUI,Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
126,the81FQoAUI,How about a video about how they didn‚Äôt work out too well for the some that are no longer with us?
127,the81FQoAUI,"Perhaps you guys can take the vaccine yourselves, and do a daily vlog showing your results. Cheers."
128,the81FQoAUI,This aged well.
129,the81FQoAUI,You forgot to mention the heart attacks people are getting... Good job at not being biased!!
130,FZd3asOuwEw,"I think it's fascinating how just talking about the vax induces such disproportionately strong feelings in certain people. I mentioned it on another thread and I had people telling me I was gonna die and basically raging at the fact I was still alive.

These are the same people who claim to be pro-life. Just a reminder."
131,FZd3asOuwEw,"My very elderly stepmother announced one day, after reading some bullshit on her phone, that three, just THREE covid shots would completely destroy a person's immune system! Upon hearing this, my father (also very elderly but not quite so susceptible to bullshit) pulled his vaccination record card from his wallet and announced, ""We've had four shots already."" I presume that the expression on my stepmother's face was one of disappointed embarrassment."
132,FZd3asOuwEw,Sounds like serious mental health issues no matter how healthy he is.
133,FZd3asOuwEw,"I honestly doubt this. Medical see his vaccine status and see he‚Äôs already been vaccinated, they wouldn‚Äôt waste resources like this."
134,FZd3asOuwEw,"According to the right-wing misinformation, that man shouldn‚Äôt even be alive, but reality shows that he is."
135,FZd3asOuwEw,I've had 3 boosters since the initial 2 shots and I've not even had so much as a sore arm from any of them.  I forgot to add that I turned 72 this past September 3rd.
136,FZd3asOuwEw,"Absolutely fascinating, that guy has now so many microchips in his body, he probably works now as a G5 Cell tower üòâ"
137,FZd3asOuwEw,Lol.  There was that one dude in the UK who got ninety shots so he could sell the COVID shot cards to people who refused to get jabbed.
138,FZd3asOuwEw,"Pierce, you've had two hundred covid shots!

I'll be a LIVING GOD!"
139,FZd3asOuwEw,"I'm kinda disappointed. Considering what the Antivaxxers love to claim about the Vaccine, I was kinda hoping he turned into a real life Magneto."
140,uOxppT3gPpE,It amazes me how people are still in denial simply because their egos can't tolerate how wrong they have been this whole time. And on top of that they feel like they're the intelligent ones.
141,uOxppT3gPpE,Even mentioning this used to get you banned or fired. Was madness
142,uOxppT3gPpE,My heart breaks for all the people who felt pressure to take the jab.
143,uOxppT3gPpE,The way this  whole thing was handled has turned me complete anti vaxx. I hope everyone effected gets justice.
144,uOxppT3gPpE,"It‚Äôs amazing how some people are still so trusting and naive, even after they‚Äôve been lied to. And after they KNOW they‚Äôve been lied to"
145,uOxppT3gPpE,I'm still 17 and took vaccine at 15 yrs age... After vaccine my health got downhill and developed high Bp and heart issues and I'm still youngüò¢üò¢
146,uOxppT3gPpE,"I'm a simple man. When the Dr. who created the MRNA technology said it wasnt safe, that is all i needed to hear."
147,uOxppT3gPpE,This is like when the police investigate the police to find that there was no misconduct by the police.
148,uOxppT3gPpE,It blows my mind how many people actually took the jab. It was so obvious what was going on...
149,uOxppT3gPpE,"One of my relatives developed pericarditis three days after taking 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine. He was absolutely healthy previously and he is in his early twenties. Kaiser doctors at the beginning were trying to deny any connection to vaccine. He was several times in and out of the hospital now and finally they admitted that it's related to vaccine. Also, my mother-in -law developed bone cancer after the ""shot"". My sister in law's mother just passed away after her cervical cancer returned after long remission after the ""shot"". My other's sister-in-law father developed severe heart issue also right after the shot, to the point that he is dying now. Of course, they are all older people, but what is striking is the timing of this.  I have not taken the shot, neither my child and nor my husband because 10 years ago when we took swine flu vaccine we all got severe side effects, and that is why we did not take any covid shots. My husband developed stroke then ( absolutely healthy 36 year old), I almost died from Guillain-Barre syndrome , my child developed severe neuropathy, and my husbands uncle had a heart attack. Again coincidence? I was very healthy before the flu shot, and now I am almost disabled. I did regain some of my health after the Guillain Barre  , but I am still have severe residual symptoms. I am a microbiologist and have also medical background and I would never take another vax even if threatened. It is a poison, you might not believe me and think it is just all some kind of conspiracy nonsense , but I hope you will heed the warning! Lot of smart people, scientists and doctors spoke against it, but the censorship is very live and strong on YT"
150,P3nXJB5PoBM,My best friends wife will never walk again after she took the experiment.  She was 43 when she got the experiment.
151,P3nXJB5PoBM,"Hey David, you seem like a really smart guy. May I give you a little unsolicited advice? Forget about politics for a moment. Forget about political parties for a day and go out into the world and try to find the truth about this. Do research online. Talk to doctors. Talk to families of healthy young people who just suddenly drop dead. Do some digging and follow the truth wherever it takes you. If you are able to take politics out of your research you will find some semblance of the truth. And the truth is scary."
152,P3nXJB5PoBM,"Anecdotally I personally know 7 people who were hospitalized with pericarditis,myocarditis or embolisms within 2 weeks of vaccination. 3 others ‚Äúonly ‚Äú had temporary Bells Palsy within a week of getting the first booster. No one died. I know of 3 deaths from COVID pneumonia and 3 or 4 serious illnesses. The overwhelming majority of the people I know who have had COVID were barely ill. Most were unvaccinated."
153,P3nXJB5PoBM,My Aunt died three days after having the v. She was an athlete who‚Äôs heart just stopped in her sleep. I know a guy who can no longer walk after complications from the v.
154,P3nXJB5PoBM,My university professor died right after his 3rd dose. He said he would take the week off for that and that was the last time we saw him. Also my ex-girlfriend is now battling with Von Willebrand disease and has severe heart issues. She had none of that before getting vaccinated.
155,P3nXJB5PoBM,Why does David ask for comments if he doesn‚Äôt read them?
156,P3nXJB5PoBM,My friend is dead..35 years old .a roofer..said he got the shot to protect his daughter .died of heart attack...so suck it
157,P3nXJB5PoBM,"This guy is confident in ""the studies we have"". What studies? Drug company's studies? The government in Great Britain is starting to examine the excess deaths problem, why aren't we doing that here?"
158,P3nXJB5PoBM,"Pakman, these comments should tell you evetything you need to know. I understand you probably haven't missed a booster, but living in denial of the fact that these things are extremely unhealthy for humans is not going to make it all go away. We need to share truth to the masses."

I see alarming rates of sudden adult death syndrome among 20-50 yrs. I've never seen this prior to 2021. 
David, I'm afraid you are going to look back at this and realize you were lied to. You better pray, David, because there are a lot of ppl who mocked ppl like this woman that are 6 feet under."

164,xYW-o8CNQiU,Do you know what doesn't exist?  A single human who regrets NOT taking those shots.

175,85ZicYaZsbQ,THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
176,85ZicYaZsbQ,Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
177,85ZicYaZsbQ,Nazarin is a smart girl who has learned to think for herself üëè
178,85ZicYaZsbQ,"I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer."
179,85ZicYaZsbQ,"Well over 65M Americans had zero jabs and are not ""being hospitalized and/or dying at higher rates"".  If that were the case, it would be relentlessly covered by the news media, yet we hear nothing of the sort."

181,fdGj6p2qDdk,"Congratulations on your true endeavors. I'm old enough to remember at a very early age the polio sugar cube to help fight the disease. At that time..we had no fear of an attempt in eradicating the polio virus, no politics involved."

187,fdGj6p2qDdk,Where is Dr. Luc Montagnier ?  He should have been there !!!!
188,fdGj6p2qDdk,"Nakahara et al, September 19 2023...published findings...large study of people without symptoms of myocarditis.  People with no external signs of myocarditis yet had received the mRNA shot had evidence of heart damage. Whereas those who did not receive any mRNA shot showed normal functional hearts.  Explains the uptick in sudden deaths among the vaccinated."

193,Y0sg9G5BBVU,This aged like fine milk.
194,Y0sg9G5BBVU,Thanks jimmy!  I was just about to get the vaccine and now I definitely never will!
195,Y0sg9G5BBVU,"If you remained a pure blood through 2 years of social engineering, congrats. Seriously"
196,Y0sg9G5BBVU,Calling people stupid and belittling them is100% the correct way to ensure they will NOT change their mind about getting the vaccine
197,Y0sg9G5BBVU,A 53 yr old doctor paying off student loans while in retirement is not a doctor I'd want to listen to.
198,Y0sg9G5BBVU,The gut is almost never wrong. Congrats to everyone who listened to their guts.

He said, ""I stayed away from you guys as long as I could"".  True story"
203,Jb2YMvfvm_M,My best piece of advice I ever got from an elderly person was to stay away from mainstream healthcare for as long as your body allows. Do everything in your power to stay fit and healthy to ensure you don't need any medical interventions. I only now truly understand what he meant.
204,Jb2YMvfvm_M,"Years ago, one of my pre-med professors told my entire class to never take a drug within it's first 5 yrs of development unless your life depends on it because researchers never really know the extent of what a drug can do until it's administered to a massive population of people.

206,Jb2YMvfvm_M,"Let's be clear. The only reason the CDC released ""SOME"" of the Vsafe data was because they lost a court case to keep it suppressed. After losing the court case they only released data on people who checked a preprogrammed list of side effects. They did not publish the date from the ""other"" empty text box where you could describe something not on the provided checkbox list. That is going to be the most important data. The lawsuit continues. Stay tuned."
207,Jb2YMvfvm_M,"The longer this has gone on, the more relieved I am that I never got the jab."
208,Jb2YMvfvm_M,"Some people would never accept this as they were brainwashed into taking it,  really sad."
209,Jb2YMvfvm_M,"My best friend died a few months ago from a blood clot.. he was laid in his chair for two days until a neighbour alerted the Police to kick down his door to find him.

He laughed at me when I tried to tell him not to take this poison, I told him that his immune system would fight the virus off.. but he didn‚Äôt listen. He had every shot and every booster shot.. now he is gone."

212,eFx-d0SvOVg,It hurts my brain listening to Bri still trying to gaslight us.
213,eFx-d0SvOVg,The way they are trying (and failing) to explain how the vaccines are still beneficial is so embarrassing...
214,eFx-d0SvOVg,Robert Malone told everyone this from beginning and has been proven right every step of the way
215,eFx-d0SvOVg,"What a dilema for Bri. ""How do I make myself right when everything proves me wrong."""
216,eFx-d0SvOVg,"Stop using the word ""vaccines"" for those shots."
217,eFx-d0SvOVg,"Duh!! Those of us who actually read the science and abstained from this experiment tried to tell you all that these vaccines were not what they were being sold as!! It's called High-zone tolerance, a type of immune fatigue. Bri, you owe people an apology!"
218,eFx-d0SvOVg,"Bri, don't assume everyone is as ignorant about this issue as you are"
219,eFx-d0SvOVg,I am greatly encouraged by these comments. So good to see so many people refused to take the jab!
220,NGxPkc_9uhY,Hats off to Florida Surgeon General Director Joseph Lapado! He is a courageous man and is taking a stand against the global vaccine mafia!ü•∞
221,NGxPkc_9uhY,"Florida's Surgeon General is correct. The shots have given rise to increased 'turbo-cancers' of all kinds. Many Oncologists are experiencing the increased numbers, especially among young people. This is serious and his concerns for safety should be considered."
222,NGxPkc_9uhY,"My neice died of an aggressive  cancer, she was vaccinated,  my brother in law had continuous strokes and died and my mums partners son had chest pains after getting the vaccine and died 2 weeks later, my friend got blood clots 2 days after and her daughter got cancer which is now cured rank goodness. I have never ever in my life seen so many funerals like I did after this vaccine came out. This doesn't just happen."
223,NGxPkc_9uhY,Avoid the clot shot
224,NGxPkc_9uhY,Thank you for speaking out Dr. Lapado.  We need strong voices.
225,NGxPkc_9uhY,Dont take the poison
226,NGxPkc_9uhY,I know nurses who were very angry over the covid deaths and the shots. They knew their patients were not dying from covid but the doctors were putting it down as cause of death.
227,NGxPkc_9uhY,They won‚Äôt admit that they are wrong
228,NGxPkc_9uhY,"Good going, Florida Surgeon General ! It‚Äôs so great to see an HONEST Doctor with a working conscience and integrity speak-out life-vital truth and warnings against these deceptively and evilly pushed/ coerced by threat bio-weapons."
229,NGxPkc_9uhY,We do have the data and the data shows it wasn't worth it.
230,I9S2jooTxkQ,"I‚Äôm a person with MS, when the vaccine came out, I called the manufacturer and asked them about it if there is a adverse reaction with my MS, they said call your doctor and we don‚Äôt know. I called my doctor and he didn‚Äôt know either, so I decided not to get the vaccine."
231,I9S2jooTxkQ,"In April 2021, I had shots 1 and 2 of Pfizer. I am a 25-year MS patient.  I was walking FINE prior to this. Within 1 HOUR of shor 2, I was not walking. 
I then did not walk for 15 months, had Covid 3 times, and shingles twice. Fought through and fired 4 neurologists who all said I had gone progressive with my MS until FINALLY getting a full head-to-tail MRI, which showed my scans were the same stable scans that I have had for the last decade. 
It is not my MS. It was neuroinflammation from the vaccine. There are a whopping TWO doctors that I will trust...  MANY want to silence us the vaccine-injured."
232,I9S2jooTxkQ,"Im a nurse practitioner and was essentially forced to take the jab due to the company I worked for requiring it. I reluctantly gave in and got vaccinated in May 2021. I was diagnosed with MS in June 2022. It was the worst decision I ever made. I have no doubt it gave me MS, but my neurologist and healthcare colleagues think Im wrong. Thanks for covering this. Im suffering for not standing up to my beliefs"
233,I9S2jooTxkQ,"My next door neighbor has now been told she‚Äôs got MS , the last few yrs have destroyed her former self . My mum and her husband both died within a year . I told them to wait but nobody listened , my daughters listened , thankfully üôè"
234,I9S2jooTxkQ,"This is so frustrating.
I am an ICU nurse with MS. When the vaccine came out, everyone was like are you getting it? Aren't you in immunosuppressive drugs?
I said actually until I can see that is proven to not cause relapse I will not.

I fought with my employer against vaccination for 2 years and finally won having a permanent exemption. Because there are case study of severe relapse.  So glad I am a heath care worker and know how to stand up for myself and to think for myself."
235,I9S2jooTxkQ,I was a fit and healthy 28 year old with no prior health symptoms (with the exception of very occasional asthma). I woke up with sudden leg numbness and lack of balance not long after my second vaccine. Multiple sclerosis diagnosis has since followed. I struggle to believe these aren‚Äôt connected. Never again will I be bullied into taking any medical intervention from the government again.
236,I9S2jooTxkQ,"It screams cover-up when we aren't ""allowed"" to talk about a potential health crisis."
237,I9S2jooTxkQ,"In April 2021 I was a healthy 60-year-old woman and wanted to have a little bit of life back. I decided to get the Pfizer vaccine and I told my husband to let me go first and see how I do since he has some medical issues. I thought I did fine and got the second one but within a couple of weeks something was very wrong, but I didn't think about the vaccine I thought maybe my age.  My balance was off, I had a tightness around my waist, I didn't want to drive at night, and my personality had changed.  My daughter started googling and said it sounds like MS.  My daughter asked a friend that was a doctor and he said he didn't think so. My age was the main reason. 
I will skip ahead to January 2023 and finally had an MRI and had many lesions. In my report, it said, ‚Äúsomewhat old for this active MS.‚Äù  My next step was a spinal tap and I had the bands in my fluid.  I was finally diagnosed with MS.  In April I started Ocrevus.  My life has changed so much in the last 2 years.  I am 99.999 percent sure it was the vaccine that caused my MS."
238,I9S2jooTxkQ,"Those of us that never got one üíâüíâüíâare to be congratulated on resisting the biggest media drive/campaign ever perpetuated on humans, and resisted all manner of pressure put forth by all manner of people. IF these people EVER get serious about conducting an authentic study they will have a control group, which they would not have had if we‚Äôd all buckled under the pressure and taken the üíâüíâüíâüíâ. Congrats everyone! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
239,I9S2jooTxkQ,"My immediate family and I refused (repeatedly) THE shots and we never had c***d!

251,3rIQHrbDguM,"I‚Äôm a nurse. Got fired from my job for refusing. I recognized the BS immediately. The pressure from other nurses, doctors and my wife was immense. They lied about it all. It makes me happy to hear how many in the military refused."

308,3GVGd3Ckrxk,It wasn‚Äôt worth the risk if it didn‚Äôt provide immunity
309,3GVGd3Ckrxk,Never go to a doctor for health advice.

311,UijQ-6jhVuc,"I‚Äôm not against getting the vaccine , I feel you have the right to choose ! What I am against is the government mandating it and forcing it on everyone"
312,UijQ-6jhVuc,This happened to me! I got my first dose and a few weeks later I was hospitalized and my platelets were VERY low and my red blood cells were EXTREMELY high. The doctor said I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be alive. I had the Pfizer vaccine. I regret I ever got that shot.
313,UijQ-6jhVuc,I seem to remember the tobacco companies investigating whether cigarettes caused cancer.
314,UijQ-6jhVuc,My mother died 20 days after her vaccination - 24 hours after vax - she got thrombocytopenia and died a horrific death. Never will forgive for what happened.
315,UijQ-6jhVuc,The best part about being a conspiracy theorist is not having myocarditis.
316,UijQ-6jhVuc,My sister in law had several strokes after her first booster. She was the healthier member of our family and in her early 50‚Äôs. She said she had felt different after the shots. I‚Äôm grateful I never got vaccinated. Bummed that two of my kids did get vaccinated üôè
317,UijQ-6jhVuc,"In other words, he'd probably still be living had he not gotten the vaccination."
318,UijQ-6jhVuc,I love how they are still trying to override our common sense ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
319,UijQ-6jhVuc,"My dad almost died after getting his Covid shot. He was hospitalized then eventually moving to a retirement home. He lost the ability to walk after being bedridden for so many months. 

Doctors were quick to deny that the shot had anything to do with it. They were quick to change the subject too."
320,HtTalpY-J-M,"As long as he pays for 211 of those shots out of pocket, maybe very roughly around 21100 euro, not a big deal."
321,HtTalpY-J-M,It's good to know the vaccine is safe to use.
322,HtTalpY-J-M,"no proof, no identity, just words."
323,HtTalpY-J-M,"AND THE DOCTORS WOULD ALLOW HIM TO DO THAT??? 
PLEEEZE...B.S"
324,HtTalpY-J-M,Wasn't this video supposed to be posted on April Fools Day?
325,HtTalpY-J-M,Oh god !! How can it be possible??
326,HtTalpY-J-M,"In todays late news..He exploded 3 minutes after this footage was doctored...err, filmed."
327,HtTalpY-J-M,Uh... why?
328,HtTalpY-J-M,So one example is the base for leftist science now?
329,HtTalpY-J-M,"Next, a report on old people who smoked their whole lives"
330,_SeY5K8EgSg,Let‚Äôs all just agree we witnessed the greatest experimental trial study in human history. Ever body lined up like Guinea pigs when it wasn‚Äôt  necessary.
331,_SeY5K8EgSg,it was a miracle so many fell for it
332,_SeY5K8EgSg,Brought to you by Pfizer
333,_SeY5K8EgSg,I thank God everyday for making me a Conspiracy Theorist üôè

336,_SeY5K8EgSg,The Earth is healing üòä
337,_SeY5K8EgSg,I‚Äôm going to my friends funeral on Wednesday as a result of the Covid vaccine they are paying his family liabilities
338,_SeY5K8EgSg,Because people don't have healthcare access. Beyond frustrating that Republicans still think abortion access is why birth rates are down. Healthcare and rent costs have made it so having children is a privilege for the upper crust.
339,_SeY5K8EgSg,Because it‚Äôs no good!!
340,vilMNHn4Yh8,A tragedy‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..I still wonder every day why people willingly did this while the rest of us had our guts screaming NO!
341,vilMNHn4Yh8,Fear is temporary. Regret is forever.
342,vilMNHn4Yh8,"It's too late now, the damage is done. You all followed like mindless sheep. I was suspicious from day one and became much more alarmed the moment legal immunity to the manufacturers was mentioned. We'll perhaps never know the true extent of damage, people dying too soon but their families not joining the dots. It's very sad. People still have not learned and will thrust their arm out for the next one."
343,vilMNHn4Yh8,This must be taken to court as the biggest crime against humanity
344,vilMNHn4Yh8,"my family and church friends called me selfish with no love for others. They rejected me, but my mega disabled son and I are vaxxed free. God gave me the strength even though we spent almost a month in hospital."
345,vilMNHn4Yh8,It‚Äôs far worse than they are saying.
346,vilMNHn4Yh8,ZERO vaccine here üòÇ üëá
347,vilMNHn4Yh8,"‚ÄúIf you have to be persuaded, reminded, pressured, lied to, incentivized, coerced, bullied, socially shamed, guilt-tripped, threatened, punished and criminalized ‚Ä¶ If all of this is considered necessary to gain your compliance ‚Äî you can be absolutely certain that what is being promoted is not in your best interest.‚Äù ‚Äì Ian Watson"
348,vilMNHn4Yh8,Sunik stood up in the house and said the jabs were perfectly safe ..2 weeks ago ! I bet his family did not have one !!
349,vilMNHn4Yh8,They say side effects are rare...BS ...everyone who took it has some issue
350,r62K2ZzOEko,Time has told & time told us tucker was right the hole time!
351,r62K2ZzOEko,What's crazy is...Tucker has told the truth the entire time
352,r62K2ZzOEko,Tuckert speaks more truth in a 2 minute commentary than this crap of a network does in a year.
353,r62K2ZzOEko,"15,000 ""coincidences"" reported on VAERS so far."
354,r62K2ZzOEko,"""When stupidity is considered patriotism, it is unsafe to be intelligent."" Isaac Asimov."
355,r62K2ZzOEko,Love ‚ù§ Tucker Carlson !! Truth teller if ever there was one...üôåüôåüôå
356,r62K2ZzOEko,"As a medical professional who mostly enjoyed my six years working & teaching at a great US university hospital, back in the 90s, I have finally decided to stop watching news from this once leading nation. All this absurdity and proud ignorance concerning basic medical protocols is sickening and perverse."
357,r62K2ZzOEko,Dang he just went right into proving his point and not even realising it.
358,r62K2ZzOEko,I was never able to understand how Paul Ryan could stand up straight with his complete lack of a spine.
359,r62K2ZzOEko,"This ain't going to age well, already tucker is proving he is right about the vaccine side effects"
360,rNaIMC4XMhc,"""The principle of decision making on my body are more important than any title."" immortal words"
361,rNaIMC4XMhc,"Asked him if he was willing to potentially stump his career for his principles, came back in 2023 and won 3 out of 4 slams. What an athlete and what an ambassador.."
362,rNaIMC4XMhc,"Still watching this interview after Novak has a record 23 slams. So satisfying that he stood by his values and principles, and STILL managed to break the Grand Slam record. Elite person and an Elite athlete."
363,rNaIMC4XMhc,"The man is a hero.
BBC will never understand what it means to be a hero."
364,rNaIMC4XMhc,"It brings tears to my eyes when the interviewer asks him if he is willing to let go of the opportunity to be the best tennis player ever and he just smiles and says ""yes"" üò• He should not have to make such a choice üò™ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bless his heart for standing up for freedom. This moment should go down in history."
365,rNaIMC4XMhc,And he won the Australian Open 2023. What a great player.
366,rNaIMC4XMhc,This guy is much more than a Tennis legend. He is a legend to the world for standing up for what‚Äôs right. God bless
367,rNaIMC4XMhc,Mad respect for this man. A real man. Exemplary.
368,rNaIMC4XMhc,This is what a person of principle looks like.

Love this man ‚ù§"
370,Z-zWo835gOs,The doctor does not have to justify why she hasn't had a vaccine to anyone...and neither do I!
371,Z-zWo835gOs,I'm a doctor myself and my issue is the mandating of the vaccine for NHS workers or anyone else for that matter. Compelling people to put something into their bodies that they don't want is a dangerous road to go down
372,Z-zWo835gOs,"Anytime a news presenter has the audacity to argue about medical matters without scientific basis to a medical doctor, the World has gone mad!"
373,Z-zWo835gOs,This is a doctor I trust - good on her for standing her ground!
374,Z-zWo835gOs,Dr Robert Malone (One of the founding inventors on mRNA technology) says: 'This is the first time in history that the ineffectiveness of a vaccine has been blamed on those who have not taken it!'
375,Z-zWo835gOs,"Firstlt, why is a news reporter arguing with a doctor? Ya‚Äôll are not the same. Secondly, why not tell grandpa to get vaccinated instead of blaming other people for putting grandpa ‚Äúat risk‚Äù?"
376,Z-zWo835gOs,"What really annoys me about the media is the whole ethical issue, trying to emotionally blackmail people. But forget that it is highly unethical to force people to have treatment that they don‚Äôt want! We all have a right to decide what to do with our own bodies and should not be discriminated against."
377,Z-zWo835gOs,"I was worried what the comment section would look like, but it is so refreshing to see people applauding someone for voicing their opinion instead of vilifying them as the reporter is doing."
378,Z-zWo835gOs,She‚Äôs being RESPONSIBLE for being cautious and wanting to learn more.
379,Z-zWo835gOs,I get to choose what I put in MY body. Fully support this doctor. I never listen to the media or the government. Always using spin. WELL DONE THAT DOCTOR!!
380,WhiBpmH1mE4,Crazy!   I'd love an update on him several years from now.
381,WhiBpmH1mE4,"He‚Äôs fine, he‚Äôll probably live to üíØ"
382,WhiBpmH1mE4,"How was he able to get all those vaccinations, and why would you want to? ü§™"
383,WhiBpmH1mE4,"An old and wise African American man once told me. "" You can write anything thing on paper, don't make it true!"". So I'd take this with a grain of salt. If true, let's see how he is in a year or two. He should have got a six shooter and played a game of Russian Roulette, same thing IMOü§î"
384,WhiBpmH1mE4,Let‚Äôs talk to this man in a year!

387,WhiBpmH1mE4,"He is now a property of, make and model, and is patented to what ever company decided to participate in this study.

388,WhiBpmH1mE4,"Ferrets have one of the closest immune type to humans.
UK has roughly 500000 (half million) Ferrets.
Ferrets spread influenza to humans.
Not a single case of 1 Ferret contracting, spreading or dying of Sars Cov2.

390,noNa3WUGpC8,The problem is how willing the vast majority of the public are to being controlled.
391,noNa3WUGpC8,What‚Äôs insane is the WEF talked about ‚Äúwinning back trust‚Äù in their meeting the other day. All trust is forever gone. This life has truly become a joke. Those people are truly and utterly evil beyond words.
392,noNa3WUGpC8,WEF should stand for World Extinction Forum. Thank you Dr. Campbell for your courage and honesty.
393,noNa3WUGpC8,"At the beginning of COVID, I was very concerned about diseases....now I am just concerned about the society, the government and whom to trust."
394,noNa3WUGpC8,"""Disease X"" is a placeholder name until the marketing department comes up with something scary enough to work. Pretty standard for a newly manufactured product."
395,noNa3WUGpC8,It is a great honor to listen to you from Northern Mexico. I was trained as a scientist in Texas A&M University and you can be sure that I will never stop defending the truth in every way I can.
396,noNa3WUGpC8,"Sorry you had to take videos down, John. Sinister people are doing very questionable things and we don't hear about them until it's too late. I'm worried but I'm thankful for these videos keeping us informed. Thank you, Dr. John. You are a hero."
397,noNa3WUGpC8,I love the way you show what you are reading aloud and taking notes directly on the paper.
398,noNa3WUGpC8,How completely has the Pharmaceutical Industry been given the protection of NO ACCOUNTABILITY?
399,noNa3WUGpC8,"During covid, I followed you presenting lucid, clear, clinical truths about the status of what ""we the people"" were dealing with. You intellectually gave us what we needed to make good choices. Thank you for doing, not only your job as a medical doctor and researcher, but a good human being. I thank you for giving us the info that made the difference in our lives."
400,Li-oxKhvZy0,The body count between these three men is something truly impressive. And scary.
401,Li-oxKhvZy0,The crazy part is when you start thinking about who‚Äôs bossing around 3 former presidents and getting them to stand like kids in a school project delivering these scripts
402,Li-oxKhvZy0,Imagine a virus with its own PR campaign
403,Li-oxKhvZy0,"I have never felt as lied to at this level ever as I did just now, seriously, the level of creepiness of this is UN-President'ed."
404,Li-oxKhvZy0,I am sure the true number of dislikes are probably 100k or more.
405,Li-oxKhvZy0,Thinking a politician cares about you is like thinking a stripper really likes you for your personality. We do not want your experimental drugs
406,Li-oxKhvZy0,"Hysterical watching George W. Bush on the Sunday shows being treated like a saint and a statesman, after these same shows spent every second of his 8 years in office calling him a racist, a liar, an idiot, a war criminal, illiterate and a crook."
407,Li-oxKhvZy0,I‚Äôve never seen America more united than in this comment section
408,Li-oxKhvZy0,Is there any video of them actually getting the shot? I‚Äôd bet it was saline.
409,Li-oxKhvZy0,The only up-shot of this advert is that they look cold. It'll be a lot hotter where they are going.

420,KJvsp3Ayzss,"One very important law needs to be passed, i.e. if pharma manufacturing companies cannot be held liable then at least those politicians who encouraged mandating these vaccines should be."
421,KJvsp3Ayzss,"Why do they call for extreme lockdowns over a few covid cases, but the neurological side effects which is affecting thousands upon thousands of people are called ""rare"" side effects?"
422,KJvsp3Ayzss,Rare is Starting to look like a Pandemic of its own
423,KJvsp3Ayzss,"Nothing says ""trust the science"" quite like ""you can't sue us if something goes wrong"" and ""we need 75 years to release the data to the public""."
424,KJvsp3Ayzss,"When you start adding the deadly blood clots, the strokes, heart attacks, pericarditis & myocarditis, embolysms, paralysis, then, clearly, the severe adverse raction aren't that ""rare"" at all."
425,KJvsp3Ayzss,‚ÄúRare‚Äù has been so overrated. It‚Äôs ‚Äúrare‚Äù because it‚Äôs so underreported or non-reported by mainstream media. Shame!
426,KJvsp3Ayzss,It‚Äôs only rare when it doesn‚Äôt happen to you.
427,KJvsp3Ayzss,"I remember a time when 50 people died or had horrible side effects, The drug was removed from the trials. Ahhh the good old days when you could actually trust the science and medication."

431,1m_iclAMXLo,"O my God, he changed his mind  when more information became available as time went on!!Sounds like a smart person"
432,1m_iclAMXLo,He changed his mind when 30 year olds suddenly starting dying having heart attacks on an alarming rate. Fair play on him for speaking out.
433,1m_iclAMXLo,Being sold a lemon and then realizing later it was a lemon isn‚Äôt flip flopping.
434,1m_iclAMXLo,Making vaccines available and making it mandatory are completely different.
435,1m_iclAMXLo,All states need to investigate Covid
436,1m_iclAMXLo,"Honestly, people that spread misinformation should be held accountable for the deaths they caused."

472,K3odScka55A,First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
473,K3odScka55A,"I think the problem is ultimately the education about these vaccines. The information needs to be transparent, clear, relatable, and easy to understand. This kind of video needs to be more accessible and shared around on common media so people understand."
474,K3odScka55A,This is what you call proper explanation of the vaccine efficacy statistics.
475,K3odScka55A,Vox is really good at designing infographics that make complex topics more digestible. I appreciate all the effort!
476,K3odScka55A,"When the info about ""efficacy rates"" are being thrown around publicly without trying to educate to the public what it actually means.... its stressful to try to explain to people cause they tend to believe rumors. Thankyou for this vid!"

485,Kd-E95tXfsY,"but if it really works, why is that pharma companies producing that COVID 19 evade legal sanctions and no liability if it fails, since they said it is effective (theoritically)..."
486,Kd-E95tXfsY,So what happens when the M spike goes through structural changes such as in the case of the new variants?  I assume vaxxed and unvaxxed will be in the same position after a few months.  Simply put we cannot keep chasing these variants by vaccinating every few months. It‚Äôs not practical or good for our overall health.

523,iyo2UNQcdpQ,"My Father (74), had taken 5 jabs, he had been complaining for the last 2 years about chest and back pain, last week he collapsed and passed out, I called the paramedics, they told him he was just having a panic attack, later in the day I took him to the ER because he started to cough up blood. At the hospital they took an X-ray of his heart, gave him a sleeping pill and an injection of some muscle relaxant, they didn‚Äôt take blood or look for clots. We got him around 4:30 AM, I woke up to him in pain, I immediately started the truck to take him to the hospital and when I came back in to help him to the truck he collapsed and died in my arms. The ME wasn‚Äôt going to do an autopsy, but I pushed them to do one. They found myocarditis, several blockages in the arteries around the heart and hemorrhaging in the lungs. The worst part about all of this tragedy is that he trusted our State Funded Media here in Canada and the Government over his own loving family.

I can promise you, they‚Äôre not lining up any more for their shots, and it‚Äôs strange how silent they are about their shots now!

531,iyo2UNQcdpQ,My mother was a vivid high functioning person who ran an antique store and was an accomplished artists. When Covid hit my mother and father immediately got in line for the shot and every booster they could get! About two months after my father called me and said that they were having health problems. My mother was having a hard time with her memory and him with his general health. My mother is now in hospice and my father is not too far behind. It happened so fast! I know this can happen without a shot but it all seemed to start as soon as they got it.

533,iMx7kmld9sk,"Thank God. Some will be spared.
I took first/only Pf jab and had a heart problem since 4 days later. Then lost my job for not getting the 2nd one. Wish I hadn't given into the pressure at work and just quit instead. Can't get my health back.First thing I did was move from Oregon to Idaho, where old fashioned values still exist. Love the governor and the people.

553,pp-nPZETLTo,It has been a year. Would you consider creating an update on this discussion?
554,pp-nPZETLTo,Please consider revisiting this conversation a year later!!
555,pp-nPZETLTo,"I experienced several AEs listed on the Pfizer documents (which a judge forced them to share). Whatever happened to informed consent? Had I known of the risks, I would not have gotten the shots. I was healthy, on no prescription meds prior to the shots. My guess is those who are v-injured are under reported because MDs are not reporting to VAERs and/or encouraged not to do so."
556,pp-nPZETLTo,"My 42 year old Son was admitted to hospital Feb/2021 for low oxygen, spent a week in ICU, tested negative for COVID, under went many tests. Two months later was put on life support, treated for pneumonia, negative covid, sent to cardiology for treatment and more testing. Aug/21 hospitalized, on ventilator for lack of oxygen, again treated for pneumonia, negative for covid. Upon release was denied oxygen for home for lack of affordability.  He had received two Pyzer  covid shots, one in Mar/21 and second May21. He passed away Dec21, told that autopsy didn't show covid"
557,pp-nPZETLTo,"My father was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in February of 2021, they immediately tried to push the jab on him, I explained it like I was talking to a child because dad has brain damage from a stroke, I talked him out of taking that shit all together and I guarantee if I hadn't dad wouldn't be alive still today, and they had also gave him 6 months to live"
558,pp-nPZETLTo,I'd like to hear an update 1 year later on the scientific literature sited on this podcast
559,pp-nPZETLTo,"Whatever happened to ""herd immunity"" ? That's never discussed anymore."
560,pp-nPZETLTo,Hello! I am one of the few unfortunate people who has had serious adverse effects from the Moderna Covid vaccine. Most of them are neurological in nature now. Prior to the vaccine I had no health issues. I have been trying to get medical care for 10 weeks and the medical community just looks at me blankly. Can you direct me to any resources that could help?
561,pp-nPZETLTo,What about all the sudden deaths of athletes and young healthy people.
562,IxCHv7T_mao,I forgot where they put the title on YouTube videos...which is wild because I don't think it's been on top since like 2012.
563,IxCHv7T_mao,"I am terrified of needles. Normally when I hear people talking about vaccines I get super light headed and sometimes actually pass out. I'm slowly exposing myself to images and videos of vaccines and needles so that, when it comes time,  the process is easier for me. Getting the vaccine was never in question. I will not be responsible for someone's death if I can help it."
564,IxCHv7T_mao,"Hank, you realise the people will demand you recreate your 15 hours in Target video?"
565,IxCHv7T_mao,"i knew the ""yes"" was coming even before i clicked"
566,IxCHv7T_mao,"As a healthcare worker, this is the first time I‚Äôve heard anyone say they would get a vaccine to help me and it made me feel more things than I though it would. Thank you Hank."
567,IxCHv7T_mao,Thanks for clarifying that the vaccine testing regulations haven‚Äôt changed. That wasn‚Äôt clear to me
568,IxCHv7T_mao,"A little over a month ago I went to the ER and got diagnosed with appendicitis, the cases in my state weren‚Äôt super bad at the time and I was able to get care and a same day surgery. Which was good because when they took it out the surgeon said it was close to rupturing. The cases in my state have skyrocketed since and I can only imagine what people are dealing with in hospital. I am so incredibly thankful for them and all the people helping to end this pandemic and when it‚Äôs my turn I‚Äôll get a vaccine"
569,IxCHv7T_mao,The old vlogbrothers references made me tear up....idk why or if I‚Äôm just emotional but gosh I love this community. Thank you nerdfighteria for changing my life.
570,IxCHv7T_mao,"As someone in the Pfizer trial who has at times felt disheartened, as if I joined this study for nothing because people were just going to reject the science and ignore the vaccine, this video made my day. We have this light at the end of the tunnel and we should be (safely) celebrating. We're going to get through this, and it's not going to take years... we're down to months now. DFTBA."
571,IxCHv7T_mao,"I‚Äôm a public school teacher, I am 100% going to be taking a vaccine as soon as possible to make sure I don‚Äôt spread anything unintentionally to my students or colleagues. When we have the tools to stop suffering, we need to use them."
572,oMXGGmBfkf8,"Here are the answers to some common questions. Please note that this video is about the scientific basis of mRNA vaccines in general, not about any particular vaccine or manufacturer. This video is not sponsored by anyone and does not represent endorsement of any particular vaccine. The answers below are based on well-known, basic knowledge of mRNA/cell biology and immunology, which can be found in ANY TEXTBOOK. More Q&A may be added later.
Also note: this video was originally intended for our regular audience (med students), so it's more technical. We have a simpler version here: https://youtu.be/XTLYXmgG8DU
For comparison of different vaccines, as well as events of immune response, role of different immune cells (T-cells, B-cells, APC), see this video: https://youtu.be/osRo-yz1VQ8
Q1: How long the mRNA from vaccine will stay in human body? A: mRNA is very unstable, it is easily degraded by enzymes in our cells (RNAses). Average half-life of mRNA in human is around 10 hours. mRNA from vaccine is expected to stay no longer than a day.
Q2: How long the antigen (translated from mRNA vaccine) is expected to stay in our body? A: Several days. Once the immune system is activated, it will see the cells that carry the antigen as damaged and destroy them.
Q3: So from A to Q2, our immune system destroys our own cells, is that bad? A: No. This is the natural way the body detects foreign antigens, just like when an infection occurs ‚Äì infected cells display pieces of the virus to alert the immune system and get killed. The difference is that you can control the dose with the vaccine, unlike a natural infection. And the vaccine does not multiply. The number of our own cells that will be killed with the vaccine dose is negligible. The effect is also limited to the cells around the injection site. Note that traditional vaccines also work this way: the antigen delivered by a traditional vaccine is also taken up by some of our cells, it is then broken into pieces and displayed on the surface of the cell to be ""seen"" by the immune system. This is the only way for the immune system to detect foreign antigens. The body will replace the lost cells within several days. For more details see this video: https://youtu.be/osRo-yz1VQ8
Q4: So now the immune system will produce the antibodies, will it ever stop? A: It's the same process that happens when there is a natural infection. So, upon infection or vaccination, antibodies will take a couple of weeks to be produced, the level will peak for about a couple more weeks and then it will go down, no more production. But now the body remembers the virus because some memory cells are left - when you encounter the real virus these cells will produce antibodies again, this time instantly in response ‚Äì so fast that no infection will occur. If the body does not encounter the virus then, no antibodies will be produced.
Q5: How about side effects? A: All vaccines have side effects, mRNA or traditional. The list of side effects should be available online or at any location that offers the vaccine.
Q6: How mRNA gets into cells? A: It is delivered in lipid covering that will fuse with cell membrane (also consists of lipids) - it's called endocytosis.
Q7: Is this gene therapy? A: No, gene therapy involves replacing your gene with a new one, this vaccine does not touch your genes.
Q8: Can mRNA vaccine change my DNA? See full A in this video: https://youtu.be/XTLYXmgG8DU
Q9: I had COVID and recovered, do I still need the vaccine? A: You probably do not need the vaccine if your infection was recent, at least for now. The question remains is how long natural immunity will last, and how long protection by vaccine will last, we do not yet know the answers. UPDATE: 1 dose of mRNA vaccine in people with previous infection works as well as 2 doses in people without previous infection. Basically: previous infection gives the same immunity as 1 dose of mRNA vaccine."
573,oMXGGmBfkf8,So how does the message sequence stop the spike protein from repeating process multiple times and what is the estimated time sequence remains in manufacturing mode?
574,oMXGGmBfkf8,"Hey there, nice video, detailed and understandable. When the antigen is displayed on our own cells where it is recognized by the immune system 0:54 I would like to know what will happens as the immune system will start fighting our own cells with this new antigen display on its surface. It might be that the antigen are just release outside the cell, not causing the LT to attack the cells but only the antigen ?
And also if you have time, how does the vaccine target specific cells and will not spread in your body to integrate mRNA in cells like neurons. Thanks :)"
575,oMXGGmBfkf8,I got pfizer biontech shot today i can alredystart speaking german.
576,oMXGGmBfkf8,"It is very well done. Sound correct to me with the bio class I had. I had crazy hyper motivate teacher. It is sad that gov take for granted our willing to get this and no time to explain how it works like you do. Your comment section is gold for more precise info. I will do more research but you vid is by far the best one that not trigger my education from my old teacher.
Edit for grammar"
577,oMXGGmBfkf8,Where can we see the list of ingredients (active and inactive) utilized to create the vaccine ?
578,oMXGGmBfkf8,"I'm just wondering, is this technique has specificity on what cells it will endocytose? Doesn't seem like it will be specific to any as it uses lipid. Also, is it a single layer lipid, lipid bilayer or has the structure like extracellular vesicles."
579,oMXGGmBfkf8,"Please correct me if I'm wrong. If it is our self cells that are going to express the antigen, then it is going to be expressed by the MHC class 1 right? And only cd8 t cells bind to them and not cd4 t or b cells. We might have some memory cd8 t cells for that but we wont be able to produce antibodies against the virus? Or are we also expecting the lipid nanoparticle containing mRna to be engulfed by macrophages or something?"
580,oMXGGmBfkf8,"Love the vid! Just have a question and im sorry if i sound dumb. Can the cells with the rna of the vaccine still work as usual? For example, if we are altering how the cell detects foreign agents can the immune response to other diseases get  weaker or slower? Thx!"
581,oMXGGmBfkf8,"First of all thank you for the explanational video.
I read also the pinned and answered me a lot of questions.
I have one more and sorry if its somehow explained but as english is not my primary language I maybe missed than.
There are sayings that mrna (for covid) may create autoimmune ilnesses in long term (as its not 100% tested).. is something like that possible?
I am not afraid of immidiate effects I understand how it works (more or less) what I am worried is that it may cause an ilness in future.. is that possible?
Thank you"
582,zBObkBFMcyo,"OMG, I can't believe someone is finally saying this on live TV, in public. Finally.  I'm in shock."
583,zBObkBFMcyo,Mandating a vaccine for which the manufacturers take no responsibility is reprehensible IMO.  Where there is risk there must always be choice.
584,zBObkBFMcyo,VERY MISLEADING QUESTION- Vivek is exactly right about the origins of protection for big pharmaceutical companies.
585,zBObkBFMcyo,Vivek went into fiery beast mode and left them all speechless. This guy is smarter than all of the combined IQs on that stage.
586,zBObkBFMcyo,I have been waiting for years now for normies to wake and realize just what their government has done to them. And to their children. The depth and breadth of criminality here is unprecedented.
587,zBObkBFMcyo,"The moderators were cutting off Vivek every single time he spoke. You could hear them say okay, it's time, your time is up in his midsentence all the time. At one time, they asked question after question and then followed up with another question to""Irrelevant Christie"" just not ask Vivek a question because he was next in line.If you watched the debate, one could see that like daylight."
588,zBObkBFMcyo,The man is very intelligent and articulates extremely well. Pharma companies making billions with no culpability is absolutely insane.    The corruption reeks.
589,zBObkBFMcyo,Brilliant response without taking the bait ! üëãüëãüëã
590,zBObkBFMcyo,It would be nice to see Nuremberg style tribunals.
591,zBObkBFMcyo,"This guy is sharp as tack ! Have to admit he is absolutely correct. Citizens who were given these vaccines...and experienced adverse health effects... or worse... as a result, need to be able to sue these companies. I see no reason to protect them from litigation for their wrongs.We are talking about people's lives ! I'll be frank in saying... this young man has my attention!

621,yhECkm16AGU,"Yes Brianna, you were lied to. At this point though, you're only lying to yourself. Acknowledge the truth and grow from it."
622,I3kd5SyYHEE,It's so rare you only hear about it daily.
623,I3kd5SyYHEE,The side affects are NOT minor or RARE. It can and has been life Ending.
624,I3kd5SyYHEE,"""Myocarditis is SIMPLY inflammation of the heart muscle."" Nice bit of fobbing off there, like it's nothing."
625,I3kd5SyYHEE,"its not ""rare""
its just rarely documented"
626,I3kd5SyYHEE,The music they put in the background to make this seem like a lighthearted issue is media gaslighting at its finest
627,I3kd5SyYHEE,a coworker got the second Pfizer shot and he had a really bad case of myocarditis... 8 months now.. he can't work anymore.. he can barely walk around the house.... and Pfizer is not liable..... GREAT HUH????
628,I3kd5SyYHEE,"My uncle developed myocarditis after receiving his Pfizer ‚Äúvaxx‚Äù. Poor guy can‚Äôt work anymore, 45 years old."
629,I3kd5SyYHEE,"I'm a 30 year old woman, I got the Pfizer vaccine back in September. After the second dose,  I actually had heart pain and pressure. It's sporadic and comes and goes with weeks in between, but it's worrying. I can't say I blame people for not wanting to get vaccinated, just be sure to look after yourself. There are times I regret getting it, because my heart was fine before."
630,I3kd5SyYHEE,the best part of being a conspiracy theorist is I don't have myocarditis
631,I3kd5SyYHEE,Not rare when it happens to you.
632,WFLDAOJ4sDs,I was fired from my job at Forsyth hospital for declining the vaccine. I‚Äôve been struggling since. I declined because I suffer from heart disease and lupus. I‚Äôm now waitressing and I‚Äôm grateful to be working but I‚Äôm not making nearly what I use to make. I‚Äôm a single mom with two children on the spectrum. I‚Äôm constantly faced with financial hardships and can barely support my children. I‚Äôm overwhelmed at times. But I know I made the right decision. God will see me through faith over fear.
633,WFLDAOJ4sDs,"Once you have outsourced your natural immunity to the elephant, you can‚Äôt live without it. Getting sick frequently is just the unpleasant withdrawal symptom."
634,WFLDAOJ4sDs,Thanks Dr. Philip. Mental issues appear to be prevalent amongst the vaccine cultists.
635,WFLDAOJ4sDs,"The Lancet? Yeah, I would take it with a pinch of salt!"
636,WFLDAOJ4sDs,Bill Gates loves this story of gigavaxxed man.
637,WFLDAOJ4sDs,"This is like someone saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve smoked 200 cigarettes a day for 2 years and don‚Äôt have emphysema or lung cancer so cigarettes are safe, especially to lower blood pressure while pregnant.‚Äù"
638,WFLDAOJ4sDs,"My my very healthy godson in his 20s has never been quite well since his employer forced him to get The Elephant.  But with a wife and 3 kids to support, he has been able to keep working until two weeks ago, when he was hospitalized for suspected tuberculous.  The diagnosis is not certain, but he definitely cough up blood and has pneumonia.  The Health Dept. won't let him out of isolation yet.  This is in California, USA.  Apparently there has been a rise in TB since the Elephant came out in 2021."
639,WFLDAOJ4sDs,Is this the guy that took shots for others that did not want it and made a bundle of money for it? PureBloodCriticalThinker
640,WFLDAOJ4sDs,"I just feel sorry for all the people who were brainwashed by fear into complying. Those who refused suffered and are suffering financially and socially, but those who complied have accepted to let strangers with questionable authority take medical decisions on their behalf. Just like well behaved children doing what mommy and daddy say‚Ä¶"
641,WFLDAOJ4sDs,Shows how broken the system is when you can pretend to be someone else.
642,lEFYYpE_hds,"I‚Äôm not anti vax but when I‚Äôm not allowed to ask questions, I ask more questions. Why so defensive? Why so unwilling to have a conversation about it? It‚Äôs a red flag to me when questioning something or asking questions gets a strong negative response."
643,lEFYYpE_hds,"""You're willing to lose your job over this?""
""Yes""
""Tell me why.""
""Because I am not going to take that vaccine...""
*Immediately gets cut off by the reporter and we can't hear why she won't get it*

Well done. Amazing reporting."
644,lEFYYpE_hds,"My roommate who's a 21 year old male contracted myocarditis from the COVID vaccine. He started convulsing in the floor one night and we had to rush him to the hospital. He's been to multiple specialists since then. It's a much bigger deal than people think, one of the risks of myocarditis is sudden death."
645,lEFYYpE_hds,"Reporter - ""So you're willing to lose your job instead of getting the vaccine, tell me why.""
Woman - Begins to explain 
Today show - *immediately cuts her off üòê"
646,lEFYYpE_hds,"It's linked to heart issues in all age groups in my opinion.  As a nurse, I'm seeing a lot of heart issues about 3-4 months after receiving covid shots in people that don't have prior heart issues."
647,lEFYYpE_hds,I‚Äôm a woman. I now have heart problems. No more vaccines for me. I‚Äôm on heart med. now.
648,lEFYYpE_hds,"They really need to report numbers and percentages so we can have even a clue as to what an ""increased rate"" is. News channels are so bad at reporting useful information and ambiguous information only increased emotional reactions and conjecture."
649,lEFYYpE_hds,Imagine posting such a story and not stating how many have had these reactions out of how many observed. I guess that's why you don't need a degree to be a news anchor...
650,lEFYYpE_hds,I'm so sorry for all the individuals here that were convinced or cohersed into taking this vaccine. People really need to band together and push back against this.
651,lEFYYpE_hds,My friends cousin (female) who is 19 went into cardiac arrest 3 days after 2nd vaccine. She just had a heart transplant and has a long road ahead of her. It‚Äôs more common than they are letting people believe.
652,-92HQA0GcI8,"This video tells a part of the vaccine story few people get to see. Vaccines aren't miracles. They are the products of research, curiosity, and the hard work of scientists. 
Follow me on Instagram and Twitter and let me know what you thought of this video! @DrJoeHanson @okaytobesmart"
653,-92HQA0GcI8,Gosh that PhD student really hit the jackpot of PhDs
654,-92HQA0GcI8,"3 things I still can't get today:
1. covid vaccine
2. PS5
3. RTX 3090"
655,-92HQA0GcI8,"Dude, amazing explanation video. I really wish they would show more of that on TV instead of all those depressing news about covid and political debates about every single decision."
656,-92HQA0GcI8,"7:57 ""Can you play Doom on this thing?"" Responds with: ""Some of our computers, you are able to play at max settings"""
657,-92HQA0GcI8,"Lots of love and respect to the science community. The media focuses a lot on crappy influencers, royals, actors and actresses , sports people but they forget about the people working anonymously to save and protect lives."
658,-92HQA0GcI8,"Such a fantastic video, thank you! I get really emotional thinking about how much we are capable of solving huge problems if we really put our minds to it. Very grateful to all the scientists, researchers, health workers, and so many more people, who have put in such a tremendous amount of hard work into developing and distributing vaccines in record time."
659,-92HQA0GcI8,Imagine writing your phd and get to study a pandemic first hand...
660,-92HQA0GcI8,Your last statement is extremely important. Supporting basic research is so important.
661,-92HQA0GcI8,This is exactly what I wanted to know. Thank you for making this excellent video!
662,EETuOY3JjfM,He said you have a greater chance of being struck by lightning than having an allergic reaction. I already have bad allergic reactions to many things...and I‚Äôve actually been zapped by lightning! I‚Äôd be doomed! üò¨
663,EETuOY3JjfM,"I am an athlete. I got my second dose of the covid vaccine 3 days ago. The next day after the vaccine, I couldn't sleep. I had the worst fever ever. Today is my 3rd day after the second shot, I feel normal but my stamina when I workout is not the same. I feel like I get fatigued much faster than before and I run out of breath much faster than I used to. I swear I am not lying."
664,EETuOY3JjfM,The inside of the body is nothing less than an action movie üò¨üòé
665,EETuOY3JjfM,I would love for this to have been real microscope footage of the vaccine interacting with cells.
666,EETuOY3JjfM,"My friend, who is 39, fit and healthy, was hospitalized with stroke-like symptoms yesterday. He received his second vaccine dose 3-4 weeks ago, his wife said he woke up in the morning and complained of his heart racing and difficulty breathing. While they were waiting for the ambulance she checked his heart rate with their blood oxygen finger monitor, his heart rate was at 155BPM. Can someone explain why a guy with no health issues had a reaction like this after getting the covid vaccination? I'm not anti-vax but this scares the hell out of me. I've heard reports of death and heart inflammation after getting the Covid vaccine, I feel like the vaccine will weaken the heart and cause health problems down the line for healthy adults 18-44."
667,EETuOY3JjfM,"Even if you make it sound cool and easy, to me it is quite terrifying"
668,EETuOY3JjfM,"Imagine these vaccines don't work on incoming variants, and WHO has to make another vaccine and all those fully vaccinated still need another dose lmao the business keeps going"
669,EETuOY3JjfM,"I got the first shot of Sinopharm and I am always feeling tired and sleepy after the vaccine, Now I took at least 14 hours sleep in a day but before vaccination I was hardly sleep only for 8 hours."
670,EETuOY3JjfM,the human body is amazing the way it fights for your health
671,EETuOY3JjfM,I spent about 7 days in the ER due to Covid and I haven‚Äôt been vaccinated personally it‚Äôs changed my mind about getting it I‚Äôm nervous but it felt like I almost died from it and I‚Äôm only 26.
672,HRfb2DnFWSE,Only the dumbest among us are quackccinating.
673,HRfb2DnFWSE,15% uptake last round.  How much longer are they going to push this charade?  CDC now has zero credibility.
674,HRfb2DnFWSE,LMAO only the most brainwashed will fall for this
675,HRfb2DnFWSE,SHAME LESS FOR WORDS FOR ALL THE LIES THAT ARE BEING SPOKEN
676,HRfb2DnFWSE,"The thing about karma is: what goes around, comes around. You reap what you sow. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction."
677,HRfb2DnFWSE,Scam shot
678,HRfb2DnFWSE,I thought she died suddenly.
679,HRfb2DnFWSE,I am sure this will age well...
680,HRfb2DnFWSE,Crazy eyes just like Walensky

üôèüí´üåü‚ö°üéä"
686,DEx1GuqAwPk,I'm too young to now struggling with my heart after Covishield shot. Never experienced such health issues ever before.
687,DEx1GuqAwPk,"I'm happy with my decision to not take vaccine. Made my family follow suit. 
I firstly don't trust doctors blindly and believe that nature has answer to everything and know the importance of understanding your body before consuming any drug (prescribed or not).
I got infected with covid virus and lost sense of smell and suffered from minor other infections but got alright by taking natural remedies."
688,DEx1GuqAwPk,Those who didn't take booster shot you have God's blessing. I took it and I've been having issues with my health since. I made such a mistake
689,DEx1GuqAwPk,Yes..agreed I am suffering from heart blockage being an athlete only after COVID 19..
690,DEx1GuqAwPk,"Do meditation daily,

Take a good sleep ,
Listen relaxing and calm music 
And remember ,you are stronger than your problemsüòä‚ù§"
691,DEx1GuqAwPk,"I am 37 years old, after taking first, second and booster dose of Covishield I am experiencing lots of health issues, energy level lowered down, often suffering by fever, cough, body ache, pain in waist & leg, palpitation etc. Other member of my family also suffering with multiple ailments. I never experienced such illnesses before taking this vaccine."
692,2IXQwVB8-ig,Commit to supporting Andrew Bridgen. Only honourable mp in that cess pit.
693,2IXQwVB8-ig,"The Scottish man was closed down by the host as soon as he mentioned how many people (30,000) had been injured, and Sunak responds as if it was just the two people in the studio.  Shameful obfuscation."
694,2IXQwVB8-ig,Well done that man. üëç
695,2IXQwVB8-ig,We don‚Äôt need a inquiry we need a trial!
696,2IXQwVB8-ig,This guy had more passion than the rest of the audience put together. RESPECT.
697,2IXQwVB8-ig,About time. They treated Andtew Bridgen disgracefully.
698,2IXQwVB8-ig,Never regreted not getting the vaccine.
699,2IXQwVB8-ig,Saddened and ‚Äúshocked‚Äù to hear you‚Äôve been silenced‚Ä¶.quite possibly the biggest lie this unelected PM has told.
700,2IXQwVB8-ig,Sunak says that he is surprised that this chap has been silenced and yet he was keen to silence Andrew Bridgen in the commons when he brought up the same question ! What a toe rag he is and all the others along with him that are trying to smear Mr Bridgen .
701,2IXQwVB8-ig,Well done to that guy üëè
702,p42FmUNULWg,The fact a doctor does not want vaccine speaks volumes. üòÆ

706,p42FmUNULWg,The smartest among us refused.
707,p42FmUNULWg,This Dr needs a massive raise.
708,p42FmUNULWg,"So many doctors didn‚Äôt want this üò¢
Our medical system needs to be renamed more accurately to ‚Äòour pharmaceutical system‚Äô."
709,p42FmUNULWg,"Medication so dangerous, doctors sacrifice their entire career to avoid it."
710,p42FmUNULWg,"They should not be able to force anyone to inject anything into their bodies.  If a doctor feels that going to these lengths to keep his job, and doesn't feel the vaccine he is being told he must take is safe why force him?  Why not give him the choice,  and respect his decision, especially when he is a doctor? 
Stripping him of his ability to carry on treating his patients, comes across as more sinister than if he doesnt take it he is a public health risk."
711,p42FmUNULWg,This why I didn‚Äôt take it and never will I knew I was right
712,40eZeXPyJ0g,And people ask how the vaccine got so politicized.
713,40eZeXPyJ0g,So Harris if the Biden administration says to take it I politely say I won‚Äôt!!! Trump 2024 USA USA USA !!!
714,40eZeXPyJ0g,This has been politicized so heavily it‚Äôs ridiculous.
715,40eZeXPyJ0g,"The person scrolling down through the comments, have a nice day"
716,40eZeXPyJ0g,I want to see a clock to ensure both receive an equal amount of time!
717,40eZeXPyJ0g,"If I told her to take that vaccine, I'm sure she would listen to me."
718,40eZeXPyJ0g,*Remember when she called Joe Biden a racist during the Democratic debates? Pepperidge farms remembers...*
719,40eZeXPyJ0g,Whenever she speaks one is reminded of why she got zero delegates in the Dem primaries and was one of the first candidates to fail and drop out....Tulsi exposed her horrible record as attorney in SF.
720,40eZeXPyJ0g,Harris can tell a lie in one sentence. Pence has to use a paragraph to prove it's a lie. That's why he needed more time.

722,LVKSBHhGmDc,"A dummy coworker of mine lined up for her 4th shot, and says once the new shot comes out, she'll get the fifth. She's 50 and can barely walk now. She was fine before the jabs. There's no cure for stupidity."
723,LVKSBHhGmDc,A moment of silence for to those who let the government dictate their lives
724,LVKSBHhGmDc,One of the most profound ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù moments in history
725,LVKSBHhGmDc,I'm unvaxxed and haven't had covid in almost two years. Thanks immune system üòä
726,LVKSBHhGmDc,A moment of silence for all those who played themselves.
727,LVKSBHhGmDc,"Never wore a mask, never stayed home and still unvaccinated. I was 100% guaranteed to die because I didn't play along but 3 years later I'm aok"
728,LVKSBHhGmDc,"I guess the ""conspiracy theorists"" and ""science deniers"" were right huh üòè"
729,LVKSBHhGmDc,"I‚Äôll still never forgive those who demonized people for not having the ‚ÄòJab.‚Äô

‚Äî ThomasKing"
730,LVKSBHhGmDc,"Blood clots from the first

It would have been so much worse if it wasn't  for the jab."

734,0UHCFPDhrEI,This aged beautifully‚Ä¶
735,0UHCFPDhrEI,The more they try to convince me to get it the more my gut tells me not too
736,0UHCFPDhrEI,They should do a documentary on severely injured patients from the vaccine and the percentage then
737,0UHCFPDhrEI,You women are my heroes!  Stay strong!!
738,0UHCFPDhrEI,"Vaccine or no vaccine, everyone is taking a risk. People should just mind their own business."
739,0UHCFPDhrEI,"The longer I have worked in the health field as an RN the more skeptical I am with ""Experts""."
740,0UHCFPDhrEI,Thank God there are still people out there who can  think for themselves and not let mainstream media do it for them.
741,0UHCFPDhrEI,I appreciate these women being honest. There‚Äôs so much fear about speaking out against mandates. It‚Äôs terrible

743,wosyaWiDR2U,Why am I not surprised that he tried to point the blame in another direction
744,wosyaWiDR2U,I had a bad reaction to my first Moderna vaccine .   Doctors were not only unhelpful but could care less.  I went through 6 weeks of physical therapy due to intense dizzy spells.  Then said I should go ahead and get the second shot . No thanks.
745,wosyaWiDR2U,"Of course we can‚Äôt blame the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù but it‚Äôs ok to  blame the dead victim. 
RIP Kassidi."
746,wosyaWiDR2U,She was a surgical assistant.  I'm sure she knew how much Tylenol to take!
747,wosyaWiDR2U,The moment they said the manufacturers would have no liability was the moment my decision was .......
748,wosyaWiDR2U,"She was a Nurse she would not have taken 4,000 mg plus of acetaminophen in  a day"
749,wosyaWiDR2U,"Unfortunately, there are more stories like this but they just aren't being reported on the news."
750,wosyaWiDR2U,"Thalidomide was prescribed for years to help pregnant women with morning sickness ... and then, the monstrosities started appearing in the THOUSANDS.  Yet, it was years before Thalidomide was taken off the shelves."
751,wosyaWiDR2U,Seems Doctor you were very keen to say she had OD‚Äôd on Tylenol and direct attention away from it possibly being the vaccine. I saw you for the first time today do so don‚Äôt know if you always do this; but it seems undeniable to me that this mRNA spiked protein technique deserves more criticism instead of the vaccine didn‚Äôt harm the patient mantra!
752,Mdr2rLWGXiE,My recovery journey with igrotum is filled with hope and progress. Its a true companion in fighting cancer.
753,Mdr2rLWGXiE,"Living with an incurable disease is so hard, but you just have to live life day by day as it goes by (Cancer sucks)..."
754,Mdr2rLWGXiE,This is how ‚Äúiam legend‚Äù starts.
755,Mdr2rLWGXiE,Helping our body to naturally cure cancer is a wonderful approach.  I hope this saves many lives
756,Mdr2rLWGXiE,"My father lived 23 years with cancer. He never got Covid, and his cancer was being controlled. It was about a couple months after getting the shot that his cancer took off uncontrollably and went downhill in a hurry until he passed."
757,Mdr2rLWGXiE,This is what humanity should be working on instead of constantly fighting.
758,Mdr2rLWGXiE,"very encouraging to hear.
I find cancer is a scarry word. I know too many people whose lives are in limbo far too young. My colleague's girlfriend (2 younge kids) is battling breast cancer at 34 for over a year now and she's not out of the woods yet. This isn't a fight she should be fighting; she should be enjoying her two young daughters, and instead, she's worried she won't see another year. This always happens to the best of us humans too.

anyway...I'm hoping this forges new paths that ensures kids and young adults don't leave us before they can enjoy a full life."
759,Mdr2rLWGXiE,"Here we go, boys! I Am Legend! Let's get a cancer vaccine on the roll!"
760,Mdr2rLWGXiE,This is so exciting. The human mind never cease to push further what is possible.

766,V9Z325DYJJc,The real question would be how the chart would look like if you compare the vaxxed to the unvaxxed in the same age group. That would really clear the debate. But there's a reason why they don't show you that. Isn't it so?
767,V9Z325DYJJc,These people deserve capitol punishment for pushing this on humanity
768,V9Z325DYJJc,Anytime I see ‚Äúfact checked‚Äù I know it‚Äôs a lie coming next.
769,V9Z325DYJJc,"But if the vaccine worked, even the old shouldn't be dying. In fact, the whole point of the vaccination warning was mostly for the vulnerable old people. The old people were ALWAYS the ones who died at the higher rate, even before we had a vaccine, and we see now that that is STILL the case."
770,V9Z325DYJJc,"I love to hear him give his expert opinion on 84% increase in heart attacks from 0 to 49 year olds in Florida, He sure as hell can't start it off with they were old. LMAO wake up America"

785,sJhQLdH8Zxc,"Funny how 69% is Americans are vaccinated - but 80% received ONE or more dose. My mom had a severe reaction after the first covid vaccine and had to go to hospital- they said if she got second she might die. My gf‚Äôs periods STOPPED after she was mandated by her college to get both. My coworkers mother (in her 60‚Äôs post menopausal) started bleeding again after the covid vaccines. There‚Äôs something in the vaccines that is negatively affecting people and if some want to bury their head in the sand about it, I can empathize with why bc it‚Äôs scary to think about bc a large majority of people have this poison inside them. It probably angers them to know they were fooled and no body wants to hear that but you can only ignore the data for so long. Praying for all those affected to be okay.

I will NEVER forgive & forget the people who pushed this shit on the rest of us."

1) Fatigue for 3-5 days. Body felt warm. Eyes heavy. No strength to walk. Just wanted sleep.
2) some strange feeling in the chest/blood pressure. The feeling I couldn't explain. Like someone was turning my system on and off.

I took my dose on 9th Oct. I still feel weird today. I took paracetamol for the first week every night. I'm a guy who works with power tools whole day. It's what I love to do instead of hitting the bottle. I felt tired but i never took a day off. I don't feel like taking the 2nd shot.

932,i9JLZuhqRuU,"Addendum:
Two questions asked frequently.

Was the deceased in the first paper tested for SARS-CoV2 infection?

Answer: The paper states, ""but no positive laboratory or clinical diagnosis of the infection.""  The paper never states that the patient received a test and the result was negative.   Some have stated that as the patient was admitted to Charit√© Hospital in Berlin and their protocol for admission requires testing prior to admission.  However, it is unclear of the current website policy was in place when the patient was admitted.  Regardless, the policy states the following:  (https://www.charite.de/en/clinical_center/themes_hospital/main_topic_coronavirus/)

""At present, the following patient groups must show proof of a negative rapid antigen test (within the past 24 hours) or PCR test (within the past 48 hours) upon arriving at any Charit√© outpatient facility:

Vulnerable patients, such as those receiving hemato-oncological care or otherwise immunocompromised patients
Patients receiving daily inpatient care: Testing for SARS-CoV-2 is required at least twice weekly for those visiting Charit√© daily. It is important to test after the weekend or any other interruption in daily inpatient treatment (for example, the patient must show proof of a negative test every Monday and on one other day of the week).
Patients who are in the outpatient clinic for a longer period, for example for preoperative evaluation/preliminary examination
Patients participating in outpatient clinical studies""

Please note that a simple rapid antigen test (which is not designed to determine past infection but rather infectiousness) could have been the test that allowed the patient to be admitted to the hospital if it was negative.  But a negative antigen test would never be taken as proof that the patient had NEVER been infected with the SARS-CoV2.  

It is unfortunate that one has to this type of digging to find the ""answer"" which actually leaves more questions.  It is possible that the author did not realize how important this issue would be when originally writing the paper.  However, given the fact that a lack of nucleocapsid protein is not, in fact, the 
sine qua non of vaccine damage but also infection it now focuses on this question: how tight was the testing for SARS-CoV2 at the end of the deceased life?  The false negative rate is very different between self-administered tests and other more standardized tests.  In addition the patient could have spike proteins long after the RNA was detectable by PCR or protein by antigen testing making the results of the test moot.  Given this uncertainty, retrospectively, it is understandable that the author would have simply stated that the patient had ""no positive laboratory or clinical diagnosis of the infection.""   We wish this were clarified and if I was the peer reviewer I would have asked that this be fleshed out in the paper itself. 

Second Question:
What was the vaccination status of the deceased in the second paper?  

Answer: Unknown but it would be unlikely that all would have been given that a high proportion of COVID-dead were unvaccinated.    However, we do not have to remain with this answer.  A case series was published in November of 2020 (before C19 Vaccines) which showed the same result:  Nucleocapsid proteins were not seen to the same degree that spike was seen.  For instance the paper states regarding the brain: ""In the 16 (40%) cases positive for SARS-CoV-2 proteins on immunohistochemistry, spike protein was detected much more frequently (14 [88%] cases) than nucleocapsid protein (seven [44%] cases)."" https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(20)30308-2/fulltext#seccestitle170

934,i9JLZuhqRuU,The risk of any medical intervention should always be voluntary.  Never should we mandate anything like this.
935,i9JLZuhqRuU,"I was a US Navy Nurse Corps scholarship student in college in 1974. To quote my Microbiology Professor "" Immunity is EVERYTHING""! Best thing I ever learned in Nursing school! Eat clean, stay hydrated - water is life, get enough sleep 8-9 hours! Albert Einstein got 10 hours of sleep every night! , exercise moderately, stress less! Keep your IMMUNE system STRONG! ü§îü§óüå≤üåÑüå≤üá©üá™üá®üá≠üá∫üá≤üíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíô"
936,i9JLZuhqRuU,Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
937,i9JLZuhqRuU,Thanks for making this. I‚Äôm currently a PA student and patients ask me all the time about vaccine side effects. It‚Äôs nice to see a deep dive into current research being done.
938,i9JLZuhqRuU,"I am an 68 year old woman. The last time I was hospitized was in 1960, right after the Polio vaccine , I developed Viral Encephalitis post Chicken Pox! I NEVER take the flu vaccine, rarely got the flu. If I did get the flu ,I treated it with Homeopathic remedies. I was a US Navy Nurse Corps scholarship student in college. I left nursing, got an Honorable Discharge and became a Special Education teacher for 37 years! When I retired from teaching I had 300 Unused Sick Days. I take ZERO prescription drugs. I use ONLY vitamins & some herbs. I am recovering from Covid-19. The very first time I ever got it! I have relatives who were vaxed and had Covid 19 three times!!!!! I didn't get vaxed! When I got Covid 19 , I was NEVER hospitized. I was given a drug to reduce nausea! I am recovering at home!"
939,i9JLZuhqRuU,People should have had the choice and discussion rather than censorship and gas lighting.
940,i9JLZuhqRuU,"I'm an Australian Dietitian and Diabetes Educator and I have to say that I love how open you are to exploring so many different modalities of health and wellbeing. Saunas, ice, sun, nutrition, exercise, published papers like this youtube presentation, . Congratulations on being so open minded and curious, fabulous but unusual traits in health professionals. I'm very grateful to have found your presentations"

1015,RyT3veZRMcg,Much respect to you guys for doing ACTUAL journalism. Including myself I know thousands of people who have been injured. If I alone have come across that many that I guarantee there are millions and these aren't just effects that happen right away. Mine started 3 days after and now I have breast cancer as a result 2 years to the month later. It will likely be 50 years or so before the truth comes out but I'm telling you this is going to affect generations to come. One of the worst mass humanitarian crimes ever committed. And if still keeps going. Thank you for standing up for us
1016,RyT3veZRMcg,Gonna need more than 15 mil. Better get all those billions back from ukraine.
1017,RyT3veZRMcg,"They knew, many scientists and medical professionals spoke out at public meetings and wrote countless letters to politicians advising against the shots."
1018,RyT3veZRMcg,I‚Äôve been dealing with severe allergies and fatigue ever since
1019,RyT3veZRMcg,We tried to tell them and they wouldn't listen
1020,RyT3veZRMcg,"As a person who is dealing with injuries from it, CICP only covers medical bills, loss of employment, or death. Not a life altering issues resulting from it. I was told the VA will cover it when I retire from the military. My prescription to keep my platelets from bottoming out costs $3-4000 a bottle. If I wasn‚Äôt in the military there‚Äôs no way I could pay that every month."
1021,RyT3veZRMcg,"We tried to tell you. You wouldn‚Äôt listen. You called us conspiracy theorists, kicked us out of the military, fired us from our jobs, tried to restrict our freedom of movement, and shun us from society. You hated us; we prayed for you."
1022,iiWCZDEjjKw,"Mom always told me "" Just because everyone else is doing something, doesn't mean you have to""....... words of wisdom."
1023,iiWCZDEjjKw,If you‚Äôre young and healthy it just isn‚Äôt worth the risk. Period.
1024,iiWCZDEjjKw,I‚Äôve never heard anyone talk so casually about side effects and people still line up to get the jab... unbelievable
1025,iiWCZDEjjKw,"""If you or someone you know has received the Covid 19 vaccine you may be entitled to compensation."""
1026,iiWCZDEjjKw,I just had my first shot and felt fine. I'll get my second shot when the bartender gets back.
1027,iiWCZDEjjKw,I‚Äôm sure that random mom will shed light on what‚Äôs going on here.
1028,iiWCZDEjjKw,its crazy how people still listen to the news
1029,iiWCZDEjjKw,"News segment did not mention the health conditions of the 18 affected prior to receiving the vaccine.  Lumped the number 18 together with teens and young adults.  Could be 1 teen and 17 YA or 17 teens and 1 YA.  Did not classify what is considered a young adult.  Did not mention the amount of vaccines administered to this age group.  While my sympathies go to the affected no matter how big or small the number, this segment is too vague for me to form an understanding opinion on the matter."
1030,iiWCZDEjjKw,"I love how these types of news segments put a doctor's perspective and a random person's perspective on equal footing, when one spent hundreds of thousands of dollars and 8 years on education and the other doesn't know how what contraception is"
1031,iiWCZDEjjKw,The fact that they are being forced to report this shows that its much worse out there than we think
1032,YhMlZczq4Ns,"The Pfizer shots and booster all nearly killed me. I lose 2 days of my life per shot, laying in bed with 101 fever and rapid shallow breathing, chills and odd stabbing pains in my abdomen and thighs. I get the massive swollen glands in my armpit and can‚Äôt raise my arm for days."
1033,YhMlZczq4Ns,You may very well have the only doctors handwriting that is understandable in the entire world. Thank you for all you do.
1034,YhMlZczq4Ns,"Question - if the J&J is an adenovirus vaccine and Pfizer, Moderna are mRNA vaccines, is there any benefit, such as, for example, a different type of immune response, that if mixed would theoretically give you broader immunity? Is this something that is measurable?"
1035,YhMlZczq4Ns,Amazing how you take a complicated subject and make it sooo easy to understand ... wish you were my chem. Bio .anatomy prof in college ...
1036,YhMlZczq4Ns,Thanks for another great video Doctor. Amazed at the clarity and level of detail and presented in a way that folks with not too much scientific knowledge can understand.
1037,YhMlZczq4Ns,"Thank you, Meccram !!!  
   **** Could you Please make a video on the myocarditis & related risks with Moderna, and how 3 Nordic countries ( Sweden, Norway, and Finland)  have suspended Moderna  for people under 30 ( in Sweden for men AND women that age.)****
     How safe is Moderna for women in their 40's and 50's? ( Concerned re: myocarditis, blood clots, etc.)....but I'd LIKE to get a Moderna booster, if safe enough ( I got J& J initially.)  THANKS SO MUCH !!!"
1038,YhMlZczq4Ns,"I had Moderna shots. My booster was a half dose. I had very mild reactions to all three shots. However I felt the booster the most. I spent a day resting on the couch, drinking tea and napping. Mostly fatigue, some aches and chills. Felt 100% better the next day."
1039,YhMlZczq4Ns,"Please explain the myocarditis risk for young men, specifically regarding boosters... if you can.  With many thanks."
1040,YhMlZczq4Ns,"The fact that the moderna boost is full dose (100ug) in this study versus a half dose(50ug) which is the acutual dose people will receive. This almost invalidates the moderna boost graph results in this video, it is concerning because It is difficult to make a decision based on something that may be inaccuarate."
1041,YhMlZczq4Ns,For my healthy tripple vaxxed BF the first one was the last one: he passed away from a sudden heart attack a month after the  booster.
1042,z5lJeTjvFHU,Bro my arm is literally in a state of paralysis
1043,z5lJeTjvFHU,"At first it felt like a regular shot but later in the day, my arm felt like it was going to fall off üòÇ

It hurt so badly lol"
1044,z5lJeTjvFHU,"I got my second shot today, it feels like someone punched me in the arm 50 times with a big ass hand! I can barely move my right arm, it really does hurt."
1045,z5lJeTjvFHU,I think ‚Äúa little sore‚Äù is an understatement
1046,z5lJeTjvFHU,yo I thought I was the only one feeling this way lmao I literally can't lift my arm
1047,z5lJeTjvFHU,"For me, I got my vaccine today, early morning. My arm did NOT hurt after. But 5-6 hours later on in the afternoon, my arm is then sore and I can't lift it up!! :'( :'("
1048,z5lJeTjvFHU,My shoulder feels like a restraining order was made against moving.
1049,z5lJeTjvFHU,Yeah... got my first dose of Moderna today. The injection site was sore right after which is to be expected from getting a shot but now hours later my whole arm hurts lol. If this is the worst of my symptoms I‚Äôll count myself lucky. I‚Äôm more worried about the second shot though.
1050,z5lJeTjvFHU,"I got mine today in the morning, I was fine for about 7-8 hours. I thought my arm wouldn‚Äôt hurt but nope. 7-8 hours, it started really hurting. My arm looked a bit swollen too. I had to take Tylenol. Now it‚Äôs a bit better but I can still feel it. I hope this goes away by tmw."
1051,z5lJeTjvFHU,I got the Pfizer shot then right after my dumbass went to bench press my arm feels like it's dead üíÄ

1062,LXDH-xKIk0A,The only shocking part of this is seeing it on mainstream media.
1063,LXDH-xKIk0A,"This occurrence is not only not new, it was predicted as a strong possibility and cautioned about with regards the mRNA transfection inoculations by many prominent virologists and immunologist right from the start. Doctors were shadowbanned if they tried to talk about it. The two hosts do look a little unsettled. I would love to know what was said in Amy Roach's ear piece as they quickly went to commercial.

‚ÄúOk, but will the manufacturer at least be held accountable if something happens to me?‚Äù

1094,IGqDGeDssmY,Kudos to Vice for reporting on this issue without making it political.
1095,IGqDGeDssmY,It's happening all over the world. Problem is media isn't covering it in any country. Agree with the comments.
1096,IGqDGeDssmY,My sister is bipolar and she experienced a rough period and went manic after her second shot. I would love to see a study done on the effects of the shot on the the mentally ill.

1100,IGqDGeDssmY,"I just spent 4 hours reading the comment section. It is amazing and inspiring to see so many women share, discuss, correlate & analyse the situation going on with these vaccines at the moment. As a person with Endo, whose painful period symptoms were never taken seriously by doctors, it was incredible to hear so many women speak their truth loud and proud.  We deserve a healthcare system that doesn't exploit us !

Please remember that: 
1. Menstrual/fertility issues are SERIOUS - they could have long term effects, or cause death, not just disrupted periods
2. Most want to dismiss us because they are conditioned to think these side effects are super rare, when they are not
3. If this report by Vice is not taken seriously, if they continue to dismiss all these cases as anecdotal, the only solution would be for all of us to unite together as women of all races and religions and fight Big Pharma to its death. For our men too, they will thank us later.

Stay strong, stay healthy ! Support good, caring local doctors, you know who they are !"

1125,-ZW4T0L38J8,"The one thing they don't mandate is exercise, sunlight/Vit-D, and healthy eating. They don't mention it even once."
1126,-ZW4T0L38J8,"Can someone explain to me when, in all of history have bullies and liars ever been the good guys? Censoring negative side effects, banning alternative treatments, lying about cases and efficacy to encourage injections, penalizing people who make their own decisions... When has this ever been done by the good guys?"
1127,-ZW4T0L38J8,"These people are making so much money off of this, they don‚Äôt want it to end."
1128,-ZW4T0L38J8,"I read a story where a person had 113 employees, fired 14 to make it to 99. All 14 were vaccinated. This is how you do it folks"
1129,-ZW4T0L38J8,I was absolutely surprised that MSNBC actually aired this TRUTH about the public pushing back against mandates..
1130,-ZW4T0L38J8,"If your forced to accept information; not allowed to question it; restricted from seeing conflicting data, receive only pre-filtered (censored) information, that is actually propaganda. Science is questioned, open to examination, openly discussed, and continuously up for peer review. Which are YOU accepting?"

1132,sPOMCrV3dG4,this should be studied further.  not just for covid but for other immono deficiencies or even auto immune issues
1133,sPOMCrV3dG4,Why would you keep getting shots if they're not working for you? Your risks with all those different shots will probably be worse then the benefit.
1134,sPOMCrV3dG4,Well I hope they use her as a case study for the original failed shots. Praying for her safety and health
1135,sPOMCrV3dG4,"the media is freaking people out. i feel bad for her, she shouldn't have to live  like this"
1136,sPOMCrV3dG4,"I cannot imagine what she's going through, no immune response. So scary"
1137,sPOMCrV3dG4,"Bless her heart, I pray she stays well."
1138,sPOMCrV3dG4,"I wonder if this was recommended by her physician. I worked in the medical field and from what we studied, antibodies may usually take about weeks upto months to develop. And I'm just wondering, what does she mean by ""no immesurable antibodies?"" Is it completely 0 and how long did she have the antibody test after getting the vaccine? This is not meant to judge her but as someone who studied serology/immunology this is rather a ""weird"" case. I get it that she's *immunocompromised* but all the more you cant just introduced antibodies like that esp multiple times in a short period of time. Based also from experience, my aunt didnt know she has breast cancer and started feeling sick after 2 weeks of her 1st shot. From there, her health declined tremendously and died after 1.5months. We consulted the physician regarding this but told us that it was almost impossible to prove that it was caused by the vaccine as no study yet can support our claim. Hoping that this woman would remain safe and healthy as Covid can really be a big blow to unvaxxed seniors, immunocompromised, overweight and those with comorbidites. Keep safe everyone. ‚ù§"

‚ÄúOk, but will the manufacturer at least be held accountable if something happens to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, they‚Äôre not responsible for any side effects.‚Äù

1314,IGqDGeDssmY,Kudos to Vice for reporting on this issue without making it political.
1315,IGqDGeDssmY,It's happening all over the world. Problem is media isn't covering it in any country. Agree with the comments.
1316,IGqDGeDssmY,My sister is bipolar and she experienced a rough period and went manic after her second shot. I would love to see a study done on the effects of the shot on the the mentally ill.
1317,IGqDGeDssmY,Imagine if this video wasn‚Äôt posted..where could women openly have this dialogue and be heard??
1318,IGqDGeDssmY,"The fact that around half the population has periods, and yet it was not properly studied is kinda fucked up..."
1319,IGqDGeDssmY,This is happening and more all over the world. It‚Äôs criminal. My heart goes out to all who are going through this. Don‚Äôt give up. Report and share your stories wherever you can. I send you hugs and strength.
1320,IGqDGeDssmY,"I just spent 4 hours reading the comment section. It is amazing and inspiring to see so many women share, discuss, correlate & analyse the situation going on with these vaccines at the moment. As a person with Endo, whose painful period symptoms were never taken seriously by doctors, it was incredible to hear so many women speak their truth loud and proud.  We deserve a healthcare system that doesn't exploit us !

Please remember that: 
1. Menstrual/fertility issues are SERIOUS - they could have long term effects, or cause death, not just disrupted periods
2. Most want to dismiss us because they are conditioned to think these side effects are super rare, when they are not
3. If this report by Vice is not taken seriously, if they continue to dismiss all these cases as anecdotal, the only solution would be for all of us to unite together as women of all races and religions and fight Big Pharma to its death. For our men too, they will thank us later.

Stay strong, stay healthy ! Support good, caring local doctors, you know who they are !"

But, these things may be the least of their worries!  I also hope that it was only medicul and not spiritual(Rev 13 and 14)! I surely hope so!"

1368,sPOMCrV3dG4,"I wonder if this was recommended by her physician. I worked in the medical field and from what we studied, antibodies may usually take about weeks upto months to develop. And I'm just wondering, what does she mean by ""no immesurable antibodies?"" Is it completely 0 and how long did she have the antibody test after getting the vaccine? This is not meant to judge her but as someone who studied serology/immunology this is rather a ""weird"" case. I get it that she's *immunocompromised* but all the more you cant just introduced antibodies like that esp multiple times in a short period of time. Based also from experience, my aunt didnt know she has breast cancer and started feeling sick after 2 weeks of her 1st shot. From there, her health declined tremendously and died after 1.5months. We consulted the physician regarding this but told us that it was almost impossible to prove that it was caused by the vaccine as no study yet can support our claim. Hoping that this woman would remain safe and healthy as Covid can really be a big blow to unvaxxed seniors, immunocompromised, overweight and those with comorbidites. Keep safe everyone. ‚ù§"

1482,3XTzk9RouSY,It's sad to see that covid became so politicized. It should have been a fight that united people against a common struggle
1483,3XTzk9RouSY,"The worst part is that no matter who you are and what you believe, when you die from this, you die alone."
1484,3XTzk9RouSY,"I was going to post a statement that was just down right mean.

1491,3XTzk9RouSY,"As a country, both Dems and Reps and all in between, we need to stand together against politicians who seek to divide us. All they're doing mostly is blaming the other side for your problems,saying what you want to hear, pretending they believe what you believe, to maximize your loyalty to them. Meanwhile when you really look at it, we all want the same core things: Good health, safety, education, for ourselves and our families. There's an old political saying: Never let a good crisis go to waste. Not saying this is what Kelly did. In fact I'm sure she didn't because from what it sounds like she was a genuine person who believed in what she was saying. But many politicians are using Covid for personal gain irrespective of consequences. Demonizing the vaccine even though they themselves are vaccinated, simply because they know it's popular with their base to say so. Wise up my fellow Americans. The politicians are not on our side. And if I have to choose between a politician and my doctor, when it comes to my health, I'm choosing my doctor. Because the doctor faces greater consequences in his/her community for giving bad medical advice."

I‚Äôm not joking) My baby girl was born healthy she‚Äôs in my arms as we speak. Now we both have natural antibodies and I‚Äôm breastfeeding. It didn‚Äôt feel right for me to get vaccinated pregnant and I‚Äôm proud I stuck to my choice.
1553,U2cVxKVpl-8,Food for thought. When I was in college studying veterinary technology we were taught NEVER vaccinate a pregnant animal. Should it be different for humans? I think not!
1554,U2cVxKVpl-8,If it‚Äôs so safe why are the manufacturer‚Äôs protected from any lawsuits due to adverse reactions? Would you buy any other product that the manufacturer would not stand behind?

1573,2XVCPdPAUbA,"Big Brother doesn't like it when individuals say ""no""."
1574,2XVCPdPAUbA,"Benjamin Franklin once said: ""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."""
1575,2XVCPdPAUbA,When my school had the D.A.R.E. program I was taught not to experiment with drugs.
1576,2XVCPdPAUbA,"This mandate is absolutely outrageous!  It is unprecedented.  Where is the outrage and protest‚Äî-if you choose to vaccinate‚Äîfine, it‚Äôs is your choice, if you choose not to vaccinate that choice should be respected as well-without the threat of taking away your livelihood!"
1577,2XVCPdPAUbA,Then the employer needs to sign a liability clause if they mandate it. How many employers do you think would mandate it if they were liable for any consequence resulting from the vaccine?
1578,2XVCPdPAUbA,It's only a job. Don't sell your soul for a job. It will be the same for everyone soon
1579,2XVCPdPAUbA,"They can mandate it all day long, but remember the government isn't going to bail you out when you go under."
1580,2XVCPdPAUbA,‚ÄúGive up rights for the collective good‚Äù. Did you seriously just say that?  No thank you comrade!

1582,0u1nJo4fGg8,Every vaccine needs to be peer to peer reviewed before it's listed as proven
1583,0u1nJo4fGg8,Hmm interesting. I'm thinking if there is a certain non mutating part of the HIV virus that we can target ? Like we do with the spike protein in the ncov virus . Otherwise we could make personalized mRNA vaccines based on the specific type of the HIV virus present.
1584,0u1nJo4fGg8,I pray this day will come fast. The world has lost too many people to the virus 40 years ago till today. Fingers crossedüëåüèª
1585,0u1nJo4fGg8,50% efficacy is still an F.
1586,0u1nJo4fGg8,"Between the Moderna mRNA HIV Vaccine (for people not infected with HIV) & American Gene Technologies AGT103-T (for people already infected with HIV), which both are in clinical trials, is great news for everyone!"
1587,0u1nJo4fGg8,thank you Loard for gaving Dr Jibola the wisdom to fine the cure for Hepatitis B.

1589,0u1nJo4fGg8,"Yeah, proven to be completely ineffective and dangerous."

1592,AM3gSgvN2Fw,Why does this show still look like it‚Äôs filmed in the 90‚Äôs
1593,AM3gSgvN2Fw,THank you for giving these guys the credit they deserve and not just say its a Pfizer vaccine.
1594,AM3gSgvN2Fw,I am an ER doc in East Texas. received my vaccine last Thursday. I really appreciate the scientists who developed it. I can‚Äôt thank you enough.
1595,AM3gSgvN2Fw,"The real inventor was Biontec, they should get more credit for their work!"
1596,AM3gSgvN2Fw,"My friend's sister died of Covid yesterday. Her funeral is today. This really brings it home to me. Whichever scientists can succeed in destroying Covid and giving us back human life - not the lives lost, but the lives still living - those scientists are indeed heroes."
1597,AM3gSgvN2Fw,"Reporter: it was a miracle
She was like, yea nah .. Its called science üòÇ!"
1598,AM3gSgvN2Fw,I cant wait to go back and watch this video in 2026
1599,AM3gSgvN2Fw,The Sahin couple should get the Nobel Prize. They are true geniuses.
1600,AM3gSgvN2Fw,The German woman speaks from her heart. Her words are so touching!
1601,AM3gSgvN2Fw,I got high-school vibes watching this Lol it reminded me of when the teacher use to roll the tv out üòÇ
1602,bqJRzfmB26w,"My Grandmother lost a 9 month old & 3 year old, on the same day, from Diptheria. My other Grandmother lost a 12 month old to Whooping Cough. My oldest brother almost died frrom Polio. I am so thankful that I was able to raise my boys, without having to worry about them dying from a preventable disease. A few generations ago parents did not have that luxury."
1603,bqJRzfmB26w,I'm currently caring for a 6 year old with tetanus in the ICU. It breaks my heart seeing her mom crying all day. Tetanus is completely avoidable with a simple vaccine.
1604,bqJRzfmB26w,"With most conspiracy theorists, they feel they know things others don't and it makes them special."
1605,bqJRzfmB26w,"""When stupidity is considered patriotism, it is unsafe to be intelligent."" 
Isaac Asimov"
1606,bqJRzfmB26w,It's gratifying to hear her call anti-vaxxers a cult. And it's scary to see how easily people became anti-vax.
1607,bqJRzfmB26w,That‚Äôs fantastic that she was able to change her view. Pretty rare.
1608,bqJRzfmB26w,"The World went to Hell when ""feelings"" were equated to facts."
1609,bqJRzfmB26w,"Giving everyday ppl validation by calling  them ""Influencers"" is fucking beyond me"
1610,bqJRzfmB26w,"After a life of being nobody, the validation makes them feel they're somebody, it becomes an addiction."
1611,bqJRzfmB26w,I grew up in a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù house and when I was 9 I crawled under my house to follow my cat. I put my hand down on a rusty nail sticking up out of the ground and literally impaled myself. Thank goodness I had a Pediatritian for a mom who made me get my vaccines!
1612,XHfRpNJI0c8,I‚Äôm surprised she had friends to begin with
1613,XHfRpNJI0c8,One thing that the last few years of this global madness has told me is that I really dont need celebrities in my life. Doing much better without these over paid goons.
1614,XHfRpNJI0c8,"Imagine a vaccine so safe, that the manufacturers needed to be given total legal immunity."
1615,XHfRpNJI0c8,Another way to separate people.
1616,XHfRpNJI0c8,"Somehow, I have a feeling that the people who would estrange me for being unvaccinated aren‚Äôt the people I‚Äôll really cry about when they leave."
1617,XHfRpNJI0c8,Why we all unvaccinated people don‚Äôt cut ties with her movies and shows and see how far she goes.. ü§≠üòÇüòÇ
1618,XHfRpNJI0c8,Let‚Äôs be real. This is an actor! Who gives a shit what they say. They live in a world where reality does not exist.
1619,XHfRpNJI0c8,I‚Äôm really not understanding this. If she can get it from an unvaccinated person and she‚Äôs vaccinated then one of her vaccinated friends could get it and give it to her. The only sure solution seems to be total isolation
1620,XHfRpNJI0c8,It‚Äôs like when the wife says‚Äù It‚Äôs me or the dog‚Äù and the husband goes to the store for another box of Milkbones
1621,XHfRpNJI0c8,Talk about discrimination against the unvaccinated.
1622,wuqyRBmashA,They are STILL saying you should get this if you will otherwise stay unvaccinated!!! Absolute insanity.
1623,wuqyRBmashA,I can't believe the media is not burying this story.
1624,wuqyRBmashA,If you said this 2 years ago you were labeled a conspiracy theorist.
1625,wuqyRBmashA,"Just go to VAERS and spend a little time looking at the stats for adverse effects. The trials showed that a percentage would suffer from bad reactions but they kept quiet about it of course. The money has been made, the crime has been committed."
1626,wuqyRBmashA,Wow I can‚Äôt believe the news actually reported this
1627,wuqyRBmashA,Can't wait for the day the MSM is held accountable for this
1628,wuqyRBmashA,Negative side effects are not rare. Any vaccine developed and deemed safe in such a short period of time is not safe.  They spread so much horrible propaganda people thought they had no choice. Hopefully this lady and everyone else makes a full recovery.
1629,wuqyRBmashA,That shot aged her like 20 years in a span of weeks
1630,wuqyRBmashA,I don't believe the numbers of reactions are that low. I truly believe that the numbers of bad reactions are a lot higher than they're admitting. Too many families that I know are having bad reactions. üòï
1631,wuqyRBmashA,What do you expect from the same company who messed up making baby powder ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1632,qa9_EqFgD04,"This video is bunk- salt in coffee is incredible. In the words of Alton Brown, ""Not only does salt cut the bitterness, but it also smooths out the ‚Äústale‚Äù taste of tank-stored water. (‚Ä¶) And by the way, research has proven that salt is actually better at neutralizing bitterness than sugar"""
1633,qa9_EqFgD04,"In the last month since this came out, and after following groups that have had pfizer, moderna or pfizer, astra it is becoming clear that mixing does not pose any problems and does protect as well as a double of one type."
1634,qa9_EqFgD04,"Apparently, you can mix them, it just depends on what your country's health ministry's approach is."
1635,qa9_EqFgD04,Got my booster in a few hours. No idea which I‚Äôll get but had Pfizer for 1st 2 and was fine after both. I‚Äôve just read Moderna booster can give more protection than another Pfizer. Most people seem to get same one they had for first 2 so I expect I‚Äôll get Pfizer. Not really bothered either way. I have read people who had Astra Zeneca for 1st 2 then get Pfizer or Moderna are more likely to have side effects. Well Astra Zeneca is the 1 I wouldn‚Äôt want and it‚Äôs only being used in people who can‚Äôt have Pfizer or Moderna.
1636,qa9_EqFgD04,No clear reason provided in this video. I hereby declare it as a waste of time.
1637,qa9_EqFgD04,"The NACI in Canada seems to be saying if your first dose was Moderna, getting a second vaccination of Pfizer, if Moderna is unavailable, is fine.  I wonder what the folks at Pfizer and Moderna have to say about that...?"
1638,qa9_EqFgD04,"Meanwhile in a Canadian vaccination center.

""We've only got a half shot of Astra Zeneca and a half shot of Moderna left to make a second dose so we're just going to combine the two"" 

""But I got Pfizer as my first dose..""

""Don't worry, the doctors think it'll be fine"""
1639,qa9_EqFgD04,Me looking at this while I took AstraZeneca first dose and Pfizer second dose ü§°
1640,qa9_EqFgD04,"Especially if you received Pfizer back in December and want your booster to be Moderna (so the vaccine doesn‚Äôt wane quite as much).  It‚Äôs been over 8 months so I assume my immunity is zilch by now. The US is leaving healthcare workers in the dark right now. We‚Äôre working with infectious agents with possibly no immunity. . Yeah, we are anxious and angry"
1641,qa9_EqFgD04,Why there is so little information about Novavax vaccine? Does someone know where to look for?
1642,wWCLBraM4gE,"Two years to make a vaccine, 10 years to test one."
1643,wWCLBraM4gE,Due to the fact  that no NHS or anyone from the research side can be sued now. Way to Dodgy for my liking.
1644,wWCLBraM4gE,"Test it on all MP,S and the Royal family first with a video of them actually taking it at the labs then and only after 1 month would I take it."
1645,wWCLBraM4gE,This is insane...üò®
1646,wWCLBraM4gE,"For last few days I was like ""so I guess this is us now. No birthdays, parties, concerts, celebrations, gatherings, school, traveling."" completely forgetting vaccines exist üòÇ"
1647,wWCLBraM4gE,i think all at the bbc should be first inline for this wonderful vaccine =)
1648,wWCLBraM4gE,Visit Alex Belfields YouTube site and watch his broadcast regarding the new vaccine and the fact that Minks are being culled in Denmark - what he is saying is unfortunately plausible
1649,wWCLBraM4gE,"So... Is it also working on other mutated strains of covid (Denmark,Minks)?"
1650,wWCLBraM4gE,"Let the news outlets try it, if they start saying correct news we know it works"
1651,wWCLBraM4gE,I require much more information on this before i consider it as an option.

Being a kid, they took care of me. 2 years later I had a tetnus, and the same thing happened. I avoided vaccines for 20 years, until I was told to take another tetnus. I told the nurse what happened in the past. She had never heard of problems like this, and told me not to leave after the tetnus. 5 mins, and that recognisable feeling started. Wanting to vomit, shaking, and unable to stand up. The nurse called a Dr, who said ""ah, you are afraid of needles!"". He wouldn't accept anything else. I asked him, ""why does it not happen when I had blood taken?"" He said ""uh, uh..."". I'm not trying to put anyone off, if you want the vaccine, take it, but if you experience what I do, go to a Dr you trust, and one that recognises problems for what they are, rather than trying to talk crap about ""even 6 '5 soldiers getting scared of needles"" (yes, the Dr said that).... My experiences make me sceptical."

1750,Ozk594EtwcE,My left ear is allergic to this video.
1751,Ozk594EtwcE,"My son passed away to Anaphylaxis.  I have been telling people exactly what is said in this video.  I thank you very much for the direct honesty and PLEASE make sure to stay on this message because it is true.  I have been telling all to make sure if you have a history of Anaphylaxis to please make sure to take the precaution of the correct setting, make sure you are observed, and that you communicate clearly with the administrator of your history.  I believe the role of Allergists ( Doctors) should be proactively reaching out to those that might fit this.  Many are confused about what an allergic reaction vs. Anaphylaxis ( life taking - fast-acting EPI and ER sometimes intubation needed)  and in that the awareness the media PR must be.   I would never want to put a person, not even the healthcare worker who has to live with helping in those moments if they are not prepared with the proper equipment, staff, and knowledge of what to do.  Anaphylaxis is The difference between an allergic reaction and anaphylaxis is the latter involves the respiratory and/or cardiovascular system.  My son had been placed on his Asthma meds before receiving his Epi and was driven to the hospital and 911 was not called, I was not with him at the time.  He was only 7.  These all things I knew if I was there, this I now try into teaching and helping everyone.  It happens so quickly and can happen again in 24hrs.  He went into cardiac arrest by the time he got into the ER and the right doctors had been made available upon transfer, that poor doctor came up to me the day of his funeral services and I held him so tight because his life too was forever changed, he wept to me how he did everything possible and I held him and told him I knew and I only wished that he had been prepared before he got to him... Thank you Dr. Fauci and I am not sure if you will ever read this, but I want you to know I am a voice of this, and I will keep to it and please keep to your message, it is so very important to have this as I advocate this truth... Now to make sure everyone has the proper setting equipment and not cause a shortage of epi... and awareness.  I thank all the heroes out there... all of you... Joseph Denicola's Mom Julianne   https://twitter.com/MemoryofJoseph/status/1338569552330969090?s=20

For those of you who need to understand signs, this is a great article that discusses Anaphylaxis  ( as Dr. Fauci is describing) My son was so prone to Anaphylaxis shock even the smallest kiss to his forehead by someone that had coffee early in the morning hours we would be off to the hospital, this meant he would stop breathing..blood pressure drops very quickly... so much that is happening on the inside.  This is not the mere rash... you can read his story too on JosephDenicola.com  Here is a quick article that describes the difference .. Everyone should not be in fear the vaccine can be safe if given in the correct setting and if you do not know if you are one that needs to take precaution call your allergist, if you do not have an allergist and are walking around daily with just an itch here and there, you do not have Anaphylaxis and you would most definitely be seeing an allergist annually for blood works etc. and prescription epi.

1752,Ozk594EtwcE,"Another point of concern was ""none of the vaccine testing"" included those who had previously been exposed to the virus. We know people infected a second time with covid had a negative cascade effect  immuno-response. This is very important given the number of people who are are asymptomatic and do not know that they have contracted the virus. And here we are a year later and there is still no national testing. In my state, I have to be over 65, symptomatic, or have come in contact with somebody who had covid in order to get tested and I need a Rx. So basically nobody knows if they have been infected. 
So what happens if you have antibodies for the virus already for my previous, unknown exposure and then your immune system starts doing somersaults reacting to the viral proteins in the vaccine? 
The fact that they did not test for this in the trials makes me leery given what we know about this virus and the number of people that are going to need to be vaccinated in order for us to get somewhere to normalcy by next year. How likely are people going to take the vaccine if two in ten start having a adverse reaction that includes organ failure or a anaphylactic response?
Again, zero forethought. This is why even if you rush something you do it right. And you never rush something for a political reason."

1844,l6mTAJ08aUI,Why did you guys remove the part where the HIV protein was used in the making of the so called vaccine?
1845,l6mTAJ08aUI,There's a reason why it normally takes 10 to 15 years - it's called trials. Instead they've decided to early trial it on the entire UK population
1846,l6mTAJ08aUI,Genocide - Ivermectin has already shown the shot wasn‚Äôt required
1847,l6mTAJ08aUI,Biggest crime ever perpetrated against the people.
1848,l6mTAJ08aUI,It was won due to the amount of people who cannot think for themselves. We are so easily influenced and manipulated.
1849,l6mTAJ08aUI,Why edit out the part where you explain you used HIV as a clamp for the spike protein?
1850,l6mTAJ08aUI,You took out the part where you used H.I.V in the spike protien!!!
1851,l6mTAJ08aUI,At this point if you still have the ability to think for yourself then you're not going crazy.
1852,l6mTAJ08aUI,the 10 - to 15 years is the testing period to make sure it is safe
1853,l6mTAJ08aUI,This is missing the part about HIV.
1854,ELwYEqzTgSk,"On Christmas Day, my GF and I spent 7 hours visiting, eating, and chatting with about 17 people who are all fully vaccinated. At least 8 of them are either currently sick with covid or just getting over it.

(My GF actually rode to the event and back in a car w two fully jabbed people who were currently covid pos and sick/showing symptoms for 12 hours each way‚Ä¶ without a mask).

One guy who is also fully vaccinated and recently boosted tested positive for covid on the 23rd, so chose to stay home/missed the party. 

Neither of us have had any vaccines at all, and are doing just fine today w zero symptoms. 

Have since heard from several hundred other unjabbed folks that report experiencing the exact same thing over the holidays."

1861,ELwYEqzTgSk,Your immune system is the most precious thing you have. Do not fuck around with it in freaky Frankenstein ways because you are told to by people who stand to make billions from your compliance.
1862,ELwYEqzTgSk,The amount of fool people in comments is actually tragic
1863,ELwYEqzTgSk,I love how all pro-vaccine videos on this channel are raided by anti-vaxx activists. But other videos not based on science any more credible than pro-vaccine ones are not objectionable to them at all. How is that not doublethink?

1911,MI2ke9iEaTE,You don't know your allergic until you have a reaction! Your gambling with your life no matter what we do!
1912,MI2ke9iEaTE,We had two people who suffered the same reaction here in the U.K. The drug and vaccine advisory board immediately issued a warning to people with severe allergic reactions to not take the vaccine. All very calm and measured and sensible. I look at this and you would think that warts started growing on the persons face after they took the vaccine. Now when people take the vaccine they are asked to wait for 10-20 minutes just in case. Question is why wasn‚Äôt the advice given out by the U.K. replicated in the USA as they would know it could happen again?
1913,MI2ke9iEaTE,Nope tf out of this

1966,z3QI_0461_4,how long it is protective?
1967,z3QI_0461_4,Considering these vaccine company's have openly have said they will not guarantee and will not be liable to be sued when things go wrong. so the government has said they will be the ones to pay out when things go wrong.

1983,tYJkhp8lGho,That's half of LA!
1984,tYJkhp8lGho,See this is why nobody believed them when they came out and said it's perfectly safe because it takes time for these things to be revealed.

2005,GOq8-FR8s1E,Dr Seheult treated one of my family members at our local hospital. He is such an upstanding and competent pulmonologist. I had actually been watching his Med Cram videos for years prior to meeting him in person at the bedside of my aunt. It was a serendipitous moment to know that this wonderful doctor lives and practices in my neck of the woods. My aunt fought valiantly but the infection was too powerful for her to prevail. After my aunt passed I had interaction with Dr Seheult‚Äôs office for paper work. And he was always efficient and diligent even then. God bless this guy.
2006,GOq8-FR8s1E,Incredibly detailed and thoroughly explained as usual. You have been a wealth of important information over the last 10 months on this specific topic. I can't thank you enough.  It's so refreshing to get clear and concise explanation of the science as this unfolds.
2007,GOq8-FR8s1E,"Dr. Seheult, you are such a beacon of information.  Your analysis and perpective on the vaccines are most welcomed and very easy to understand.  Love the head scratching...  Salutations de Montr√©al!"
2008,GOq8-FR8s1E,Dr. Seheult's mastery of conveying ideas via the color board is phenomenal.

2010,aCXDkIy1YEg,"Godspeed, our UK cousins. Look forward to seeing you again soon!"
2011,aCXDkIy1YEg,Prayers!! I really do hope we are just being skeptical I hope thats what it is!!
2012,aCXDkIy1YEg,Good luck people of the UK!

2014,aCXDkIy1YEg,When is it going to be released and the exact date of the covid 19 vaccine?
2015,aCXDkIy1YEg,"Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples:¬†‚ÄúThe teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses‚Äô seat.¬†So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.¬†They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people‚Äôs shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.
Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long;¬†they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‚ÄòRabbi‚Äô by others.
‚ÄúBut you are not to be called ‚ÄòRabbi,‚Äô for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.¬†And do not call anyone on earth ‚Äòfather,‚Äô for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah.¬†The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted"".

You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.

If my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land.

And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing¬†in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.¬†But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father,¬†who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.¬†And when you pray, do not keep on babbling¬†like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.¬†Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need¬†before you ask him.

This, then, is how you should pray:

Our Father¬†in heaven,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdom¬†come,
your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one.

For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

These are the teachings,
The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God.
REPENT, and start doing what is right.
If you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples; then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

A time is coming and has now come, that the true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and Truth. God is Spirit, so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and Truth; they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.

In the New Heaven and New Earth,
only Righteousness dwells.
May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with you all."

I was one of many that was fired from a college because I refused to get my experimental pokes, but what makes me angry isn't the fact that the University fired me, but the fact that they forced all the students to take the jabs as well in order to continue their studies and graduate. The school put the demographic that was at the greatest risk of heart problems into a position where they were heavily pressured under duress into taking something that can lead to health complications later in their adult lives and there is no recourse if they are permanently injured."

I agree with you that we should have already eradicated polio, but after what has happened these last three years, I doubt the majority of people would trust our government, or the who to put forth a vaccine for polio, as we have lost faith in the medical system! God bless you and be safe"

Once 80% of the population has received the fifth dose, the restrictions can be relaxed as the sixth dose stops the virus from spreading. I am confident that the seventh dose will solve our problems and we'll have no reason to fear the eighth dose. The clinical phase of the ninth dose will confirm that the antibodies remain stable after the tenth dose. The eleventh dose will insure that no new mutations will develop, so there is no longer any reason to criticize the twelfth dose."

2173,Ozk594EtwcE,"My first allergic reaction to a vaccine was for the BCG at 13 years old. 5 mins after, I felt sick, turned pale, and dropped onto the couch. Being a kid, they took care of me. 2 years later I had a tetnus, and the same thing happened. I avoided vaccines for 20 years, until I was told to take another tetnus. I told the nurse what happened in the past. She had never heard of problems like this, and told me not to leave after the tetnus. 5 mins, and that recognisable feeling started. Wanting to vomit, shaking, and unable to stand up. The nurse called a Dr, who said ""ah, you are afraid of needles!"". He wouldn't accept anything else. I asked him, ""why does it not happen when I had blood taken?"" He said ""uh, uh..."". I'm not trying to put anyone off, if you want the vaccine, take it, but if you experience what I do, go to a Dr you trust, and one that recognises problems for what they are, rather than trying to talk crap about ""even 6 '5 soldiers getting scared of needles"" (yes, the Dr said that).... My experiences make me sceptical."
2174,Ozk594EtwcE,I had an allergic reaction to Pfizer today in front of Walgreens outside by myself. Couldn‚Äôt stand at all. Tried to go in and get help and I kept fainting. Praise God women came and found me outside and praise GOD for saving me!!! I had a full blown allergic reaction outside on the ground and I prayed and was healed! Normally I need Epi-pens or Benadryl but God!!! He is a healer! Believe in him! I cannot get the next vaccine but I have God!!

2178,Ozk594EtwcE,My left ear is allergic to this video.
2179,Ozk594EtwcE,"My son passed away to Anaphylaxis.  I have been telling people exactly what is said in this video.  I thank you very much for the direct honesty and PLEASE make sure to stay on this message because it is true.  I have been telling all to make sure if you have a history of Anaphylaxis to please make sure to take the precaution of the correct setting, make sure you are observed, and that you communicate clearly with the administrator of your history.  I believe the role of Allergists ( Doctors) should be proactively reaching out to those that might fit this.  Many are confused about what an allergic reaction vs. Anaphylaxis ( life taking - fast-acting EPI and ER sometimes intubation needed)  and in that the awareness the media PR must be.   I would never want to put a person, not even the healthcare worker who has to live with helping in those moments if they are not prepared with the proper equipment, staff, and knowledge of what to do.  Anaphylaxis is The difference between an allergic reaction and anaphylaxis is the latter involves the respiratory and/or cardiovascular system.  My son had been placed on his Asthma meds before receiving his Epi and was driven to the hospital and 911 was not called, I was not with him at the time.  He was only 7.  These all things I knew if I was there, this I now try into teaching and helping everyone.  It happens so quickly and can happen again in 24hrs.  He went into cardiac arrest by the time he got into the ER and the right doctors had been made available upon transfer, that poor doctor came up to me the day of his funeral services and I held him so tight because his life too was forever changed, he wept to me how he did everything possible and I held him and told him I knew and I only wished that he had been prepared before he got to him... Thank you Dr. Fauci and I am not sure if you will ever read this, but I want you to know I am a voice of this, and I will keep to it and please keep to your message, it is so very important to have this as I advocate this truth... Now to make sure everyone has the proper setting equipment and not cause a shortage of epi... and awareness.  I thank all the heroes out there... all of you... Joseph Denicola's Mom Julianne   https://twitter.com/MemoryofJoseph/status/1338569552330969090?s=20

For those of you who need to understand signs, this is a great article that discusses Anaphylaxis  ( as Dr. Fauci is describing) My son was so prone to Anaphylaxis shock even the smallest kiss to his forehead by someone that had coffee early in the morning hours we would be off to the hospital, this meant he would stop breathing..blood pressure drops very quickly... so much that is happening on the inside.  This is not the mere rash... you can read his story too on JosephDenicola.com  Here is a quick article that describes the difference .. Everyone should not be in fear the vaccine can be safe if given in the correct setting and if you do not know if you are one that needs to take precaution call your allergist, if you do not have an allergist and are walking around daily with just an itch here and there, you do not have Anaphylaxis and you would most definitely be seeing an allergist annually for blood works etc. and prescription epi.

2180,Ozk594EtwcE,"Another point of concern was ""none of the vaccine testing"" included those who had previously been exposed to the virus. We know people infected a second time with covid had a negative cascade effect  immuno-response. This is very important given the number of people who are are asymptomatic and do not know that they have contracted the virus. And here we are a year later and there is still no national testing. In my state, I have to be over 65, symptomatic, or have come in contact with somebody who had covid in order to get tested and I need a Rx. So basically nobody knows if they have been infected. 
So what happens if you have antibodies for the virus already for my previous, unknown exposure and then your immune system starts doing somersaults reacting to the viral proteins in the vaccine? 
The fact that they did not test for this in the trials makes me leery given what we know about this virus and the number of people that are going to need to be vaccinated in order for us to get somewhere to normalcy by next year. How likely are people going to take the vaccine if two in ten start having a adverse reaction that includes organ failure or a anaphylactic response?
Again, zero forethought. This is why even if you rush something you do it right. And you never rush something for a political reason."

2202,emuTXyu_ei8,Trying not to be racist is actually meaning of racism...
2203,emuTXyu_ei8,"The whole point of the emphasis on race here is that historically, science has often attached less value to people of color.

2207,emuTXyu_ei8,We can tell from the thumbnail that she‚Äôs black and female lol. That‚Äôs very redundant and unnecessary.
2208,emuTXyu_ei8,everytime i see race in the title of something like this they are basically saying black people arent usually smart enough for this but wow here is a black person in this role AMAZIN!

2304,40WLv5FeFBc,What I wouldn't give to hear George Carlin's take on society in 2020/2021.
2305,40WLv5FeFBc,"It also includes communism, social score and reeducation camps."
2306,40WLv5FeFBc,"A product so good, so necessary. You have to bribe people to get it."
2307,40WLv5FeFBc,I choose free will and constitutional rights. Lasts longer.
2308,40WLv5FeFBc,When has the government or pharmaceutical companies ever paid YOU to take something that‚Äôs good for you??
2309,40WLv5FeFBc,"Lady, you have a choice.
Vaccination is voluntary.
Love how you can lie without blinking. That‚Äôs a talent."
2310,40WLv5FeFBc,"Oh yeah I definitely trust the government more, on the count of the fact that they're LITERALLY BRIBING ME now. That makes perfect sense."
2311,40WLv5FeFBc,"""Always trust a government that gives you free stuff."" -Nobody Ever"
2312,MI2ke9iEaTE,I know a guy that got the vaccine then still got COVID 3 weeks later and died in the hospital.  He was healthy with no comorbidities or previous allergies.
2313,MI2ke9iEaTE,The reason why mitch is pushing for the liability protection lol too protect pharma from lawsuits
2314,MI2ke9iEaTE,"""If approved, 6M dosis will ship next week"" So they already mass produced something yet to be approved, or they will rush to make it and ship it? either way id be very concerned about their QC ü§î"
2315,MI2ke9iEaTE,Thats all I needed to hear.  They don't need to go any further because my mind is made up.
2316,MI2ke9iEaTE,Ok props to nbc news for this report. Thank you for honest reporting.
2317,MI2ke9iEaTE,He had NKA by the way don‚Äôt let them lie. Long term side effects are the dangerous ones
2318,MI2ke9iEaTE,I swear when I searched this the bar recommended ‚ÄúCOVID vaccine patient eating other patient‚Äù üò≠‚úã
2319,MI2ke9iEaTE,You don't know your allergic until you have a reaction! Your gambling with your life no matter what we do!
2320,MI2ke9iEaTE,We had two people who suffered the same reaction here in the U.K. The drug and vaccine advisory board immediately issued a warning to people with severe allergic reactions to not take the vaccine. All very calm and measured and sensible. I look at this and you would think that warts started growing on the persons face after they took the vaccine. Now when people take the vaccine they are asked to wait for 10-20 minutes just in case. Question is why wasn‚Äôt the advice given out by the U.K. replicated in the USA as they would know it could happen again?
2321,MI2ke9iEaTE,Nope tf out of this

2338,QyOv2CKATf4,We have successfully delivered 1.7 million vaccine doses .  To the local dump! Wonderful news.
2339,QyOv2CKATf4,The only thing that needs boosting is peoples courage!
2340,QyOv2CKATf4,The people know what these vaccines do to them and their children.  Good for them for standing up to this wickedness.

2421,aCXDkIy1YEg,When is it going to be released and the exact date of the covid 19 vaccine?
2422,aCXDkIy1YEg,"Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples:¬†‚ÄúThe teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses‚Äô seat.¬†So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.¬†They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people‚Äôs shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.
Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long;¬†they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‚ÄòRabbi‚Äô by others.
‚ÄúBut you are not to be called ‚ÄòRabbi,‚Äô for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.¬†And do not call anyone on earth ‚Äòfather,‚Äô for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah.¬†The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted"".

You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.

If my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land.

And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing¬†in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.¬†But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father,¬†who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.¬†And when you pray, do not keep on babbling¬†like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.¬†Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need¬†before you ask him.

This, then, is how you should pray:

Our Father¬†in heaven,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdom¬†come,
your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one.

For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

These are the teachings,
The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God.
REPENT, and start doing what is right.
If you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples; then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

A time is coming and has now come, that the true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and Truth. God is Spirit, so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and Truth; they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.

In the New Heaven and New Earth,
only Righteousness dwells.
May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with you all."

2427,VNIBK5KXS_k,"Thank you so much for really breaking it down! I‚Äôm 10 weeks pregnant now (went through IVF after trying for a year now!) this really helped dissipate the fears I had and I was really on the fence about getting vaccinated. There‚Äôs just so many people saying so many things but really in the end It comes down to this.. I don‚Äôt want to die. I have a little girl already and am now expecting another baby.. I want to be here for my children. My daughter is almost 2.. she wouldn‚Äôt even remember me if I died of covid. I need to think about her and what it would do to her if I died. So I‚Äôve made my decision and your video was really just the push I needed to actually schedule it. Thank you.
And to those who might read this and not agree, it‚Äôs absolutely YOUR choice to not get vaccinated but please I don‚Äôt need anyone bashing me or putting me down for making a decision for ME. What I choose for me doesn‚Äôt effect your life any! Thanks üíú"

2430,VNIBK5KXS_k,I like your approach. You are very nonjudgmental and I am thankful for that. It stands you apart from other providers. So thank you!

I am 8 weeks and hesitant to do it in my 1st trimester"
2432,VNIBK5KXS_k,"Thank you for talking about this, this was a fear of mine because i am TTC so this makes me feel better.

I do have another question though it‚Äôs not about vaccines but does ibuprofen have an effect on your fertility. Cause i do take ibuprofen when i‚Äôm on my period because of the excruciating pain and cramps i get."
2433,VNIBK5KXS_k,"Excellent video. Clear, concise and to the point. Just what we needed to hear. Thank you."
2434,VNIBK5KXS_k,THANK YOU FOR TALKING ABOUT THIS!!
2435,VNIBK5KXS_k,You answered all of my questions thank you. I still feel more comfortable waiting till after I give birth getting it. But is it possible for me to get it right after labor if I have an emergency c section of the epidural?

2498,cNl_vW_yV5Q,Did you have both arms vaccine shots or one side only after 2nd dose?
2499,cNl_vW_yV5Q,"Useful video. I had a a very long drawn out experience with Covid and vaccines. Previously a very fit strength & conditioning coach. I  had Covid December 2020. First vaccine in March, with no real impact. However, after the second vaccine my left arm swelled up and I felt very unwell. I visited my doctor, who sent me straight to the emergency dept. At this stage I had severe arm tremors, blood pressure of 190/160 and a resting heart rate of 158 bpm (I'm normally around 55 bpm). The doctor in the emergency dept. said I had an overactive thyroid gland and wanted to treat me for that issue. I left the hospital unimpressed with the diagnosis. My conditions worsened over the next month and I had to have a second visit to hospital and was administered several drips and had my second set of chest, ECG and blood tests. 6 months later I am waiting on an ECHO scan to rule out Myocarditis/Pericarditis as I still have very high blood pressure, liver enzyme and heart rate. Prior to this experience I had 3 days off work due to sickness over a 15 year period. I have now been off work for 6 months. Finally, I was due my booster vaccine two weeks ago. The heath professional declined to administer it to me on the basis of my previous experiences.

The Lancet has an excellent article on long term-Covid (June 2021) which can be accessed via Google Scholar. I think my reaction was a combination of long-coved, combined with a vaccine response. Hopefully this is of use to some of you."

that being said, she had just one dose of astra zeneca a year ago - she said that she felt like she‚Äôs about to die the evening after, never felt more sick in her entire life. didn‚Äôt get the second dose. i know her for almost 10 yrs and she generally never gets sick. 

i consider myself a well read individual, went through numerous data on the matter and am generally for the vaccines. i just have some questions that‚Äôs quite difficult to find definitive answers."

I don't particularly feel  empowered by being right in this case nor will anyone give me credit for it but everyone around me who has had the shot has been sick with all kinds of weird stuff from pericarditis to thinking they have parasites.

Started feeling as if the muscles in them As shaking extremely hard like they where hello. Can't truly explain how this felt. It's been 3 weeks since vaccine and my left leg is so painful when I walk, sit lay down. Do I think my leg worsened by vaccine? Yes, I do. I did not take second injection.

I visited the doctor to see what the issue was and it turns out I have high blood pressure (stage 2 hypertension). No matter what medications I take or life style changes I make it will not reduce and the headaches will not go away. I've been dealing with this for over 2 months now and I feel like giving up. I would understand if I had high blood pressure if I live an unhealthy lifestyle but I don't. I workout every single day, have a healthy diet. I work at a gym for god sakes and Infact I manage one. No matter what other changes I make and medications I take, my BP will not reduce and the headaches won't stop. I can't help but think that this is an effect of the moderna vaccine I took.

It hurts me when people don't take it seriously and people just tell me ""it doesn't even hurt"" or ""just get on with it"" that doesn't help me in the slightest. The pressure to get this vaccine has been giving me 24/7 stress and I want it so bad but can't seem to get it done. I'm not selfish for not getting it done, it's just mental stress that I can't physically handle"

But it was so quick and painless that I actually started laughing when it was done because of how silly I felt. It wasn't even a sharp scratch like I've heard some people describe, but more like a dull poke that lasted less than a second."

I have the same issue and find it difficult to explain to people what it's like. But being in a room full of people getting vaccines, in a hospital setting, needles and the smell of disinfectant does not  help at all. He should be in a cubicle where there are not visual stimuli and the nurse should get the job done quickly without talking for 20 minutes.

She still demands I get the shot but I just smile and say no thank you. She has had all kinds of problems since getting the shot but won't admit it's from the shot. I don't particularly feel  empowered by being right in this case nor will anyone give me credit for it but everyone around me who has had the shot has been sick with all kinds of weird stuff from pericarditis to thinking they have parasites. Eating healthy and exercise... Keeping your mind right is the best medicine."

Started feeling as if the muscles in them As shaking extremely hard like they where hello. Can't truly explain how this felt. It's been 3 weeks since vaccine and my left leg is so painful when I walk, sit lay down. Do I think my leg worsened by vaccine? Yes, I do. I did not take second injection. I don't blame anyone who does or does not take  vaccine. Just my experience."

I visited the doctor to see what the issue was and it turns out I have high blood pressure (stage 2 hypertension). No matter what medications I take or life style changes I make it will not reduce and the headaches will not go away. I've been dealing with this for over 2 months now and I feel like giving up. I would understand if I had high blood pressure if I live an unhealthy lifestyle but I don't. I workout every single day, have a healthy diet. I work at a gym for god sakes and Infact I manage one. No matter what other changes I make and medications I take, my BP will not reduce and the headaches won't stop. I can't help but think that this is an effect of the moderna vaccine I took. Please think twice before putting anything in your body and please get regular checkups from the doctor to avoid the feeling I have right now."

It hurts me when people don't take it seriously and people just tell me ""it doesn't even hurt"" or ""just get on with it"" that doesn't help me in the slightest. The pressure to get this vaccine has been giving me 24/7 stress and I want it so bad but can't seem to get it done. I'm not selfish for not getting it done, it's just mental stress that I can't physically handle"

2705,-QadUB9OrH8,"Pfizer booster shot for general population in the US will most likely be approved on September 20. Moderna booster shot is lagging behind but will be approved in the coming weeks too. Both booster jabs will have the same formula as their original vaccines at this point. This causes concerns because of the new and more contagious variants. Some doctors say we don't even need booster shots at this time, some advice on 8 months after receiving the last jab, others want us to get a booster shot after 5-6 months!! This's so confusing that the two top FDA doctors left the agency amid growing concerns and disagreements. And what about people who actually had COVID? Studies show that their immune response (antibody count) is actually higher than those who have been fully vaccinated. I live in New York City and I'm so tired of this ‚Ä¶"

2730,mtr3iyXiqh0,"If Eric had died from this unlicensed drug, there would have been candle light vigils, tears and tributes. He has serious side effects, it knocks him sideways, speaks out and he's labeled a far right nut? The world is absolutely in a dark place right now. I now have a couple of family members and two friends who have had reactions to this, one was refused his own blood test results after his collapse, it's disgusting."
2731,mtr3iyXiqh0,"I have Type 2 Diabetes.  It was under control.  All of us here that have it know that when you get the flu or fighting an infection the inflammatory response will make your glucose rise.   Shortly after I got my second dose of the Moderna vaccine I spiked a low grade fever, my glucose spiked higher that it's been in a long time,  381mg/dl.   Before the vaccine my glucose was under control with no meds and eating an ultra low carb diet maintaining a 120 mg/dl-160mg/dl with no meds.   I didn't want to my glucose to stay high so I've drank lots of water and took my meds for a while and found it very difficult to keep my glucose under 240mg/dl with the meds.  I was also eating ultra low carb as I have been for the past 3 years.   In two weeks a bout of Tinnitus  started.  I'm glad I have self discipline because man the constant sound of a gas leak + a high pitch ringing that you can't escape is pretty brutal.   Fast forward to 4 months later and I have been able to reduce my glucose meds to two doses per week, eat ultra low carb and the Tinnitus stopped.   But now I have a constant brain fog.   Dr. said it appears that it's a case of Covid Fatigue and does not know how long it will persist.   I am an Engineer.  I need to be sharp.    
I'm hoping that soon I will be able to stop the glucose meds entirely and control my glucose with an ulta low carb diet again.  The meds
actually contribute to the progression of the disease since glucose will build in your liver and muscle tissue, and extra insulin is secreted from your pancreas to normalize your glucose.  It does not make you better.  It sweeps the problem under the rug.  That's why I do what I do,  ultra low carb diet just helps your body do what it's supposed to do.  

I should of known that since the Covid vaccine could trigger an inflammatory response that my glucose would spike.

I bet if someone has an illness that gets worse with an inflammatory immune response the Covid vaccine will make it worse.
I don't trust and form of  media any more.    We need to draw our own conclusions.

No one involved with any government of any Country should be allow to own any stock in a pharmaceutical company."
2732,mtr3iyXiqh0,Eric isn't alone. My buddy decided to get the shots and both his arms and hands and wrists swelled-up. It was so painful he was literally in tears. I witnessed this and there's no way I would be able to play guitar or piano in that condition. It has taken steroid injections and intense therapy to reduce the side effects. There's probably thousands more cases who have gone unreported.
2733,mtr3iyXiqh0,"After my daughters second jab she started clotting-she now lives without a rib and will be on medication forever.

They are a dutch bio tech firm with a deep expertise in vaccine technology. The J&J vaccine was developed thanks to the combine expertise of these companies.  And yet the goal of this video is to show the backstory of Janssen and to show that their history/experience in the Congo was one reason why they were able to lead out on this effort. I should have clarified the details about Crucell. that would have been a more accurate picture. I could have made a video entirely on Crucell and Dutch vaccine expertise. that would have been an interesting video too. but it's a different story.  Hope that's helpful."

One day after the first shot she had heart pain and days later was in emergency diagnosed with pericarditis, fluid around her heart,  after all other tests ruled everything else out. She is a runner and was out of breath after a few steps and is on meds.The doctors are required by law to report adverse reactions within one business day (in Canada) and it wasn't reported.  She has backing now by her Cardiologist and other people going forward with bringing this to the attention of the health authorities.  If you have any symptoms get checked asap.

Also, Pfizer litigates against safety data sheets from being released."
2957,oOUlee5W_eo,"Why request ""emergency authorization"" and not just release it after approval, kids are not high risk?? OH WAIT! Because under ""emergency authorization"" the manufacturer becomes shielded by the PREP Act ensuring they cannot be sued by patients over side effects. Got it."

It‚Äôs surprising to many that there are still clinical trials going on, even though many millions are getting vaccinated."
2978,i2-Ju5AtfKk,"Another reason the one-month comparison is not fair is that it is measured *one month after the second shot* for two-dose vaccines, compared to one month after the only shot for J&J.

It is comparing 4-week numbers to 7 or 8 week numbers, and the second stage trials of J&J noted protection continued to increase after the one month mark... up to 100% of the test group over time (although the test group was fairly small, because second stage trials are small)."

This is how I lost my step-father‚Ä¶. Heart attack after waking up to pee in the middle of the night‚Ä¶.. 
I‚Äôm sick of the spin."
2994,iomQxux4CAQ,"I had a violent seizure after taking the vaccine. I‚Äôve never had one before and it was beyond scary. If someone was not at my home with me to take me to the emergency room, I don‚Äôt know what would have happen to me. 
I noticed that I‚Äôve had other issues as well, such as chest pains whenever I go out bike riding or simply playing tug of war with my dog. 

I‚Äôm 27 (25 at the time of the seizure), physically fit, don‚Äôt smoke, only drink a couple glasses of wine once every 2 weeks, eat healthy and have always been healthy. 
Heart disease or seizures do not run in my family. 

I was pro Covid vaccines before I started having these issues. Now I regret it and question if it was worth sacrificing my health."
2995,iomQxux4CAQ,And since when is the family required to make public the cause of death? Using a family's loss and grief as a talking point is as low as it comes.  What a heartless and despicable human being
2996,iomQxux4CAQ,It is laughable that she asks if she is a conspiracy theorist or Nostradamus and claims to be neither. Then she goes on to do as Nostradamus would do and make a prediction that is driven by conspiracy theorist üòÄüòÉüòÑüòÅ    üòÄüòÉüòÑüòÅ  The irony !!!!

6. What vaccine, that's supposed to be safe, had immunity from prosecution and hides trial data for 95 years?"

3011,_LrxVcM9_Sc,We support these people protecting our rights against tyrants.
3012,_LrxVcM9_Sc,"No one should be ""punished"" over not getting Vacced"
3013,_LrxVcM9_Sc,This is the first time in Australia's history that we have mandated a largely healthy population into getting a vaccine that has many unknown outcomes.
3014,_LrxVcM9_Sc,Bullying and coercion. Welcome to draconian Australia. Disgusting.
3015,_LrxVcM9_Sc,"Plain and simple. You cannot coerce or force someone into a medical procedure, it is law. What a crazy world we live in now."
3016,_LrxVcM9_Sc,Government should stay out of the Doctors office. It's NO place for them... how dare they dictate what we choose to do with our own health??? Abhorrent. Disgraceful. I will never vote for any of them again.
3017,_LrxVcM9_Sc,Nobody should be forced to take something that we don't know the long term effects of
3018,_LrxVcM9_Sc,The government is smart. Leaves the mandate for businesses to enforce to escape the backlash.
3019,_LrxVcM9_Sc,Good on you guys/girls for standing up for all Australian people's freedom of choice and rights. Human rights must be maintained!
3020,_LrxVcM9_Sc,"""punishment""? Yes that's the right word. Coercion and force."

3047,YFtl603V9m0,"I think it's time for Kochie to resign from TV, just goes to show how out of touch he is calling for mandatory vaccinations."
3048,YFtl603V9m0,Kochi has shown himself to be very dystopian. He should be banned from television immediately.
3049,YFtl603V9m0,"Kochie, people have a right to choose. Just like many people will choose to switch you off and find other credible people to listen to - not the MSN!!"

3056,MnV9LumDxZk,The man is genuinely trying his very best not to burst out laughing and only half succeeding
3057,MnV9LumDxZk,This was one of the most pathetic performances ever witnessed on British television. Does he honestly believe he fooled ANYONE?
3058,MnV9LumDxZk,"Laughing at how gullible people are, while lining his pockets in the process."
3059,MnV9LumDxZk,He literally tried digging his eye for a tear... Not even a drop

3106,om3frsTgPH8,"Hi.
Can you clarify if this drink can reduce side effects because I've seen many websites that say citrus fruits won't reduce side effects; I'm not entirely sure if ""Fever, Weakness and Dizziness"" are considered side effects since I'm not a medical practitioner myself but I've referred to many real doctors on this platform and on other news websites. I've also not seen other people on Youtube posting something similar to this, maybe since this is ""a drink [recommended] by the doctors that one needs to drink for at least 2 to 3 days every few hours to avoid fever weakness and giddiness"", so I am not sure why others won't support this claim.

""Nutritionists suggest eating foods that are good for the immune system: broccoli, garlic, citrus fruits, ginger and green tea to name a few. These won‚Äôt protect you from the actual coronavirus or vaccine side effects, they just help keep you healthy so you‚Äôll be in tiptop shape should you come down with anything."" According to a Japanese article.

Let me know if I'm just being paranoid."

3132,RArZyMK0O8U,They need to keep track all the symptoms & deaths from the covid vaccine open to the public like they did with the covid virus page.
3133,RArZyMK0O8U,"100% Efficacy because the Placebo group in this trial was ignored when giving out the results. It's the same for all of the other injectables. The Placebo sides of the trial gets ignored, all the folk that didn't get in the control side are ignored to make the results much much better looking than they are. You need to add in the Control side of each trial to get the Absolute Risk Reduction for the entire population of the Trial. This is against FDA guidelines but somehow has been allowed since this thing started.  If you combine the results you get the actual Absolute Risk Reduction, i.e. your true benefit from the entire trial, the actual advantage for getting the injectable.  The Kids trials moves from 100% to 1.5% if you do that. Only 18 kids tested positive from PCR in the control group, none of them had any symptoms at all, so how many were false positive and at what level was the Cycle Threshold for the PCR (anything over 28 doubling cycles is mostly meaningless).  All of the injectables are 'sold' to the public like this, the authorities are not dumb and know this.  The Actual advantage for most of the other trials is in the region of around 1% benefit.  No one knows the long term safety profile, no one, because it takes 2 to 3 years minimum to start seeing any longer term issues.  Pfizer enrolled all of Israel in their study (Israel jumped the que in return) for long term safety data, when you examine that paperwork you see the trial end date is set at Jan 2023."

3138,RArZyMK0O8U,"A leading breast imaging organization in the country is recommending that women wait to schedule a mammogram until four weeks after their COVID-19 vaccine over concerns about an odd new side effect.

The Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) is warning that women who were recently vaccinated could have swelling and a lump in the lymph nodes of their armpit, which can be mistaken as a sign of breast cancer. The SBI issued the recommendation in a recently-released three-page document, which warns about the risk of the vaccine causing axillary adenopathy, aka a change in the size and consistency of lymph nodes in the armpit that can be a sign of breast cancer. (In the case of breast cancer, axillary adenopathy can be a signal that breast cancer has spread.)

While the SBI says that axillary adenopathy is ‚Äúrare‚Äù in general and ‚Äúrarely reported‚Äô after HPV and flu vaccines, it also notes that women who have recently been vaccinated against COVID-19 may experience this.

The SBI cites data that found 11.6% of patients who received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine had swelling or tenderness after receiving their second shot and that lymphadenopathy, i.e. swelling, happened in more than 1% of people in clinical trials. These symptoms were more rare in people who received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, but they did happen."

3147,5agQe6NHCs0,"You need to put a context on this for us. My md said the flu vaccine is only 40%.  75 % is pretty awesome, although, frankly, I really don‚Äôt believe J&J.

3201,i2wnAW0JMxo,"22 years old and I have a severe fear of needles. I've been to have my vaccine done twice now and had the biggest panic attack before they even got the needle out and couldn't go through with it. It hurts me when people don't take it seriously and people just tell me ""it doesn't even hurt"" or ""just get on with it"" that doesn't help me in the slightest. The pressure to get this vaccine has been giving me 24/7 stress and I want it so bad but can't seem to get it done. I'm not selfish for not getting it done, it's just mental stress that I can't physically handle"
3202,i2wnAW0JMxo,"Im in the exact same position, 23 with a deadly fear of needles. My province has made the covid passport mandatory which was basically my worst nightmare"

Anyone that says to ""suck it up"" and ""get over it"" even if they are in the medical field, number 1. does not belong in the medical field, number 2. should find a job working in another career, number 3. lacks empathy"

I have the same issue and find it difficult to explain to people what it's like. But being in a room full of people getting vaccines, in a hospital setting, needles and the smell of disinfectant does not  help at all. He should be in a cubicle where there are not visual stimuli and the nurse should get the job done quickly without talking for 20 minutes. Then he should be allowed to leave the triggering setting to relax and recover outside. Also wearing headphones and listening to a podcast or music is a great way to remain relaxed. This only works if the nurse does not insist on taking the headphones off to tell him something he doesn't care about."

""COVID-19 IN CADIZ
An epidemic in a Los Barrios residence causes 46 coronavirus deaths
The Andalusian competent authorities intervened by ordering the inoculation of the second dose of the vaccine to be stopped in the center ""

But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.¬†They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people‚Äôs shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.
Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long;¬†they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‚ÄòRabbi‚Äô by others.
‚ÄúBut you are not to be called ‚ÄòRabbi,‚Äô for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.¬†And do not call anyone on earth ‚Äòfather,‚Äô for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah.¬†The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted"".
Matt 23 NIV

You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.
""If my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land.""

And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing¬†in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.¬†But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father,¬†who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.¬†And when you pray, do not keep on babbling¬†like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.¬†Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need¬†before you ask him.

This, then, is how you should pray:

Our Father¬†in heaven,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdom¬†come,
your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one.

For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

These are the teachings,
The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God.
REPENT, and start doing what is right.
If you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples; then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

A time is coming and has now come, that the true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and Truth. God is Spirit, so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and Truth; they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.

In the New Heaven and New Earth,
only Righteousness dwells.
May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with you all."

So, having been given 'dissinformation', based on your informed consent policy, my parents took it.  My dad died two months later.  He spent his last few of days in hostpital.  My mum asked why the windows wouldn't open in his room & the nurse said, because the ward was built for covid.

3318,IMY4UOA7E_w,"Hey everyone quick clarification (as made clear by the 8 million comments on the matter): The COVID vaccine was developed in the Netherlands by Janssen Vaccines, also known as Crucell. They are a dutch bio tech firm with a deep expertise in vaccine technology. The J&J vaccine was developed thanks to the combine expertise of these companies.  And yet the goal of this video is to show the backstory of Janssen and to show that their history/experience in the Congo was one reason why they were able to lead out on this effort. I should have clarified the details about Crucell. that would have been a more accurate picture. I could have made a video entirely on Crucell and Dutch vaccine expertise. that would have been an interesting video too. but it's a different story.  Hope that's helpful."

3426,bPDm-RV0Xks,"This is so weird. I am not vaccinated, as I didn't feel like taking a vaccine that had no previous longterm study. I hadn't caught covid up until the end of December 2021. I had all these beginning symptoms you describe here. A bad headache, my body hurt, my skin felt like I had a sunburn. All of this mainly subsided by day 10 and then another 5 days for my breathing and stamina to regulate. Sounds like actually catching covid was easier then getting this shot and dealing with the unnatural side affects. God made our bodies strong. People need to stop listening to these so called experts (who are in big pharmas pocket) and start tapping into the spirit within. We are strong energetic beings, if only we start treating our bodies and minds like the temple they are meant to be."
3427,bPDm-RV0Xks,"After I started warning them NOT to take the bioweapon injections, even months before the demonic fluid was rolled out, I lost my whole family. My wife made it clear she was going to take it, and was going to have my sons take it too. I was forcibly kicked out by her and her friends who ganged up against me. She then had me kicked out of our connect group. She then threatened to have me thrown out of the church because I was the only one who refused to wear a mask. She became a very cold and insensitive person, when once she used to be a kind and gentle woman. Please pray for her and my sons, whom she has set against me, and I have not seen them for more than 2.5years. Thank you."

3493,Y8tjtaFXCFw,"Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: ‚ÄúThe teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses‚Äô seat. So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people‚Äôs shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.
Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‚ÄòRabbi‚Äô by others.
‚ÄúBut you are not to be called ‚ÄòRabbi,‚Äô for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‚Äòfather,‚Äô for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted"".
Matthew 23 NIV

You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.
""If my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land.""

And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

This, then, is how you should pray:

Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdom come,
your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one.

For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

These are the teachings,
The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God.
REPENT, and start doing what is right.
If you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples; then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

A time is coming and has now come, that the true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and Truth. God is Spirit, so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and Truth; they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.

In the New Heaven and New Earth,
only Righteousness dwells.
May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with you all."

They also obscure it by including too wide of an age range in the summary.. The point is that they make a summary statement that obscures risk and informed consent, almost certain that lay people will rely on this statement rather than looking at the data.

An occasion arose whereby several of our soldiers had been cut off behind enemy lines. A volunteer was required to get to these brave men with a view to guiding them back to safety. He volunteered. He got to our men but there were too many to return on foot unseen. He saw a German half track unguarded. He jumped in with full British battle dress, put on the German helmet left on the seat but tried everything to get the blasted thing started...lights, wipers, indicators...until he found a button on the floor. He spoke no German other than yaa when passing German sentries... the half track was cramped full with our troops. He saved them all. He couldn‚Äôt have been 10 st socking wet. After the war he became finance director of a well known car dealership in Swansea.

He actually told me this story about 6 months before he died of old age.

Here‚Äôs to Len Smale MM."
3542,z1K8ZkA8ukk,"Love the green and the red poppy! God bless you Dr. John. Great, safe day. Your diligence is so appreciated üôèüèΩüòä"
3543,z1K8ZkA8ukk,"Such dedication, Doc! How do you do it? Day after day, you prove to be superhuman! Thanks so much for your many, many months of hard work that has kept us in the loop. We appreciate you more than words can express. And it's always moving hearing you correct the odd blooper made in a previous clip. Shows ethics and responsibility. Kudos!"
3544,z1K8ZkA8ukk,"John, you've been great, you've been so informative, so concise and willing to report anomalies when they occur, you're a real inspiration."
3545,z1K8ZkA8ukk,Thank you Doctor. Be well all. Best wishes from Canada on this Remembrance day. Today we remember those who served at are now at greatest risk.
3546,z1K8ZkA8ukk,"How refreshing to hear someone admit they may have inadvertently misinformed people. One of the reasons so many trust you I think. As usual your information was clear and concise, and you remain my primary source! What are we all going to watch when this is all over??? Thank you, as always John."
3547,z1K8ZkA8ukk,You have kept us safe and sane.thank you .you are an example of the best of humanity .
3548,377UvhOxL_s,I‚Äôm never voting for another Democrat again after this stunt.
3549,377UvhOxL_s,This isn't about a vaccine mandate.  This is about a mandate precedent.  What is allowed here opens a door and is just the beginning.
3550,377UvhOxL_s,This is way more serious than these reporters are portraying it as.
3551,377UvhOxL_s,"You can never give an INCH, or they will always take a mile...."
3552,377UvhOxL_s,Biden forgot he said he would not mandate it.  He also thought he was running for senate.
3553,377UvhOxL_s,"Not about the vaccine anymore guys, its about allowing the government to mandate things similar to this"
3554,377UvhOxL_s,Yet Congress is exempt from the mandate. Chew on that for a while.
3555,377UvhOxL_s,"Alaska, Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Georgia, Alabama, Idaho, Kansas, South Carolina, Utah and West Virginia are more than a handful."
3556,377UvhOxL_s,"Tennessee, Kentucky and Ohio filed suit Thursday. That's 21 states so far."
3557,377UvhOxL_s,"Not even all of the CDC employees are vaccinated, but I'm supposed to be? OK."
3558,sV6o4SMEyNs,It is sad when people do not learn from their history.
3559,sV6o4SMEyNs,Vice is like that one puppet in the puppet show that has its operator's wrist visible.
3560,sV6o4SMEyNs,Do the opposite of whatever vice says and youll be fine
3561,sV6o4SMEyNs,"Bruh, this sh!t would be absolute GOLD for a Boondocks episode smdh"
3562,sV6o4SMEyNs,Lmaooo no way this is not satire... It's hilarious when you know the context of the tuskegee experiment and the title of the video.
3563,sV6o4SMEyNs,Ignorance breeds suffering
3564,sV6o4SMEyNs,What about their relative that was actually the victim of Tuskegee Syphilis experiment and the lies? I bet their voice wouldn't have been bought like their descendent was in this interview
3565,sV6o4SMEyNs,the entire video was everyone saying they dont trust it then the old lady at the end says to get it so that's how you title it lmfaooooooo. anything vice tells you do the opposite
3566,sV6o4SMEyNs,You can't have multiple moments like that from the government and expect people to keep bouncing back with their trust. Government has shown they can't be trusted... this sentiment will stick around for years to come
3567,sV6o4SMEyNs,"Yall exploited that woman and lied to us with your headline. This was a bait and switch manipulation.  Clearly, she doesn't have enough information to be telling anyone besides herself what to do ( I am so sorry ma'am, I am not meaning to disrespect you, but we have to be honest here. I do hope you have a wonderful, blessed life.) 

This article should have been spotlighting the two gentlemen and their facts/information. We should focus on what THEY are saying and particularly, what they are ""refusing"" to say ( read between the lines).   

You should have done better. You should have labeled this appropriately and you have now fallen into the category of typical media. Might as well be fox."
3568,Fa3v5HOTOpI,I‚Äôm experiencing everything you described right now. If I wasn‚Äôt in healthcare and didn‚Äôt need to travel I would never of got vaccinated. This second dose is no joke! ü§í
3569,Fa3v5HOTOpI,"Both doses of Moderna gave me extreme body aches and fatigue, I also had chills/fever. They mainly last 24-48 hours, but I made the mistake of working out in close proximity to both shots so I‚Äôm certain that didn‚Äôt help. Super grateful for the privilege of being vaccinated though!"
3570,Fa3v5HOTOpI,"After my 1st Moderna shot, I had a sore arm. After the 2nd shot, I had a sore arm, slight chill, slight sore back and legs. I did not have a fever or nausea or headache.  I did not feel worn out. I did not take any medication. I'm a male age 60."
3571,Fa3v5HOTOpI,"Man the second dose destroyed me. Fever, bad chills, extreme heartburn because of ibuprofen. 6/10 would definitely recommend"
3572,Fa3v5HOTOpI,My 2nd moderna shot i took yesterday morning.  I'm feeling it now and my arm is sore with a slight fever.  I took 2 tylenol.  Thanks for not making me feel alone on this.  I just think that the consequences are a lot more lethal!
3573,Fa3v5HOTOpI,I‚Äôve noticed Tylenol doesn‚Äôt work for me and I took extra strength. Motrin was much better
3574,Fa3v5HOTOpI,"I got my second dose of the Pfizer about 30 hours ago, and my symptoms sound pretty similar, only when I took Tylenol it seemed to help the headache/nausea, at least for awhile."
3575,Fa3v5HOTOpI,"I took dose 2 on yesterday may 4th in the afternoon and was fine through the day I.experienced the same side effects fever, chills and body aches all throughout the night.. also a dry throat."
3576,Fa3v5HOTOpI,Man those chills are no joke. And then the body aches next day I feel were amplified because of the chills
3577,Fa3v5HOTOpI,I'm 38 hours post  2nd Moderna shot. I have a sore arm and nothing else. I feel good üëç I'm 33 year old female
3578,MSjqi2Zw9JY,"In the past, trials were properly independent. Now, the pharmaceutical companies do their own clinical trials and hand over the data."
3579,MSjqi2Zw9JY,"A vaccine so safe, the manufacturers are immune to public liability, a vaccine so effective, you have to be ""paid"",  ""nudged"" or coerced into taking it."
3580,MSjqi2Zw9JY,The highest bidder and biggest investment.
3581,MSjqi2Zw9JY,"They‚Äôve been saying ‚Äòno known long term side effects‚Äô, because we haven‚Äôt had it long term! 
And, you can‚Äôt sue the company for any side effects, if you get any. 
It‚Äôll stick with my immune system thanks"
3582,MSjqi2Zw9JY,"Golden rule... when government say ""panic"" you don't worry. When they say ""don't panic"" you know your screwed."
3583,MSjqi2Zw9JY,Why couldn't all the money go towards actually funding the NHS properly to deal with covid? covid wards are only 'full' cos there is only 10 beds per hospital.
3584,MSjqi2Zw9JY,"Very informative, definitely help me decide to wait."
3585,MSjqi2Zw9JY,This feels like a paid advertisement not news
3586,MSjqi2Zw9JY,Get the civil servant approving the vaccine to be the one with 600K of shares so he profits
3587,MSjqi2Zw9JY,The fact they have to promote this explanation is another nail in the coffin. Corruption at its best.
3588,h4ubjd_Asko,He forgot to mention there's no long term safety data.
3589,h4ubjd_Asko,This Dr has given blatant false information.
3590,h4ubjd_Asko,Dr rigi
3591,h4ubjd_Asko,All lies
3592,h4ubjd_Asko,"What a liar, he has just suffered a mystery medical emergency. You sold your soul by going on tv and told everyone to take it. How many would have listened to him."
3593,MbbuP-6P5qo,"Those of us who didn't get vaccinated don't look so stupid now, do we?"
3594,MbbuP-6P5qo,"I'm not a conspiracy theorist.  I am a critical thinker, familiar with the history of government and the nature of people."
3595,MbbuP-6P5qo,"I'm in the US and my husband was on Medicare (age 73).  His occupation mandated the jab, and as he was religious in his annual influenza shots, never questioned the safety.  I begged him not to take it.  First dose of Pfizer on 02/19/21....he fell and landed in hospital within 48 hours from loss of sensation in his legs.  Jab #2 was on 3/20/21.  He fell again and landed in the hospital for 'observation'.  He sailed through a very risky spinal surgery on C2 and C3 on 8/10/21.  I begged him not to get the booster, but he did on 10/16/21.  Admitted to hospital again with excrutiating abdominal pain on 11/16/21.  He was to be discharged on 11/20/21.  My oldest son spoke with him on 11/18/21, and they agreed to have their evening chat at 9:00 pm. The call ended at about 12:25 pm.  At 2:30 pm. some hospital 'chaplain' called the house to ask if I was related to him...that they found him on the floor with a gash on his head and had aspirated his vomit.  This was in Los Angeles...He died at 9:04 pm and fought like h-ll.  Those bastards at the hospital refuse to give me his medical records.  His primary care physician will be released from federal prison on May 14th. for Medicare fraud.  I didn't take the poison so I wasn't allowed in the hospital.  Dear God these people are EVIL! Yes, I've exhausted every legal avenue.  It helps to share my story with those who can empathize."
3596,MbbuP-6P5qo,The unions that didn't stand behind their people over this covid vaccine should be held accountable
3597,MbbuP-6P5qo,"One of the best decisions I ever made in my life?

Refusing the covid vaccine."
3598,MbbuP-6P5qo,To be a conspiracy theorist is to believe that companies with a long history of harming the public will continue to do so.
3599,MbbuP-6P5qo,"We are not conspiracy theorists, we just use common sense."
3600,MbbuP-6P5qo,"If you are a Pureblood (aka, non-vaccinated with the CONvid-19 jab) I have the utmost respect for you. üëç"
3601,MbbuP-6P5qo,"I never believed the government from day 1. I lost my job, because I wouldn't have the jab. My marriage of 35yrs, was tested to the limits. Family m6thought I was nuts, for not taking the jab. I even questioned myself, and nearly  succumbed to taking the jab, because I wasn't getting the support from loved ones. But I stayed strong, and boy am I so glad I did."
3602,MbbuP-6P5qo,The best thing about being a conspiracy theorist is not having myocarditis.
3603,VGm7Dfp0EXo,"Don‚Äôt forget to smash the like button if you believe in science ü§ó‚ú®. It helps me with the algorithm so we can educate more people! 

P.s. comment down below and let me know if you‚Äôve already gotten your vaccine and what symptoms you had!"

3605,VGm7Dfp0EXo,"Thank you so much Miki, I am scheduled to take my first dose tomorrow. I am nervous but excited. I just want everything to be alright. This video has made me feel less nervous."
3606,VGm7Dfp0EXo,omgeee love this!
3607,VGm7Dfp0EXo,"I'm a highschooler and i just signed up for advanced chemistry and bio classes today! I really hope these courses can get me into nursing school...you are such an inspiration, miki!"
3608,VGm7Dfp0EXo,i died when you cussed because you were in pain and kevin said ‚Äúyou wanna say that in less colorful language?‚Äù
3609,VGm7Dfp0EXo,Can we just all agree that she looked glowing in the last clip? Love lots!
3610,VGm7Dfp0EXo,He is so chill and practical. You two balance each other perfectly.üòç
3611,VGm7Dfp0EXo,"You're such a great nurse, Miki. Thx for sharing your vaccine experience with us. I'm glad you and Kevin are protected."

Mas gusto nyo pa na ma expired kaysa pakinabangan ng mga taong may gusto? Tama si Sen Imee Marco's wala na dapat nabpriorities kung sino may gusto bakunahan? para walang nasasayang at tinatapon nyo dahil expired na? Style po ng mga taga DOH BULOK?"

3646,oR8DITTTkNI,Being MANDATED to recieve something that is legally exempt from liability is absurd!
3647,oR8DITTTkNI,"This will never end, they are addicted to the money and the power it brings. Makes them untouchable and dangerous to humanity."
3648,oR8DITTTkNI,The irony of having stock prices showing going through the roof as he tells everyone ‚Äúthey need‚Äù his product is ridiculous
3649,oR8DITTTkNI,"We now live in world where CEO‚Äôs, not doctors, tell us what shots we need to get."
3650,oR8DITTTkNI,How no one in the media realizes this is a blatant conflict of interest. ITS IN THIS GUYS BEST INTEREST TO PROMOTE VACCINES.
3651,oR8DITTTkNI,"Patient: ""Does this vaccine provide immunity?"" Doctor: ""Yes it does....... for Big Pharma""."
3652,oR8DITTTkNI,"""You're going to be mandated to take yet another dangerous, ineffective shot, I'm going to be completely protected from liability if it kills you, and the government is going to give me billions of dollars in your tax money.""
That's what he's actually saying."
3653,oR8DITTTkNI,Funny how these predictions that increase the stock price of both Pfizer and Comcast are so accurate.
3654,oR8DITTTkNI,I remember the supreme court judge claiming there have been 100k pediatric hospitalizations then the CDC director came out and admitted it was actually less than 3500 kids. It's really shady how people feel they need to greatly inflate the numbers.
3655,oR8DITTTkNI,"I had omicron. While it sucked, I was sick for 12 days with flu like symptoms and now I'm fine. No pneumonia or lung damage and no lasting side effects, besides still having a light lingering cough. We don't need a vaccination for this. This is all about the money for them."

3698,v5V8AjWUlRs,I would like to see the FDA use this same kind of scrutiny on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine studies. There‚Äôs no way they did all of this with how quickly they approved them.

3700,v5V8AjWUlRs,"My faith in the FDA to act in the public's health is approaching zero.  However I'm convinced that the FDA will act in the best interests of the Major Drug Companies.  If I've learned anything from COVID, it's that Government corruption is much higher than I had imagined."
3701,v5V8AjWUlRs,"I think it's funny the fda is scrutinizing this one but the other ones, they literally let them pass go do not collect $200. Corrupt."
3702,v5V8AjWUlRs,"I'm glad Dr Syed is finally acknowledging those of us who have been sounding off the alarm from even before the rollout about about the lack of knowledge about the long-term effects of these injections considering how quickly they were developed and the novel (& frankly risky) Vehicles they come in.

3705,v5V8AjWUlRs,"Hmm, now they're concerned. It's too late for those who got these vaccines. FDA made it extremely difficult just to get approval to have clinical trials ran at my hospital human trail division. These vaccines would have never made it to my desk to be processed for FDA review. I was surprised then not so surprised they passed these vaccines for human use without any clinical trials and testing prior giving them to the population as a whole. Additionally, they have not traced these vaccines. Money is a great motivator. From what I have gathered, human safety is of no concern to them."

I feel this is the biggest disgrace that's ever been perpetrated on people."
3734,vS3aoyaarkI,The fact that this debate was not allowed to happen during the last 2 years  should speak volumes.
3735,vS3aoyaarkI,"If the Dr beliefs the vaccine has saved his life, how does he explain all the non vaccinated who also fully recovered and shown to have made natural antibodies?"

Take your pick just quit trying to imply that men can be pregnant. Gosh I‚Äôm so sick of this fantasy world people think they can live in. 

If these studies aren‚Äôt sure that only women can be pregnant, I doubt the validity of any other information. 

Maybe include how many of these ‚Äúpregnant individuals‚Äù have also died suddenly or been diagnosed with myocarditis since getting the vax."

I wasn't able to go to my Brother-in-laws, or my cousins funeral because I wasn't vax. I was uninvited to Thanksgiving last year for the same reason.

3788,PTiV3BbHl7k,The fact that this is even  a topic is bothersome.
3789,PTiV3BbHl7k,OSHA has recently created a new mandate that if an employer does then it is considered work-related and ANY/ALL side effects then become the companies responsibility. This occurred in the last week.
3790,PTiV3BbHl7k,"It starts with a paper card, then a QR scan on your phone, then a trendy wearable device, finally a microchip for convenience.  See where this leads?"
3791,PTiV3BbHl7k,"Very, VERY sinister. The fact it is even talked about should set off alarm bells."
3792,PTiV3BbHl7k,The bigger question is can they fire you for not getting the vaccine if you've been teleworking for over 12 months? I'm teleworking so I'll just continue to telework thank you.
3793,PTiV3BbHl7k,They say it is your choice but not happy if you say no to vaccine
3794,PTiV3BbHl7k,This is some mark of the beast Revelations crap right here

3804,_cP00AfRIrk,"My fiance got tinnitus after the jab.  He didn't at first associate the two at first, it was his doctor who asked if he had been vaccinated and then told him that she was seeing an ""explosion"" of people with tinnitus right after being vaccinated and in her opinion she felt it was the vaccine.  That is one doctor in one small town?  Thousands?  Likely at least in the 10s of thousands."
3805,_cP00AfRIrk,My wife was skeptical of the vaccine from the jump. I did some research trying to alleviate her concerns. After two days I came to the conclusion she was right.  Neither of us took the poison.  Very glad we didn‚Äôt.

 I guess they'll  say it's all-in my mind that I'm having having symptoms 3 weeks after the vaccination."
3810,V0ENHzLE3OI,Thank you doctor for telling me how to interpret and think!!! BAAAA!  BAAAA!!!
3811,V0ENHzLE3OI,I am really beginning to think that they think we are stupid.
3812,V0ENHzLE3OI,What you need to know: ABC will continue to read talking points handed to them by bureaucrats. ABC = Pravda.
3813,V0ENHzLE3OI,"NO, if you or a member of your family is suffering from side effects post it on  *all social media outlets.*  We need and want to know."
3814,V0ENHzLE3OI,The only one getting immunity is the manufacturer.
3815,V0ENHzLE3OI,Searching YouTube until you find someone who tells you what you want to hear has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever witnessed.
3816,V0ENHzLE3OI,Got my second Pfizer vaccine 4 days ago. First day after I was nauseous and tired. Then my muscles started aching and still are.
3817,V0ENHzLE3OI,Where was the information about serious side effects from the Covid vaccines. This video was a bait and switch move.
3818,WB6yucemJ-o,I've noticed the more I avoid cable news and social media the more normal things are.
3819,WB6yucemJ-o,A family member had covid back in November last year and has had issues since. They kept saying it was just long term covid. Turns out it was actually lung cancer and it went undiagnosed because they refused to test for anything else.
3820,WB6yucemJ-o,"My grandfather was in his 80s, in June he got the vax two weeks later he was hospitalized with blood clots. December he got a booster and on December 18, passed away. I don‚Äôt think this is just a coincidence‚Ä¶"
3821,WB6yucemJ-o,She should be brought back now to discuss it all over it again!
3822,WB6yucemJ-o,We need an update with this doctor. Love to hear what she has to say now. Godspeed

3825,WB6yucemJ-o,The very first time that I found out about the spike protein in those vaccines was in late 2020 in a Medcram YT interview with Dr Shane Crotty. Would love to hear what he has to say about those spike protein induced blood clots.

3833,s40QaVcMhzY,I love how this is supposed to be rational.
3834,s40QaVcMhzY,Oh well this proves that no one could have side effects including death from just one shot. üôÑ
3835,s40QaVcMhzY,I don't believe the Lies!!!!! No one should....
3836,s40QaVcMhzY,"I call BS on this one.  That would be almost 2 shots per week for 29 months.  Where was he going twice a week, and nobody noticed?  üòÇ"

3843,4usVIX5B6Rs,When did Gates become a doctor and why is he even being questioned about this?? For some weird reason he's way to involved
3844,4usVIX5B6Rs,""" I am confident in the process.""
""I don't know what that means.""
This person is a perfect picture of what's wrong with our society."
3845,4usVIX5B6Rs,I'm 73 with MS & I did not get vaccinated.   Two weeks ago (Aug. 14) I got covid & it lasted 3 days.  And it was very unpleasant but now it's over & done.  Sore throat was the worst but just kept drinking oolong hot tea.  Am back to normal & I live alone so I took care of myself.   Life goes on & you do the best you can.
3846,4usVIX5B6Rs,I love the side eye Joe gives the big fella as he‚Äôs scrolling his phone instead of listening to the Gates video. This guy is an excellent candidate for this experimental medical injection!
3847,4usVIX5B6Rs,He believes the experimental injection is safe because the manufacturer says so. LOL!ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

3898,7oGofOuai1k,Guys I got the vaccine and now women can't get enough of me. The lady from the irs keeps calling
3899,7oGofOuai1k,"The shot certainly fails to live up to the marketing hype. Can't get a 5G signal, and now I won't even stick to the fridge door."
3900,7oGofOuai1k,"I'm disappointed this isn't real.
Now how will I achieve my dreams of becoming Magneto?"

3902,7oGofOuai1k,I find it so hilarious how almost every news coverage on covid has mostly dislikes
3903,7oGofOuai1k,"""It's not listed in the ingredients.""

High quality fact checking"
3904,7oGofOuai1k,I'll be honest I didn't even watch the video I went straight to the comments
3905,7oGofOuai1k,That this has to be covered in the news is mind blowing to me ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£
3906,7oGofOuai1k,The fact that the news has to cover this makes me lose faith in humanity tbh.
3907,7oGofOuai1k,How is it untrue when we're seeing it with our own eyes? They really just want this to disappear
3908,Re3Z5svoITA,This whole thing stops when we the people say NO!
3909,Re3Z5svoITA,You might recall that BRANDON once promised there would be no vaccine mandates!
3910,Re3Z5svoITA,I'm glad people are finally standing up and I'm glad the news is actually reporting it
3911,Re3Z5svoITA,She said the law.  Mandates are not law
3912,Re3Z5svoITA,Taking things away until someone says ‚Äúyes‚Äù is not a choice. Period.
3913,Re3Z5svoITA,Nobody should be forced to have anything injected in their body
3914,Re3Z5svoITA,Lightfoot says those that uphold the law shouldn‚Äôt act above the law. What about the politicians that should uphold the constitution? Are they above it?
3915,Re3Z5svoITA,"This won‚Äôt end well. While companies may be free to implement these mandates, they severely underestimate people‚Äôs willingness to lose their jobs in a time when employees are so desperately needed."
3916,Re3Z5svoITA,"Lightfoot says above the law... except her mandate is not law. Laws are made by a legislative body. The office of mayor is an executive office. 

And the oath is first to the constitution, which she disregards on a regular basis."

3931,02yBLZ1jNpw,Besides ... mandating a treatment that is protected from liability is ABSURD!!!
3932,02yBLZ1jNpw,Don't become a parent who finds out what ZERO LIABILITY means the hard way!!
3933,02yBLZ1jNpw,"""Florida contradicts CDC on COVID vaccine for children"" and follows the science. Fixed it for ya."
3934,02yBLZ1jNpw,"Is this the same CDC, that cherry-picks which data they choose to release to us?"
3935,02yBLZ1jNpw,"Hint: If the manufacturer needs indemnity, it's not safe."
3936,02yBLZ1jNpw,That‚Äôs because Florida doesn‚Äôt constantly lie for big pharma.
3937,02yBLZ1jNpw,Phizer released 8 pages of side affects
3938,ol2mefX3WuI,She used her platform and told people to do what‚Äôs best for them. Something was wrong with that ?

Furthermore, only ideologies can be followed, not science because science is a method of inquiry, and not a prescription of anything.‚Äù ~ HC Mehdi"
3941,ol2mefX3WuI,"""teachable moment"" actually just means people talking down at the person and forcing them to conform. You are not the authority of what people can and cannot think."
3942,ol2mefX3WuI,"Nicky is right, we shouldn‚Äôt be bullied into taking vaccine.This is very stressful for those on the work front ‚Ä¶ choosing vaccine over our jobs for survival."
3943,ol2mefX3WuI,"""All blacks must think alike.""
Translation:
""We smarter white libs will decide what you think."""
3944,ol2mefX3WuI,It is not Nicki's job to tell grown people to get vaccinated just because she has a huge following.
3945,ol2mefX3WuI,Looks like Nicki was just having an open dialogue and Joy pretty much jumped the gun
3946,ol2mefX3WuI,"This is why I really don't get media outlets.... she never ""told"" anyone not to get vaccinated, she just gave her opinion and her experience. Joy was way out of line for this!"
3947,ol2mefX3WuI,Just look at ‚Äúirregular periods and vaccines‚Äù so many women comments about their period.

3951,TsUuypZ2jLc,You know what the best part about being a ‚Äòconspiracy theorist‚Äô is? I don‚Äôt have myocarditis or blood clots in my body.
3952,TsUuypZ2jLc,"I lost a 41 yr old niece that was healthy in May 22,2022. She died unexpectedly and her autopsy come back undetermined and that's all the answers we get. My niece died this same exact way. Thank you for speaking out"

3955,TsUuypZ2jLc,Vaccine related injury is currently an ACTUAL doctors diagnosis!
3956,TsUuypZ2jLc,I feel pretty certain that she wouldn't bring the vaccine up as a likelihood if Silk wasn't vaccinated/boosted.

They didn't shun me, and had only what they thought were good intentions by urging me to get it, but...I can't say this is vindication for my decision, more so that I saw this kind of report coming out one day a mile away. Thankfully none of them have exhibited any adverse effects (yet at least), and I hope it stays that way. 

It was a risk I was completely unwilling to take, personally."

3990,9uV154LQ1J4,The fact that GP surgeries all over the country are still insisting on phone consultations is an absolute disgrace. The NHS is an utter joke.

4028,3hsT7kMRAd0,Not only were people wrong. They now deny what they did. Nuremberg code was crossed here and those should be held accountable.
4029,3hsT7kMRAd0,"During the plandemic, I watched in horror as 90% of the populace willingly turned into volunteer pharmaceutical sales reps. Needless to say, I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt listened to those poor, brainwashed fools. I don‚Äôt participate in pharmaceutical experiments under any circumstances. It‚Äôs just a personal policy that I have and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt compromise it."

4032,3hsT7kMRAd0,Pharma should no longer legally be allowed to advertise or donate. Only reasonable step moving forward.
4033,3hsT7kMRAd0,Crimes against humanity!  These people need to be held accountable and jailed!

4084,BsK8fWmpP68,"Thanks a lot Dr. Steve James...thank you Dr. McMillan to speak out loud....As a physician I also spoke and speak out loud. In  responsibility for my patients, myself and science I didn't allow my government to set me and other under pressure to get vaccinated. I am glad that I didn't stop thinking, proved the arguments and only  followed logical reasons. You Dr. McMillan and other the rules of science following helped me a lot on my lonesome way. It gives me hope that your arguments Dr.  Steve James seem to be heared. Thank  to you and thank you to the politican who seems to follow logical arguments. Dr. Astrid Horsch"

4087,BsK8fWmpP68,"I‚Äôm surprise they didn‚Äôt put you in jail for telling peoples the truth,thank you for your courage"
4088,BsK8fWmpP68,"Steve James is certainly a hero. I worked for the NHS as critical care nurse during the early days and I caught Covid in Nov 2020. I knew when the jabs came out I had no need to take it and then when they mandated it that was a massive red flag for me and really woke me up as to what was happening. I was astounded by the number of doctors and nurses who had had the virus and then went to queue up for the jab. I heard one consultant say that after contracting the virus he then had the first jab and was very ill and there was no way he was taking another. Why did these 'clever' people not understand about how your immune system works and about natural immunity???? I also know of staff who took the jab reluctantly as the could not afford not too. I wonder if they still feel it was the right decision today? In early 2022 I completed a FOI request to my trust for the number of patients in ICU who were vaccinated/unvaccinated with Convid, between certain dates. Interestingly out of the 71 cases 17 had an were 'unknown' status, 20 were unvaccinated - the other 34 had had either 1,2 or 3 jabs."

4102,8dGMmhny5EM,"Landmarking the deltoid(upper arm muscle) for the IM location before any Injection (by the Nurse)is so Important not to create damage to tissue, vessels, etc‚Ä¶ If they don‚Äôt do a two finger landmark below your Upper shoulder bone(Acromion) stop them immediately. The process of Landmarking shows the proper location, safest location is for a Deltoid IM injection site to prevent damage to Veins, Arteries, & Nerves. And no pinching of skin ever with an IM injection."
4103,8dGMmhny5EM,Thank you for speaking up!
4104,8dGMmhny5EM,ASPIRATION is a must!
4105,8dGMmhny5EM,Aspiration should be done on every occasion. It could explain why people are having issues with blood clots and heart problems if it‚Äôs gone straight into their circulation system and not in the muscle.
4106,8dGMmhny5EM,Who is here making sure their doc did it right.
4107,8dGMmhny5EM,"You should gauge the muscle looking at the patient's weight, needle length and fat distribution. Pinching isn't the issue, it's common sense. No one would pinch 1 inch of skin.... unless patients are obese, in which case stretching the skin should be the better practice."
4108,8dGMmhny5EM,"I thought this was going to be about the need to aspirate so as not to risk going into a blood vessel . though rare , this has been increasingly seen to cause some very dire adverse effects INCLUDING DEATH from the complication of inflammation of and around the heart , myocarditis and paracarditis as well as some severe neurological side effects"

4125,tGs0ucefm38,Pregnant people?  All I need to know.  May God forgive you.

4127,tGs0ucefm38,"Pregnant individuals?  How many men gave birth for this study?  My guess is none.  Have the courage to use the correct words - pregnant women, pregnant females, pregnant moms. Take your pick just quit trying to imply that men can be pregnant. Gosh I‚Äôm so sick of this fantasy world people think they can live in. 

If these studies aren‚Äôt sure that only women can be pregnant, I doubt the validity of any other information. 

Maybe include how many of these ‚Äúpregnant individuals‚Äù have also died suddenly or been diagnosed with myocarditis since getting the vax."
4128,tGs0ucefm38,"My daughter got pregnant after receiving the clot shot. Ultrasound showed a huge blood clot IN HER UTERUS dwarfing the tiny baby with its  beating heart. Neither the OB nor the radiologist had an explanation. The OB said she‚Äôd never seen this before. My daughter lost the baby a week later. It broke my heart! 
Anyone who would suggest this shot for pregnant women is not to be trusted!"

4147,ff3jUFnig9w,Hold up! All THREE use aborted fetal tissues! I will pass. Life is sacred.
4148,ff3jUFnig9w,"The sad part of this for me is that, as a pharmacist, I have been so busy trying to keep up with other issues related to helping my community with the various vaccines that this information slipped me by at first, and when I heard about it for the first time, I have gotten so used to ridiculous tin-foil-hat BS that I originally assumed there was no level of truth to it.  To be fair, my personal stance has not changed, but as I learn more of the whole story, I am much more understanding of patients who express a concern."

4152,ff3jUFnig9w,So they all use stem cells in some part of production. Disgusting!
4153,ff3jUFnig9w,"The citation of the Vatican Statement in this video is provided without context. In reality, the statement only applies in countries where no other vaccines are available due to the greater, more urgent moral imperative of decreasing the mortality rate of COVID-19. 

‚ÄúAs the Instruction Dignitas Personae states, in cases where cells from aborted fetuses are employed to create cell lines for use in scientific research, ‚Äúthere exist differing degrees of responsibility‚Äù of cooperation in evil. For example,‚Äúin organizations where cell lines of illicit origin are being utilized, the responsibility of those who make the decision to use them is not the same as that of those who have no voice in such a decision‚Äù.

‚ÄúIn this sense, when ethically irreproachable Covid-19 vaccines are not available (e.g. in countries where vaccines without ethical problems are not made available to physicians and patients, or where their distribution is more difficult due to special storage and transport conditions, or when various types of vaccines are distributed in the same country but health authorities do not allow citizens to choose the vaccine with which to be inoculated) it is morally acceptable to receive Covid-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted fetuses in their research and production process.‚Äù

Providing this statement outside of context does not represent the Catholic bioethical position expressed by the Catholic Theological Union, which is clearly misrepresented as morally approving Catholic consumption of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in the United States."

4156,yd5tV-SoCeo,"Great video, thank you!"
4157,yd5tV-SoCeo,"I'm a fitness instructor and was in the best shape of my life when I got the 2nd Pfizer vax. 16 days later I thought I was having a heart attack with sharp intense chest pain radiating into my left arm. Went to ER and they diagnosed it at myopericarditis from the vaccine. It's been nearly 2 months now of not working, not able to lay down due to pain/discomfort, and feeling extremely fatigued 24/7. I'm only 26, too young to be so fragile. Has anyone else experienced this and have advice/know how long it could last?"
4158,yd5tV-SoCeo,"Well I've never had heart problems or gone to the ER.... until a week after my 2nd dose of Pfizer.  This video is a nice reguritation of what the CDC says, but from a real person who almost died twice at the young age of 40, I'm calling this down-played."
4159,yd5tV-SoCeo,"After my second dose of Pfizer, I can‚Äôt walk for 5 minutes without being out of breath. I got my second shot 2 months ago and I was running 10 miles per week before I took the shots"
4160,yd5tV-SoCeo,Had Myocarditis as a child but not aware that Mitral valve was damaged and recovered to superb fitness then at 62 valve fell apart and nearly died. Long Term DAMAGE to the Heart from Myocarditis is a future killer!!!
4161,yd5tV-SoCeo,"I‚Äôm so angry because I didn‚Äôt know about this side effect to the COVID vaccine. I mean, I‚Äôd heard about it and probably just brushed it away. Ever since receiving my second dose, I‚Äôve experienced intermittent, random chest pain that usually came on daily for some amount of time. I‚Äôve been to my cardiologist and passed my cardiac stress test, but was denied an Echocardiogram by my insurance. Now I‚Äôll be calling my doctor‚Äôs office/insurance and insisting on ruling out myocarditis. I had no knowledge of this prior."
4162,yd5tV-SoCeo,It might help to mention that CDC has calculated and long known that only 1% of adverse events are actually reported to VAERS.
4163,yd5tV-SoCeo,"A true risk/benefit calculation should also take into account: anti autoantibodies, asymptomatics, comorbidities and vitamin D blood levels. We  know 13.5% of hospitalized COVID cases have antibodies to interferon which disable this key immune function and lead to long covid. Another variable is 1,25 DH-D3 blood levels which is being debated as having an impact on severe disease and death. Instead of lumping and treating everyone in each age category as having the same risk, there should be screening for the above mentioned criteria to get a true risk profile in each age category."
4164,yd5tV-SoCeo,"Alright so I went to the ER for heart issues. I'm 22. I just got the second vaccine, started having chest pains, feels like someone is sitting on my chest for hours at a time. They said I was having a ""panic attack"". I definitely was not though, and they set me free. Its still really hard to breathe and I don't know who to tell if the ER won't listen...."

4254,gPHgRp70H8o,"When he said ""You, Mike, in Baltimore. Get the vaccine"", I took that personally. I already got it, John. Go bother Steve in Annapolis. He's being hard headed about getting the vaccine."
4255,gPHgRp70H8o,‚Äúthat is the worst thing to come out of a kennedy‚Äôs mouth since the back of a kennedy‚Äôs head‚Äù holy SHIT lmao
4256,gPHgRp70H8o,"That egg bit. Something about it screams ""this is a joke,"" but I'm genuinely worried that he actually wants to be egg. It was way too convincing."
4257,gPHgRp70H8o,"I wonder if John discussed the egg bit with his wife beforehand, or just let her discover it organically. 

I've seen enough episodes of this show to know is definitely the second one. I can imagine the text messages from her friends about eggs, shes confused at first but then remembers who she married, accepting her future and the inevitable egg jokes."
4258,gPHgRp70H8o,"It's great that you're asking questions, Tucker. I'd recommend asking a doctor rather than a camera, though. Cameras are not medical experts, Tucker."
4259,gPHgRp70H8o,How did John keep a straight face during the vaccine cicada bit? A true professional. I couldn't stop laughing.
4260,gPHgRp70H8o,"Holy fuck, that Kennedy joke was the second most brutal shot a Kennedy has taken."
4261,gPHgRp70H8o,This contained way more of Tucker Carlson than I ever wanted to actually directly experience.

Worried about a test? Guinea pig bridge is there for you. Girlfriend cheated on you with your philosophy teacher? no worries, guinea pig bridge will always be there for you."
4263,gPHgRp70H8o,"As someone from a third world country, I'm envious that US even have the privilege to have so many unfilled appointments. Meanwhile, countries like us here in Southeast Asia are getting desperate to get more supply for vaccines because so many people are in need of it yet are finding it difficult to get vaccinated because of lack of supply. Then countries like the US still have so many people not going to their appointments..."

4265,1g1rSggnBv0,NO ONE regrets NOT getting it.
4266,1g1rSggnBv0,"My husband is a MD and knew from the very beginning that these ""treatments"" were a bunch of BS. He was persecuted by his peers, talked about behind his back at medical meetings for spreading, ""misinformation and threatening a lawsuit"". Turns out he was 100 percent correct about everything he said about it. I know this hurt him deeply but he stood by his convictions and did not mandate anyone in our office to get the ouchie and we risked being shut down. He told me one night, ""I am so ashamed of my profession"". He still has not received an apology from his colleagues. Not that he was expecting one. Those who know him, know he is a saint and loves being a doctor."
4267,1g1rSggnBv0,"My husband was a flight attendant for Hawaiian Airlines and after 22 years, was fired for not agreeing to take the shot, even though he had been flying throughout the pandemic, as an essential worker, before the vax was even released. We lost his income, our lives were upended, but he‚Äôs healthy and alive, thank God! We can move on from job loss."
4268,1g1rSggnBv0,Biggest crime against humanity ever
4269,1g1rSggnBv0,"The fact they were encouraging pregnant women to take it, when they should avoid soft cheeses and mayonnaise was just unbelievable."
4270,1g1rSggnBv0,The inability to discuss this openly is the real crime.
4271,1g1rSggnBv0,I WILL STOP BEING A CONSPIRACY THEORIST WHEN THE GOVERNMENT STOP CONSPIRING  üôÑ
4272,1g1rSggnBv0,"Retired nurse here, studied the body and psychology... smelt a rat quite soon in. TRIED to share my concerns and thoughts with family and friends, but the governmental claptrap won them over. I pray every day for their future health."

4284,e7l7j2r6cFM,"I had covid & I got the first Moderna shot yesterday. I feel the same way after this shot that I did when I had covid. My arm was immediately sore, moving your arm around is advised. After about a couple hours in, I started getting extremely cold and tired. I literally had the chills from how cold I felt. Today, I‚Äôve slept all day in and out and my entire body hurts and I‚Äôm very hot. Don‚Äôt know how to feel about it & I‚Äôm nervous to see how my body will react with the second shot considering I feel terrible right now after only the first‚Ä¶"
4285,e7l7j2r6cFM,I just got the first round of moderna 3 days ago and I have every symptom listed for it. I feel worse than when I actually had Covid. I got fever up to 102.
4286,e7l7j2r6cFM,Exhausted.  Take the next day off to sleep.
4287,e7l7j2r6cFM,"My boyfriend‚Äôs sister is really nervous about getting her 2nd jab. After her first Moderna jab, she had horrible headaches‚ÄîAnd then a couple of hours after the jab, she said she experienced some type of full body paralysis. I don‚Äôt know exactly how long it lasted‚Äîbut she said she wanted to yell out to her husband in the next room‚Äîand she couldn‚Äôt do it...she couldn‚Äôt move at all."
4288,e7l7j2r6cFM,"Had body chills, exhausted, and diarrhoea"
4289,e7l7j2r6cFM,"I received my first moderna shot in April of this year and the second in May.  My only side effect was the muscle pain.  I lost almost total use of my right arm for several months.  I still don't have full use, but it has improved considerably.  Anyone else experience this?"
4290,e7l7j2r6cFM,"I know 5 people who lost their hair agyer the booster,  men and women.  And several other patients experienced rapid decline and untimely death, with no history of hereditary health conditions , nor previous serious illnesses"
4291,e7l7j2r6cFM,"Got sick after first shot! Terrible headache 6 hours, enough for me to rank it equal to my worst migraine attacks, and farigue for a day, slight anxiety and actually restless and painful ice cold thighs and legs for a day. Still having weird tingly feelings in my body. My arm got sore, could barely lift it (felt like the same pain as when you get hit in the thigh). But the arm thing was the least annoying. 

The symptoms have been interesting for me to track. I find it a bit like an exploration."
4292,e7l7j2r6cFM,Some people have no side effects and some have terrible side effects. The ones who have no side effects think the ones who do are lying smh
4293,e7l7j2r6cFM,"Ok.. After intense pressure, I had 1 maderna shot months ago and had no immediate side effects at all.  I didn't get another because within a day or so I noticed a feeling of thickness in my right ankle and then I developed a petechial rash around my ankle (pinpoint red dots under the skin that are not itchy or painful and don't change color when pressed) and swelling from my knee down.  With no history of injury, my concern and my doctor's concern was that I could have some sort of thrombosis.  I had an ultrasound which was negative but they couldn't rule out micro-thrombosis.  Even though the swelling was just on one side we decided to try a ""water pill"" to see if it would affect the swelling.  It didn't.  No clue if this was due to the injection of an unproven substance but I am anxious not to find out more.  My knee, leg, and ankle are still swollen months later."

4305,MYVAdufixc8,"I would say people  who basically  forced people  to be vaccinated should be held accountable.  They said, ""Get jabbed, or lose your job"". These have left many with life long injuries. Crimes against humanity."
4306,MYVAdufixc8,"It is amazing how millions of ""conspiracy theorists"" warned about the dangers of the Jab and all were shut down, ridiculed, mocked, shunned by society, friends and family, even blocked from expressing their opinions on social media. No apologies, no acknowledgment of being right, just crickets from the other side. 
Oh. But we are told to trust the experts."
4307,MYVAdufixc8,Never forget - never forgive. we need accountability and prison sentences

4347,GaXJlDvZcjs,Frazer is an example of a person that has taken the shot and is unwilling to admit he may have been wrong. Going down with the ship at all costs.

4358,WFLDAOJ4sDs,I was fired from my job at Forsyth hospital for declining the vaccine. I‚Äôve been struggling since. I declined because I suffer from heart disease and lupus. I‚Äôm now waitressing and I‚Äôm grateful to be working but I‚Äôm not making nearly what I use to make. I‚Äôm a single mom with two children on the spectrum. I‚Äôm constantly faced with financial hardships and can barely support my children. I‚Äôm overwhelmed at times. But I know I made the right decision. God will see me through faith over fear.
4359,WFLDAOJ4sDs,"Once you have outsourced your natural immunity to the elephant, you can‚Äôt live without it. Getting sick frequently is just the unpleasant withdrawal symptom."
4360,WFLDAOJ4sDs,Thanks Dr. Philip. Mental issues appear to be prevalent amongst the vaccine cultists.
4361,WFLDAOJ4sDs,"The Lancet? Yeah, I would take it with a pinch of salt!"
4362,WFLDAOJ4sDs,Bill Gates loves this story of gigavaxxed man.
4363,WFLDAOJ4sDs,"This is like someone saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve smoked 200 cigarettes a day for 2 years and don‚Äôt have emphysema or lung cancer so cigarettes are safe, especially to lower blood pressure while pregnant.‚Äù"
4364,WFLDAOJ4sDs,"I just feel sorry for all the people who were brainwashed by fear into complying. Those who refused suffered and are suffering financially and socially, but those who complied have accepted to let strangers with questionable authority take medical decisions on their behalf. Just like well behaved children doing what mommy and daddy say‚Ä¶"
4365,WFLDAOJ4sDs,Is this the guy that took shots for others that did not want it and made a bundle of money for it? PureBloodCriticalThinker
4366,WFLDAOJ4sDs,"My my very healthy godson in his 20s has never been quite well since his employer forced him to get The Elephant.  But with a wife and 3 kids to support, he has been able to keep working until two weeks ago, when he was hospitalized for suspected tuberculous.  The diagnosis is not certain, but he definitely cough up blood and has pneumonia.  The Health Dept. won't let him out of isolation yet.  This is in California, USA.  Apparently there has been a rise in TB since the Elephant came out in 2021."
4367,WFLDAOJ4sDs,Shows how broken the system is when you can pretend to be someone else.
