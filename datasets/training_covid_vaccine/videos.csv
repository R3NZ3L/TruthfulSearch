1,-Ea3UwYZnrA,Long covid and long vaccine,"Professor Robert Clancy has found similarities between long covid and long post covid vaccination syndrome. Here he shares new findings on the theory and practical medical management of these two conditions. Thank you, Professor, as always for sharing your time and expertise.",2024-01-18,635111,26629,5609,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg," well a warm welcome to this talk and a particularly warm welcome back to Professor Robert clany all the way from Sydney Professor welcome back and thank you for coming my great pleasure John as always now Robert Clans is well known to the the channel he's a consultant physician a professor of immunology and holds qualifications in Medicine Science and pathology and is a holder of the Australia medal so great to great to have him back now you've been doing quite a lot of work recent L Robert on uh long Co and I think we should say that one of the big advantages of being shall we say at our stages in later stages in our careers is you don't have to worry about publication so much so quite a lot of what we're going to talk about now is fairly original work so thank you for sharing that with us so we want to talk about um post vaccine and post infection long covid um now both of these syndromes you you you've been seeing you've been seeing patients with these can you just tell us roughly roughly roughly what you see patients with long covid patients with long covid vaccine injury what are what are you seeing well I think the first point uh John is that uh there's no great mystery to to these conditions uh what happened was with the infection uh initially people were seeing ongoing symptoms and came up with a diagnosis that was vague and confusing and it was called long coov now long coov was anybody who had symptoms following Co infection that persisted for more than 3 months and the confusion for this is that it it included a number of different problems and every patient had a different mix of these problems and so uh for people who uh were working outside of say Immunology and related um related disciplines it it was incredibly difficult but to simplify there there are basically two different components uh it's been known really since the late 1800s that people who get particular infections uh have a chance of getting a persistent fatigue illness that follows it and that's quite it's nothing different about Co and so the essential component of long Co is what is essentially post viral infection fatigue and it has two Central components the first is what I call Energy activated fatigue which means that if you do something uh then you pay for it you get more fatigue and the way I discuss that with patients is I talk about a ceiling I say we've all got a ceiling and uh in people with post viral fatigue syndrome long Co that ceiling comes down and if you try to push yourself with energy then you hit that ceiling that ceiling pays you back and you suffer for hours or days with of increased fatigue uh and um Associated characteristics the the second character the second feature of this uh chronic inflammatory state is cognitive defects and most people don't say I've got a cognitive defect they say I've got brain fog and uh it comes in many different forms I always have I had a I worked at McMaster University in Canada for some years and set up the Immunology Department there and I I remember I had this wonderful patient uh who was always late for appointments and um I once said why is it that you're always late you know I'm seeing you at the end of the clinic when you're actually supposed to be here 2 hours ago she said well it's it's part of my my problem I stand at the bus stop and I see the bus coming along and it says mcmas University and by the time it's sort of registered the bus is gone and I've got to wait for the next one and so there are all sorts of variations I had other patients who were Math teachers who had to give up because they they couldn't sit and look at the board and do simple mathematics so brain fog is a terribly a terribly incapacitating problem but when we came to Long co uh patients had these symptoms but they had other sets of symptoms which were more structural damage and so while in classic chronic fatigue illnesses you don't have so much in the way of structural damage to tissues the brain the heart in Long Co you did and that's because uh if you look at the underpinning cause of all of these it's the antigen is persistent uh in classic chronic fatigue it's commonly not always but commonly the epstar bar virus which is the virus in my country we call glandular fever I'm not sure what you call in in England is it glandular fever or infe nucleo well the Americans like yeah we would say glandular fever or if you're feeling a bit more correct infectious mononucleosis yeah there's a lot of confusion of but there's no question that a number of patients will have that incarcerated into their cells and under various stresses uh the virus escapes and you get fatigue illness maybe a sore throat big lymph nodes uh things like that and so we've known a lot about that but long um long Co and the patients had damage to their peripheral nerves often uh small fiber neuropathy with burning feet burning legs uh major problems in the brain uh cardiac issues a whole range of structural abnormalities and they got all thrown in together and you can understand the the confusion of people saying well how do I sort this out you know there's no obvious treatment um what's going on here and that's the way I know it's interesting I knowing that we were going to talk today I I just printed out uh the latest paper that I found on cause of um long Co which came out just last month and um it's a very interesting paper because it's full of detail but not full of message and it's whole list of different things that people see without saying wait a second what's the big picture here what's really going on and unless you approach it in that way you can't really really help the patient because the patient wants to understand what's going on and wants to have some logic in terms of what they can do about it uh and I I think that's where an immunologist basically looks after these patients I mean people with chronic fatigue illness have usually fallen into the basket of clinical Immunology because um most people who work in vertical systems like chest or heart or lung or brain um look at a particular disease in that system whereas immunologists look at a mechanism across the different systems and so we try to understand a process that's going on in a a person with autoimmune disease chronic fatigue illness various conditions like that and then address the diagnosis uh in that form uh look at tests that might help understand that process and medications or processes that can help uh the patient with those issues so I I think that's the broad sort of difference that underpins this now so that was chronic that was chronic fatigue in the context of um of U the covid infection and then more recently people are saying wait a second I'm seeing people uh who have had vaccination who have never had uh uh uh Co and these people are developing very similar symptoms uh and I I see in I don't see a lot of patients these days but I certainly see a number and I I have a number of patients who have uh had vaccines never had Co um but they've got essentially long Co syndromes and again it's a mixture of classic um energy activated fatigue brain fog together with certain structural problems uh so and the reason that it's very similar is that the persistent antigen is the same antigen it's Spike protein so you're getting Spike protein from the infection Co and that can persist at least 12 months maybe a lot longer in some of these patients whereas uh with vaccine we know that the spike protein the messenger RNA vaccine that is given uh disseminates through the body uh it provides expression of the spike protein on potentially any cell in the body and that can go on for months or year at least a year and remember the these are new syndromes we we didn't know about them until the the last couple of years so we don't know how long these conditions go but the bottom line is that there's the same cause for the Post vaccine long Co if you like and the post infection long Co and this is incredibly important to understand and sadly it is not understood very widely because if you go and have I've got a patient at the moment who had uh postvaccine uh long Co and then got Co infection and of course um people said who dear me all those terrible symptoms you've got of long they've got worse um we thought if you'd had a vaccine you'd get um much less problem with with with Co but of course uh it's a totally different situation when you're looking at a small proportion of people who get postvaccine long Co to the average person who might get uh a a vaccine which reduces the intensity of covid and therefore is linked to a degree of less chance of getting severe long Co disease and so there's this commonality of persistent antigen that underpins both those conditions and we need to understand that if we're going to apply effective management strategies it's it's really quite hard to understand this so when someone's vaccinated if they get this long vaccine covid situation instead of producing the antigen for a few hours they're producing the antigen chronically over o over a year or or more um what what is what is happening there how can the vaccine which is a single dose go on and produce Spike protein for a year or more well I think that's that's the big question isn't it and the answer is fairly straightforward that if you have a messenger RNA vaccine that messenger RNA we know um in the way in which it's packaged and presented will go throughout the body and can uh be taken up into essentially any cell in the body now when it does that it the messenger RNA uh expresses through the ribosomal system in the cell the factory for proteins it it it expresses Spike protein which is represented on the surface of the cell and can be detected in blood uh for a length of time now when it's expressed on the uh length of um uh on on the cell surface uh in most people it's probably only a relatively short period of time but in some people in fact a significant number of people they'll express it for a long period of time and they get an immune response because that remember that's what you're trying to to do with messenger RNA vaccine you're trying to stimulate an immune response but what uh was not understood and and sadly had not been properly tested right at the beginning uh was that this antigen um Can persist for a long period of time and be the focus of a self-destructive immune response very similar to autoimmune disease and that's exactly what's causing one of the two main causes of the structural damage I'm talking about remember I I said you get a chronic inflammatory situation due to the Persistence of the antigen and an ineffective immune response that's not clearing it which leads to lowlevel inflammation which leads to the exercise induced fatigue and the brain fog but now you can also Express this antigen uh as a foreign antigen on the cell surface and that's destroyed by t-lymphocytes as that's the job of the T it's not supposed to do that because it's someone's injected messenger RNA into you uh and so you get structural damage uh one of the commonest ones I see are people with um small fiber neuropathy um which is terribly disconcerting uh Burning uh feet uh disbalance um neurological issues flare up of demyelinating diseases uh cardiac issues uh all of these structural damages and they're different in every person which makes understanding and analyzing postco either postco syndrome extremely complicated and extremely difficult I mean it's it's probably getting into the pathophysiology a bit but if you're going to go on produce producing Spike protein for a year after vaccine do you think that means that the RNA has somehow gone into the DNA and there's an ongoing process of transcription here I think there are probably two ways of answering that firstly I don't think there's any doubt that you can reverse transcribe into DNA that's been shown in human cells uh at least to my knowledge on three occasions um and and that is a worry in its own and quite different to the problems we're talking about here uh that's looking at how I can change DNA expression in the individual uh it ra it raises all the questions of um um Progressive and expanded cancer uh it looks at transgenerational defects if it gets into the germline cells uh so that's that's a different issue here we're talking about messenger RNA without necessarily going to DNA just working doing what messenger RNA does and that's code for the amino acid sequence in a protein on the ribosomal Factory in the cell and so you're making all a spike protein don't need the DNA for that uh you've got the the DNA normally makes messenger RNA but we're actually giving messenger RNA so we're we're we're adding to to to the pool and so you've got all these cells making Spike protein for God only knows how long uh we don't know how long a long time and um that's creating uh and one of the factors that conditions a very important factor because not everyone gets postco not everyone gets fatigued uh it would seem that there is a subset of people who are more prone to develop um persistent nonresolved antigen in other words the messenger RNA keeps producing antigen and the body's immune response doesn't effectively clear it um if we had a lot of time I could run through the the the background information for this but let me just summarize and say in my view about 20% of people are fatigue prone uh there's a phenotype um you know you look at kids who go to university and say how many of you you uh have ever had fatigue at the time of exams and whatever bit of a sore throat about 20% will say that about 20% of athletes um get uh um essentially overtraining syndrome which is a a form of chronic fatigue it's a form that most people with chronic fatigue would love to have means they just drop their their time for 100 yards by 0. one of a second but it gets them out of the final um but but it is a very good model system that we we looked at very closely some years back the uh so you've got this situation where is a a group of people who appear to be prone and they're the ones who will get postvaccine fatigue and probably the the ones who have got the persistent formation of um the spike protein and get um long coed with both the fatigue and the structural uh defect problem using different mechanisms totally different mechanisms for the two so it sounds like we've got two mechanisms going on well the main mechanism whether it's long Co or postvaccine long Co is Persistence of the spike protein the spike protein is still produced for whatever reason whether it's long covid or postvaccine injury chronically being produced sometimes the features are as as a result of specific tissue damage because the tea cells are beaten up these cells would You're expect ing the spike protein wherever that is and of course we know that can be anywhere in the body now because the vaccine is systemically distributed so we've got the tissue damage but we've also got the ongoing inflammatory effects the the effects of the chronic inflammation that we're seeing as long covid or long postvaccine long covid that's are they the two sort of main causes of the clinical features exactly but keep in mind there is one underpinning common denominator and that is persistent antigen production which is a feature of all the chronic fatigue illnesses going back to influenza and all the other issues that that we um and this may this is just my view might I often turn out to be wrong but it's my view is that there's a phenotypic um uh uh proness if you like to developing uh fatigue illness when they're stressed with and they're more likely for some reason to get a persistent antigen because they have uh a less effective immune response than other people so most chronic fatigue syndromes can be explained in terms of the ongoing Persistence of some virus presumably mostly a virus causing these these chronic features so in theory if you could like wave of magic wand and eradicate all the virus from the body the patient would get better apart from the pathology that's caused by the tissue damage the irreversible tissue damage that's absolutely right and in fact um um when we were dealing with the uh Institute of sport in Australia with the elite swimmers uh you might remember they they win gold medals uh but some of them didn't and um uh we found that what was happening uh at the time the stress of international competition is in a number of these people start excreting epara virus in their throat so normally it's contained by a wall of tea cells and under the stress in the people who have got a partial immune deficiency so they've got a predisposition of not having a really effective immune response when they're expressed and people with long Co will say the same where under psychological or physical stress um I get worse and um we looked at this very carefully with the elite swimmers and we were able to uh completely obliterate that expression of epstar bar virus coming out in a condition which used to be called overtraining syndrome by doing one of two things uh the first is we we actually treated them with highly potent antivirals and prevented this and maintained their swimming capacity uh or we identified that the main precipitating factor was a particular type of physical stress which was um high high energy training and so we changed their training program and the Olympics uh in 2000 uh every Australian Elite swimmer swam to their predicted best which had never been before and it gave our physiology colleagues a very good jobs for the English Olympics which came next because the English wanted to know why our swimmers were doing so well uh and partly was because they didn't get subjected to uh fatigue induced impaired performance um by changing their training program so all of these issues um come together with this Persistence of of antigen and control of that antigen uh epstar virus as you know gets integrated into the DNA of cells uh and it should stay there and the tea cells are critical for that uh with Spike protein uh they should never it should never uh be expressed systemically and should never um have a persistence uh of expression but in some people of course it is and they're the ones prone to developing these fatigue illnesses so you're going to be getting in and dat with the emails from Olympic committees from around the world now Robert asking for your assistance I'm sure I'm sure about that all that work's been published a couple of years back and and sadly our competitors know about it so um so this means that basically everyone has been exposed to Epstein bar virus just that some people managed to eliminate it and some people don't exactly uh 80% of people um with the the athletes uh was pretty much 95% of the athletes uh had been exposed had Mar a IG antibody and this is the interesting thing that the the people who um have glandula have the epstar bar virus uh and who are prone to getting fatigue never quite make the right sort of te- cell response and I I'll give you two quick examples and these relate exactly to the situation in uh that I'm certainly seeing and has recently been published to some extent uh with long Co um if you look at antibody production the antibodies are made by a cell given the very imaginative title of a a b cell a b lymphocyte requires T lymphocytes to help them so we have these helper tea cells now it appears that there's a defect in the tea helper cells in people with long Co and this has been identified in different studies and certainly exact L the same in people with other chronic fatigue illnesses and the way the te cell deficiency expresses itself is that the B cell has markers of not working as well as it should now if you get a virus infection you make what's called an IGM antibody the IGM antibody is the first antibody but it's not a particularly High Affinity good effective antibody and so what the body does it replaces it with an IGG antibody so you go from IGM to ig now uh which is a much higher Affinity antibody and you make different subclasses of IGG and there's four sub IGG 1 2 3 and four now two things I noticed over the years looking after literally hundreds of people with chronic fatigue illnesses is that number one many of these patients never switch from the IGM to the IG anybody and so when you do a routine epstar bar virus in antibody and every Doctor Who who's watching this will know you look for IGM antibody because that tells you you've got a current infection you've just got the infection and suddenly and I I used to get a phone call every couple of weeks from General Practitioners that I work with saying hey this is confusing I got a patient who's got IGM and IG antibodies and they've had them for weeks and months and of course these are the people who have got ongoing chronic fatigue and they're not actually eliminating or controlling their epstar bar virus by virtue of the fact they're not making a particularly effective immune response and the response defect goes back to the te- cell because it's not helping the B efficient effective IGG response and so when you do a routine test the IGM which should tell you it's a recent infection but it's not it's been there for weeks or years and an IG and and the second and this is really interesting because only just a month or so ago uh this was found for long Co that in people with chronic fatigue syndrome one of the things that uh we noticed uh in our Clinic was that a number of these patients have IGG subclass deficiency particularly an igg2 subclass and it didn't initially it didn't make much sense and I started seeing both the IGM IGG confusion plus the IGG subclass deficiency both of which depend on good te cells working um now different subclasses have different jobs and so ig2 has a particular job and if it's very low then you've got a defective antibody response by virtual of this so what a wonderful study I saw I think it was about a month ago John um where they looked at IGG subclasses in Long Co and lo and behold there's a highly significant reduction across the long Co something that's never really been done for chronic fatigue syndrome uh the classics um significantly lower igg2 so exactly the same things is occurring in Long Co which brings all of these chronic fatigue illnesses collect ly together so moving on to the sort of um management strategies that we going to use Robert I mean I mean the question is of course what the heck do we do we do about this so um do we need to promote a more effective immunity within the respiratory tract and how would we do that well uh I don't have all the answers no one has all the answers but I I think that if you understand the process that's going on you can see some sense in going forward now I can run through there there are five things that that uh I do with with my my patients uh or I I'm thinking about uh the first is that we we we've developed the idea and I I've talked briefly about this with you before of what I call immune resilience and that is um and I think in the context we discussed it before I said why is it 99% of people who get long co uh inconvenience for a few days they feel a little sick a fever sore throat and then they get better whether you treat them or not but 1 or 2% get very sick H and some may die and yet you look at that Collective group and of course there are predisposing factors for getting very sick but many of them are just like you and me uh that we all look the same we think we're the same and yet we handle the virus differently and this has been an area that my group's been interested in for a long period of time and um we developed the idea that there's a thing called immune resilience and that there are ways of Shifting that immune resilience so that that 1% behaves like the 99% now that that's something that that that my own we've been certainly working on and uh not available yet but but I I think is the way one of the ways to go in the future so in other words people who uh get uh Airway infections uh handle it more effectively and don't run into the complications which obviously include long Co because of a defective immune response so I I think that's uh for the soon future not not a long term uh the second is to understand the process as being persistent antigen uh now the spike protein um is I think without our question the persistent antig both these cases uh and this is a practical area uh and there are two approaches currently uh being used um uh our friends and colleagues in America uh have developed various enzyme packages uh based on ninas which is a long St very interesting um uh orally uh an ingested enzyme that has specificity for Spike protein and I know studies are being done uh in uh in America uh using these um substances uh and we're really looking for forward to seeing uh how how they come out uh the second thing you can do about the expression of Spike protein is blocking its effect um really really exciting work has come out in the last few months about how icton works and there's a complete relook now at iaon uh about time I may add but um and I think I think one of the things that's bridged from the The Narrative that that was very unkind to iaon and the reality of science is the demonstration by uh a combination French and American groups showing that ican blocks the uh blocks Spike protein so it blocks the spike protein getting into the cell and it blocks it aggregating red cells which is the reason that you get low oxygen tension uh low oxygen saturation in patients who get significant co uh and I I was on one of the three papers that that showed that it was amazing within 24 hours of taking icton oxygen desaturation reversed now that's not suppressing inflammation and now by virtue of these studies it's shown that uh you disaggregate the cells and so the oxygen can return very quickly now I've been treating some of my own patients with moderately high dose of ivaan for a month I think I've treated five or six and every one of those has improved now that doesn't mean a thing it's not a randomized control trial uh it's it's it's what I call clinical medicine you you look uh at at a problem you say this is a process uh what logically can be done now it's not necessarily going to change all the structural damage that's been done but certainly there's been some improvement not not necessarily dramatic Improvement some improvement uh in a month or so of taking icton I I think what really is needed is people who um have access to um academic uh um academic situations where they can study and do these a randomized control of icton in Long Co properly done uh would be the most important thing that can happen uh in in Long Co um the third thing that um that I think is really really interesting in Long Co is that uh and particularly a couple Chinese groups have been promoting this and that is that people who get long Co get a disturbance of the microbiome in the bow now you might say how on Earth can that relate to something that's going on in the airway well um I was lucky enough years ago to work with John benstock in Canada uh who came up with the idea of the common mucosal system which has been underpinning my work over many years uh in humans and uh it it's just suddenly I realized that all our focus on this common mucosal system was the immune expression not the microbial drive and when you think that the the architecture of this common system that expresses control over all the different mucosal surfaces of the body the architecture involves sensor systems all the way down the gut not just the small bow with pair patches but all sorts of little patches with specialized M cells they're called over them that allows bacteria to come in and so I I think the important thing to understand here is that the commonality of mucosal immunology and expression involves the microbiomes at the different sites and so uh what happens uh in the airway by swallowing and affecting P patches can distort the microbiome in the gut and the microbiome in the gut can equally influence what's going on in the airway and I'll just give you one exciting um observation and that is a group was looking at uh in mice they were looking at csel pneumoni which is a nasty bacteria that causes pneumonia and they couldn't understand why on Earth when they gave pneumonia to the mouse by putting the the bug in the airway their microbiome changed uh this is in the gut and of course um the reason is this commonality this communication system that's so effective so what they found was and this is exactly what was found in the patients with long Co a particular type of bacteria was depressed and these bacteria well bacteria that produce short chain fatty acids butyric acid um acetic acid propionic acid those three main one two and three um carbon short chain fatty acids um now the people working with the mice and ciella said well what happens if we um reduce these bacteria uh in the gut then the the main product from the bacteria uh is things like butc acid and so they measured butc acid and found it was very low so very sens they just started feeding butc acid to these these mice and the eclips and pneumoni became much much uh improved uh didn't completely cure them but it certainly improved showing there was this connection between the two so you have two ways in which the microbiome can change the expression of any form of chronic fatigue one is by metabolic transfer of of receptors of um molecules that can move around through the blood seam and secondly by changing the cell Delivery Systems through the aggregated infid issue of P patches um sequel patches and the various ones in the column so that to me is very exciting and again if you can bear with me for 20 seconds I I'll I'll give you a very very important example many years ago Tom Baro who was the guy who discovered the uh the treatment for peptic ERS to which eradicated them uh he also was the person who um really developed the idea of feal microbiome transplants by changing the microbiome by washing you out and giving you some healthy ones um Tom Tom is uh quite extraordinary um he Tom treated patients who came to him with fatigue and non-specific gut symptoms and was surprised to find not only did the gut symptoms improve with this fmt but so did the fatigue now uh no one quite believed it so he went back 10 years later 10 years later and found something like 60% of the patients and most of those patients still had a resolution of their symptoms including their fatigue now you don't see that in chronic fatigue illnesses in other words by having a specific intervention there was some resetting of the system which we don't understand very well and so um I'm I I do a clinic in in in Tom's practice uh and uh he was is my PhD student and um he Tom uh I'm I'm actually if he's watching this or I'm going to send him an email Tom uh you've got to go back and start looking at uh how we can manipulate the microbiome and have outcomes in Long Co um so um I I think the the next thing that I think is really important so we there are the three things that I think are really important the next thing is don't feed the syndrome don't keep giving people vac who have got long Co syndrome because um you look at the literature and I I just did a review for a journal last week on a metaanalysis of all the studies done on vaccination and and long Co and it blew me away I mean it was a very well done study and and 20 there was a 20% reduction of long covid in people who have been vaccinated but I looked at the number of people was 1 million if you're looking at probably a 100,000 or a couple hundred, thousand people they get lost in they're very different they're the people who have got a fatigue illness maybe phenotype that have develop this uh in the context of the vaccine and you give them more vaccine or they get Co and they get worse this is a concept that I find nobody really or or most people have great trouble grasping I just noticed this morning while I was waiting to hear from you John that Peter McCulla wrote one of his um uh reviews and it was making exactly the same point you know you don't vaccinate people with chronic fatigue syndrome you're just putting petrol on the fire and of course yeah the final thing is you address the issues the person has um uh I noticed that some of my colleagues say a lot of these people have got in the morning uh you can't work you lose your job you're broke um you're going to have a touch of reactive depression and anxiety and um it's not that they have a primary mental health problem they've got serious responses mental health responses of a normal type to a uh to a very uh incapacitating problem so that's that's our approach anyway to uh to chronic fatigue illnesses excellent updates and uh we'll um certainly keep an eye on this one but I I think gives us real cause for for Hope here Robert that there is potential ways ahead for people that are suffering in this way yeah but for now thank you

3,2IXl4qJGrRk,A man deliberately got 217 Covid shots. Here’s what happened,"A 62-year-old German man deliberately got 217 Covid-19 vaccine shots in the span of 29 months, according to a new study, going against national vaccine recommendations. That’s an average of one jab every four days. CNN’s Meg Tirrell reports.  #CNN #News",2024-03-06,158613,2368,1801,UCupvZG-5ko_eiXAupbDfxWw," A German man has puzzled scientists after he deliberately got more than 200 COVID 19 vaccinations. 217 to be exact, over two and a half years. That's a shot every four days, roughly. CNN health reporter Meg Tyrrell is here to explain more. This guy sort of became a voluntary science experiment Yeah, of course. They called this guy a hyper vaccinated individual and researchers sort of found out about him through media reports as he was already more than 200 shots into this self experiment he was doing. And they asked if they could study him. He was actually being investigated by the authorities in Germany for potential fraud. They suspected maybe he was trying to sell vaccination cards, but no charges were ever filed against him there. Now, this guy is 62 years old, as you said. 217 COVID 19 vaccinations within the span of 29 months. If you look at the pattern of some of these and we've got a bar chart here that shows the dates of some of these shots and these are not even all of them, but if you just look in this one year span, he was getting maybe one or two per month as the beginning of the year was happening as he gets into January of 20, 22. He got 48 shots within that one month period. Most days of that month he was getting two shots per day, one in each arm. He continued with a large number of shots in February, then dropped down to just six in March. Of course, scientists are wondering what the effect was on him. First of all, he didn't report any vaccine related side effects at all, which is sort of crazy to think about when you think about how you feel about getting a COVID shot the next day. Secondly, his immune response did show an increase in immune cells like antibodies and T cells, but not necessarily a better or worse immune response, even after more than 200 COVID vaccines. And finally, guys, he never got SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID. But of course, the researchers say they don't know if that's because of so many vaccines, because of just the first few vaccines or because of his behavior or something else. But this leading to quite an interesting and of one person experiment, guys. Yeah, maybe tough to answer why someone would get 217 COVID vaccinations in two years but walk us through the the saying current recommendations on how many COVID 19 vaccines to get Yeah it goes without saying it is not 200. Right now in the United States the general recommendation is one updated each fall similarly to how we get the flu vaccine and we know that only a fraction of people are actually getting annual COVID shot at this point. The CDC did also just come out and recommend an additional shot now for people over the age of 65 to increase their immunity. So you're talking about a couple shots per year against COVID really at the most. This guy going way outside of those bounds. But luckily he seems to be okay exponentially, to say the least. Carol, thanks so much for the update on this really odd story. Thanks, Mike."

5,im3otpqYAiQ,Covid Vaccine Study Finds Links to Health Conditions,"Vaccines that protect against severe illness, death and lingering long Covid symptoms from a coronavirus infection have been linked to small increases in neurological, blood, and heart-related conditions. Jason Gale discusses the findings of he largest global vaccine safety study to date on Bloomberg Television.

You can find out more on this story here: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-19/largest-covid-vaccine-study-yet-finds-links-to-health-conditions",2024-02-20,46733,794,941,UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg," [CC may contain inaccuracies] In terms of how widespread the adverse
event reporting has been. Talk us through what the findings were.
Yeah. So these findings are not really at all
surprising. We have known about these side effects
really since the vaccines began rolling out at the end of 2020, early 2021.
We've seen this myocarditis inflammation of the heart muscle pericarditis,
inflammation of the sac around the heart, as well as this unusual blood
clot that forms in the brain from the virus vector vaccine.
So none of these findings are new, but they are actually fairly reassuring
because they didn't find anything else that was that was at all alarming,
Heidi. And it did look at a few different
vaccine types as well. Was there any difference across them?
There was indeed. Yes.
They did see this increased risk for for the brain blood clots in in relation to
the AstraZeneca viral virus vector vaccine.
And and also we did see the increased risk of of myocarditis and pericarditis
with the mRNA vaccines that are the ones made by Pfizer, Biontech and Moderna.
There were some other interesting findings as well.
Guillain-Barré syndrome was shown to be a an event of concern linked to mostly
to the Oxford AstraZeneca virus vector vaccine.
Otherwise, everything else was pretty much as we
had already expected. Thinks
so. And we've talked about some of those
pre-established conditions of interest. Did they find anything that was
pertinent across that subsection of the study?
Beyond those 13 events that they were looking for that they didn't see, they
weren't looking specifically for other aspects of vaccine injury.
That has been noted in the past. Postural orthostatic tachycardia
syndrome that is increase heart rate that has been noted in relation to
vaccines. The researchers have also seen in a
higher frequency associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
So while the vaccines were known to be associated with this problem, they were
actually occurring more frequently from an infection."

IT FOUND THAT THERE IS AN EXTREMELY RARE BUT INCREASED RISK FOR CERTAIN NEUROLOGICAL HEART BLOOD AND BRAIN DISORDERS AFTER TAKING THE VACCINE. BUT HOW RARE IS OKAY? AND HOW MUCH MORE IS IT NOW IDENTIFIED AND PEOPLE THEN? BEFORE THE VACCINE? AND ALSO, WHAT ABOUT ALL THE LONG COVID SYMPTOMS THAT PEOPLE ARE PRESENTING WIDE UNMASK THE 99 MILLION ABOUT THAT. THOSE RIGHT? YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW MINE. THEY COME FROM MY DOCTOR. DOUBLE BOARD, CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN LONG COVID CLINICAL SPECIALIST AT TERRAIN, HEALTH DOCTOR ROBIN ROSE. SO YOU CALLED ME ABOUT THIS AND SAID, BOY, THE HEADLINE MAKES IT SOUND LIKE YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. WHY? THE BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY IS IS THAT THEY LOOK AT LIKE YOU SAID, THESE 99 MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS 10 COUNTRIES. AND THEY IDENTIFIED THESE VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS THAT WERNER A LOGIC RD AT CARDIAC OR HUMAN TO ISSUES. BUT THESE ARE PROBLEMS THAT WITH ANY THERAPEUTIC VACCINE THAT IS COMING OUT. YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO SEE THESE ISSUES, RIGHT? OR YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT TO SEE THESE ISSUES. AND IF YOU DID, YOU WANT TO SEE THEM AT A LOW RATE AND THERE WERE A HANDFUL THAT WERE FLAGGED, YOU SAFETY SIGNNALS THAT WERE 2 TO 3 TIMES HIGHER. YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY LOOKED AT, THEY WOULD, YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE THE EXPECTED VERSUS WHAT THE OBSERVED OUTCOMES WOULD BE. AND THEY WERE 2 TO 3 TIMES HIGHER. ANYWAY, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT IS EXPECTED VERSUS OBSERVED ME. SO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE ROLLING OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY'RE UP UNICA TREATMENT. A VACCINE. YOU KNOW, YOU EXPECT MAYBE YOU'LL HAVE SOME SIDE EFFECTS, MILD, MODERATE OR SEVERE SIDE WHEN THEY SAW, YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY WHEN THEY WHEN THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE DATA, ARE THEY? THEY KNEW THAT. SOME OF THE SIDE EFFECTS THAT THE SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS, THE OUTCOMES COLLECTED BY THESE 99 MILLION PEOPLE WERE HIGHER THAN WHAT THEY HAD EXPECTED. THAT MAKE SENSE. YEAH. AND YOU TOLD ME THAT AS AN ANALOGY YOU WERE LIKE IF WE WERE TALKING ABOUT LIKE CANCERS OR THINGS LIKE THAT, PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE HAPPY ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE SEEING IN THIS STUDY. HOW SO? SO THIS IS WHAT I MEAN. SO WHEN THE HEADLINES COME OUT ABOUT ABOUT VACCINE, RIGHT VERSUS COVID. THE THE VACCINE GETS DOWN, PLAYED IN A LOT OF WAYS. ARE THE HEADLINES DOWNPLAY WHAT'S HAPPENING? OKAY. AND THE ISSUE IS IS THAT IN OUR SOCIETY AND IN HEALTH CARE IN GENERAL, WE ALWAYS DO CARE ABOUT THE FEW OR THE RARE THINGS THAT HAPPEN, RIGHT? SO, YOU KNOW, WE COLON CANCER SCREENING, EVERYONE. THAT'S 45 YEARS AND OLDER, YOU KNOW, IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT NEED TO GET SCREENED BECAUSE WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE 32 OUT OF EVERY 100,000 PEOPLE THAT PER YEAR RIGHT. SAME THING WITH WOMEN AND CERVICAL CANCER. YOU KNOW, 7.7 FEMALES AT OF EVERY 100,000 PER YEAR, GET CERVICAL CANCER. THESE ARE RARE OR FEWER EVENTS THAT OCCUR. BUT WE CARE ABOUT THEM. WE DON'T DOWNPLAY THEM AND WE SCREEN THESE PEOPLE AND WE TRY TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING. THAT WAS MY POINT. AND HERE ARE SAYING IT'S UNACCEPTABLE LOSS AND YOU MADE ANOTHER GOOD POINT TO ME, WHICH IS WHY DIDN'T THEY IF THEY HAD THIS BIG COHORT TO ABOUT A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT CLINICIANS LIKE YOU ARE SEEING AND SEE HOW PREVALENT THEY ARE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? ANSWER YOUR OWN QUESTION IS. RIGHT. SO EXACTLY. THERE'S 10'S OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE SCREAMING FROM THE ROOFTOPS SAYING THAT AFTER THEY HAVE THE VACCINE, THEY'VE SUFFERED JUST. YOU KNOW, BE SICK. SYMPTOMS ARE NOT THAT THE SEC, BUT NOT A SEVERE IS THIS BUT SYMPTOMS THAT HAVE IMPAIRED THEIR ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. YOU KNOW, THEY CAN'T LIVE THE WAY THEY USED TO LIVE ON A DAILY BASIS. AND THOSE ARE THINGS, INCLUDING, YOU KNOW, CHEST HAVING US. PERSISTENT HEADACHES EVERY DAY MOST EXERTIONAL MOLLY'S NEUROPATHY WEAKNESS. NEW ONSET CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA IS A STRUCTURAL HEART DAMAGE, AUTOIMMUNE CONDITIONS, ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAN NAME 100 OTHER THINGS. PROBABLY. YOU KNOW WHY WE NOT LOOKING AT THING. THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN THIS STUDY PARTICULAR THINGS THAT ARE SUPER RARE AND VERY, VERY SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING. LAST THING. MY PRODUCER JUST GOT MY URBAN AND SAID, HEY, YOU KNOW, THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT IF YOU WERE VACCINATED, YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO GET LONG COVID. IS THAT TRUE IN YOUR EXPERIENCE? OUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THAT AND MIXED BAG. IT'S A MIXED BAG. E THERE. WE NEED A LOT MORE DATA ON THAT. BUT IT SEEMS THAT MANY PATIENTS THAT HAD LONG COVID THAT GOT VACCINATED ACTUALLY GOT WORSE INSTEAD OF BETTER IN MY EXPERIENCE. AND A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES EXPERIENCE THAT ARE TAKING CARE OF THESE PATIENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. TO BE LOOKED AT A LITTLE CLOSER AND CREST. THERE WAS A STUDY TO THAT JUST CAME OUT ABOUT PREGNANT WOMEN LAST WEEK. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT STUDY OVER 51% OF THE WOMEN THAT WERE PREGNANT THAT WENT ON TO HAVE LONG COVID WERE VACCINATED. AND 49 PER SO THERE IT WAS IT A LITTLE BIT MORE, YOU KNOW, HEADS MORE TOWARDS THOSE BEACH A VACCINE WENT ON TO LONG COVID VERSUS THAT. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU GET IS MULTIFACTORIAL. THERE'S"

DO A LOT OF AMERICANS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE VACCINE DESERVE AN APOLOGY. ABSOLUTELY. I I BELIEVE THEY WE APPROACH THIS. HAVE TO BE OPEN WITH PEOPLE. WE KNEW VERY EARLY ON THAT THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN THE HEART INFLAMMATION MYOCARDITIS MUCH MORE WITH A COUPLE OF AT VERSUS PFIZER. BUT THIS VERY LARGE STUDY OF ABOUT 100 MILLION PEOPLE SHOWS THAT THERE ARE RARE NEUROLOGICAL EFFECTS. THERE ARE RARE IMMUNE EFFECTS AND THERE ARE THE HEART INFLAMMATION AND THESE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS. WE HAVE TO BE OPEN WITH PEOPLE THAT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE 7 YEARS OLD OR 75? YEAH.

#davidpakmanshow #joerogan #covid",2024-02-10,115978,5820,4600,UCvixJtaXuNdMPUGdOPcY8Ag," Speaker 1: This is really painful to watch. On 
the bonus show today, we are going to talk about   the continued influence of the Joe Rogan Podcast. 
We are going to talk about how, I mean, listen,   influential is the most accurate word about the 
Joe Rogan podcast, and that's part of why this   is so painful to see. On a recent episode, Joe 
Rogan, on whose show I've appeared twice, just   casually said, you know, it's crazy how many young 
people got vaccinated and then died suddenly.   This is one of the most, what's the word? Is 
it destructive? Is it pernicious? Is it just   dishonest? Is it inaccurate? Is it depressing? 
What misstatements and inaccuracies about the   Covid vaccine? I'm going to play it for you. Then 
we're going to talk about it. Listen to this.  Speaker 3: This is how many people 
were promoters of the vaccine,   then died suddenly. It's crazy how many young 
people just died in their sleep after they took   it. And everybody's like nothing to see here.
Speaker 4: Sudden adult death syndrome.  Speaker 3: Yeah. Just died suddenly. You ever 
go to the died suddenly Instagram page like,   Holy. There's so many and so many people like 
talking about people who are, you know, anti   Darwin anti-vaxxers and then then you're dead. 
Sorry if you bought, you bought into the wrong   bullshit. But that's, you know, if you really want 
to get cruel, that's Darwinism. Do you not know   they lie by now do you not. Are you not aware of 
the opioid crisis? You're not aware of vioxx? Not   aware of the very like to 25% of all FDA approved 
drugs that get pulled? It's one out of four and   you're like, really? You're an anti-vax really 
reality. What are you, a conspiracy theorist? You   fool. Darwin's going to do its work with you. 
You're modifying your genes, you idiot. Like,   what are you doing? What are you doing? You're 
just going to trust Pfizer. Well, they do support   Anderson Cooper. Brought to you by Pfizer.
Speaker 1: Oh boy. Oh my goodness. Where do   you even start with this? Where do you even start? 
With the amount of damage that is being done here?   You know, every single one of these claims is 
wrong. First of all, the idea that the vaccine   modifies your genes. It's not true. It's been said 
so many times. It's been explained no matter what   sort of medical expert you have, explain it. Some 
of these folks just don't want to accept it or   believe it. He talks about the movie died suddenly 
and the Facebook page died suddenly. That is a   propaganda film, widely debunked and completely 
non empirically based. Which features a bunch of   headlines that you can find on Google about people 
that died and then suggests this never used to   happen. Healthy young adults never used to die. 
And it's happening now at a greater rate than it   used to. And it's because of the vaccine and the 
film has gotten. At one point it was more than 20   million views. It's so hard to know because it's 
on different platforms. And yeah, tens of millions   of views is fair to say. And, when you look into 
the film, you find that, number one, the rate of   these, deaths hasn't increased other than by 
the degree to which we know people have died   from Covid. We also have investigated some of the 
specific people that died suddenly. They weren't   even vaccinated. So some of the people featured 
in the film were not actually vaccinated with   the Covid vaccine. So total propaganda film that 
is leading people dangerously astray. And then,   you know, there's always some, as Sam Harris 
said to me last week in our interview or the   week last week, you. Sometimes these conspiracy 
theories have some grain of truth. And the grain   of truth here is pharmaceutical companies 
have lied and pharmaceutical companies have   done bad things. Joe Rogan mentions vioxx and 
he mentions opioids. It's really important to   understand that these are dramatically different 
sorts of medications. Vioxx was an Nsaid designed   to treat pain and inflammation, marketed for 
osteoarthritis and for some acute pain conditions,   and it was withdrawn from the market because there 
were concerns it would increase heart attack and   stroke if you used it for a long period of time. 
Okay. The opioid crisis. Opioids are an entire   class of prescription pain relievers. You've got 
your oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine and others.   The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. They 
are known for pain relieving effects, but huge   addiction, potential overdose. We, know about the 
Sackler family and their, deliberate, deception   when it comes to clinical trials, side effects 
and risk for addiction, etc.. Vaccines are meant   to help the body generate immunity without getting 
the disease. That's the idea. And vaccines are one   of the most effective ways to prevent diseases, 
including diseases that can cause death, as well   as diseases that are that are less likely to cause 
death. So when you look at the risk profiles with   vioxx, the risk was related to cardiovascular 
events, and it was significant enough to say,   we've got to withdraw this from the market. With 
opioids, you've got addiction risk, dependency,   overdose, death risk. These are significant, and 
it has generated a public health crisis. Vaccines   are low risk. Most side effects are extremely 
mild and temporary. Even the more rare serious   side effects almost always resolve on their 
own. When we've talked about the myocarditis,   pericarditis, and do you sometimes get a serious 
adverse event? Are there a few people that have   died from serious vaccine side effects? From 
just about any vaccine? Yes. But the point is,   you don't suspend an incredibly successful 
and effective public health campaign because   any intervention can have these extremely rare 
side effects. You look at opioids and vioxx,   it's a completely different, situation. So anyway, 
the vioxx opioid comparisons are just absurd. It's   really sad to see Rogan go in this direction. 
And, you know, I don't know who people write to   me. They go, David, you know, if only he would 
allow you back on, you could set them straight.   First of all, it's not about setting people 
straight. I don't know if he would ever have   me back on. I would appear anytime. That's what 
I've said. And, that that's where I will leave it"

10,mkZ1MabMEZw,Covid Vaccine Side Effects + VAERS,How I explain VAERS to a hypothetical patient,2022-01-02,1458114,107435,6857,UCLbidg2ZT49dWrxDkwNKr0g, so what do you think about getting the covet vaccine today I don't know doc what about the side effects if you look in Bears there's millions of side effects true but those aren't all verified you think they're made up no I'm saying a lot of those side effects weren't actually from the vaccine but it says they were the various data isn't automatically verified by professionals it's reviewed by the experts to look for patterns it says thousands of people died from the vaccine that seems like a pattern to me for instance on Bears right now 12 people were reported in October of 2021 to have died within seven days of getting the coveted vaccine I don't want to die that month 6.6 million Americans were vaccinated okay and 55 000 Americans die every week from covet I heard that's inflated because no from anything there are a lot of Americans in 2019 on average 55 000 Americans died every week wow so if we vaccinated every American in one day we'd expect 55 000 of them to die within the next seven days seems high 6.6 million vaccinations in October of 2021 is 1.8 percent of Americans so even if we gave them a popsicle instead of a vaccine we'd expect 991 of them to die within the next seven days did you say popsicles so just because they died within seven days of getting the vaccine doesn't mean they died from the vaccine you're saying popsicles kill people no nice so can I have one a vaccine a popsicle and a vaccine nah I'm good

#ABCNews #ABCNewsAustralia",2024-02-26,304812,2815,0,UCVgO39Bk5sMo66-6o6Spn6Q, the results are written from the world's largest study into the side effects of covid vaccines the study involved almost 100 million people from eight countries for more we're joined by the host of the Health Report on RN Dr Norman swam Norman great to see you again now what have we learned from this study that's been highly anticipated well just you alluded to the scope of it 99 million people 183 million doses of vaccines looking at Astra Mna and fisa and they've done it in eight countries with very reliable data places like Australia New Zealand Canada Denmark Finland um and the results show that well first of all the uncovered side of side effects that they hadn't quite expected and they did show up as a signal there all the side effects were rare and it takes me a little bit just to explain the um you the data because what they were doing was they were saying look what's the base rate of these problems in the community and what's the rise above the base R how many cases would we have expected over this period of time in this group of people and then how many cases appeared and uh what they showed was that they were rare so they start and and they only chose significant side effects if they were confident that they were side effects so gon Barry syndrome is one that been talked about a lot you and I have talked about it on the virus on news channel and the um so this is an ascending paralysis of the body a bit like um well it's not really like multiple sclerosis but it it it affects the ne the nervous system usually in most people it's a temporary phenomenon although it can be quite serious at the time gon bar seem to be only a problem with the Astro vaccine rare but only with the Astro vaccine not with the MRNA vaccines myocarditis pericarditis inflammation of the heart that showed out is a significant side effect um and no surprises there with the MRNA vaccines then there was a side effect called acute disseminated enom myelitis so this is essentially a brain inflammation usually seen in children but in this case in older people these are largely 20 to 60y olds um and again in most people self-limiting but could can be quite nasty but to give you an idea of how and it was only with the modna vaccine they didn't see it with fizer and they didn't see it with Astra so out of 10 million doses of Astro 1 million well I think yeah 10 million doses of of Mna I should say they were they expected to see two cases in that population of this brain inflammation and they saw seven so it's you can see how rare it is but it needs more investigation so out of that cohort of 99 million participants who were the subject of this study how many people came out with side effects um I've been asked this question before in terms of how many people if you just take the brain inflammation yeah out of 99 million people seven because this was I mean the whole yeah but the thing about side effects is that a lot of people around the world were wondering what if I'm one of the seven right but proportionality is really really important here that's right so it's vanishingly rare but it does exist and it's it's all about transparency so that you know what the risks are and this would be like winning the biggest lot um three times in your life something like that as we mentioned this was uh eight countries was a scope how much can that be extrapolated to the rest of the world population are recipients of these vaccines it's a it's a good question because you might well get different genetic susceptibilities in different populations but um the uh in terms of a representative population for Australia the the um you know particularly Canada was heavily involved it's a very similar population to australas I think Australians can take it away that from their point of view it's gives a good understanding of the risk of side effects I want to turn now to another study this time into a type of blood fat blood fat that's been linked with heart disease and stroke tell me about that we all know about cholesterol and if you've thought about cholesterol you've heard about there's good cholesterol and bad cherol right bad cholesterol is called LDL and uh that's the one that they target to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and so on it's been known for a long time that on the side here there's another Blood fat it's not part of cholesterol separate blood fat and it goes by the name lipoprotein little a CU there's a little a next to it the way the the experts um describe it and it's been known for a while that LP little a increases the risk of heart attack and stroke but it's but cardiologist have been trying to find all sorts of reasons why they shouldn't measure it one of the reasons is that they haven't got effective treatments for it it turns out and it's just getting stronger and stronger and stronger that LP little a is a strong risk factor for heart attacks and strokes in its own right and we should have it should be measured in people who are at high risk cuz there are ways of bringing it down and reducing your risk and there are new treatments on the horizon and it's as poent in terms of heart attack and stroke as LDL cholesterol how do you get about working out if you are at high risk or not you get a simple blood test trouble that easy yeah it's that easy trouble is it's not re reimbursed at the moment so it will cost you anywhere between 25 and 50 bucks right Norman great to chat with you thank you so much for coming in not at all
12,u9sfVoHhIfM,Beyond the Noise #33: Was it a mistake to mandate COVID vaccines?,"By the end of December 2020, two COVID mRNA vaccines were available to stop a virus that was wildly out of control. But many people refused to take them, leading to establishment of vaccine mandates - which might have caused greater harm in the long run.

———————————————————————",2024-03-12,4240,324,222,UCyFgCoP4ovsHbt92vM4zN2A," from microb TV this is beyond the Noise episode number 33 recorded on March 6 2024 I'm Vincent raken Yello and joining me today is your host Dr Paul offet hi Vincent this is the video version of Paul's column on substack called beyond the noise cutting to the chase on import important Health topics and today we're going to take a closer look at Paul's last column which is entitled was it a mistake to mandate covid vaccines now maybe we can start by having you take us back to 2020 and tell us how that first year the pandemic played out well it was a nightmare I mean we had nothing the first death from covid at least reported death was the end of February of 2020 and then you know hundreds of people were dying a day thousands of people were dying a day um we didn't have antiviral agents until October we didn't have Monon antibodies until November and we didn't have vaccines until December so we had nothing other than to try and limit human to human contact so I would have imagined that when we finally did have vaccines which was in December of 2020 they would have been seen for what they were which is a godsend which was true for many many people saw it that way but some unfortunately didn't so the vaccines became available at the end of 2020 and and you point out in your article some incredible numbers on the uptake right uh and to the credit well first of all to the credit of the Trump Administration for operation warp speed I think within 11 months using a technology we' never used before messenger Orna we had two very effective and safe vaccines and and remain frankly remarkably safe not absolutely safe but remarkably safe considering it's a new technology and then we had to do something also that we didn't have in place in this country which was really set up an infrastructure for Mass vaccinating adults which we did a million people a day two million people a day three million people a day by the time we were in the middle of 2021 roughly six seven months into the availability of a vaccine 70% of the US population had been vaccinated but then we hit a wall and 30% of the US population simply refused to get a vaccine so what to do why did they refuse to be vaccinated do we know I think a couple reasons I think one because they um were frightened about the vaccine I mean it was our first genetic vaccine it's a biological agent that you're injecting into your arm which if you don't really understand the agent very well you can see how people would be scared I think people denied some people denied the um the impact of this virus which is remarkable um there were definitely a number of people who would be on social media or even in Congress who would say that we're making a bigger deal of this virus than it was so I think those are probably the two big reasons so then mandates were were put in place what were what were they for well first of all you could argue we should have never needed mandates I mean in a better world anybody who would have looked at the data associated with these vaccines would have lined up to get them we really shouldn't have had to mandate vaccines but but we did and I think probably the biggest reason at that time was our Health Care system was overwhelmed by this virus I can tell you and I work at a 's Hospital which was probably less impacted than adult hospitals you know we had three floors of covid we had trouble taking care of not only covid patients but the other patients we were responsible for we canceled elective surgeries as many hospitals did and so it was a little ging frankly that that people with a vaccine available chose not to get it yet were perfectly willing to to sort of overwhelm our emergency department or overwhelm our hospital they were perfectly willing to Avail themselves of medical care but not the medical care that offered them vaccines it was hard to watch frankly and so we had to flatten the curve we had to flatten the curve and the way we we decided to do that was to mandate vaccines that you that you you had to get a vaccine to go to work to go to school to go to a bar to go to a restaurant to go to a place of worship to go to a sporting event um and that um I think did impact to some extent vaccine uptake I know I remember there was one uh couple or family that I saw initially on the floor and then ultimately in the Intensive Care Unit it was an older adolescent who had pretty significant respiratory disease ultimately requiring an intensive care unit admission and uh he wasn't vaccinated although he could have been because this was we were you were able to get a vaccine you were authorized a vaccine by uh May of 2021 for anybody over 12 so he was old enough to have gotten a vaccine didn't get it uh his mother didn't get it his siblings didn't get it and I remember talking to the parents and the father did get vaccinated and I asked him why and he just casually said well I had to for work so I think to some extent vaccines were used but uh I think I think there was value in mandating them for a lot of reasons first of all we know that if you got a vaccine and then you got covid you would shed less virus therefore you were be you would be less transmissible less capable of infecting someone else and and most importantly you would decrease dramatically your chance of being hospitalized so in 2021 you were 12 times more likely to be hospitalized if you weren't vaccinated in 2022 six times more likely to be vaccinated to be hospitalized if you weren't vaccinated so vaccination clearly was a value it's a shame we had toand at it you would think we wouldn't have had to but I think we did I remember going to a theater here in New York and they checked my everybody's vaccine record at the door you had it on a little app and you showed it to them to see that you were otherwise you couldn't go to the theater was really somebody like Kyrie Irving right who who's you know a basketball star for the Brooklyn Nets at the time and um you in order to enter the stadium Where Brooklyn played you had to be vaccinated well he refused to be vaccinated so he couldn't play for their 41 home games and lost half his salary which was you know $16 million he was willing to lose $16 million because he refused to be vaccinated that's just crazy because oh well we don't have to go through that so in your in your column you write about how some people claimed they want to ex I their personal freedom and not be told to get vaccinated why doesn't that work you went through this but tell tell us why it doesn't work so so covid is a contagious disease if you choose not to be vaccinated or said in another way you choose to increase your chance of getting infected and and uh and transmitting that infection to someone else you're making a choice for someone more than yourself um tetanus for example is not a contagious disease if you choose not to get a tetanus vaccine and you get tetanus no one is is going to catch it from you but but here this is a contagious disease and remember there's about 9 million people in this country who cannot be successfully vaccinated because of the level of immunosuppression they're getting because of their cancer therapies or because of their solid organ transplants or bone marrow transplants do you have any responsibility to them because when you get on an elevator or you get on a bus or whatever it's possible you could be sitting next to someone who can't be vaccinated do you have a responsibility to your neighbor so the title of the article is uh did we make a mistake so why why do you think we might have made a mistake in mandating the vaccines I think we're seeing that now think what happened was there have been hundreds of pieces of legislation pushing back against sort of these tenants of Public Health which includes not only masking but vaccines and as a consequence vaccines to some extent became a dirty word I think we leaned into this libertarian left hook this notion of personal freedom bodily autonomy which was more a province of the right during this uh this pandemic and as a consequence you're seeing an erosion in some to some extent in vaccine rates among kindergartens gardeners because their parents are choosing to exempt them from vaccines either a philosophical exemption or religious exemption so you're seeing more than we have ever before a use of non-medical exemptions among kindergarteners and I think as a consequence of that what you're seeing is Measles just what you would expect to see when you see an erosion vaccine rate so we now have roughly 15 states that have measles and I I just think measles it's some level um it's not just that we've largely eliminated the disease we've eliminated the memory of disease because measles can make you sick and you know I'm of an age obviously we're as a child of the 50s I had measles at a time when there'd be three to four million cases of measles and there'd be 48,000 hospitalizations and 500 deaths from measles measles is a serious infection and occasionally fatal infection and I feel we're playing a very dangerous game right now and also it's impacting School mandates in in very as you mentioned in Mississippi uh no more school mandates right right so so you well there's always School mandates I think what what happens is there's now an increase in exemptions to school mandates a non-medical exam so that's what happened in Mississippi a lawyer representing a group called informed consent Action Network which is not a religious organization quite the opposite um and they they are very proud of the fact that they've introduced a a uh religious uh exemption and now hundreds and hundreds of children in Mississippi have chosen that exemption and no doubt what will follow is an increase in susceptibility to measles and certainly likely an increase in cases of measles so it's the freedom to do harm so if um we end up having a big measles outbreak do you think that will impact these exemptions or it won't have any effect at all yes I think it will and and the reason I say that is I lived through the 1991 measles epidemic in Philadelphia so in a three-month period it between 1991 and 1992 in the winter we had 1,400 cases of measles and nine deaths it's centered on two religious communities that chose not to vaccinate their children um and as a consequence they formed the epicenter of that outbreak there were in those two groups 600 cases and six deaths but the virus spilled into the surrounding Community not surprisingly causing an additional 900 cases and three deaths um we got to the point in in in our in our city where people were scared to come into the city um the the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania gave us hundreds of thousands of dollars to to vaccinate down to six months of Age and and I think the most amazing aspect of that I think for the first time in American history and it's never happened since is we had compulsory vaccination not mandatory vaccination mandatory vaccination is you are asked to get a vaccine if you don't you may not be able to go to the school you want to go to or go to work compulsory vaccin ination is you are vaccinated whether you want to be or not and so here you had parents that did not want their children vaccinated but by by a city law they had to be vaccinated and so what happened was one of the uh pastors of the churches Charles reinard sort of s sought out the American civil liberties Union because what they were doing was perfectly legal we had a religious exemption to vaccination in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania what they were doing was legal so he sought out the ACO to represent do doing what they were doing not vacc on religious grounds which was legal and the ACLU a group that is perfectly willing to represent unpopular causes like Nazis marching down the streets of skoki Illinois refused to take that case because what they said was while you we recognize a religious freedom here you are not at right Rel you do not have a religious right to Marty your children and you had to be there at the time people were so scared of measles at that time I it's hard to know to imagine retrospect that something like that ever happened but that's what happened in Philadelphia in 1990 in 1991 1992 I I I will say this what what stopped that outbreak for all our vaccination for all our education there was one thing that stopped that outbreak spring it is a winter disease spring stopped that outbreak okay now um I wonder that was the 90s I think a lot has changed since then and I'm not sure the ACLU would have the same position but we'll see so after all this Paul uh if you had to do it again would you say we shouldn't mandate covid vaccines um I I I think we were right to do that um our health system was so overwhelmed with that virus we couldn't take care of of covid patients or other patients we couldn't do everything we needed to do we shouldn't have had to have mandated vaccines but I do think at the time it was the right thing to do I would have never predicted that this would have been been the outcome IE measles among children was the outcome of that and and it may be worse I we'll see what happen it's already March so I think as we move into spring we'll see measles evate but I do worry about what happens next year with his erosion in in school mandates because a number of countries did not mandate vaccination right and they did well is that because they're just smaller than we are or because they actually respect sort of Public Health institutions I mean the Scandinavian country who never mandated vaccines but had very high immunization rates they actually trust their Public Health agencies I know it's hard to believe that anyone does that but they did one last thing Paul you quote La Lawrence gon saying we are going to have a worse pandemic and this can be a problem I I would say we don't know that we're going to have a worse pandemic but it doesn't have to be worse it could be just the same as covid and uh if we go through the same thing um it it'll be problematic no I think you're right I I do think um there are certain weapons we have in public health vaccination isolation quarantine and I feel like the legislative push back that's occurred associated with this pandemic may make Public Health weaker in the future we'll see we'll put a link to this column in the show notes you can go and read it all yourself that's beyond the noise with Dr Paul offet thank you Paul thank you [Music] Vincent yeah"

Book club: http://www.lifeslibrarybookclub.com/",2021-04-23,217542,17683,3056,UCGaVdbSav8xWuFWTadK6loA," Good morning John, here in the
US the moment has arrived. Everyone over the age of 16
can get the COVID vaccine. Over 200 million doses have been
administered, and around 40% of people have gotten at
least one dose. And yet. The graph of people
getting vaccinated everyday, it’s starting to stop do this,
where it’s going higher every day, it’s starting to go less and less
everyday. And the reason for this is largely younger people,
by which I mean people under the age of 50 not getting their
vaccine immediately. It could be that you, watching this video
right now are one of those people, or maybe you know one of those
people and you want to send them this video. So I’m going to go,
very quickly, through a few of the reasons why I’ve heard young
people specifically say they haven’t gotten vaccinated yet. And first, I think tremendously under examined, is just that like, it’s a slightly
unpleasant task that I don’t want to add to my list of
things to do. And since now you can do it at any time, people
are putting it off. Schedules are busy, and you know
that the day after your second dose you might feel pretty crummy,
I certainly did. So why not put it off to a more convenient time? But as with all procrastinations, look there’s not really a better time than now. But you also have to look at what the trade off is, like we’re
dealing with mild inconvenience that is scheduled versus unscheduled
major inconvenience and maybe worse. The symptoms of COVID suck
no matter how old you are. COVID does kill young people, it just
doesn’t kill very many of them. The hospitalization rates are pretty high,
and spending a bunch of time at the hospital is so bad. It’s also like a burden on healthcare workers who are
overburdened enough right now. There are also a bunch of long
term side effects from getting COVID that we don’t understand super well
right now, and those sometimes also happen when people
get very mild cases. But even if you get none of that,
it’s still really inconvenient to get COVID. You feel like crap, you
have to quarantine. It’s inconvenient for you and everyone else
in your world. So why not decrease the odds 
of that happening by 95%? But maybe you’re not worried about yourself at all. It’s still really
important to recognize that every person except like the first
person who gets COVID, gets it from somebody else. And it’s very
easy to not know when you are the person who got someone sick
because a lot of people get sick by being exposed to people who
are infected but don’t even know that they are. If you’re
vaccinated, the odds of you getting another person sick
go way, way, way down. And then much more unlikely,
but even scarier. Every one of the new COVID variants that we’re talking
about right now, every one of them evolved inside of a person. And we will never know who that person was. But I think we all can agree that
we don’t want to be that person. Nobody wants to be the breeding ground
from which a new variant of COVID emerges. You can prevent yourself
from being that person by getting a vaccine. Now finally I’ve also heard some people saying that, you know,
I got COVID, or I think I got COVID, or I might as well just get COVID
and I can get immunity that way. Leaving aside the fact that it is a big deal  and you might infect someone 
for who it is an even bigger deal, immunity from getting COVID is 
much less effective at preventing future COVID infections than the vaccines are. So if you’ve
had COVID or you think you might have, or if you think, I’ll just
get it and get immune that way, none of that works. You need a vaccine. I understand that every person is
experiencing this differently, and also that it’s frustrating. And annoying. Like this things has been in charge of our lives for too long. And for many people, a vaccine feels like a way of taking back
control. And for others, it feels like more control that they’re
giving up. For me, it felt like taking back control. And I think to some extent, because the vaccines are a
really big deal, and they are such a triumph of hard work
and human ingenuity, that it’s easy to think, like, I have to
think really hard about this. It’s something to worry about,
and to fret over. But my friends, it’s really not. The decision here
is simple, it is both a big deal but also not a big deal. It’s just not a
big deal. So if you need one final reason to go get a vaccine,
hi I’m Hank Green. I make science videos. I’ve been making
educational videos for people for free on the internet for over 10 years,
and maybe you want to do me a favor! It’s super easy,
there’s a link in the description you can click on it, put in your
zip code, and make your appointment for getting your COVID vaccine. Put it in your phone, then go do it. And get a free donut. John, I’ll see you
on Tuesday."

vaccines for COVID-19, some of which are already
starting distribution in parts of the world. But given that these are mRNA vaccines are relatively new technology that has not been widely used before. We wanted to explain how
they work and what happens to your body from the moment
that needle touches your skin. - Like vaccines, we're used
to seeing these vaccines will be injected into the
upper muscle of your arm but unlike typical vaccines which introduce inactive or
weakened forms of a virus, these will release genetic
material called messenger RNA. So what exactly does this mRNA do? Well in a regular cell of your body, you have DNA inside of the
nucleus and this DNA stores all the information and
instructions important to the functioning of your cells your body and ultimately makes you you. Inside your cell is machinery
that reads through your DNA and transcribes it into mRNA which then leaves the nucleus
and goes into your cytoplasm. And it's here that the ribosomes and yourselves read the RNA and depending on the specific code to
build a series of amino acids which fold in on
themselves to make proteins which keep you alive and functioning. This process is known as translation. In fact, it's this process
that viruses take advantage of in the first place. They insert their own
genetic information into you and then your cell machinery
unwittingly starts taking that information and building proteins to help create more viruses. - So back to the needle, the mRNA that is being injected into you from the vaccine also
carries genetic instructions but in this case, it's only coding for one small part of the virus instead of the whole thing. You've probably seen SARS
CoV2 represented like this with the spikes on it. And it's this spike protein
which on its own is harmless that the vaccines mRNA codes for. The mRNA makes its way into
the cytoplasm of your cells where the ribosomes read the information and start to create the spikeD proteins. Once the protein is made, it goes to the cell membrane
and then your cell breaks down and destroys the injected
mRNA instructions. - So what good does having a
tiny fragment of viral spike in your body do? Well, it gives your body
and more importantly, your immune system, a preview
of what the virus looks like without causing disease. Suddenly your antibodies
will notice it and go, well, this doesn't belong here which triggers an immune
response to recognize and prepare your body for the real thing without ever having to come in contact with the actual virus itself. Your immune system
essentially gets a headstart by creating powerful
antibodies that can neutralize and kill the real virus. And this antibody memory
is stored in your B cells so that if you're ever
infected in the future with the SARS CoV 2 virus, your
body now has the upper hand. This is known as an
adaptive immune response. Your body has already seen
these spike proteins before and therefore it already knows what to do. Essentially, these mRNA
vaccines allow your body to protect itself from a future infection without ever having to
risk the consequences of getting the COVID-19. - So why haven't mRNA
vaccines been used before? While they are relatively new researchers have actually been experimenting
with them for decades but in the past they've
been very unstable. Enzymes in your body would
break down the mRNA quickly so they needed to be packaged well. The ones being released
now have the mRNA encased in lipid nanoparticles
which essentially protect the mRNA from being degraded. Since there are more unstable
than other types of vaccines, they have to be kept cold. For example, the Pfizer vaccine it has to be stored at
minus 70 degrees Celsius and at normal refrigerated temperatures can only last five days. Of course, a global pandemic
has certainly increased the funding and resources going towards these types of vaccines which has helped to accelerate their development. - What makes these vaccines so appealing is that unlike other vaccines, they can be made in a lab with
readily available materials and actually made much quicker
than other types of vaccines. Instead of fully developing
non-infectious viruses and then injecting them,
these mRNA vaccines can sort of pass many hurdles
by using your own body in an ingenious way. It's also far more cost-effective
to create mRNA molecules rather than the proteins themselves and also a lot more scalable which is helpful when we are
in a global pandemic waiting for a vaccine. - So is it safe? And given that it's a
relatively new technology, should you be concerned at all? Well, that's what these initial
trial stages have been for. Not only to test whether or not they work and cause immunity but to make sure they have minimal side effects. As of now around 70,000 people have been given these vaccines with no serious concerns, a caveat being that the full research hasn't been published yet
as of recording this video. But it's important to remember that just because it's safe doesn't mean there won't be any soreness or pain. Some recipients did report aches and pains and as of now you'll
need to receive two shots to ensure efficacy. I saw a really great analogy
by the professor Shane Crotty who works in vaccine research and he said, ""It's not unlike going to
the gym and getting exercise ""and really sore muscles. ""A bit of pain can be a positive sign ""that good things are happening. ""Sometimes you have to earn your immunity, ""just like you have to earn
those biceps you wanted so bad."" - We know you've been asking
about these vaccines a lot, we've also had our questions. So we hope that all this
information was useful and concise and educational for you 'cause it does sort of help make things seem less unknown and scary
in a very strange time. - Thank you all so much for watching. If you want to hear more about vaccines, our podcast is on YouTube. You can check that out, we
have a few episodes on vaccine. - We gossip about vaccines to be honest. - You would love to see
gossip about vaccines. Otherwise make sure you
like this video, subscribe and we'll see you next time
for some more science, see you."

17,uOxppT3gPpE,Post-vac syndrome: &#39;There is no such thing as a vaccine without side effects&#39; | DW News,"It is normal to have certain reactions after a vaccination: There may be redness, swelling or pain around the injection site. But for some people, life has changed dramatically following their COVID-19 vaccination. 

The German biotech firm BioNTech is facing compensation claims for alleged side effects from its Comirnaty vaccine. Millions of people in Germany received the jab, which authorities say saved many lives in the pandemic.

The plaintiff, who is not being publicly named under German privacy laws, alleges that the vaccine caused her to suffer upper-body pain, swollen extremities, fatigue and sleeping disorder. She is suing BioNTech for at least €150,000 ($161,500) in damages for bodily harm as well as compensation for unspecified material damage, according to the court. A lawyer representing her, Tobias Ulbrich, told Reuters news agency that he would challenge assessments made by EU and German health regulators that the Comirnaty jab had a positive risk-benefit profile.

#davidpakmanshow #bretweinstein #tuckercarlson",2024-01-08,201925,5319,5883,UCvixJtaXuNdMPUGdOPcY8Ag, let's do a couple of covid related stories Brett Weinstein evolutionary biologist and podcast host of the Darkhorse podcast was recently interviewed by former Fox News propagandist Tucker Carlson and Brett told Tucker something that sounds shocking because it is and it's wrong which is that 17 million people have died from the covid vaccine that is quite a claim let's take a listen to what Brett had to say gauge Tucker's reaction and more generally we will discuss it there was uh a press I was recently at a conference uh in Romania on the covid crisis and so there was a lot of work trying to unpack what we actually understand and I saw a credible estimate of something like 17 million deaths globally from this technology so 17 million deaths from the coac well when you know when you scale up to billions uh it's not hard to reach a number like that with the technology that's dangerous now to your deeper question I think let's and by the way these are not our subtitles they're a mess but I just want to make clear these are not our subtitles Steelman so just for perspective I mean that's like the death toll of a global war yes absolutely it is this is a a a great tragedy of History so that proportion um and amazingly there is no way in which it's over I mean we are still apparently recommending these things for healthy children never stood any chance of getting any benefit from every chance of suffering harms that are uh not only serious but tragic on the basis that children have long lives ahead of them so listen uh let's start anecdotally okay okay the claim is 17 million people have been killed by the covid vaccine and it's continuing let's start anecdotally which is not the way we do things but sometimes it's useful to start with an anecdote just as a sniff test and then we'll go further okay first of all does anybody in my audience know a single person who had a serious vaccine complication maybe there's a couple of you okay sometimes that happens extremely rare we have an audience in the millions C L it's possible that someone in the audience not not you but knows someone who had a serious vaccine complication maybe there's a few of you okay does anyone in my audience know of anybody personally right who died from the covid vaccine I assume the answer is zero since almost no one okay almost no one has died from vaccine complications so does anyone in my audience then know anybody who has died from covid or covid complications just about everybody I know says the answer is yes I assume the answer is yes both personally and certainly obviously we know of people through through the media my aunt died of complications from covid she was imuno compromised had a number of health issues got covid never recovered passed away an uncle of mine died from Co pneumonia now let's go beyond anecdote okay the global death toll of covid about six million closer to seven depending on whether we talk recorded deaths or an excess death model OKAY somewhere between six and7 million Deb of covid and 17 million dead of the vaccine now you can go and watch the presentation that Brett saw in Romania okay it's a Canadian scientist Dennis rancour uh here's just like a few seconds of it this is all available online it's 26 minutes scene that is explained by the magic of mathematical models written by bought out scientists working for bought out politicians so it is not true the vaccine did not save lives okay you can go and watch this entire thing and then you will have the information that that uh Brett has and then you can also find the 130 page so-called analysis of this on which that presentation is based we're not going to link to it we're putting up a screenshot but we're not going to link to it since I don't know we could be banned or something who knows and here's what this quote analysis did the analysis looked at all cause mortality in 17 countries and the analysis claims that all cause mortality data shows there was no benefit from a covid vaccine now all it does is it looks at population data doesn't confirm whether anybody who died was even vaccinated and it makes it an impossibility to draw any kind of conclusion about the relationship between vaccination and morality like at the top level it's bogus we don't even need to go further but we can the analysis also ignes really good evidence that we have that when we see a spike in excess mortality in a country it aligned with a covid surge not a vaccination surge if you look and you say okay we know there was a covid surge in this country at this time and then you see excess mortality go up that's really good data about what might be going on on the other hand and if you look at a country like Peru when you saw the excess deaths Spike uh did not coincide with when the vaccination rates went up we know when the vaccination rates went way up in Peru and you didn't see excess deaths so the studies that we have show all cause mortality is uh higher in the states with lower vaccination rates and all cause mortality was lower in states with higher vaccination R so it is truly dangerous listen do I think Bret Weinstein really believes this I genuinely do not know I do not know whether Brett Weinstein believes this stuff five years ago four or five years ago I would have said Brett Weinstein is too smart to fall for this crap it's just what my view would have been and I don't know what the answer is because unfortunately if he doesn't believe it then he's deliberately spreading misinformation which I mean what's worse being a liar being misinformed being a deliberate liar seems worse to me it's really sad what's happened to Brett Weinstein and of course opportunist Tucker Carlson loves the ability to just promote the hell out of this crap for clicks and is he even getting clicks I don't know something that's been in the news a lot lately is data Brokers collecting vast amounts of data about everything you do on your phone and computer where you go what you look at they identify patterns in your behavior and it's really quite disturbing how much data Brokers know about us even our health information and then we found out that sometimes government agencies like the FBI will buy that information from data Brokers to spy on Americans without warrants ad companies buy the data to serve you ads financial institutions can use the information the information can even end up on public search sites where anybody can see it but there is a way to stop it our sponsor incog is an affordable service service that sends automatic data removal requests to data brokers who are required by law to comply incog even follows up with the data Brokers to ensure your data is permanently gone and incog keeps you updated every step of the way I use incog myself it is remarkable what they will accomplish for you and my audience gets 60% off go to incog docomond and use the code Pacman the link is down below

#davidpakmanshow #covid #vaccine",2023-01-28,163647,7025,6016,UCvixJtaXuNdMPUGdOPcY8Ag," Speaker 1: Anti-vaccine so-called expert Sherri 
Tenpenny is again spreading fear and promulgating   disinformation about the COVID 19 vaccine. She is 
now warning everyone that is close to you is soon   going to die from the COVID vaccine, not from 
COVID, from the COVID vaccine. Sherri Tenpenny   is now warning about a tsunami of deaths in 
2023. She says by the end of this calendar year,   the year of the Lord 2023, every one of us will 
know five, maybe ten or more people who have died   from the COVID vaccine. Okay. Let's listen to what 
she had to say. This is very instructive in terms   of fear mongering and so many other things.
Speaker 4: Let's listen now. We're seeing the   tsunami of deaths. Tsunami I've been talking about 
since the beginning of 21. Millions of people are   going to die. You know, when Judy Mikovits came 
out on Plandemic at the beginning of that and by.  Speaker 1: The way, that was one of the biggest 
nonsense propaganda films. Plandemic and Mikovits   It's crazy to even mention it.
Speaker 4: That   that more than 50 million people are going 
to die. And everybody was like, Whoa!   And when they started interviewing me and I and 
they asked me, what did I think about that number,   I said, It's way too low. Oh, it's going to be 
much more than 50 million people in America alone.   And we're already starting to see it.
Speaker 1: We're not.  Speaker 4: So the tsunami of deaths is 
coming. It's already here. And I believe   that what's happening now is is starting 
to happen now is the tsunami of regrets   of the people that fell for the lies, 
the fear, friends and family members and   parents and children. And all they did 
to your grandchildren just could not be   told otherwise. But now that people are dying 
like flies, I mean, my business partner has   83 close people in his life that have died.
Speaker 1: You know, most the truth is most   people don't have 83 people in their lives that 
they are close to. This is like a separate issue,   but these are obvious lies.
Speaker 4: 83.  Speaker 1: Yeah. No.
Speaker 4: It's the beginning.   And I predict that by the end of this year, 
every person in this room and every person   listening behind here is going to know a minimum 
of five, probably ten or more close friends and.  Speaker 1: Figure you don't have as many 
friends as her business partner. So you'll   have only 5 to 10 people die.
Speaker 4: Members that have   died from these shots.
Speaker 1: Right.   So I want to remind everybody, and this is so 
controversial every time people say David, is   Sherri Tenpenny a doctor? Is she not a doctor? And 
when I explain it, people get mad. Sherry Tenpenny   is not a medical doctor. She is an osteopathic 
physician. Now, whenever I make that distinction,   people start writing in, including osteopath, 
saying, David, you shouldn't act as though that   is less than being an MD. I'm not saying anything. 
I'm just telling you she's not an M.D. She's an   osteopathic physician, and her claims have no 
scientific basis. It doesn't mean every osteopath   believes the things Sherri Tenpenny believes. I'm 
not saying that at all. All I'm telling you is   actual medical doctors have debunked her claims. 
Health organizations have debunked your claims.   Many osteopathic have also debunked her claims. 
But in the sense that osteopathic physicians   are doctors, she is indeed a doctor. Now, if she 
sounds familiar, and this is really the big point   I want to make. It's because we have listened 
to her predictions in the past, and of course,   none of them have come to pass. What I would like 
is accountability for these people when they make   these predictions. Let's remember and then we can 
follow up and say, hey, that stuff didn't happen.   Because remember when she said this last year?
Speaker 4: The more shots you get, the more the   more you destroy your immune system and the 
faster that happens. And it's anticipated.   The German data says that by the end of 
2022, every fully vaccinated person over   the age of 30 may have the equivalent of full 
blown vaccine induced immune suppressed AIDS.  Speaker 1: Ladies and gentlemen, as a fully 
vaccinated person over the age of 30, I am here   today to tell you I do not have full blown vaccine 
induced immune suppressed AIDS. I do have a little   neck pain from a weird movement I did at the gym 
three days ago, but I don't have full blown AIDS.   So the point is, it's fear, fear, fear. And we're 
going to talk about this later. I can't believe   I'm saying these words. But later on in the show, 
I'm going to talk to you about Tucker Carlson,   fear mongering about a space vagina. I know it 
sounds insane, but it's what it is. They have to   induce fear. Fear generates the environment they 
need in order to then sell you something, whether   it's tickets to an event or a product or liquid, 
liquid, silver, whatever it is they sell you.   And then there's no follow up and there's no 
accountability. We have to hold these people   accountable for their endless failed predictions. 
This is yet another one of those. And if you want   to if you're listening today and you want to see 
what this looks like when this woman makes these   claims. We'll have all of these clips on our 
YouTube channel, YouTube.com slash The David   Pakman Show and on our Instagram, which you can 
find by searching Instagram for David Pakman show."

21,fdGj6p2qDdk,The Nobel laureates behind mRNA COVID vaccines,"More than one million people died just in the U.S. as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that broke out in 2020. But a scientific miracle – a vaccine released later that same year – saved countless lives. Last year Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman, the two scientists whose research in messenger RNA (or mRNA) and immunology enabled the development of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines, were named Nobel Prize-winners. ""Sunday Morning"" contributor Kelefa Sanneh talks with Weissman and Karikó about their partnership, and the unusual trajectories of their lives that led to a breakthrough that may reshape vaccine treatment for a host of diseases.

I heard about it it's a virus it's a respiratory   infection I knew the vaccine was going to work 
how did the lockdown affect your life and your   work we never stopped working they work day and 
night different shifts and minimizing the presence   of people in one room this is the Frozen vaccine 
wow for patients you thaw this out you dilute it   and you inject it in their arms the MRNA Covid 
vaccine uses mRNA to direct the cells to create   a spike protein like the one on the surface of 
the virus so the body builds defenses against   that protein this protection helps fight the virus 
the vaccine became available in the United States   in December 2020 that month Weissman and Karikó 
were vaccinated with a flourish did you think on   that day about all the years and Decades of 
work it took to get to that point yes yes I   I was thinking about that and thinking about what 
we went through they put up some cameras and took   pictures and and had fun Pfizer Moderna which 
one Pfizer the covid vaccine reduced the death   toll and helped people get back to relatively 
normal lives was there any disappointment that   the vaccine didn't just sort of put an end to 
covid once and for all in the beginning of the   pandemic I would go into the Intensive Care 
units and every bed would have a covid patient   on a ventilator doing poorly and now when I went 
into the Intensive Care units there were no covid   patients at all and that's because of the vaccine 
and their work will be used in the battle against   some of the world's most difficult diseases how 
bright is the future it's truly phenomenal right   now there's 250 Phase 1 clinical trials of RNA 
vaccines people are making vaccines for HIV for   malaria for Hepatitis C for TB for food allergies 
talk to a parent with a kid with a peanut allergy   and every day is a panic the covid vaccines were 
backed by government mandates and sparked an   uproar the controversy I still don't understand 
people thinking that science and vaccines are   out to get them and I've never heard of such a 
thing before well maybe it's just what happens   when politics collides with medicine that's not 
the job of our politicians they're not supposed   to tell people how to live less well of how to die 
from diseases they're supposed to help the world   this past December 3 years after the vaccine was 
released the Nobel Prize committee awarded Karikó   and Weissman its 18 karat gold medallion how 
long does it take for it to sink in it's still   happening yeah it takes time did you think 
finally my finally moment was the phase three   clinical trials when we saw that the vaccines 
were 95% effective that was a life's work has   turned into something useful did you take a moment 
to celebrate no I'm not much of a celebrator I I   just probably went back to work famously I ate 
the whole bag of chocolate covered peanuts well   on a day like that you had definitely earned it 
a good good scientific lab has top-of-the-line   equipment but a really great scientific lab has 
a trophy room when you think about like becoming   a scientist is it somewhere in the back of your 
head like I might win the Nobel Prize never no my   parents when I was maybe five they were brought in 
on a tour of the Nobel Auditorium and at one point   they walked up to a pair of seats and said Reserve 
these for us if weissman's rise seem predictable   Karikó's did not born in communist Hungary Karikó 
never knew a scientist but she knew she wanted to   be one in 1985 30-year-old Kati Karikó along with 
her husband and young daughter left Hungary for a   job in a lab in Pennsylvania this teddy bear 
seems like it would be kind of out of place   but this is actually a very important bear isn't 
it yes this is the bear that uh helped us get to   America and start our life if I turn this over 
someone did a little surgery on this teddy bear   didn't they tell me what happened here I put 
$1,000 equivalent of British pounds and I saw   it back because in Hungary we were not allowed to 
take any money out of the country your daughter   was the mule nobody found it nobody suspected 
and from there to here Nobel Prize yeah and   some decades in between yeah decades spent doing 
what both Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman truly   love laboratory is a is is a wonderful place and 
so kind of my home is a laboratory I sometimes get   the sense that maybe you would rather be in the 
lab doing your work than talking to journalists   yeah partially it is true but also we realize 
that it is important to go out and educate the   public and explain what we are doing and Inspire 
the next generation of scientists exactly I mean   I'm much happier and nothing personal I'm still 
happier sitting in my office or in my lab working   that's my favorite place as a member of the 
human race I'm glad to have you working in your lab"
22,Y0sg9G5BBVU,A Message for People Who Don’t Want the COVID Vaccine,"26% of Americans are planning to skip the COVID vaccine. We get that people are skeptical of politicians and celebrities telling them what to do but we should listen to doctors. The men and women who have been on the front lines of the pandemic risking their lives to save ours are frustrated. If we don’t get more people vaccinated we could see vaccine-proof new mutations of the virus and go through this all over again. So as a public service we asked some real doctors and nurses to offer their best advice to those who are on the fence about the vaccine. Pay attention, this is important.

that says there's been more covert deaths in people that are vaccinated versus people that are unvaccinated and we want to look at that in a little bit of detail in a minute and put some context in that and also we want to look at the bivalent vaccine boosters that are being given in the states and we're going to be looking at information from V safe which shows that 54.8 percent of vaccine recipients of the bivalent boosters had a systemic side effects most of which weren't serious in the time frame they were looking at now that's about the only way I can summarize this it is a bit complicated and of course YouTube rules and my own personal standards insist that we will be looking at a data from official sources and other reputable sources of data so we're not going against any uh any guidelines from the United States government now um here we have this this is this is this was a report it was commissioned by The Washington Post Kaiser Family Foundation vice president Cynthia Cox who does a lot of this kind of work now um this is quite interesting 58 of coronavirus deaths in August with people who were vaccinated or boosted and that is people who'd had a primary uh course of vaccines at least a primary course of vaccines so what it looks like is happening here is we're getting waning of the protective effects of the vaccines it's now waning and of course this combined with the systemic side effects that we're going to look at from the booster doses needs to be taken into account as we consider the the consider the risk of benefit analysis because we started these vaccination programs a while ago and the risk benefit analysis has changed um we're not saying the vaccines aren't effective we're not saying that there are anything about the vaccines we're just saying the risk benefit analysis has changed let's go on um so therefore 42 of deaths in August were in people who were unvaccinated so the majority For the First Time The More Death covered deaths in the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated population in the United States now it's fair to contextualize this because if we look at CDC data we do find that 80.06 percent of the United States population is vaccinated so there's more people in the vaccinated group than in the unvaccinated group but it's also true as we saw that there were more covert deaths in the vaccinated group for the first time now historically this is quite interesting September 2021 vaccinated people 23 percent of the coronavirus fatalities in people that were vaccinated January in February 2022 had gone up to 42 percent and as we saw now it's now gone up to 58 percent so we see that the risk of benefit analysis is changing the data is there before our eyes so a direct quote from the Kaiser foundation in the Washington Post we can no longer say this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated so uh Mr Biden's um not saying Mr Biden was wrong at the time but um times have changed we know protective effects Wayne and this needs to be taken into account when we look at risk benefit analysis in my view so this was a the Kaiser Foundation had conducted the analysis now A Center for Disease Control and prevention morbidity and mortality weekly report and this is this paper here from from the CDC so we're banging bang in the middle of official U.S government data safety monitoring a bivalent covid-19 vaccines now um August the 31st 2022. um the FDA authorized the bivalent booster for Pfizer and moderna um MRI encoding the spike protein from the original SARS coronavirus II and from Oregon ba4 and ba5 so it was this bivalent combination vaccine advisory committee on immunization uh practice recommended all persons over 12 receive an age-appropriate dose of the one of these vaccines that was their recommendation at the time and indeed still is now v-safe is a voluntary smartphone-based U.S safety surveillance system established by the CDC to monitor Adverse Events after covid vaccination and here we have it it's a v safe here now I don't actually know too much about that so if people that are using it in the states have been giving me some feedback on that that would actually be really uh really quite useful to get some information on that as of the 3rd of October I believe there were 10 million users of that period of time so it looks like it's being fairly well used are we getting better data now from the states it certainly is starting to look that way we're getting better quality data now vaccine Adverse Events reporting system is the other way of course and um information is also taken from that total data from the 31st of August the 23rd of October 14 odd million uh had received a Pfizer bioentec 8.2 million uh the modernist just over uh I think the modern is just over 18s so pretty large numbers that we're getting here now v-safe is a bit more confusing it looks like in this period of time there was 211 959 registrants age over the age of 12. slightly complicated as well because people under the age of 16 have to have supervision to use this program so quite how that's working out I don't really know in the states but registrants now it looks like these are people that had just started using the app in that period of time but as is often the case with CDC it's not that clear really the way the writers is not that not that transparent very often August 31st to 23rd of October is the period of time so um just that finite window of time 2022 reports in the week after vaccination be put so this is just a one week period now clearly you don't have to be a that clever to realize that this isn't going to pick up any potential long-term side effects we're not saying there are long-term side effects but any potential long-term side effects would by definition not be picked up in the first week so it is limited but anyway injection site reactions 60.8 that's not too surprising and it's not really concerning you get a soil arm of course um systemic reactions though this is more concerning to me 54.8 percent fewer than one percent and I think we'll see later it's about point eight percent uh received Medical Care so vsafe is reporting that some people did need uh medical opinions and medical care after the vaccination I don't think that's controversial it's a simple statement of fact uh vaccine Adverse Events reported system so uh 5542 reported Adverse Events of bivalent uh vaccine pretty small number really actually um are all the cases being reported to bear as of course not of course not uh but 4.5 of those were serious now remember this is of cases actually reported but still a reasonable proportion of the case is actually reported were classified as being serious Adverse Events now this is straight from the CDC Healthcare Providers and patients can be reassured that Adverse Events reported after bivalent boosters are consistent with those reported after monovalent vaccines do you see what they've done here they're comparing the bivalent boosters with the monovalent they're comparing two groups this is a relative risk not an absolute risk not saying the CDC are being disingenuous not at all but we they are reporting a relative risk not an absolute risk the absolute risk um they didn't put that in not given so it's a relative risk the absolute risk is going to be smaller than the relative risk how much smaller don't know they didn't say information not given disappointing from the CDC that they're just talking about relative risk the health impacts after covered vaccines uh vaccination are less frequent and less severe than those associated with covered illness again they're comparing people that have had illness with people that are vaccinated a relative risk not an absolute risk for the whole population not saying the CDC are being deliberately disingenuous here but it would have been better to have information on absolute risk as well as relative risk unfortunately the the absolute risk is not given but we know it will be smaller than the relative risk now the reference they use for this is interesting because they're making this broad statement here health health impacts which so Health impacts is a broad statement it applies to everything but the reference they give reference to there is quite specific now that's the reference there and uh it just refers to myocarditis pericarditis and combinations of those or multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children within seven days or 21 day risk window after the index date so again this is only a 14-day window that they're taking this information from and even then they're giving it as a relative risk I mean we're not saying the CDC are trying to give the wrong impression here but it just doesn't seem very well written to me um I I I know many relatively Junior academics who could write it much more clearly than this I think but we're not arguing with the numbers that the CDC are giving we're more uh commenting on their on their presentation okay comparison between and after uh vaccines after infection again they're comparing between the infections and uh after the vaccines two groups the relative risk between those absolute risk not given again so we see that the CDC are really giving relative risks comparing one group with another group not giving the absolute risk for the population as a whole CDC please you need to give both we need to know what the absolute risk is as well as the relative Risk please now a bit do a bit more detail here a review of these safe data from the mobile app again during August the 31st to 23rd of October same time period now this is what they say 211 212 000 nearly registrants these are presumably people that registered new newly in that period of time um they're covered a fairly good age group um a few to 12 to 17s as we see there more in the uh more in the older age groups but a good a good spread of Ages no complaints there at all uh quite a few of these 50 45 were the fourth dose and the fifth dose was 50.2 percent but of course we know that if these risks if the heart disease complications especially that the CDC does admit can occur after vaccines they're more likely after the second dose so again it's not giving a really good overall picture it's really quite specific to these um bivalent boosters that they're talking about uh in the week after rece receiving um a bivalent booster dose local injection site reactions now this is interesting uh 49.7 amongst the over 65s higher in the younger age group and the age group they use for comparison here is the 18 to 49. so younger people men and women getting more local uh reactions systemic reactions it's the same 18 to 49 getting 67.9 local reactions as opposed to 43.5 in the over 65s and when they look at the specific problems they see this same Trend that it's younger people that are getting more so 30 in older people 53 in younger people headache again 19.7 in older people 42.8 in younger people and again we see it the same with the muscle pain and the fever now it reported inability to complete normal daily activities was 10.6 amongst those over 65 and 19.8 percent in those aged 18 to 49 after vaccination so over 19 in that younger age group couldn't carry out their normal activities after the uh the booster vaccine I would have thought these are fairly fairly High numbers uh receipt of Medical Care was reported by 0.8 percent now 0.8 percent who took medical advice after vaccination I would have thought that is rather high but the CDC just report it they don't say anything about it they just say that's what it was I would have thought it's rather High 0.8 percent you can decide whether you think that's high low or indifferent again we're talking about risk benefit analysis so so there we go um I know that's fairly data intense um but it looks like um the risks after the risk of side effects after vaccination are becoming clearer with uh vsafe although I don't yet fully understand how it's working but it's good that these are being honestly reported and just combine that with the risk benefit analysis um that more covert deaths are now occurring in vaccinated versus on vaccinated despite the fact we have to be clear about it only 20 of the the population are unvaccinated so the vaccinated is a much larger group thankfully though uh covert cases are getting milder they still do cause some deaths as we'll see seeing some hospitalizations but the trend is that they're getting milder and I think these things should be taken into account where the risk benefit analysis so that's about as far as we can go on this talk I think lots of data there all the references are given I've been as honestly I've been as honest to the data as I can and um check the links and uh I'm pretty sure all of my numbers are accurate you'll have to decide uh how you interpret the information I have given you interesting don't want to say any more well could say more but probably best not say more thank you for watching
24,eFx-d0SvOVg,"Higher Number Of COVID Vax Received, Higher RISK Of COVID: Newly Peer Reviewed Study Implies","Briahna Joy Gray and Robby Soave discuss a new Covid-19 study. #covid #coronavirus 

According to the CDC, all COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States are effective at preventing COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can offer some protection from future illness, sometimes called “natural immunity,” but the level of protection people get from having COVID-19 may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age.  

Getting a COVID-19 vaccination is also a safer way to build protection than getting sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without you having to experience sickness. Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can cause severe illness or death, and we can’t reliably predict who will have mild or severe illness. 

If you get sick, you can spread COVID-19 to others. You can also continue to have long-term health issues after COVID-19 infection.  While COVID-19 vaccines are effective, studies have shown some declines in vaccine effectiveness against infections over time, especially when the Delta variant was circulating widely.  

The mRNA vaccines do not contain any live virus. Instead, they work by teaching our cells to make a harmless piece of a “spike protein,” which is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. After making the protein piece, cells display it on their surface. Our immune system then recognizes that it does not belong there and responds to get rid of it. When an immune response begins, antibodies are produced, creating the same response that happens in a natural infection.  

In contrast to mRNA vaccines, many other vaccines use a piece of, or weakened version of, the germ that the vaccine protects against. This is how the measles and flu vaccines work. When a weakened or small part of the virus is introduced to your body, you make antibodies to help protect against future infection.

While COVID-19 vaccines are effective, studies have shown some declines in vaccine effectiveness against infections over time, especially when the Delta variant was circulating widely. According to the CDC layered prevention strategies — like staying up to date on vaccines and wearing masks — can help prevent severe illness and reduce the potential for strain on the healthcare system. 

Wear a mask with the best fit, protection, and comfort for you.  If you are in an area with a high COVID-19 Community Level and are ages 2 or older, wear a well-fitting mask indoors in public.  

If you are sick and need to be around others, or are caring for someone who has COVID-19, wear a mask. 

If you are at increased risk for severe illness, or live with or spend time with someone at higher risk, speak to your healthcare provider about wearing a mask at medium COVID-19 Community Levels. 

In April 2021, increased cases of myocarditis and pericarditis were reported in the United States after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna). Data from multiple studies show a rare risk for myocarditis and/or pericarditis following receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. These rare cases of myocarditis or pericarditis have occurred most frequently in adolescent and young adult males, ages 16 years and older, within 7 days after receiving the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna). 

There has not been a similar reporting pattern observed after receipt of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (Johnson & Johnson). CDC continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination for everyone 6 months of age and older. 

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and CDC have determined that the benefits (such as prevention of COVID-19 cases and its severe outcomes) outweigh the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis after receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

covid-19 varied by the number of covid-19 vaccine doses previously received and the higher the number of vaccines previously received the higher the risk of Contracting covid-19 popular YouTuber and comedian who has been a prominent skeptic over vaccines and mandates throughout the pandemic Jimmy Dore tweeted FYI it's not a vaccine it's a failed experiment we are the guinea pigs all right take these findings with a grain of salt but this is interesting because the first this first came out earlier this year I think around February and there was a lot of pushback at that time part of the pushback was that it was not a peer-reviewed study it was just what's known as a preprint now we're talking about this again because it has been peer reviewed and the parts of the study that raised a red flag to some vaccine Skeptics are still there in the study yeah yeah go ahead yeah so the the the authors of the study note that this is unexpected like I don't think these are people who were these are not like anti-vaccine people who are setting out to disprove the efficacy of vaccines and so so they're saying there was an association of increased risk of covid-19 with higher number of Prior vaccine doses importantly and it was not because so you could rationalize why that might be the case well maybe people who are getting the most um Jabs the most doses of vaccine are people who are older and higher at risk anyway so then yes they're more likely to get coveted because they're higher risk so it would just be incidental that they're more likely to get a lot of vaccines and they're more likely to get covered but that's not one doesn't have anything to do with the other however that is not the case here as they lay out of the Cleveland Clinic they're like okay we see why you might think that but the um the yeah that most of the people in this study were young people some young people can be at a high risk of covet if you have a pre-existing condition but you would not expect that to be most of the people and so they're saying that that really makes this finding um unexpected um yeah the risk yeah the people despite this their risk of acquiring covid-19 the people who had fewer injections was lower than those who'd received a larger number of Prior vaccine doses so it's worth noting that the overall conclusions of the study is that the vaccines do work to buy valence specific valent vaccine work to lower the incidence of covid right they work that this is not a the study is not saying that in that ultimate conclusion should be taken into account the question is whether at a certain point requiring or suggesting that people get multiple vaccines at a certain point that they're whether there is diminishing returns so there's we should distinguish between getting a vaccine or incrementally boosted versus a certain volume that seems to have an unexpected effect the paper also notes that this is not the only study to find a possible association with more prior vaccine Doses and higher risk of covet 19. during an Omicron wave in Iceland individuals who had previously received two or more doses were found to have a higher odds of reinfection than those who had received fewer than two doses of vaccine and an unadjusted analysis and it goes through some um kind of technical scientific reasons why this might be happening something called immune imprinting and some stuff with the spike protein that I think is beyond the technical uh know how of us here but it is being interpreted as validating some concerns and some anecdotal evidence that people have had that folks in their lives who got more vaccinations and more boosts seem to have succumbed to the virus more frequently than those people who only maybe got the first round or what have you again I could see for a very at-risk population or the elderly you might say well even if this is increasing the chance you get coveted honestly the odds of getting you know when a wave comes through you have good odds of getting it anyway you want if you're an elderly person or immuno compromised person the protection from the dose is more important than some slightly increased odds that you would get it in the first place the odds being that you were going to get it anyway however to you know to repeatedly boost younger people who are healthy otherwise over and over again they might be saying well you know if I get it I get it but I'd rather not I'd rather not increase my risk of getting it because if I get it I'm probably gonna not have such a bad time with it and maybe I was you know you were maybe you were vaccinated originally and we're just talking about subsequent doses or maybe you had it before they're actually in this paper it does say that um the multivariate analysis also found the more recent the last prior covet episode the lower risk of covid saying again that's the you know some kind of enduring natural immunity um and I just keep thinking how you know the the places in our society that are still trying to take this decision away from individuals like University campuses where the bivalent some of them is going to be required still in the fall uh that that can like how how naive and and and and unscientific it is to take that decision out of out of people and their doctors and then also the kind of the attempts to suppress um criticism of vaccines you know calling it all misinformation that has occurred online and and Elsewhere for the last three years so short-sighted so a couple of things first it should be noted that this was an unexpected observation in this study and they in the study say that the it needs to be steady further uh so that is you know it's we We I Wouldn't draw too many hard and fast conclusions though I take Jimmy Dora's point that it does feel like if there is in fact a negative result like making people more vulnerable to getting covered and they're just saying well we should have studied this more I can understand people feeling like they are guinea pigs in this situation right that there there should have been more of this kind of research that happened earlier but there was a real hesitancy to do so when we were in the throes of the pandemic but it's also worth noting that the objective or the biggest gain of getting vaccinated we've now known for a long time is preventing hospitalization so this study is talking about whether or not people are more susceptible to access coming to the virus but there's a whole separate conversation about whether or not it's preventing you from having the worst outcomes here so for young people who already tend not to have the worst outcomes I think that's a really interesting question that you're raising about college campuses and the like for even older people there could be a calculation that says sure you might be this percent more likely to catch covid than you might not if you had gotten multiple boosters but if you hadn't gotten boosted you might end up in the hospital or be more likely to die so it's better just to basically like take on more softer waves than to wait for the one big one to take this is yet more or this is another point of data in the column of the group of people for which it is least justifiable if you think it's justifiable at all to require them to get vaccinated is actually the population where the the requirements were most likely school-aged populations sure yeah and I that's just that's so people are going to feel I think so gaslit about all this stuff saying again the the initial promise may be implicitly I guess but a lot of people in the media reported it was that everybody has to get vaccinated we're really encouraging it where we're not requiring it outright we're encouraging it because this is how we're going to stop the spread and we're going to you know get rid of covid because when we have her immunity because you're no longer going to be able to transmit it or get it when you're vaccinated that didn't pan out and like on and on and on and on and on yeah that I I you know not under selling the vaccines I understand that they are the findings are still that they're very protective against severe decent disease and death for at-risk populations but the the logic of the requirements was really for the public health rationale was really on stopping cases yeah I totally get get that and I agree that that was the rationale but it hasn't been out for some time yeah and so I just think from a public health perspective as people are considering these kind of studies it's important to really emphasize that the goal the stated goal for some time now has been to prevent hospitalization and death and that vaccines including this study show that there is a significant benefit when the vaccine is correlated to the stream that's happening it does effectively lower hospitalization uh in depth here right but again you could have a more targeted even based on this study you could say are you in this risk category yeah look at this study you would benefit from vaccination on net you would benefit because even if you're increasing your likelihood of getting covid the protection is is important for severe indices and death you are in this this categorization you're a healthy young person and really all you're doing by getting you know your fifth or something dose is making it a slightly more likely you're going to get covered or whatever it is and that doesn't make as much sense for you and and we and we have not had that Approach at all and people are going to feel anything just valuably outraged and I think that people like Jimmy Dore who are saying well where was all this research why hasn't there been more research about what's going on with covid I think are completely right and I think there also needs to be a sensitivity to and frustration about the lack of research with respect to Long covet as well whatever you think about it the or whether or not it's credible or whether you're skeptical about how how real it is as a phenomenon the reality is that we are out of ignorance about what's going on allowing the government to basically ratchet back any protections any long-term health care support for people with long covet any way to protect protect themselves against it and also insulating the manufacturers of vaccines from any liability there's a whole mixed bag of shielding that's happening for people who are going to have outcomes one way or the other and I do think that before we are overly interested in saying well I don't think that long covet is a thing because it's being used as a pretext for the government to have overreach also downplaying the possibility of long covet having this effect that's being used as an excuse for the government to not have any responsibility for policies that may have set up a significant portion of the American public to be dealing with a crisis a Health crisis where we don't have Universal Health Care long after the government has washed its hands of all of it well I mean as you know I remain um extremely skeptical of a lot of long-covered claims however if and I I don't know what should be studied I mean it should be studied and I don't really know what people who are very worried about law and covid I'm not sure what the state of their claims are with respect to like is it worse if you've gotten a more coveted more times or is it is it correlated with the severity of the infection severity of so if you've gotten it if you get covered a bunch of times but none of them were severe you're not going to get it's no it's also correlated with a number so that's what I'm getting at so so a vaccine that makes you if you're again in a population where you're not at severe risk of it's going to make you more likely to get it maybe from a long coveted perspective that is I mean that kind of cuts both ways but that's why I agree with everyone who's looking for profound scripture more more more research and more studies and I do think there is a real issue with there being so much delay here in getting some of this kind of information out well we'll have more Rising right after this foreign [Music]

Covid-19 vaccination can induce multiple sclerosis via cross-reactive CD4+ T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and myelin peptides

https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/pt/covidwho-2138820?lang=en

Both natural infection and the mRNA based vaccinations can be accompanied by transient autoimmune phenomena,

or onset of autoimmune diseases. 

Objective

Two cases of multiple sclerosis (MS),

with clinical and new radiological signs,

beginning in close temporal relation to spike (S) protein mRNA based vaccinations. 

Aim

The onset of MS in these two cases is very likely caused by CD4+ T cell clones,

that cross-recognize SARSCoV- 2 S protein,

from myelin proteins.

Method

Spike specific CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood,

and CD4+ T cells from CSF sample were isolated,

then underwent autoantigen screening test. 

(An endogenous antigen that stimulates the production of autoantibodies)

A list of well-known MS related autoantigens,

Result(s)

Self-reactive T cells were detected from Spike specific T cell population,

also showed reactivity to MBP, MOG, (Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) peptides PLP peptide pools.

Multiple sclerosis and myelin basic protein: insights into protein disorder and disease

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8810476/

Myelin basic protein (MBP) is an abundant protein in central nervous system (CNS) myelin. 

MBP has long been studied as a factor in the pathogenesis of the autoimmune neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis (MS). 

MS is characterized by CNS inflammation, demyelination, and axonal loss.

Finally, 

we found proinflammatory T cell clones,

that recognize both Spike protein and immunodominant Myelin basic protein peptides,

and Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptides, which have previously been implicated in MS.

Conclusion(s) 

Detailed studies of both peripheral blood, and CSF derived CD4+ T cells show that the onset of MS in these two cases is very likely caused by CD4+ T cell clones that cross-recognize SARS-CoV-2 S protein derived peptides and peptides derived from myelin proteins, which have previously been implicated in MS.

Posts misrepresent research on multiple sclerosis and COVID-19 vaccines found in WHO database

https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-WHO-COVID-multiple-sclerosis-591321248797

New diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in the setting of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine exposure (January 2022)

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34922126/

Multiple sclerosis (MS) with onset in the setting of acute SARS-CoV-2 virus infection has been reported,
 
and reactivation of MS following non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccination has been noted, 

There have been three reports of newly diagnosed MS following exposure to mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. 

The association cannot be determined to be causal,

We report a series of 5 cases of newly diagnosed MS following recent exposure to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. 

Latency from vaccination to initial presentation varied. 
Neurological manifestations and clinical course appeared to be typical for MS,

including response to high dose steroids

Conclusion 

Acute neurological deficits in the setting of recent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine administration may represent new onset multiple sclerosis.

We are concerned that Parliament has not discussed and will not have a say on the 307 proposed amendments to the International Health Regulations, 

AND the amendments to 5 Articles of the IHR that were ADOPTED by the 75th World Health Assembly on 27 May 2022.",2023-05-29,1359226,53528,13367,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg, well a warm welcome to today's talk Monday the 29th of May now last week the World Health Organization put out a release showing that there was a possible cause or relationship between covid-19 vaccine and multiple sclerosis and we're allowed to report on this because it is an official who paper we're limited to other things we can report but we can report this now this is the paper here now um it says covid-19 vaccination can induce multiple sclerosis via cross reactivity with t helper cells so quite a mission from the World Health Organization now this isn't available on quite a few servers now but I've got DuckDuckGo on my um on my desktop so I could find it again but that's that's that's it there and it is as I say who publication so we can actually talk about this nice to be able to talk about things now what is this actually uh showing what what is going on here well I'm going to sort of do a quick explanation of what seems to be going on so what we have here imagine this is a nerve fiber here so the nerve that the nerve impulses will travel down here and this will be in the brain or the spinal cord and these nerve fibers are surrounded by this protective myelin sheath and in the nest central nervous system they're made by cells called oligodendrocytes here we have the spike protein from a natural uh SARS coronavirus II infection and here we have the spike protein produced by the vaccine on its own now in learning to recognize this is the CD4 lymphocyte here the T helper cell this is the famous tea helper cell that's disordered in um in HIV so when people become immunocompromised in AIDS acquired immunodeficiency syndrome what actually happens is is the virus destroys a lot of the CD4 helper cells until they can't produce any immune response but here it's not lack of immune response it's too much immune response that is the uh the problem so the CD4 is learning to recognize rightly as in the principles of vaccination these uh these Spike proteins and it can beat up these Spike proteins which of course is is good these are the spike proteins produced by the vaccine and the idea is that will help the CDL CD helper cells to get rid of the spike protein should there be a natural infection which we could argue about but the point is the same sort of chemical profile that we're finding on the surface of the spike protein um molecules there we're finding very similar proteins on the surface of the well there are very similar proteins on the surface of the myelin sheath so the T helper cells are also orchestrating a response which beats up on these myelin sheaths and when the myelin sheaths go in central nervous system um that is multiple sclerosis the myelin sheaths of course are essential they facilitate what we call bouncing transmission much faster so-called salutatory transmission of nerve fibers the nourish protect the protect the nerve fiber so without them basically you get progressive paralysis that is the main feature with multiple sclerosis and I've looked after many hundreds I guess of multiple sclerosis patients so over the years horrible debilitating disease although with a very varying path so that's what seems to be happening and that's reporting on this paper so if you can't find it on Safari or something do do try Duck Duck Go because that's where I got it I actually started to prep this about three days ago and when I went and clicked on it this morning it just wasn't there you know one of those can't find it sort of make messages anyway let's look at a little more detail now because it's a pretty significant paper and it's not only showing what this this particular autoimmune reaction is to Multiple Sclerosis but is there other autoimmune reactions well the one I'm allowed to talk about is is this one because it's a who publication um you get the impression it's probably been taken down from some other servers um but hey what do I know now this is the paper here uh covid-19 vaccination can induce now this is the this is the who so Canon juice multiple sclerosis via cross-reactive T helper uh CD4 Health cells recognizing SARS coronavirus to Spike protein and as we've said myelin this essential myelin that protects the cells in the central nervous system now the article goes on both natural infection and mRNA vaccine based vaccinations can be accompanied by transient autoimmune phenomena now this is pretty significant in itself because here we have the who actually admitting that uh SARS coronavirus 2 vaccines can cause autoimmune phenomena this is actually a pretty big breakthrough um let's hope this paper stays up because it really is quite a groundbreaking piece and I am live from the who website now via Duck Duck Go uh and uh and um I can't remember the search engine now but just don't don't go anyway um do let me know if you find it under the search engines because I've had difficulty um so on set of autoimmune disease confirmed by the World Health Organization now here we have a test case of two multiple sclerosis patients with clinical signs and new radiological Signs Now what this means is radiological signs is the um if you do MRI of the brain and the spinal cord it's very obvious when you see multiple sclerosis because you have these multiple patches in the old days multiple sclerosis used to be called disseminated sclerosis because you get patches in different parts of the body hence the different uh symptoms in different parts of the body from different lesions in the brain and spinal cord but we now call it multiple sclerosis now they're saying it's a temporal relationship to the spike protein vaccine in other words the vaccine came first and the multiple chlorosclerosis came second does this mean there's an automatic cause or correlation no it doesn't but we go back to the title of the paper covid-19 vaccination can induce multiple sclerosis so the very title of the paper is indicating that there is a causal relationship at least that's the way I read the title of that paper how long it will be there for of course is a different matter um the aim of the study uh the onset of multiple sclerosis in two cases are very likely so the saying very likely caused by the CD helper cells that cross recognize SARS coronavirus to spike protein from myelin proteins now um Spike specific uh T helper cells from peripheral they found these cells in peripheral blood and they found them in the cerebrospinal fluid most of you probably know the cerebrospinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord all the central nervous systems in this cerebral spinal fluid is a shock absorber but it's also immunologically very important as as well and they were underwent Auto antigen screening now an auto antigen is is part of you it's a it's a it's a it's a it's part of you it's endogenous um but it stimulates the production of Auto antibodies so it's when one of your own proteins stimulates antibodies to beat up on your own proteins which of course is the the essence of autoimmune disease and that is what is happening in this case according to the who circular which is uh which is still there um um so they looked up a list of well-known Auto antigens in multiple sclerosis these people knew what to look for the results self-reactive T cells were detected from Spike specific T-cell populations so the yes the vaccine in that sense worked it stimulated the T helper cells but also showed reactivity against various proteins now this MBP we'll look at in a minute the MOG is the myelin oligodendrocyte protein now what that means is this is the um this is the central nervous system here's the myelin sheath and in the central nervous system this myelin sheath is produced by the oligodendrocytes or the oligodendron glial cells so it's a protein that's specific to these cells that are producing this myelin sheath the oligodendrocytes so these are specific myelin related proteins now I'm just going to give a quick this is papers in parenthesis here but um this is just to give a some insight this is about multiple sclerosis and myelin based proteins um my myelin-based protein uh so this MBP that they found the cross reactivity to one of the ones so this cross-reactivity between the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and the spike protein there's also a cross-reactivity between this myelin-based um protein here it's a central nervous system protein in the myelin as uh MBP has long been studies as a factor in the pathogenesis and the beginning of autoimmune the auto neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis so this is not new science this is well established it is the cross-reactivity where the antibodies produced from the vaccine that is new and multiple sclerosis is characterized by central nervous system inflammation demyelination axon or loss and as we said Progressive paralysis so getting back to the paper finally we found pro-inflammatory T cell clones so in other words these the T cells were involved as as well um now it's the T Cell involved here just seems to be the T helper cells whether other ones were involved we're not told but anyway these pro-inflammatory T cell clones like the CD helper cell the CD4 cell they recognize spoke Spike protein and immunodominant myelin-based proteins in other words they're beating up on the myelin tooth as well as the spike protein and as we said myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptides which have previously been implicated in multiple sclerosis their conclusion detailed studies of both peripheral blood and cerebral spinal fluid derived CD4 plus T cells that's the C help Burton CD4 helper cells the T helper lymphocytes shows that the onset of multiple sclerosis in these two very likely caused by the T helper cells clones that the population of these cells that are developed the cross-recognized SARS coronavirus 2 Spike protein derived peptides and peptides derive from myelin proteins in other words it's beating upon the same it's beating up on the same similar structures a similar molecular structures in both of these areas beating up on the spike protein is good beating up on your own um myelin in the central nervous system is potentially a disastrous so um I think we'll actually leave that out there's more I'll tell you well we'll go on for a bit more there's always more there's always more to say but um um you've got the main effort so that's just part of the text I was working on before I lost before I found the new DuckDuckGo site uh now post misrepresent research on multiple sclerosis vaccines found by 2who databases now the fact Checkers have helpfully waded in on this and um quite a few fact Checkers it's obviously put the wind up them a bit um very good of these fact Checkers to tell us uh what's going on so we don't need to bother thinking for ourselves but I think we'll pass on it because I think we do like to think for ourselves now this is a bit of line because this is not new now this is a paper here this is another paper new diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in settings of mRNA covered vaccine exposure this is published published published in January 2022 so this is based on data collected in 2021. why wasn't this highlighted at the time why wasn't it highlighted at the time multiple sclerosis with onset uh with onset in the settings of acute SARS coronavirus 2 virus infected people has been reported so yes it's possible after natural infection and reactivity of multiple sclerosis following mRNA covered vaccines there have been three reports of newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis following exposures to mRNA covered vaccines so yes that is occurring in 2021 the association cannot be determined to be causal of course because it could be caused by other factors but it's temporal correlation whereas the new who paper goes further and says it's now lightly um we report a series of five cases of newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis following recent exposure of mRNA covered vaccines now this bit's a bit concerning latency from vaccination to initial presentation varied neurological manifestation the clinical course appear to be typical for MS so the time between people getting vaccinated and developing the features of multiple sclerosis varied there was latency how long could this latency be we don't know in these cases it was fairly short because of course the vaccines only started in in 2021 so these must have been within the course of a year are there more to come we don't know that not least we haven't been told that someone there's probably some information around somewhere um but there's multiple sclerosis responding as normal so their conclusion was acute neurological deficits in the settings of recent mRNA covered vaccination and administration may represent new onset multiple sclerosis so we knew that in uh 2022 and yet nothing changed incredible why won't the warned of these risks at a much earlier stage well the the research wonders but it didn't translate into um any meaningful findings right now just a couple of quick things um this is um petition if you're in the if you're in the UK you can sign this petition here that we're concerned about the new who amendments and some amendments that are going to kick in in just a few months that we didn't know about that have been kept quiet so if you click on that if you're in the UK you can sign that uh petition and when we get to 100 000 signatures there has to be a parliamentary debate albeit it's a fairly small one but there has to be something let's get up to a hundred thousand and um stop this uh uh these new international health things from the World Health Organization or at least not stop them let's have a parliamentary debate rather than rubber stamping it and the other thing I'll put a link in in the description as well but I've started a sub stack as well um don't know how much time I'll have to put on things but um you can put some I've put some quite detailed physiology and pathophysiology on there and um as well as news more news related items so there we go World Health Organization quite surprising really covid-19 vaccinations can induce multiple sclerosis from The Who itself um and I can tell you about this one because it is an official who site let's hope the who published more so I'm free to discuss more pathology a bit concerning about what's going to happen over the next couple of years in terms of prevalence but um we'll find out won't we we'll leave it there for now and uh thank you for watching

is killing everyone. The billionaires want to kill   us and the Covid vaccine is killing everyone. 
We're going to fact check this. And I want to   make clear for all of the different platforms 
that are going to limit me because I'm spreading   anti-vax propaganda. I'm about to debunk, debunk, 
debunk, anti-vax propaganda. Okay. Let's listen   to what Roseanne Barr had to say.
Speaker 3: You're all broke.   I'm pro Monsanto and all that crazy.
Speaker 2: So not even those are you and me.  Speaker 3: You say it drives me berserk.
Speaker 2: I have a You can   attack me in many things.
Speaker 3: No, I attack you. I'm just saying.  Speaker 2: I'm just. Yes, I know. But I.
Speaker 3: Want to.  Speaker 2: Straighten you out on something.
Speaker 3: Strange, man.  Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 3: Because you don't even   know. Okay? You work for me, and.
Speaker 2: I'm seventh.  Speaker 3: Day.
Speaker 2: If I want.  Speaker 3: To put your hand down 
right there, do it. No. Put your hand.  Speaker 2: There. What are you going to do?
Speaker 3: I'm going to cover it with mine.   And I'm going to tell you that I love you.
Speaker 2: Wow. What a 180 that was.  Speaker 3: I love you and I don't want to 
hurt you. I love your hand there. I want mine.  Speaker 2: Oh, that's right. Right.
Speaker 3: I love you. And I want to   bring everybody together to see they're getting 
screwed and robbed. Okay. Now, are we on the   same page with that? Yeah. Okay, now let's talk.
Speaker 2: All right. I have a lot of videotape,   and if I wanted to go into the archive, I could 
send you where I pretty much alone in media was   questioning the pharmaceutical industry and 
think people like Monsanto. I was the early   part of the century with the growers, 
right? Yeah. So I'm not the guy to hit   that for you. And you're for Monsanto.
Speaker 3: I was the vaccine shit.  Speaker 2: And I've been way 
out on a limb on that one too.  Speaker 3: You were wrong.
Speaker 2: I don't know   which one. I don't know what your stance on 
vaccines is. Why don't you tell me yours and   I'll tell you mine and we'll see who's wrong. 
They're trying to kill us. They're trying to.  Speaker 3: Yeah. That's why 
they're giving us the vaccine.  Speaker 2: I don't think they're trying.
Speaker 3: Well, they are killing us.  Speaker 2: Well, it's much more.
Speaker 3: Complicated than us.  Speaker 2: Who hates us? The 
pharmaceutical industry? No, actually.  Speaker 3: The crazy psychopath billionaires. 
Oh, boy. They hate the regular people.  Speaker 2: Okay, Bernie. So. But you're 
not one of the regular people. Look at   you. You're a southern belle. You're like in 
a Tennessee Williams play. And you're the.  Speaker 3: I've always depended 
on the kindness of strangers.  Speaker 1: All right. They're killing us. They are 
killing us. The vaccine is killing us. We really   need to take this head on, because this. This 
will not go away. This talking point will not   go away. Has even a single person died from the 
Covid vaccine? I'm open to the possibility that   someone has in the sense that when millions and 
millions and millions and hundreds of millions,   maybe billions of people get a vaccine, there are 
different adverse reactions. And could someone die   from an adverse reaction? Sure. But I've been 
looking everywhere for instances where someone   died from the Covid vaccine. I just haven't found 
a single instance. Right. We start looking into   the data. There have been rare cases of serious 
side effects. The JNJ vaccine was associated with   a rare blood clotting disorder, specifically women 
under 50. The AstraZeneca vaccine wasn't even used   in the United States associated with those issues. 
But have any actual deaths been attributed to   it? I wasn't able to find any in terms of more 
generally. There's this idea that if you're 80   and you get vaccinated and you die three months 
later, that that's a vaccine death. And a lot   of the vaccine deaths reported in the Vaya system 
are things like that. But can we attribute even a   single one to the vaccine? I haven't been able 
to find a single one with any vaccine. You can   have an anaphylactic reaction and it seems with 
the Covid vaccine, it was happening in five out   of every million doses administered. It's a severe 
allergic reaction. It can occur after a flu shot   or whatever. From what I've been able to find. 
No deaths from anaphylaxis were reported. There   were studies done of other sorts of reactions. 
The myocarditis, the pericarditis. Uncomfortable   certainly can be serious. I have been able to 
find no evidence that anybody actually died from   it. Now, you might. You might be able to find 
something. Hey, here's two people that we know   died from a reaction they had to the vaccine. 
Okay. Send it to me and I will look at that.   But Tucker Carlson pulled this as well, saying 
the vaccine could be killing thousands, hundreds   of thousands of us. I still have not been able 
to find any evidence of that. And importantly,   there have been population studies of large groups 
of people. Just here's a group of people the same   age. One group was vaccinated, one wasn't. The 
vaccinated group had a lower rate of all cause   death in the period following the vaccine. So I 
would love it if someone presented some of the   evidence. Roseanne Barr certainly didn't. Tucker 
Carlson certainly didn't when he brought it up.   If someone in the audience has the evidence, 
please send it to info at David packman.com."

Of course, it's not all that simple - at least not for the warriors over at SEAL Team Seven. Canine Handler Chris Cappa digs into his stance, and why he ultimately ended up leaving deployment in the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic, in this exclusive clip from Episode #174 of The Mike Drop Podcast.

alive so the contractor training company was there and hands down and me and the kennel master we do have a kennel master there he's an MA like most most at least most places in the Navy have him and we had to run a blue gold schedule because they didn't want us all there um and training you know we were kind of Off the Grid so no one knew we really existed kind of so we got away with you know doing what we wanted to do wasn't too bad to me it's fascinating and alarming that uh the whole Co experience had the impact that it had on our military well it got me out yeah forced me out really yeah I didn't take it no [ __ ] I I refused it in my uh EOS lined up and it was a complete and utter abortion and Alleyway for me because I had to put a religious R waiver in like most guys Kick the Can down the road long enough until it was my time to go and I literally made the choice I think I got out in like 61 days wow no plan no job no nothing no doubt no kids or two kids in a family just said nope this doesn't feel right guys I'm sorry it just doesn't feel right and uh and unfortunately it wasn't what the brochur said the experience anymore so it was taking my smile so it was time for me not good for you I I I applaud that I think uh how do you how does it sit with you now looking back and seeing the military saying hey if you want to come back in cuz you didn't do it you know you're welcome like how many of those guys are like [ __ ] you I'm not coming back in do you know anybody that's come back in no and all the guys were already at that point of [ __ ] you yeah because of how they were being treated the guys that were saying hey this doesn't feel right I don't think I agree with this I mean they got railroaded oh man I mean I know I know on the I know on the west coast they were pretty powerful movement over there and on the East Coast they just coralled these dudes in an office and said check in every day we don't care you know like it was you're black bald man like it was yeah they wanted you under ma supervision I mean it was what dude guys were for not getting the shot guys were fighting for their lives man dude what fighting for their lives dude it was crazy um dude that's that's embarrassing it's very embarrassing and uh it got to the point with me my wife and I were you know holding tight saying hey well we feel this way then we're being told it's time to get to leave yeah wow um but I I I feel like you like you to answer your question I feel like it's complete UT dog [ __ ] that they're going welcome people back they kicked out yeah I mean there's no way I would do it absolutely not matter of fact I'm going to come after you and probably sue you to be honest with you yeah I think I think they should yep uh do you know about how many guys ref like how many no [ __ ] active duty seals refused the shot and were forced out of the military I don't have that number ballpark dozens hundreds I would say dozens because I know in the West CO I think the the group in the west coast that kind of started it like Hey we're going to lawyer up this doesn't feel right it was a pretty big group of dudes I don't think it I think it was somewhere 10 or more and I know in the on the East Coast it was guys were on a daily mission like well if I don't do this and I got you know and that was another dozen two dozen dudes that were in a holding pattern of what their future was going to be and these weren't all like new guys This Is War you know veterans that were like this does not feel right that's absurd yep absolutely absurd yep um so all right so you play that game long enough to at least get out without having to kicked out got my got my honorable which was good did the the were the guys that were forced out for not getting the shot did they get other thanor I believe so or they're getting threatened with that I believe if not dishonorable because you were getting hit by you were not you were disobeying a direct order to me this sucks for two reasons right uh actually more than two reasons but the primary two are that I get the hey when you sign up like you can't refuse all the other inoculations and you can't be like no I don't want that like this is what you're getting you signed up that's part of the deal I get that where this is different is is that you know that's not one that you signed up to get number one and number two it's like you know I mean you can argue till we're all blue in the face about the efficacy or the lack of efficacy of it but the fact that it was you know essentially experimental it was rushed through it wasn't part of the program when you signed up you know it's it's kind of an oddball you know to me from a legality standpoint it's kind of a weird grade area that way like you know where I think it's the most disheartening is that you know to take guys say look like I could understand if the Navy said we would like everybody to get it but we're not going to force you to get it you know um you can suggest of sell to me all day long yeah but I have to have a choice yeah to to me that that is how they should have handled it to to legitimately like slap your dick on the counter and say if you don't get this we're we're kicking qualified combat veteran active duty Navy Seals out of the military because you won't take this [ __ ] shot to me says so much more about what what I've been bitching about since you you and I have have come in contact with each other since last night and just just the lack of overall quality leadership and the higher you go the worse it gets you know and to me this is as clear-cut of an example that exists uh you know of that um from morale standpoint from a an overall Community Vibe if you will you know you've you've gotten now how the [ __ ] is there a fly flying around in here especially in this weather Bryce handle that will you um the uh from your perspective having gotten out fairly recently um how would you characterize the overall morale of of the seal Community right now I have more conversations on a weekly basis with the guys that are so lost because they lost what they feel as a part of of them when they had to inevitably leave the sealed teams before they wanted to yeah um I was one of them and I think between that instance the situation we're talking about now and then everything else because the op Tempo isn't where it was and now everyone's so focused on I hate to say but like haircuts and shaves and stuff that I understand we join the military and there has to be some bearing there I'm not going to say we're special so we should get special but we should be focused on our priority and that's defending this country at the highest level yeah and I don't think that that's necessarily the priority all the time and I think from the the mafia you know the little E5 E6 Mafia it's um they're still going to be pipe hitters and they're still going to get after it but I think that a lot of guys are really looking at it like man it's not what the brochure said yeah and I think that it's it's heartbreaking it was for me it was really difficult to to make that transition out when I wasn't done I had plenty of left in me to give to the Navy um and uh yeah like I said a lot of my buddies it's a weekly conversation on what's next what do we do next how how do we navigate this space that we didn't anticipate being in and I found my you know found my silver lining s my found my light through helping others get out with what they're entitled you know to get out with so yeah it's it's low morale is low my friend let's just to put it in nutshell very low and I'm talking with guys coming off you know coming off the birds now from deployment and you know on my Coast it's we we got to get across the street we got to get over to the command like we're trying to we want we want them to take the next step forward you know yeah I mean I think from a from a again from a big picture standpoint I you know would would beg to differ a little bit in that uh you know it's called Naval special Warfare called Special Operations know you know so so to me you know whether you're shaved or not or you're uniform looks a certain way it's like yeah you're in the military but Special Operations are unconventional unconventional by Design correct and I I think you should you should always look at like I was saying last night you know to me the the simplest question that you should always ask yourself when you're deciding whether or not to do something is does it make us a more effective War fighting force the answer is yes do it to me if if you're expecting guys to be uh as Blended in and and as um kind of autonomous as possible within the military to go execute anti terrorism and and quick strike raids and unconventional warfare to me the smart answer is will let them from a uniform and and code standpoint let them be however they need to be to be good at that you know um I think being clean shaven with a high and tight has no bearing on that and and if anything you know the amount of time that you spend going through training and getting to that point is something that very few people uh obtain and and if something as simple as letting guys have beards and out of rgg tattoos and [ __ ] ponytails or Top Knots they look like Vikings or or whatever if that helps them feel more like a a Band of Brothers if it raises morale why not do it you know it's not hurting anything we need you back man we need you back bro
30,l84zftrMoyc,"More VAX, More Infection?! Newly Peer Reviewed Study SHOCKS Covid Logic: Rising Reacts","Briahna Joy Gray and Robby Soave discuss a new Covid-19 study. Originally aired May 30, 2023; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFx-d0SvOVg #covid #coronavirus 

According to the CDC, all COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States are effective at preventing COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can offer some protection from future illness, sometimes called “natural immunity,” but the level of protection people get from having COVID-19 may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age. Getting a COVID-19 vaccination is also a safer way to build protection than getting sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without you having to experience sickness. Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can cause severe illness or death, and we can’t reliably predict who will have mild or severe illness. If you get sick, you can spread COVID-19 to others. You can also continue to have long-term health issues after COVID-19 infection. While COVID-19 vaccines are effective, studies have shown some declines in vaccine effectiveness against infections over time, especially when the Delta variant was circulating widely. The mRNA vaccines do not contain any live virus. Instead, they work by teaching our cells to make a harmless piece of a “spike protein,” which is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. After making the protein piece, cells display it on their surface. Our immune system then recognizes that it does not belong there and responds to get rid of it. When an immune response begins, antibodies are produced, creating the same response that happens in a natural infection. In contrast to mRNA vaccines, many other vaccines use a piece of, or weakened version of, the germ that the vaccine protects against. This is how the measles and flu vaccines work. When a weakened or small part of the virus is introduced to your body, you make antibodies to help protect against future infection. According to the CDC mRNA vaccines do not contain any live virus. Instead, they work by teaching our cells to make a harmless piece of a “spike protein,” which is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19.

While COVID-19 vaccines are effective, studies have shown some declines in vaccine effectiveness against infections over time, especially when the Delta variant was circulating widely. According to the CDC layered prevention strategies — like staying up to date on vaccines and wearing masks — can help prevent severe illness and reduce the potential for strain on the healthcare system. Wear a mask with the best fit, protection, and comfort for you. If you are in an area with a high COVID-19 Community Level and are ages 2 or older, wear a well-fitting mask indoors in public. If you are sick and need to be around others, or are caring for someone who has COVID-19, wear a mask. If you are at increased risk for severe illness, or live with or spend time with someone at higher risk, speak to your healthcare provider about wearing a mask at medium COVID-19 Community Levels. In April 2021, increased cases of myocarditis and pericarditis were reported in the United States after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna). Data from multiple studies show a rare risk for myocarditis and/or pericarditis following receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. These rare cases of myocarditis or pericarditis have occurred most frequently in adolescent and young adult males, ages 16 years and older, within 7 days after receiving the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna). There has not been a similar reporting pattern observed after receipt of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (Johnson & Johnson). CDC continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination for everyone 6 months of age and older. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and CDC have determined that the benefits (such as prevention of COVID-19 cases and its severe outcomes) outweigh the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis after receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

covid-19 varied by the number of covid-19 vaccine doses previously received and the higher the number of vaccines previously received the higher the risk of Contracting covid-19 popular YouTuber and comedian who has been a prominent skeptic over vaccines and mandates throughout the pandemic Jimmy Dore tweeted FYI it's not a vaccine it's a failed experiment we are the guinea pigs all right take these findings with a grain of salt but this is interesting because the first this first came out earlier this year I think around February and there was a lot of pushback at that time part of the pushback was that it was not a peer-reviewed study it was just what's known as a preprint now we're talking about this again because it has been peer reviewed and the parts of the study that raised a red flag to some vaccine Skeptics are still there in the study yeah yeah go ahead yeah so the the the authors of the study note that this is unexpected like I don't think these are people who were these are not like anti-vaccine people who are setting out to disprove the efficacy of vaccines and so so they're saying there was an association of increased risk of covid-19 with higher number of Prior vaccine doses importantly and it was not because so you could rationalize why that might be the case well maybe people who are getting the most um Jabs the most doses of vaccine are people who are older and higher at risk anyway so then yes they're more likely to get coveted because they're higher risk so it would just be incidental that they're more likely to get a lot of vaccines and they're more likely to get covered but that's not one doesn't have anything to do with the other however that is not the case here as they lay out of the Cleveland Clinic they're like okay we see why you might think that but the um the yeah that most of the people in this study were young people some young people can be at a high risk of covet if you have a pre-existing condition but you would not expect that to be most of the people and so they're saying that that really makes this finding um unexpected um yeah the risk yeah the people despite this their risk of acquiring covid-19 the people who had fewer injections was lower than those who'd received a larger number of Prior vaccine doses so it's worth noting that the overall conclusions of the study is that the vaccines do work to buy valence specific valent vaccine work to lower the incidence of covid right they work that this is not a the study is not saying that in that ultimate conclusion should be taken into account the question is whether at a certain point requiring or suggesting that people get multiple vaccines at a certain point that they're whether there is diminishing returns so there's we should distinguish between getting a vaccine or incrementally boosted versus a certain volume that seems to have an unexpected effect the paper also notes that this is not the only study to find a possible association with more prior vaccine Doses and higher risk of covet 19. during an Omicron wave in Iceland individuals who had previously received two or more doses were found to have a higher odds of reinfection than those who had received fewer than two doses of vaccine and an unadjusted analysis and it goes through some um kind of technical scientific reasons why this might be happening something called immune imprinting and some stuff with the spike protein that I think is beyond the technical uh know how of us here but it is being interpreted as validating some concerns and some anecdotal evidence that people have had that folks in their lives who got more vaccinations and more boosts seem to have succumbed to the virus more frequently than those people who only maybe got the first round or what have you again I could see for a very at-risk population or the elderly you might say well even if this is increasing the chance you get coveted honestly the odds of getting you know when a wave comes through you have good odds of getting it anyway you want if you're an elderly person or immuno compromised person the protection from the dose is more important than some slightly increased odds that you would get it in the first place the odds being that you were going to get it anyway however to you know to repeatedly boost younger people who are healthy otherwise over and over again they might be saying well you know if I get it I get it but I'd rather not I'd rather not increase my risk of getting it because if I get it I'm probably gonna not have such a bad time with it and maybe I was you know you were maybe you were vaccinated originally and we're just talking about subsequent doses or maybe you had it before they're actually in this paper it does say that um the multivariate analysis also found the more recent the last prior covet episode the lower risk of covid saying again that's the you know some kind of enduring natural immunity um and I just keep thinking how you know the the places in our society that are still trying to take this decision away from individuals like University campuses where the bivalent some of them is going to be required still in the fall uh that that can like how how naive and and and and unscientific it is to take that decision out of out of people and their doctors and then also the kind of the attempts to suppress um criticism of vaccines you know calling it all misinformation that has occurred online and and Elsewhere for the last three years so short-sighted so a couple of things first it should be noted that this was an unexpected observation in this study and they in the study say that the it needs to be steady further uh so that is you know it's we We I Wouldn't draw too many hard and fast conclusions though I take Jimmy Dora's point that it does feel like if there is in fact a negative result like making people more vulnerable to getting covered and they're just saying well we should have studied this more I can understand people feeling like they are guinea pigs in this situation right that there there should have been more of this kind of research that happened earlier but there was a real hesitancy to do so when we were in the throes of the pandemic but it's also worth noting that the objective or the biggest gain of getting vaccinated we've now known for a long time is preventing hospitalization so this study is talking about whether or not people are more susceptible to access coming to the virus but there's a whole separate conversation about whether or not it's preventing you from having the worst outcomes here so for young people who already tend not to have the worst outcomes I think that's a really interesting question that you're raising about college campuses and the like for even older people there could be a calculation that says sure you might be this percent more likely to catch covid than you might not if you had gotten multiple boosters but if you hadn't gotten boosted you might end up in the hospital or be more likely to die so it's better just to basically like take on more softer waves than to wait for the one big one to take this is yet more or this is another point of data in the column of the group of people for which it is least justifiable if you think it's justifiable at all to require them to get vaccinated is actually the population where the the requirements were most likely school-aged populations sure yeah and I that's just that's so people are going to feel I think so gaslit about all this stuff saying again the the initial promise may be implicitly I guess but a lot of people in the media reported it was that everybody has to get vaccinated we're really encouraging it where we're not requiring it outright we're encouraging it because this is how we're going to stop the spread and we're going to you know get rid of covid because when we have her immunity because you're no longer going to be able to transmit it or get it when you're vaccinated that didn't pan out and like on and on and on and on and on yeah that I I you know not under selling the vaccines I understand that they are the findings are still that they're very protective against severe decent disease and death for at-risk populations but the the logic of the requirements was really for the public health rationale was really on stopping cases yeah I totally get get that and I agree that that was the rationale but it hasn't been out for some time yeah and so I just think from a public health perspective as people are considering these kind of studies it's important to really emphasize that the goal the stated goal for some time now has been to prevent hospitalization and death and that vaccines including this study show that there is a significant benefit when the vaccine is correlated to the stream that's happening it does effectively lower hospitalization uh in depth here right but again you could have a more targeted even based on this study you could say are you in this risk category yeah look at this study you would benefit from vaccination on net you would benefit because even if you're increasing your likelihood of getting covid the protection is is important for severe indices and death you are in this this categorization you're a healthy young person and really all you're doing by getting you know your fifth or something dose is making it a slightly more likely you're going to get covered or whatever it is and that doesn't make as much sense for you and and we and we have not had that Approach at all and people are going to feel anything just valuably outraged and I think that people like Jimmy Dore who are saying well where was all this research why hasn't there been more research about what's going on with covid I think are completely right and I think there also needs to be a sensitivity to and frustration about the lack of research with respect to Long covet as well whatever you think about it the or whether or not it's credible or whether you're skeptical about how how real it is as a phenomenon the reality is that we are out of ignorance about what's going on allowing the government to basically ratchet back any protections any long-term health care support for people with long covet any way to protect protect themselves against it and also insulating the manufacturers of vaccines from any liability there's a whole mixed bag of shielding that's happening for people who are going to have outcomes one way or the other and I do think that before we are overly interested in saying well I don't think that long covet is a thing because it's being used as a pretext for the government to have overreach also downplaying the possibility of long covet having this effect that's being used as an excuse for the government to not have any responsibility for policies that may have set up a significant portion of the American public to be dealing with a crisis a Health crisis where we don't have Universal Health Care long after the government has washed its hands of all of it well I mean as you know I remain um extremely skeptical of a lot of long-covered claims however if and I I don't know what should be studied I mean it should be studied and I don't really know what people who are very worried about law and covid I'm not sure what the state of their claims are with respect to like is it worse if you've gotten a more coveted more times or is it is it correlated with the severity of the infection severity of so if you've gotten it if you get covered a bunch of times but none of them were severe you're not going to get it's no it's also correlated with a number so that's what I'm getting at so so a vaccine that makes you if you're again in a population where you're not at severe risk of it's going to make you more likely to get it maybe from a long coveted perspective that is I mean that kind of cuts both ways but that's why I agree with everyone who's looking for profound scripture more more more research and more studies and I do think there is a real issue with there being so much delay here in getting some of this kind of information out well we'll have more Rising right after this foreign [Music]

Andrew Bridgen 
(North West Leicestershire) (Ind) 

Q3. More than two decades ago, the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, misled this House by promoting and endorsing the Post Office Horizon IT system as perfect, protecting the large corporation that created it and causing untold harm, damage and misery to innocent people. Can the current Prime Minister think of anything he has promoted, in partnership with huge businesses, as safe and effective that has ultimately harmed the British people? Will he use this opportunity to correct that safe and effective statement, or will he choose the same line as Tony Blair and sit back, do nothing and let the misery continue to pile up?

The Prime Minister 

We have been clear that the Horizon scandal is a terrible miscarriage of justice, and we are doing everything we can to make it right. To what the hon. Member was more broadly insinuating, let me be unequivocal from this Dispatch Box that covid vaccines are safe.

Apologies and correction from John
In this video I wrongly say the scabies mites (Sarcoptes scabiei) are insects, they are not and are correctly classified as Arachnida. This is because the adult mites have 8 legs, so are in the same group as spiders. Insects of course have 6 legs.

They are 0.2 to 0.45 mm in size, not 10 times bigger as I said, always important to put the decimal point in the correct place.

I hope to resume normal service in the next video.",2024-02-04,666855,53775,9596,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg, well welcome to today's talk it's Sunday the 4th of February 2024 now in my country we have something called prime minister's question time where members of parliament can ask the Prime Minister questions now this was the British prime minister last Wednesday the 31st of January not 2021 but 2024 just a few days ago prime minister let me be unequivocal from this dispatch box that Co vaccines are safe Mr speaker now I know that you'll be struggling with credulity at this point so I don't want to quote the Prime Minister out of context so let's look at the context now Mr Andrew bridgen asks the question and Richie sunak the Prime Minister answers the question let's just watch the whole exchange only lasts for a couple of minutes brid thank you Mr Speaker more than two decades ago the then prime minister Tony Blair misled this house by promoting and endorsing the post office Horizon it system as perfect protecting the large corporation that created it and causing Untold harm and damage and misery to innocent people can the current prime minister think of anything he has promoted in partnership with huge businesses as safe and effective which has ultimately harmed the British people and will he use this opportunity to correct that safe and effective statement or will he choose the same line as Tony Blair sit back do nothing and let the misery just continue to pile up Prim Minister Mr Speaker as we've been clear the Horizon Scandal is a terrible miscarriage of justice and we're doing everything that we can to make it right and to what he was more broadly insinuating let me be unequivocal from this dispatch box that covid vaccines are safe Mr speaker now your Member of Parliament May well have been if you live live in the UK one of those that was poo pooing Mr bridgen when he said safe and effective and he may your elected member May well have been one of the ones that were cheering when Mr Richie sunak said the vaccines are safe notice he didn't say they were effective this time but he did say they were safe now let's just look at some more information on this here now this is the uh the channel where you can watch that that's the official UK uh Parliament Channel where it's all available check out the link for yourself and we also have this document called Hansard which records everything and that's the link for that check it out for yourself can the current uh prime minister think of anything he has promoted in partnership with huge business as safe and effective but has ultimately harmed the British people so clearly Mr bridgen there is talking about the vaccines and gives the Prime Minister an opportunity to uh correct previous errors now the Prime Minister here is talking about the Horizon now this Horizon Scandal there was this terrible thing where postmasters were accused of theft and it wasn't it was the computer system goes way back to Tony blle you might have heard of him something to do with was it an invasion of Iraq or something like that something like that anyway um sticking to the point um this Horizon was uh Scandal was ignored but recently Von clean and the these poor innocent people who suffered uh greatly have been completely exonerated although not adequately compensated yet the analogies are there Mr bridon of course did advocate for the Horizon victims in his own constituency quite strongly at the time but again was poo pooed as he is now so he was drawing this kind of analogy there so the Prime Minister had this opportunity to say just a minute but he actually said this let me be unequivocal so let me be une equivocal and is I think when he said unequivocal is that the point where he banged his hand down and said this is unequivocal and this is from the dispatch box now in the UK that means it's it's this dispatch box that the Prime Minister talks from in Parliament basically is saying by the authority vested in me as the British prime minister uh covid vaccines are safe and effective sry that are cross out safe there my mistake um so there you go now I'm not just blaming I am cont CRI critiquing Mr sunak of course unequivocally I am um I think he's wrong but we have a we have his Majesty's opposition in this country that are supposed to say just a minute government let me get you in check here so Richie sunak says something K starm with the leader of the opposition should be on his feet in second saying just a minute what about way back to the Joseph frayman paper what about the yellow card data what about all the international data that shows unequivocal evidence of vaccine harms no nothing Ju Ju Just huray and they went on to the next point so there we have it that was the uh they were the exchanges in the British Parliament British prime minister 31st of January 2024 let me be unequivocal from this dispatch box that covid vaccines are safe unbelievable but at least it didn't say effective now just a couple of uh lighter points now to finish off with we did a video a few days ago I know quite a of you saw it on icin use in Africa and those patients that were treated with icin in Africa for the scab bees are just virtually cured I'm going to be showing some videos that I've just been sent a couple of days ago I might do them tomorrow don't think we' got time today um but um I made an error in the video so as always I'll come back to apology olog um so apologies and correction from from John about a mistake I made in that video in this video I wrongly say that the scabies might are insects they are not they are correctly classified as a Radia uh this is because the adult might have eight legs as spiders do so they're in the same group as spiders not insects and of course even someone who's done school biology knows that spy all insects have six legs uh and the might are actually 0.2 to 0.4 5 mm not 10 times bigger as I said sorry I simply put the decimal point in the wrong place so my apologies for that and um hopefully normal service will be resumed so my mistake sorry if I've misled anyone but the content of the video uh and the videoos of course absolutely valid totally valid IV mein uh in combination with hygiene and cleaning the clothes basically eradicated The Wretched curse of gab is from that family and with many others that's just one we chose to video from our community health project in in Africa now I'm going to read a couple of the comments from that video now as we've said before there's a whole qualitative research project in looking at these video comments if anyone bothered to do it but I'm just going to read out a couple of comments on the uh from the Iva meon and scab's video now this says um um I'm not going to read out the names of the commentators but you can look at it they're all there they're in the public domain during the pandemic I caught the Delta version of the size Corona virus to and was very sick Strangely I contacted scab the same week not wanting to infect my doctor I phon my doctor and managed to get a prescription of icin a day later I was better so excellent glad to hear that very strange coincidence getting skabes and Delta variant all at the same time although I must say personally I do keep Ivon in the house just in case I get scabies another one here um my brother Dr William Colby started the icton distribution program in the Congo Basin in the 1980s 1 billion Doses and not one complaint now this is doses given to human beings not to horses not to cows to human beings a billion Doses and not one complaint according to this comment I have noticed that there is absolutely no Co in the covid base and not even in the G refugee camp where there is TB and starvation nothing to see here can't possibly comment of course but um congratulations to Dr William Kobe for starting the Ivon distrib distribution program in Congo in the 1980s and there's many other comments I'm just going to give you the gist of one of them again I'm not just I'm just reporting what's been commented don't know if they're true or not can't tell it's just comments but they're in the public domain you can read them for yourself um I've had long covid and I've been on oxygen at 5 liters for 2 years 247 um and at some point this commentator says I found some 12 12 milligram tablets of irtin in 24 hours my oxygen saturation levels Rose to prec covid level my mind cleared overnight from the fog my ears are ringing and improving my eyesight is improved today I went to my old doctor to show him your video he already was ahead of me he prescribed 40 milligrams a day for two weeks but I told him I would like to try 20 milligrams per day because 12 migam rocked my world and increased the level if needed um a little more detail about the individual there this has been a miracle in my life no machine day or night and I assum he was referring to the oxygen concentration machine um and he also refers to some personal tragedy so they're they're in the comments there now of course I have no idea whether they're correct or not they're just comments and whatever you do do not take medicines based on what we say on this um Channel we do not prescribe you need to go to your doctor for that but interesting that those things are in the comments and again congratulations to Dr William kobby for His Brilliant work in the Congo eradicating things like river blindness and uh uh elephantiasis the massive swelling of the limbs the terrible blindness and of course huge range of other parasitic diseases and now almost certainly IA Ian eradicating um scab as well although scab Beast keeps cropping up because people keep getting reinfected so there we go uh let me know what you think of the British prime minister's comments and um we'll leave it there thank you for watching

36,UijQ-6jhVuc,Doctor Dies After Getting COVID Vaccine? Post Vaccine Deaths,"Doctor Dies After Getting COVID Vaccine? Post Vaccine Deaths

An Obstetrician / Gynecologist | Dr. Gregory Michael in Miami, Florida, received the 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Dec.18th. Shortly after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, he reportedly developed acute immune thrombocytopenia. Unfortunately, he died 16 days after getting the covid vaccine. Dr. Gregory Michael's cause of death results from a brain hemorrhage. Obviously, this is horrible. It's tragic, and you feel for his family.

---------------------------------------------------------

But it makes you wonder, was his death a result of the covid vaccine? 
And if it resulted from the covid vaccine, should that change your perspective on the covid vaccines? 
So I'm going to tell you my thoughts on this, but first, let's learn a little more about what happened. 
Pfizer is actively investigating the case.

Over 10 million people in the United States have received at least one shot of either the Pfizer Covid Vaccine or Moderna Covid Vaccine, the two authorized in the United States. Me personally, I received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, there have been about 40 cases of anaphylaxis, meaning a severe allergic reaction. Many people have had other side effects like sore arms, fatigue, headache, or fever, which typically last a day or so.

The Miami-Dade County medical examiner's office is investigating Dr. Gregory Michael's death, and as of right now, there is no official autopsy report. But based on the reports, let's see what we can make of his case.

Dr. Gregory Michael was healthy. He did not smoke. Did not take any medications. Never had any reaction to any medication nor vaccines. Then, supposedly three days after he gets the 1st dose of the covid vaccine, he developed tiny reddish spots, or petechiae, caused by bleeding under the skin of his hands and feet.

This prompted him to go to the ER. He gets blood work done, and his platelet levels are low, which is something called thrombocytopenia. Platelets are one of the components of blood clotting. If platelets are too low, it makes people more prone to bleeding. Normal platelet counts range from anywhere from 150 000 to 400 000 or so. People can have spontaneous bleeding, including internal bleeding, but that doesn't typically happen unless the platelet levels are less than ten thousand. His levels were reportedly zero, and because they're so low or absent, he gets admitted to the intensive care unit for two weeks. 

Doctors tried to get his platelet count higher as he had experts from all over the country involved in his care. Presumably, they tried several different treatments. Typically we give platelet transfusions, which is really a blood product that we're transfusing. But also give steroids, specifically glucocorticoids, such as salmeterol or methylprednisolone. If that doesn't work, we try other drugs like Ramaplastum or eltrombopag to stimulate the bone marrow to make more platelets. 

Sometimes we give immunoglobulins, sometimes we give a drug called rituximab, which is a monoclonal antibody. If all else fails, the last resort is to take out the spleen because sometimes a spleen plays a role in sequestering and destroying platelets. So they were actually planning on doing a splenectomy, meaning removing his spleen. Still, shortly before that, he ended up developing a hemorrhagic stroke that took his life in a matter of minutes. In other words, he bled into his brain. 

A sudden get severe thrombocytopenia to the point of bleeding to death because no matter what the cause is, this kind of thing is incredibly rare. I've never had a similar case like this in the intensive care unit. Some cases like this are reported with certain drugs medications that can lead to thrombocytopenia. As a result of drug-induced antibodies being made by the immune system, they attack the body's platelets.

#covid #covidvaccine #vaccine",2021-01-20,5714378,80898,21135,UCMSsLqxqvZsNXi0Z-VjN89A," hey guys welcome to another video yesterday i 
was seeing one of my patients in the pulmonary   clinic and she was asking me about my 
thoughts about getting the covid vaccine   she also asked me if i heard about the doctor 
in florida who died after getting the first   pfizer vaccination so this is something i want 
to talk about so there was an obstetrician   gynecologist in miami who received the first 
dose of the pfizer vaccine on december 18th   and shortly after receiving the vaccine he 
reportedly developed acute immune thrombocytopenia   he died 16 days after getting the vaccine his 
cause of death being a result of brain hemorrhage   or bleeding into the brain obviously 
this is horrible it's tragic and you   have to feel for his family but it makes you 
wonder was his death a result of the vaccine   and if it was a result of the vaccine should that 
change your perspective on getting the vaccine   so i'm going to tell you my thoughts on this but 
first let's learn a little bit more about what   happened pfizer is actively investigating the case 
but they don't seem to think that the vaccine is   the cause of this so far over 10 million people in 
the united states have received at least one shot   of either the pfizer or the moderna covid
vaccine these are the two authorized in the   united states as of right now me personally 
i received both doses of the pfizer vaccine   which overall went very smoothly now so far 
there have been about 40 cases of anaphylaxis   as a result of these vaccines meaning a severe 
allergic reaction none of which were reported   as being fatal now many people have had other 
side effects that are very common after the   vaccine like having a sore arm having some fatigue 
headache or fever and this typically lasts a day   or two the miami-dade county medical examiner's 
office is investigating this death as well   and as of right now there is no official autopsy 
report but based off the reports let's see what   we can make of this case so this man was healthy 
he did not smoke he did not take any medications   never had any reaction to any medication or 
vaccines supposedly three days after he gets   the first dose of the pfizer covid vaccination 
he gets tiny reddish spots or petechiae caused   by bleeding under the skin of his hands and feet 
this prompted him to go to the er he gets blood   work done and his platelet levels are low and this 
is something called thrombocytopenia platelets are   one of the components of blood clotting if 
platelets are too low it makes people more   prone to bleeding normal platelet counts range 
from anywhere from 150 000 to 400 000 or so   people can have spontaneous bleeding including 
internal bleeding but that doesn't typically   happen unless the platelet levels are less than 
ten thousand his levels were reportedly zero   and because they're so low or absent really 
he gets admitted to the intensive care unit   for two weeks doctors tried to get his platelet 
count higher as he had experts from all over the   country involved in his care now presumably 
they tried a number of different treatments   typically we give platelet transfusions which is 
really a blood product that we're transfusing but   also we give steroids specifically glucocorticoids 
such as salimetrol or methylprednisolone if that   doesn't work we try other drugs like ramiplostim 
or eltrombopag to try to stimulate the bone   marrow to make more platelets sometimes we give 
immunoglobulins sometimes we give a drug called   rituximab which is a monoclonal antibody if 
all else fails the last resort is to take out   the spleen because sometimes a spleen plays a 
role in sequestering and destroying platelets   so they were actually planning on doing 
a splenectomy meaning removing his spleen   but shortly before that he ends up developing a 
hemorrhagic stroke that took his life in a matter   of minutes in other words he bled into his brain 
now just because someone bleeds into their brain   it doesn't necessarily mean that they die but 
what happens is if the bleeding is severe enough   the pressure starts building up inside the skull 
and this is known as raised intracranial pressure   and this compresses the brain and eventually the 
pressure forces the brain down through the base   of the skull that big hole at the bottom 
of the skull known as the foramen magnum   when this happens the only life-saving option is 
emergent brain surgery where a neurosurgeon does a   craniotomy to relieve the intracranial pressure 
but his bleeding was so severe and happened so   quickly it took his life and his thrombocytopenia 
was not only severe but it wasn't getting better   despite all the treatments that they tried and 
this leads to the question why does a healthy   guy all of a sudden get severe thrombocytopenia 
to the point of bleeding to death because no   matter what the cause is this kind of thing is 
incredibly rare i've never had a similar case   like this in the intensive care unit now there are 
some cases like this reported with certain drugs   medications can lead to thrombocytopenia 
as a result of drug-induced antibodies   being made by the immune system that 
end up attacking the body's platelets   so drug-induced thrombocytopenia refers to 
acute immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and   it should be suspected when someone has a sudden 
severe thrombocytopenia so ditp or drug-induced   thrombocytopenia is even more strongly suspected 
when a patient has repeated episodes of a sudden   severe drop in the platelet count by far the 
most common drugs that cause this are things like   quinidine the blood thinner heparin and then also 
sulfonylureas like trimethoprim saltomethoxazole   aka bactrim and also there's other antibiotics 
that are fairly common that cause this as well   so it's not just drugs that can cause this 
but also certain foods herbal remedies and one   vaccine the mmr vaccine the risk of itp occurring 
within six weeks after getting the mmr vaccination   is increased however the attributable risk of 
thrombocytopenia within six weeks after mmr   vaccination remains overall low at one in 25 000 
vaccinated children now complications or long-term   consequences of itp in this age group are rare 
for the majority of children less than six years   of age the illness is self-limiting vaccines 
stimulate the immune system and in theory could   in rare cases cause it to mistakenly identify some 
of a patient's own cells as enemy invaders that   should be destroyed but with that said millions 
of various vaccinations are given every year   and clusters of thrombocytopenia don't occur and 
regarding the covid vaccine millions of doses   have been given and so far there are no other 
reports or associations with low platelet counts   so did the pfizer vaccine cause this based on the 
timing of things it seems like it but it's too   early to come to a conclusion one way or another 
we have to know all the facts and understand the   autopsy report but even then it's still not a 
guarantee that we come to a solid conclusion   although this is an incredibly sad story and even 
if it does prove that the vaccine did cause this   i hope people aren't dissuaded from getting 
the vaccine because this type of thing is still   very incredibly rare every decision we make 
in medicine is based on risk versus benefit   and when you compare the risks of covid 
and the risks and benefits of the vaccine   the benefits outweigh the risks for the vast 
majority of people in fact there are lots of   covet patients in the intensive care unit that 
have thrombocytopenia so that is something   else to put in perspective knowing more details 
about this case might help us to better devise   treatment plans in case this happens again and 
other people after they get the vaccine but   i doubt we're going to hear many more cases like 
this anyway that's all i have for this video   thanks for watching and i'll 
see you in the next one you"

38,_SeY5K8EgSg,Fewer people are getting the COVID-19 vaccine,"So far, only 7% of adults have received a dose of the new vaccine.",2023-11-20,1093,16,57,UC-RxXi2Xws6Uk22vp-sLbGA," Time now to connect the dots and we make the news make sense. The COVID vaccine was hailed as a miracle by many when people first started getting the shot nearly three years ago. But since then, the amount of people getting the shot has taken a dive. Fewer people are getting the latest COVID-19 vaccine. Let's connect the dots. The vaccine was hailed as a miracle when it first arrived. More than 90% of all adults got at least one dose of the vaccine. But as new updated boosters rolled out, the number of shots going into arms has scaled back. So far, only 7% of adults have received a dose of the new vaccine. That's compared to the quarter of folks who have gotten a flu shot. So what's behind the disconnect? Experts say it's a combination of poor messaging from health authorities and less concern about the virus itself. Doctors warn this could have a big effect on the population. Fox reports, half of seniors who are going to the hospital with the virus never even got a vaccine in the first place. Putting a strain on resources and that's connecting the dots."

Speaking exclusively to the BBC, he said he should not be associated with the anti-vax movement, but supported an individual's right to choose.

The Serbian was asked if he would sacrifice taking part in competitions such as Wimbledon and the French Open over his stance on the vaccine.

Public hearings for the Inquiry’s fourth investigation, into vaccines and therapeutics (Module 4), will be rescheduled.

The hearings were provisionally scheduled to take place in the summer of 2024. They will now take place at a later date,

There will be no preliminary hearing for Module 4 on 8 February.

Disease X is looming

https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/07/diseasex-pandemic-preparedness-cepi/

The world needs to be better prepared to tackle a future pandemic,

By mapping viruses with the potential to become the next “Disease X”, the global health community and governments can be more responsive the next time a pandemic looms

Global collaboration and adequate funding are needed to improve pandemic preparedness and ensure fast action to keep a viral outbreak at bay

“You can get a long way towards being able to produce something that will target a novel virus before that virus even emerges.”

“It’s a virus that we don't know yet, but we do know is out there, and we do know has the potential to spill over from an animal population potentially into humans, perhaps mutate or adapt itself and then begin spreading and killing people faster than we can contain it.”

… carrying out research and vaccine development for known viral “families” that could impact humans – of which there are 25 – would give humanity a decided advantage over the next Disease X.",2024-01-13,2447504,98881,16003,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg, hello warm welcome to this talk Saturday the 13th of January now I want to be talking about disease X in a minute from a small radio station in Switzerland called radio Davos I think it was more on that shortly but a bit of a disappointment first this is from the UK Co inquiry and unfortunately the uh public hearings for the inquiry fourth investigation into vaccines and therapeutic module will be rescheduled the hearings were provisionally scheduled to take place in the summer of 2024 they will now take place at a later date and then there's some rationale given there which you may choose to accept or not to enable organizations to prioritize providing evidence for the inquirer's third investigation into the impact of the pandemic on healthare well I would have thought um they knew what order this was in before they did this but never mind that's what they've said this is from the site here um this is from baroness Hallet who's the chair of the inquiry I know that the postponement of these hearings will be a disappointment for some yes it will and I think there's a degree of urgency as I'll point out um I want to ensure our hearings of uh in 2024 are as effective as possible well yes and I recognize the increasing pressure on organizations to respond to requests and provide information to the inquiry now I would have thought they'd known that when they scheduled the inquiry at the first place um maybe um they've had to reschedule this because there was some new information came to light we we we're basically not told which is disappointing but we are assured it's going to be finished by the summer of 2026 so let's hope there is time to squeeze in this rather important module because it's not on as scheduled unfortunately so I had been genuinely looking forward to that and it's pretty disappointing that that is now being delayed now I want to give you something from the mail online now that I'm just hoping they don't know more than we do about it because they actually say uh Co inquirers probing to vaccines is delayed indefinitely indefinitely they're saying well let's hope that's not the case uh as chair admits postponement will be a disappointment for some yes um hearing for the fourth module of this is from the from the mail online now hearing of the fourth module of the official inquiry to be what what it was set of the official inquiry were set to begin this summer a long awaited probe into the development of covid vaccines and drugs was today postponed and again they say indefinitely here so let's hope this is not the case baroness Hallet says I know the postponement will be a disappointment I wish to reassure you that we will hold these hearings as soon as possible good we'll look out for it uh but we're still going to be finished by the summer of 2026 so let's hope it's time now this inquiry has cost you and me the plait Ariat the pans so far it's cost us 145 million um quite incredible now um I'm going to talk about disease X in a minute but just before we do that um this is just a completely unrelated uh article I was reading in the Guardian newspaper from November 2022 this is Paul Burl who was a royal Butler and Paul borrow reported a conversation with her majesty the queen prior to her sad recent uh departure uh and Paul Bor reports that the queen said this Queen Elizabeth said this there are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge so uh it looks like uh there are powers at work uh but we don't know what they are so in Donald Rumsfeld terms this would be a known unknowns I guess now I want to talk now about disease X which is on this website here this is the uh World economic Forum site as far as I can uh derive disease X this is how we should prepare for the next big virus wow so uh this you can listen to it here or you can um read it there it's all very easy to understand while being rather uh difficult to understand now disease X um I've been teaching this sort of thing pretty well fulltime since 1990 I know I've been a clinical nurse since 1975 when I was a first year student and um I'd never heard of this disease X so I looked at some of my books because when I wrote my book I couldn't remember putting it in so it wasn't in there but I could easily miss it couldn't I so I did check in uh Reuben's pathology these are the definitive texts see it in there either uh so I checked in G and Hall superb physiology book not in there either um uh porth's pathophysiology um not in there either it's fairly thick book you think it could be in there somewhere um you get the idea not in that one can hardly pick this one up path physiology all these standard textbooks um not in there so it must be a new disease can't say I like the sound of a new disease we've had a new disease already haven't we anyway um this is just I want to give you some highlights from the um the radio Davos uh talk disease X is looming the world needs to be better prepared to tackle a future pandemic and you'll see here that the text is from the world economic Forum site um they go on to say uh by mapping viruses with the potential to become the next disease X the global Health Community and governments uh the governments and governments can be more responsive the next time a pandemic looms looks like they're anticipating another pandemic here Global collaboration and adequate funding are needed to improve pandemic preparedness and ensure fast action to keep a viral outbreak at Bay uh it says you can get a long way being able to produce something not quite sure what's being produced but you can produce something or other something or other that will Target a novel virus before that virus even emerges I assume here they're referring to repurpose drugs which could be rolled out very quickly and uh very cheaply and may be efficacious against a range of conditions maybe that's what they mean but anyway they're going to produce something um can't read too much into that all they say is something could even mean a vaccine I don't know whatever they mean there um anyway that will Target a novel virus before that that virus even emerges um it's a virus we don't know yet but we do know it's out there uh do we but we do know it's out there now unfortunately much to my annoyance and your annoyance I felt um compelled to delete yesterday's um video my apologies the the the trick is to live to fight another day um that's what we aim for but the video I was doing yesterday was examining a particular virus uh that was uh experimentally used to infect mice caused a disease of the brain and on at the end of the study none of the mice at the end of of the study were alive anymore none of them were alive anymore um because a certain event had happened to them that made them not alive um and that virus my understanding from reading of the paper was it had been it evolved in cell cultures in a laboratory so as a result of going through cell coaches in a laboratory the function of the virus had been uh had been increased it would appear it became a more functional virus there was a function and uh there was potentially um an increase uh maybe even a gain uh anyway but but um we know it's out there so they know it's out there uh obviously they don't know a precise geographical location but they know it's out there uh and we know it has the potential to spill over from animal populations potentially into humans well yeah there can be natural spill over vents of course there can also be other origins of viruses perhaps mutate or adapt itself and then begin spreading and killing people faster than we can contain it um carrying out research and oh and vaccine development carrying out research and vaccine development for no own viral families could impact humans of which there are 25 viral families they're saying uh would give Humanity a decided advantage over the next disease X so who who knows maybe the world economic Forum will be good enough to uh develop a vaccine for as great unwashed so it's all ready for us um I'll leave it with you read the article for yourself it's all there um it's all there yep from Radio Davos quite concerning really a disease X they seem to think it's coming um that's hope they don't know too much more than us we'll leave it there thank you for watching

ABC SM Wen has more on a new study. Looking at the vaccine's impact during those years, parents are regularly tasked with making decisions that will protect their kids. One choice is vaccination against COVID-19. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania analyzed over 250,000 medical records and looked into how Children who got the vaccine compared to Children who are not vaccinated. The vaccine was 98.4% effective against COVID-19 for those aged 11 to 20 from July to November 2021. When the Delta variant of the virus dominated the US, it was 85% effective for that age group from January to November 2022. When the Omicron variant dominated the vaccine was 74.3% effective for kids between five and 11 during the omicron. Additionally, they found that kids who received the vaccination did not have more heart complications than those who did not. Vaccines can keep your child safe from COVID-19 and can keep them from getting seriously ill if they do contract the virus.

56,8nD6Q9X0SFw,How COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines Work,"How do COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work? COVID-19 mRNA vaccines deliver directions, in the form of messenger RNA, or mRNA, so cells make the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This protein educates our immune system, so it produces antibodies that can neutralize similar versions of this coronavirus during future encounters. The mRNA-containing lipid particles are taken up by specialized immune system cells. See more: http://COVIDVaccineAnswers.org

59,RaLxhFiOBYk,Covid-19: Researcher blows the whistle on data integrity issues in Pfizer’s vaccine trial,"For researchers who were testing Pfizer’s vaccine at several sites in Texas during that autumn, speed may have come at the cost of data integrity and patient safety. 

A regional director who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has told The BMJ that the company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events reported in Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial. 
Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by the volume of problems they were finding. 

After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the regional director, Brook Jackson , emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Jackson has provided The BMJ with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails.

Covid-19: Researcher blows the whistle on data integrity issues in Pfizer’s vaccine trial
https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635",2022-03-16,3778859,69620,9764,UCrkhryqZABVzsGvfeAp0uIw, my name is Brooke Jackson I was fired in September of 2020 for being a whistleblower I was working on Pfizer's phase three pivotal trial on their covid-19 vaccine my first day on the job was the 8th of September and from the very beginning I noticed irregularities things that were questionable I would I would bring up the concerns to my managers and it was always or understaffed we're really trying hard to you know make this work you know at one point when I was going through emails there were emails from icon begging ventavia to follow up on severe Adverse Events that had been reported there were several emails about mislabeled specimens blood specimens and the nasal swabs there were specimens that were labeled with another participants information it was a nightmare and on the 16th of September I stayed late in clinic one evening and I was the only one in the clinic I walked into an area where the vaccines were refrigerated or frozen rather and when I walked in I saw a biohazard bag the plastic biohazard bag contained used needles and I realized how unorganized and sloppy ventavia was was handling everything in that same room where they uh where they kept the vaccine the vaccine was just left out and the boxes that the vaccine came in the containers they had written the subject information on these containers so right there you know me working on the study it unblinded me to the the randomization of these patients I made note of that I took pictures I took pictures to just to document what I'd seen to show my managers it was also discovered that ventavia was unblinding participants in the study based on a directive from our CEO which was to print out the randomization scheme and put that drug assignment in everybody's chart per Pfizer's protocol we should have immediately stopped enrolling but they never they never told Pfizer instead they wanted us to go through each of the charts and actually take out the randomization scheme that was printed so that coupled with everything else I made the recommendation for um been talking at a stop enrolling clinical trial participants in the study until we were able to let Pfizer know you sent me the photos thank you and I didn't I didn't pull them up I mean no granted that's I mean so I might should I not have taken the pictures the problem is is the breach of confidentiality and it was a personal thing because there's uh sponsor information on those boxes at that point it was clear to me that I I wasn't fitting in I decided that that next morning I was gonna gonna report my company to the FDA and so I did that about nine o'clock in the morning on the 25th of September and about six hours later I got a call from ventavia and was fired on the spot and told that I was not a good fit I remember investigator Cannon called me and we spoke for an hour and 16 minutes to be precise I can tell you everything that we talked about it mirrored what was typed in my formal complaint to them the unblinding the safety of the clinical trial participants not monitoring them for adverse reactions they were late to report Adverse Events again the untrained staff the oversight by the principal investigators specifically at the Fort Worth location the targeting of the employees for coming forward I thought that the FDA was going to swoop in and and and take care of everything what I was reporting was so important [Music]
60,K3odScka55A,Why you can&#39;t compare Covid-19 vaccines,"What a vaccine's ""efficacy rate"" actually means.

Sign up for our newsletter: http://www.vox.com/video-newsletter

In the US, the first two available Covid-19 vaccines were the ones from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. Both vaccines have very high ""efficacy rates,"" of around 95%. But the third vaccine introduced in the US, from Johnson & Johnson, has a considerably lower efficacy rate: just 66%.

Look at those numbers next to each other, and it's natural to conclude that one of them is considerably worse. Why settle for 66% when you can have 95%? But that isn't the right way to understand a vaccine's efficacy rate, or even to understand what a vaccine does. And public health experts say that if you really want to know which vaccine is the best one, efficacy isn't actually the most important number at all.

mRNA Vaccines for COVID-19. Vaccines are substances that protect you from harmful diseases. Most vaccines contain parts of weakened or dead germs that trigger your immune system to fight the disease. But mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 are different. They contain a substance, called mRNA, that teaches your cells how to make a protein that triggers an immune response. In order to understand how these vaccines work, it’s important to know what mRNA is and how it normally makes proteins your body needs. Most cells in your body have a “command center” inside them, called the nucleus. It contains genetic material, called DNA, that consists of instructions for building and maintaining your body. Proteins are one of the building blocks of your body. When a new body protein needs to be built, instructions for building it are copied from your cell’s DNA and converted into a “message,” called messenger RNA, or mRNA. Then, the mRNA travels out of the nucleus to a protein-building machine in your cell, called a ribosome. As the ribosome “reads” the “message” from the mRNA, it builds the protein your body needs. mRNA vaccines take advantage of this process to help give you immunity to COVID-19. Each vaccine contains special mRNA that provides instructions for your cells to build a harmless piece of the virus, called the spike protein. The spike protein is found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Each piece of the mRNA from the vaccine is wrapped in a protective coating. The vaccine is given as a shot in the upper arm. In the body, the mRNA particles enter your cells. Once inside the cell, the mRNA travels to a ribosome. Using the mRNA from the vaccine, the ribosome makes only a piece of the spike protein from the virus. After making the piece of the spike protein, your cell destroys the mRNA from the vaccine. It’s important to know that the mRNA from the vaccine never enters the cell’s nucleus or changes its DNA in any way. Next, your cell presents the piece of the spike protein on its surface. This allows your immune cells to detect the protein and recognize that it doesn’t belong there. As a result, your immune cells begin making antibodies as part of an immune response to the virus. In the future, if you catch the virus, the antibodies recognize and attach to the spike protein pieces on infected cells and the spike proteins on the virus. This marks them for immediate destruction by other immune cells. Like all vaccines, the benefit of these mRNA vaccines is that they give vaccinated people protection from the virus without having to get sick with COVID-19. Most mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 require you to get a second shot within a few weeks. Sometime after getting the vaccine, you may have symptoms, such as a fever. This is normal. It means the vaccine is working to make you immune to the virus. Vaccines protect you, your family, and your community from diseases that can be dangerous, or even deadly.

well over a decade to research, test, and produce. But the vaccines for COVID-19 cleared 
the threshold for emergency use in less than 11 months. The secret behind this speed 
is a medical technology that’s been developing for decades: the mRNA vaccine. This new treatment uses our body’s 
existing cellular machinery to trigger an immune response, protecting us from viruses without
ever experiencing an infection. And in the future, this approach might
be able to treat new diseases almost as quickly as they emerge. So how do these 
revolutionary vaccines work? The key ingredient is in the name. mRNA, or messenger ribonucleic acid,
is a naturally occurring molecule that encodes the instructions 
for producing proteins. When our cells process mRNA, 
a part of the cell called the ribosome translates and follows these instructions
to build the encoded protein. The mRNA in these vaccines works
in exactly the same way, but scientists use the molecule to safely
introduce our body to a virus. First, researchers encode trillions 
of mRNA molecules with the instructions for a specific viral protein. This part of the virus is
harmless by itself, but helpful for training 
our body’s immune response. Then, they inject those molecules 
into a nanoparticle roughly 1,000 times smaller 
than the average cell. This nanoparticle is made of lipids, the same type of fatty material that forms
the membrane around our cells. But these lipids have been 
specially engineered to protect the mRNA on its journey 
through the body and assist its entry into the cell. Lastly, the final ingredients are added:
sugars and salt to help keep the nanoparticles intact 
until they reach their destination. Before use, the vaccine is kept at a 
temperature of -20 to -80 degrees Celsius to ensure none of the components
break down. Once injected, the nanoparticles
disperse and encounter cells. The lipid coating on each nanoparticle
fuses with the lipid membrane of a cell and releases the mRNA to do its work. At this point, we should note 
that while the vaccine is delivering viral genetic material into our cells, it’s impossible for this material 
to alter our DNA. mRNA is a short-lived molecule that would need additional enzymes and 
chemical signals to even access our DNA, let alone change it. And none of these DNA altering components
are present in mRNA vaccines. Once inside the cell, the ribosome
translates the mRNA’s instructions and begins assembling the viral protein. In COVID-19 vaccines, that protein 
is one of the spikes typically found on the virus’s surface. Without the rest of the virus 
this lone spike is not infectious, but it does trigger our immune response. Activating the immune system
can be taxing on the body, resulting in brief fatigue, fever, 
and muscle soreness in some people. But this doesn’t mean 
the recipient is sick— it means the vaccine is working. The body is producing antibodies to fight
that viral protein, that will then stick around to defend 
against future COVID-19 infections. And since this particular protein is
likely to be found in most COVID variants, these antibodies should reduce 
the threat of catching new strains. This approach offers significant
advantages over previous vaccines. Traditional vaccines contain 
weakened versions of live viruses or amputated sections of a virus, both of which required time intensive
research to prepare and unique chemical treatments
to safely inject. But mRNA vaccines don’t actually
contain any viral particles, so they don’t have to be built 
from scratch to safely adjust each virus. In fact, every mRNA vaccine could have
roughly the same list of ingredients. Imagine a reliable, robustly tested
vaccine that can treat any disease by swapping out a single component. To treat a new illness, researchers would 
identify the right viral protein, encode it into mRNA, and then swap that mRNA 
into the existing vaccine platform. This could make it possible to develop
new vaccines in weeks, giving humanity a flexible new tool 
in the never-ending fight against disease."

65,iyo2UNQcdpQ,"Vaccination v excess deaths, correlation study","Is there a Link between the 2021 COVID-19 Vaccination Uptake in Europe and 2022 Excess All-Cause Mortality?

https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202302.0350/v1

(Western Norway University of Applied Sciences).

Conflict of interest statement

The authors declare no conflict of interest.

We primarily study a possible link between 2021 COVID-19 vaccination uptake in Europe,

and monthly 2022 excess all-cause mortality, 

(i.e., mortality higher than before the pandemic)

Analyses of 31 countries, Jan to September, 2022

31 EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Switzerland

All-cause mortality,

increased more the higher the 2021 vaccination uptake

Countries with more covid vaccines in 2021 had higher excess mortality in first 9 months of 2022

Positive correlation between vaccination in 2021 and excess deaths in 2022

A one percentage point increase in 2021 vaccination uptake,

was associated with a monthly mortality increase in 2022 by 0.105%

(95% CI, 0.075-0.134). 

When controlling for alternative explanations

The association remained robust

2021 all-cause mortality

Was lower the higher the vaccination uptake

Inverse correlation between previous covid vaccination and all-cause mortality in 2021

(this association became non-significant when controlling for alternative explanations)

Eurostat

https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/demo_mexrt/default/table?lang=en.

EU experienced excess all-cause mortality in the first nine months of 2022

COVID-19 vaccination has side effects such as myocarditis and pericarditis

JAMA Cardiology (1st June 2022)

A recent study falsified a suspected association between the two diagnoses and COVID-19 virus infection

Journal of Clinical Medicine (15th April 2022)

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35456309/

Post COVID-19 infection was not associated with either myocarditis or pericarditis

Vaccination uptake is the percentage of the total population that has received a “primary course” by week 52, 2021. 

The interaction between vaccination up- take and time passed in months since the beginning of 2022 is strongly significant and implies that the mortality increases the higher the vaccination uptake. 

Potential reverse causality

Could the excess mortality have caused the increase in vaccinations?

Concerning alternative explanations

We controlled for average all-cause mortality in 2020 and 2021,

divided by the average between 2016 and 2019

Relatively low mortality at one period is followed by relatively high mortality later, and vice versa.

We still observed a significant association between 2021 vaccination uptake and the 2022 monthly increase in all-cause mortality. 






Concerning ecological fallacy 

We are cautious about making individual-level inferences from our nation-level findings. 

Excess mortality, delayed diagnosis or medical treatment

We cannot see that the issues have been more prevalent in high-vaccination vs. low-vaccination countries. 

I.e., we do not expect delayed diagnosis or medical treatment during COVID-19 to substantially have induced omitted variable bias.",2023-03-22,908117,44847,7964,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg, what a warm welcome to this talk it's Wednesday the 22nd of March now today I'm going to be looking at a paper and this is the paper here I want to look at is there a link between the 2021 covid-19 vaccine uptake in Europe and 2022 all cause mortality not covered mortality all cause mortality and this study did find such a correlation now let's look at it now this is the question that's the paper now this is studied in this is paper this papers published in Western Norway University of applied sciences now in Norway they have certain freedoms that we don't have in Western countries we don't have in the UK or the United States for example in Norway you can actually camp anywhere so there's certain freedoms in Norway that we don't have in other other countries anyway getting back to the topic in hand um conflict of interest statements the authors declare no conflict of interest so I think we can take it from this that the authors are not being paid uh huge amounts of money by vested interest which of course is always good to check so no vested interest there the authors say we primarily study a possible link between 2021 covid-19 vaccination uptake in Europe and all cause mortality in 2022 so the correlating vaccines in 2021 for covered 19. and monthly mortality in 2022 now let's be perfectly clear this is a preprint this is not a peer-reviewed paper but I wanted to cover this paper because I think the possibility of this getting published in a mainstream peer-reviewed Journal is essentially zero leave that there I don't think it's going to get published in the peer-reviewed journal if it does I'll be very surprised and more certainly report on it but I think it's important to report on it now because this is the whole point of uh preprints they are papers for discussion and we're discussing it now um so I.E mortality higher than before the pandemic so this is taking the mortality in 2022 comparing that to pre-pandemic levels now the analyze 31 countries January to September 2022. they did point out the importance of analyzing the last three months in 2022 when they get the full data available for that is it just where that went up to 31 EU member states throwing in Norway Iceland Lichtenstein and Switzerland all cause mortality this is direct quote from the paper increased more the higher the 2021 vaccine uptake in other words countries with more covid-19 vaccines in 2021 had higher excess mortality in the first nine months of 2022. this is what we call a positive correlation between vaccination in 2021 and excess deaths in 2022 and they quantify it there was a one percent Point increase in 2021 vaccination rate so for every one point and one percent that went up basically the mortality went up by a tenth of a percent so the mortality in 2022 was 0. 105 basically tenth of a percent so uh I consider that number to be uh huge one percent increase in vaccination in 2021.1 percent increase in overall mortality in 2022. it's a huge number absolutely huge number when controlling for alternative explanations the association remained robust so they remained robust and significant now 2021 or cause mortality was lower the higher the vaccination uptake so interestingly in 2021 um we uh the more vaccines people had the less people died in 2021 but in 2022 it was the opposite but and it's a big but in 2021 when they controlled for other uh variables that became a non-significant effect so there was an inverse correlation between covered vaccines and all-cause mortality in 2021 but it was not significant after they accounted for um quite a few variations that they cleverly accounted for in this paper this is from data's from eurostat we've looked at this many times official European statistics check it out for yourself EU experienced success mortality in the first nine months of 2022 we've looked at that before no question that that is the case tragically tragically we're talking about um mortality here as if it's some abstract concept of course it's not it's multiple individual human tragedies and bereavements this is why we do this this is this this is of massive importance covid-19 vaccinations prevented SARS cov2 related Hospital admissions and deaths so there's evidence that in 2021 May 2021 and 13th of May so these are both may 2021 and given that these papers were both published in May 2021 they're dealing with um data from January February March mostly 2021 very early on in the pandemic the Alpha and the Delta stages of the pandemic so evidence that the vaccine was effective from 2021 and 2021 that's from the landsat that's from British medical journal so vaccines were preventing SARS coronavirus to related Hospital admissions and deaths specifically of course to SARS coronavirus 2 not talking about or cause mortality covid-19 vaccination are side effects such as myocarditis and pericarditis says who don't take my word for things well as always we give evidence evidence for myocarditis and pericarditis post vaccine this one's from uh Journal of the American Medical Association Cardiology a note we're now into 2022 so this is a year later so uh that this is six seven months later 25th of January 2022. so we can clearly see that times have changed a recent study falsified suspected association between the two diagnoses that's myocarditis and pericarditis and covid-19 virus infection so journal of clinical medicine that's that publication there they found post-covered 19 infection was not associated with either myocarditis or pericarditis so that makes us a bit curious about where the increase in myocarditis and pericarditis came from if it's not caused from the natural infection vaccine uptake is the percentage of the no this is how they've got the data vaccine update they took us the as the percentage of the total population that's received a primary course by week 52 of 2021 in other words this only goes up to the end of 2021. now here are the countries they studied and these are the percentages of the primary courses now of course all of this is in the article I just put this here to show you what a huge epidemiological study this actually is so percentage of primary courses by the end of 2021 and that's what they took their correlations from so low in Bulgaria going all the way up to uh Iceland and Ireland 76. 6 percent countries that you might be interested in you can see there of course the UK no longer a member of the European Union but we will be at that very much the higher end of this um and of course of course the accounting for population size needless to say their conclusion here of direct quote from the paper the interaction between vaccine uptake and time passed in months since the beginning of 2022 is strongly significant strongly significant and implies that the mortality increase and the higher the vaccine uptake so implies that the mortality increases the higher the vaccine uptake so the more people had vaccines in 2021 so that was uh vaccines in 2021 and this was a increasing deaths in 2022 there is a positive correlation between the two the higher the vaccination rate the higher the deaths the lower the vaccination rate in 2021 the lower the excess deaths um now of course these are correlations so they they rightly went on and looked at other things that could be causing this um potential reverse causality we looked at could it be the excess mortality that was causing the vaccinations well they eliminated that because of course the excess mortality came after the correlations and we know from um you know the the the need the need for uh temporal correlations that the cause has to come before the effect um but anyway They carried on concerning alternative explanations we control for average or cause mortality in 2020 and 2021 by dividing the average between 2016 and 2019. so the mortality data they were taking was from before the pandemic so that got rid of that variable relatively low mortality at one period is followed by relatively High mortality and later on and vice versa so in other words what they're saying here is well if lots of people died in 2020 you'd expect or 2021 you'd expectually expect fewer people to die in 2022 and the exact opposite was the case but they did mathematically account for that so we know that it's it's not that is not the cause of the excess mortality uh but even when they took account of this direct quote from the paper we still observe a significant association between 2021 vaccination uptake and 2022 monthly increasing all cause mortality countries with higher vaccines in 2021 had a higher or cause mortality in 2022. now they did acknowledge What's called the ukological fallacy uh now the the this would say that because something is true a nation is not necessarily true of uh of individuals which of course is is true and they acknowledge that they acknowledge that uh we are cautious about making uh individual level inferences from our nation level findings so very honest of the researchers there now excess mortality um caused by delayed medical treatment or diagnosis um which of course is the main reason given in the UK Parliament for the excess deaths that is caused by delays in medical treatment during the pandemic and indeed the relative chaos in the NHS at the moment which is true but um we cannot see that the issue the issues have been more prevalent in high vaccine versus low vaccine countries in other words delay in healthcare is is all over the place all countries have delays in healthcare but the correlation is still there when they looked at the um when they looked at the countries vaccine when they looked at the vaccination rates that one when they looked at that one the correlation is still there is still there so um they don't think it's caused by that and they actually specify this I.E we do not expect delayed diagnosis on medical treatment during the covid-19 pandemic to substantially over I've included omitted variable bias so they don't think it's that so there we have it it's very clear that there's a positive correlation um it's in that paper there the higher the uh the higher the vaccination rates were in 2021 the higher the excess mortality in 2022. so that's the end of this video I've nothing more to say on that now on a completely separate matter I've been um thinking of might go to the states and take up some uh start playing basketball no nothing drag I'd probably just start with Semi-Pro and then build up but I've been looking at the terminology and apparently um you have something called a slam dunk in basketball and this is a literally a goal scored in the basket by by putting the ball straight down into the loop with one's hand so that's a slam dunk the same points as a traditional basket but it's a show of force dominance and skill so a slam dunk is something that is a completely convincing as I say nothing to do with this today's talk um but I'll need to use the correct terminology for when I'm playing basketball in the states so do look out for me I'm quite optimistic about it but for now thank you for watching

Johns Hopkins Medicine says M RNA, that's a molecule that assists in making proteins, and some, if not most, of the COVID-19 vaccines are known as M RNA vaccines, and they help your body make proteins that mimic the COVID virus to help fight the infection. This bill obviously still needs a vote in the committee before it moves onto the House floor."

68,xnTVis4scUc,N.Y.C. companies &#39;blindsided&#39; by Covid vaccine mandate,"CNBC's Robert Frank joins 'Squawk Box' to report on how New York City businesses are responding to Mayor Bill de Blasio's latest Covid-19 vaccine requirements. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

New York City is imposing a vaccine mandate for all private sector employers as a preemptive measure to fight a surge of Covid cases this winter, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday.

The mandate covers 184,000 businesses and will go into effect on Dec. 27, and it doesn’t give unvaccinated employees the option to get tested regularly, de Blasio said. They must have at least one dose by that date. The policy applies to in-person employees who are in a workplace with other co-workers, de Blasio said during a news conference Monday.

The city will publish guidelines on Dec. 15 to provide more information on implementation and enforcement, de Blasio said. The outgoing mayor said he has spoken with Mayor-elect Eric Adams about the policy.

“We’ve got omicron as a new factor, we’ve got the colder weather, which is really going to create additional challenges with the delta variant, we’ve got holiday gatherings,” de Blasio told MSNBC earlier Monday morning. “We in New York City have decided to use a preemptive strike to really do something bold to stop the further growth of Covid and the dangers it’s causing to all of us.”

The New York City policy comes after the Biden administration was forced to halt implementation and enforcement of national vaccine and testing requirements for businesses with 100 or more employees to comply with a federal court order.

“The commissioner of health has the authority to issue a mandate like this to protect the public health and his authority to do that has been upheld time and again,” Georgia Pestana, the city’s corporation counsel, said during the news conference with de Blasio. “The trouble that the Biden administration has run into in court doesn’t really apply here.”

The city will also require everyone 12 and older to show proof of two vaccine doses – as opposed to one dose under the prior policy – for indoor dining, fitness, entertainment and performance venues starting Dec. 27 unless they received Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose vaccine.

Children ages 5 to 11 will be required to show proof of a single vaccine dose by Dec.14 for those venues, the mayor said. They will also have to show proof of one dose for high-risk extracurricular activities such as sports, band, orchestra and dance by the same date.

De Blasio said the purpose of the vaccination requirements is to avoid the shutdowns imposed in March 2020 when Covid devastated New York City and its economy.

“We cannot let those restrictions come back, we cannot have shutdowns here in New York City, we got to keep moving forward,” de Blasio during the news conference. “Vaccination works and vaccine mandates work, that’s the bottom line.”

New York City already has a high rate of vaccination, with 77% of residents having received at least one dose, according to city data. New York has identified eight cases of the omicron variant as of the weekend, seven in the New York City area and one in Suffolk County on Long Island.

“I’m sorry to say that you can expect community spread,” de Blasio said. “We have to assume it’s going to be widespread. We have to assume it’s going to give us a real challenge.”

“We’ve been to this movie before, we’ve been down this road before. We know what happens when we get a new variant, particularly one that’s highly transmissible,” De Blasio said. “We are not going back to what happened in 2020,” he said.

Covid cases are increasing in New York City, with more than 1,500 new cases confirmed daily on average, according to the city’s health department.

#COVID19 #Deltavariant #Coronavirus",2021-09-17,1314355,16242,887,UCG-iSMVtWbbwDDXgXXypARQ," [Kyle]: Welcome to this deep dive discussion 
about COVID-19 vaccines. I'm Kyle Allred,   and I'm excited to be here with Dr. Rhonda 
Patrick, who has a PhD in Biomedical Science, is   published in a variety of reputable journals, and 
is the founder of the popular website and YouTube   channel, FoundMyFitness. And Dr. Roger Seheult, 
who is a quadruple board certified physician, has   teaching appointments at University of California, 
Riverside and Loma Linda University School of   Medicine, and is the co-founder of MedCram. And on 
both our channels, we've been gathering the most   popular questions and beliefs about COVID-19 
vaccines, safety questions, efficacy questions,   potential risk versus benefit questions. And I'm 
really looking forward to both of your responses   because, since the beginning of the pandemic, 
you've been outstanding communicators about the   science and the data as it becomes available. 
You critically read COVID studies, you confer   with expert colleagues, and then you help break 
down what do people really need to know. And   you've also really focused on ways that people can 
optimize their own health and immunity throughout   your discussions. I think this is going to be a 
lengthy discussion and geared towards people that   want to better understand the data and some of 
the important nuances related to these questions.   So thank you both for being here today. Dr. 
Seheult, I'm going to send the first question   your way. I've heard some people say that COVID 
vaccines aren't necessary for relatively young   people who are in good shape and don't have 
medical problems. What are your thoughts on this? [Dr. Seheult]: Well, Kyle, as you may know, 
I'm a critical care intensivist, and I take   care of patients in the hospital. I work in a 
one ICU hospital in a one hospital town. So,   anything bad that happens, it comes to me in 
the intensive care unit. I'm the one that is   there when they put the endotracheal tube in. I 
put the chest tubes in, the central lines, and   holding the patient's hands. And so for me, in 
the last couple of weeks, this has become really   personal for me because what I've seen in the last 
couple of weeks in our hospital is like nothing   else that I've seen even with the prior wave 
going back to February and January of this year.   So, what is it that I'm seeing? 
I'm seeing patients in their 30s,   patients even in their 20s coming in with very few 
comorbidities, maybe just a little bit overweight,   and they are ending up on the ventilator. I've 
seen fathers in their 60s coming in crying,   asking me to do everything that we can 
for their sons who are in their 30s,   newly married with small children. We didn't 
see that back in February. And so, to get to the   root of your question, is what do people who are 
younger have to be concerned about? I think it's   a very good question because all of the things 
that we have learned about COVID-19 in the past   is now being rewritten by the Delta variant. So, 
if you look at some of this data, this is data   from Virginia, and you can see here on the left 
hand side of the screen in January is a graph that   we're all very familiar with. This is basically 
the monthly hospitalization rate by age group.   And what you can see there is on the right side 
of that first graph is it's a very high number for   the elderly, and it goes down very precipitously 
for the young. And that's because the young were   not being hospitalized. But as we go across 
this screen, you can see here that when we end   up in August, a very ominous sign is occurring. 
What we're seeing is that the younger population   are being hospitalized at almost the same rate. 
Maybe, instead of, you know, a 20th or a 10th,   it's maybe half of the rate of the elderly. 
And so why is that happening? Well, we know   that there's a very high vaccination rate in the 
elderly and a relatively low vaccination rate in   the young. Even look at the...you can barely see 
it, but the yellow boxes are describing what's   happening to pediatric cases. Pediatric cases, 
of course, those less than 12 years of age who   can't get vaccinated are skyrocketing. 
And so this is the concern that I have. We look at some of these other issues. For 
instance, this idea of the 99% survival rate.   That's something that they say. Hey, 99% survival, 
and I really don't need to be concerned about it.   So if you look at this data, and we compare it 
to something that we know very well like the flu   virus, you'll see here that the hospitalization 
rate for the flu virus in young people is about   0.01%. If you look at the pre-Delta COVID-19 data, 
it's about 0.2%. It's almost 20-fold higher for   COVID-19 in the young than it is for the flu. Now, 
if you think about the 1% number, you'll start to   see very clearly that if you start to think about 
there's only the 1% that are going to be affected,   that won't affect me, what we are seeing right 
now in this country, especially in states like   Florida and Texas and specifically Idaho, is 
an overwhelming of the critical care hospital   health care delivery system. Think about this. 
The population of the United States is 331 million   people. If just 1% are going to die, that's 3.3 
million people, and that's just the people who are   dying. Let's talk about the people who are sick 
and need to be hospitalized because they can't   breathe because of oxygenation. We only have under 
a million acute care beds in the United States,   and so as a result of that, you are 
going to quickly overwhelm the healthcare   system if you have a problem with an overwhelming 
infection. Let's take the state of Idaho. It has a   39.7% fully vaccinated rate, and what we're seeing 
there, as of yesterday, the governor has declared   that hospitals now because they're overwhelmed are 
going to start to deliver basically rationed care.   You should not expect the same standards of care 
that you're used to expecting in the health care   delivery system because they're just not able to 
give it. Let me give you some specific examples.   Instead of having one intensive care nurse for 
two patients, it's now going to be one intensive   care nurse for six patients with some help from 
non-ICU nurses. Because they're overwhelmed,   you cannot transfer patients to higher level of 
care for things that they need to get done if   they have very advanced cancers, for instance, 
because those hospitals don't have room. If you   need elective surgery, their elective surgeries 
are being canceled. Traumas are still happening.   Babies are still being born. These are the 
problems that we're having in a situation where   you may think that because you're healthy and 
strong and young, you're not going to be affected.   But if you were to get into a car accident, or 
you wanted...know somebody that wants to deliver   a baby and has a complication, it's going to be 
difficult for those things to happen. And so this   is the thing that's occurring. And going back 
to my experience in the last couple of weeks,   every single one of those patients in the 
hospital that were there in their 30s,   their 40s were not vaccinated. And it's 
based on information that's coming out   that you're making decisions based on whether 
or not you should get the vaccine because   you hear about side effects, or you hear 
about things, for instance, about myocarditis.   Well, here's an article from the new England 
journal of medicine, peer reviewed published   September 16th, 2001 looking at the Israeli 
data with almost a million subjects in each arm.   So what we have here plotted in yellow is the 
risk difference per a hundred thousand persons   infected with SARS-CoV-2, and in blue is the 
risk difference per hundred thousand persons who   received the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. First, 
let's take a look at SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19.   We see big risks here for acute kidney injury, 
for arrhythmia, for deep venous thrombosis, for   pulmonary embolism, and for myocardial infarction. 
And again, notice that there is a small signal   here in terms of COVID-19 for myocarditis 
and pericarditis. Clearly, there is a small   signal there with post vaccination myocarditis, 
and pericarditis, but actually the data here   on these from Israel is showing that it's more 
likely to get myocarditis and pericarditis   post SARS-CoV-2 infection. But in terms of the 
relative risks for the vaccine, which is in blue,   notice that the biggest one here at 78 is 
lymphadenopathy, which is a normal response   to the vaccine. Now there's been a couple of 
papers that are in the peer review process,   but have been published to a medical archive 
server. And again, the peer review process is   where the paper is submitted to experts in the 
field that review it looking for possible bias   or things that were not taken into consideration. 
And this pre-print non-peer reviewed article using   electronic records in the United States, also 
agreed with the Israeli data that was published   in the new England journal of medicine and came to 
the conclusion that young males infected with the   virus are up to six times more likely to develop 
myocarditis as those who received the vaccine.   Another pre-print, which is still currently 
in the process of being peer reviewed, made   headlines in a number of papers in the UK and also 
in the United States. And it showed the opposite   that the incidents of post-vaccine myocarditis 
had a higher incidents than hospitalization in   pediatric patients from COVID-19. However, the 
article glean most of its data from the VAERS,   which as you know, is a reporting system and 
raw data based on reports that could be made by   anyone and often contain incomplete 
descriptions and chart notes that require   additional investigation, removal of confounding 
variables and comparison to background levels of   medical problems to become useful. Now, we'll talk 
about the VAERS here just a bit, but as you'll see   various data, doesn't allow you to really conclude 
anything. VAERS can use to generate hypotheses,   but not to test them directly. So in summary, 
I think it's good for researchers to generate   hypothesis from VAERS data, but it's a problem 
when newspapers turn hypotheses of observational   data that haven't been peer reviewed yet and 
turn them into headlines. So it'll be interesting   to see what issues the peer review process 
points out in these papers and if they go on   to be published. So to answer your question Kyle 
it's, it's, there's a lot of information there.   Um, but for a young person now, today facing 
the Delta variant and maybe future variants,   it's not the same type of virus that we were 
dealing with back earlier in 2021. Yes. Now they   are more susceptible to getting the infection and 
now the risk of them being hospitalized is higher. [Kyle]: Dr. Patrick, what are 
your thoughts on this question? [Dr. Patrick]: Well, I think in addition to 
hospitalization, there's also the risk of people   who have mild symptoms who don't have to go to the 
hospital, they stay at home during the duration of   their illness, are coming down with post-acute 
COVID syndrome, which is popularly known as   the long-haul COVID. The symptoms range 
from brain fog to racing heart problems   to lethargy. And there's been a variety of 
studies that have come out that have looked at   what long-haul COVID is and what population 
it seems to be affecting. And interestingly,   you'd think, well, people having these long-term 
effects would be the ones that were, you know,   on the ventilator. Well, of course, people on 
ventilators do have long-term effects. But you'd   think people that are hospitalized would be the 
ones mostly having these long-haul COVID effects,   and it turns out younger people, people under 
the age of 50, teenagers even, people in their   20s are the ones that are really, you know, 
coming down with this long-haul COVID syndrome. There's a pre-print that has not been 
peer-reviewed yet, and it's a big study that   was done out of the U.K. It's part of this ongoing 
study called the Biobank Study. They get large   population sample sizes. In this case, it was 
close to 800 people. It was 780 or something like   that people before the pandemic came in and had 
MRI brain scans. Researchers have all this data   on individuals', you know, brain structure 
and volume. And so once the pandemic hit,   many people came down with COVID-19, some mild 
cases, some more severe, some were hospitalized.   And a few months, you know, into the pandemic, 
researchers doing this Biobank study thought,   ""Hey, we should bring these people back in and get 
a brain scan and see if there's any changes."" And   so that's what they did. Just, you know, months 
after their first scan, they brought them back   in for another scan. And what the preliminary 
findings, again, that are not peer-reviewed yet,   showed is that there are major differences in gray 
matter regions of the brain. Gray matter atrophy   is occurring in several different regions of the 
brain, very prominently in the olfactory region,   which makes sense because, you know, one of the 
telltale symptoms of COVID-19 at least pre-Delta   was loss of smell, loss of taste. And also 
there's atrophy in other brain regions   involved in memory and learning. People that had 
severe COVID do have worse atrophy compared to   the people that only had mild cases, did not 
need to be hospitalized, but they themselves   were also experiencing brain atrophy. These are 
people that did not have to go to the hospital.   And, of course, people were matched for the 
same age, the same gender, the same ethnicity,   and the same time in between scans, so 
trying to keep everything, you know,   as comparable as possible to compare apples to 
apples. To me, that was quite frightening because   it really suggests that there are 
complications, and there are, you know,   long-term effects of this virus that we don't 
quite understand and that are affecting,   you know, hundreds of thousands of 
people. I personally know quite a few. [Kyle]: Dr. Seheult, anything 
to add on the long COVID   front because I know...that's a concern that 
I have. At my age, if I got COVID-19, would I   have lingering symptoms? What are you seeing 
on your end clinically with regards to that? [Dr. Seheult]: Oh, yeah. So, in addition to me 
working in the intensive care unit, I also have   an outpatient pulmonary clinic. I've diagnosed at 
least three or four, just off the top of my head,   blood clots in patients who went 
to the hospital, had COVID-19,   survived, got better, so they weren't part of 
the 1%, but then they had persistent shortness   of breath, leg swelling. We immediately made the 
diagnosis and put them on blood thinners. And so   that's just a small slice of what we're seeing   in terms of comorbidity. So the 1% is death, but 
there's a lot worse that can happen up to that   point than death. There's a lot of bad things 
that can occur. So, totally agree. Absolutely. [Dr. Patrick]: To add on to the blood clots and 
strokes, there was this study...multiple studies,   one out of Israel, and a couple out of the United 
States, showing that people under the age of 50   were coming in to the emergency room for strokes. 
And one of the studies out of Israel found,   because they test everyone for COVID-19, 
a high percentage of the people that were   coming in for these strokes, these young 
people under 50, had COVID-19 and didn't   even know they had had it. So, I mean, we're 
talking obviously mild, mild cases, potentially,   even asymptomatic if they didn't even know they 
had COVID-19 and they're coming in with strokes. [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah, absolutely. And so this is 
the thing is that COVID-19 has many different ways   of affecting the body. The one that we 
all know about is the lungs, of course,   because it can cause inflammation in the lungs. 
But as Dr. Patrick points out, there are blood   clot issues. So blood clots to the lungs can 
also occur, but also blood clots to the brain,   which manifest the strokes. [Kyle]: Dr. Seheult, could you also speak 
to this question that some people have,   or really the interpretation of 
something that's on the CDC website   about death certificates and how only...at one 
point, only 5% of death certificates had only   COVID-19 on the certificate. I know you fill 
out quite a few death certificates in the ICU.   What are your thoughts on this idea? 
What can we really interpret from that? [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. So it really boils down to 
how the death certificate is filled out. Generally   speaking, the way the death certificate should be 
filled out when somebody dies is you have the most   proximal thing occur at the top line, and that 
would be...let's say there was a car accident.   Okay. You were in a motor vehicle accident, and as 
a result of the motor vehicle accident, there was   a rupture of one of the internal blood vessels, 
and then you bled out. So, you wouldn't just put   at the top of that death certificate motor vehicle 
accident. That's not what the bureau of statistics   of your state wants to see. They want to see 
ruptured, you know, pulmonary artery, and then   under that, they want to have the reason for the 
ruptured pulmonary artery. That would be motor   vehicle accident. So, when you are describing 
someone with COVID-19, COVID-19...you don't   die from COVID-19, right? COVID-19 is not 
a final cause of death. It may be the thing   that set things in motion, and so you would have 
COVID-19 caused pneumonia, and then that caused   something like adult respiratory distress 
syndrome or acute respiratory distress syndrome,   and that was the cause of death. Because, as we've 
just mentioned, COVID-19 can cause death in many   different ways. COVID-19 could cause you to die 
by a pulmonary embolism or a stroke in the brain.   Unfortunately, some physicians are 
just putting COVID-19 at the top. So I think, Kyle, what you're referring to is this 
statement that we see here on the CDC website,   and they say here that ""The number 
of deaths that mention one or more   of the conditions indicated is shown for all 
deaths involving COVID-19 and by age groups.""   ""For over 5% of these deaths, COVID-19 was the 
only cause mentioned on the death certificate.""   So people have taken that to mean that really 
COVID-19 only caused 5% of the 600,000-plus   people that have died in this country, and all 
the other things were just comorbidities. But if   you actually look at the CDC's website, you'll 
see what some of these ""comorbidities"" are,   and as we've just discussed the actual way 
that COVID-19 kills people. So, for instance,   the number one comorbidity was pneumonia. 
Influenza and pneumonia are grouped together.   Well, the pneumonia was caused by COVID-19. 
It wasn't a comorbidity. Another one that's   very common is respiratory failure. Yeah, it's not 
like people are coming with respiratory failure,   and they also happen to have COVID-19. No, 
COVID-19 causes respiratory failure. And another   one of these ones that was on there was adult 
respiratory distress syndrome. That's actually   what they mean to say there's acute respiratory 
distress syndrome. Again, another thing that's   caused by COVID-19. And so what's happening here 
is that, you know, these physicians are very busy.   They're being handed death certificates. They 
need to fill these things out. They think, ""Oh,   yeah, that guy, he died of COVID-19. That's 
right."" And they just write COVID-19 at the   top. That's the incorrect way of filling those 
out, and that's the reason why, fortunately,   only 5% of those death certificates are being 
incorrectly filled out with just COVID-19. [Kyle]: Just to clarify, using 
that data to make a case that   really COVID-19 is only killing people with 
multiple comorbidities is not accurate. [Dr. Seheult]: Not at all. [Kyle]: Okay. Well, Dr. Patrick, this next 
question's for you, and it's about spike   protein. We know that the spike protein can be 
dangerous and cause a significant immune response,   and there's this idea floating around that because 
spike protein is dangerous from the SARS-CoV-2   virus, therefore, the COVID-19 vaccines must be as 
dangerous as well. What are your thoughts on that? [Dr. Patrick]: Well, I have a lot of thoughts on 
that, Kyle. I've thought long and hard about it.   But sort of before I get into some of the details, 
I think, the spike protein has really become a   common household name. At this point, most 
people around the world know what the spike   protein is mostly because it's the entry point 
for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to get into our cells.   There are about 26 different spike proteins. 
I shouldn't say different. There are about 26   spike proteins that line the surface 
of a SARS-CoV-2 viral particle,   and these spike proteins will bind to a receptor 
on many different cell types we have in our body   that have a receptor called ACE2. And when the 
spike protein then binds to the ACE2 receptor,   it undergoes a conformational change that 
essentially refers to the structure of it changes.   So it binds on to this receptor, and it then 
elongates, and sort of twists and turns around,   and then it fuses with the cell membrane and 
is, you know, engulfed inside of the cell.   Another way it happens is through 
endocytosis. But essentially,   the point I want to make here is that 
conformational change happens because   when the spike protein initially binds to the 
ACE2 receptor, it's in a conformation called   the pre-fusion conformation. You can think of 
it more like a closed type of conformation.   Once it binds, this triggers a conformational 
change for it to, again, like I said, elongate   and sort of twist around. When it does that, that 
is referred to as the post-fusion conformation.   And the reason that's really important is 
because all of the vaccines that are available   in the United States under either emergency 
use authorization or under FDA authorization   or up and coming vaccines, so that includes the 
Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines,   the Johnson & Johnson adenoviral vaccine, as 
well as the Novavax vaccine, they all contain an   insertion of two proline amino acids into the 
spike protein to lock it into the pre-fusion   conformation. And this was brilliant work done 
by the structural biologist, Dr. Jason McLellan.   He's at the University of Texas in Austin. And he 
thankfully had figured out this way to lock viral   proteins into the pre-fusion conformation. First 
it was with the respiratory syncytial virus, RSV,   and then later, he had figured out for the 
other beta coronavirus, the MERS coronavirus.   And so he really had a running start there. 
And the reason that is so important is because,   when you're comparing the spike protein 
from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as I mentioned,   there's 26 of them on every viral particle, 
to the spike protein that is in the vaccines,   including the mRNA vaccines and the vaccines in 
the United States, it's a different spike protein.   It's a spike protein that cannot undergo 
that structural change. It does not elongate   and, you know, dig into the cell membrane and fuse 
with it. It's a different spike protein because of   those two proline amino acids that were inserted 
to lock it into the pre-fusion conformation. And one of the first things you learn as a 
scientist, as a budding young scientist is that   you can't compare apples to oranges. You can't 
compare two different things. You have to compare   apples to apples or oranges to oranges. And 
so when you're talking about a different spike   protein, structurally, it's different, right? You 
can't take a study that's looking at the spike   protein that is from the surface of SARS-CoV-2 
and say everything that that spike protein is   doing applies to the spike protein in the vaccines 
that are available in the United States because   it's different. And so, I think, that's a really, 
really upfront important thing to understand. And   the burden of proof is on, you know, people making 
the claim that the spike protein from the mRNA   vaccines is dangerous because some studies have 
shown that the spike protein from the SARS-CoV-2   by itself can be dangerous. You have to show that, 
and it has not been shown. So, what these studies   that have shown that the spike protein from 
SARS-CoV-2 virus, how it can be dangerous, there's   been some in vitro studies, which means cells in 
culture in a dish. When you dump spike protein   on them, it can cause the activation of cell 
signaling pathways that could lead to cell death.   This is often referred to as cytotoxicity. There's 
also been some animal studies shown where either   recombinant protein, which is just basically 
made in a lab, so they make the spike protein,   or what's called pseudovirus expressing the spike 
protein, so this is not the SARS-CoV-2 virus,   but it sort of acts like a virus 
to allow it to get into cells,   if you directly inject the pseudovirus with 
a spike protein into the trachea of hamsters,   it causes severe lung damage and also 
gets into the circulation and causes   circulatory damage and vascular 
damage to the vascular system. And so these studies, and there's been, you know, 
a few of those, have really spurred this idea   that the spike protein from the vaccines must 
be dangerous because these studies showing the   spike protein that's found on the surface of 
SARS-CoV-2 is. And again, you can't compare.   You can't make that comparison, and that's 
really just one aspect of, you know, this story.   The other aspect has to do with where the spike 
protein goes in the body. And, you know, I think,   first and foremost, anyone that's concerned about 
these studies showing that the spike protein   by itself is dangerous should be terrified 
about getting SARS-CoV-2 because, for one,   you're getting, as I mentioned, 26 of those spike 
proteins on one viral particle. How many viral   particles are replicating inside of your cells 
at any given moment? You know, thousands of them.   And on top of that, there have been studies that 
have shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus is detected in   multiple organs. You know, this isn't just in the 
nose and in the trachea and in the lungs, which   in and of itself is bad. I mean, the damage 
to your lungs is, you know, one major concern.   But the SARS-CoV-2 virus, again, with spike 
protein has been detected in the heart   in humans. It's been detected in the brain. It's 
been detected in cerebrospinal fluid. It's been   detected in kidneys. It's been detected in the GI 
tract. It's been detected in the testes. It's in   many different tissues in humans. Oh, and it's 
been detected in plasma in the circulatory system.   So, again, you know, the concern should 
be amplified for actually contracting the   SARS-CoV-2 virus if you are concerned about 
the study showing spike protein itself is   dangerous. And that sort of leads me into 
the vaccines. And generally speaking,   I'm going to talk a little bit more about 
mRNA vaccines because there's been some more   concern about that, and there's 
been some more data on that. But people are concerned that these mRNA 
vaccines are getting into multiple organs,   and therefore the spike protein is getting into 
these other organs and causing damage, again,   different spike protein. So, that needs to be 
considered. But a lot of this data stems from...a   lot of this concern stems from some data that was 
generated by Pfizer and BioNTech when they were   doing a bunch of safety studies looking at, 
you know, what happens when you inject really   high concentrations of the mRNA vaccine 
by Pfizer into rodents. And so, I think,   the first thing to keep in mind...and I know 
that at MedCram, you guys have had people on   like Dr. Shane Crotty who's explained how the mRNA 
vaccines work, how you have, you know, the mRNA   inside of a lipid nanoparticle along with some 
other factors like polyethylene glycol, and that   is injected into the deltoid muscle tissue, and 
that basically, after that injection into the   tissue happens, you have the lipid nanoparticle 
with the mRNA vaccine now getting inside of muscle   cells using your own cell machinery, the ribosome, 
to actually make the spike protein, which itself   has been shown to peak after 24 hours, and then 
after 48 hours, the spike protein, half-life of   the protein that's made is degraded. It's not very 
long-lasting. The mRNA itself also has a half-life   somewhere between, you know, 48 to 72 hours, and 
the lipid nanoparticle has a very short...like   within hours. It really only lasts long enough to 
protect the mRNA from being degraded. But once you   actually do make the spike protein, the spike 
protein itself is...it is expressed on the cell   surface, what's called the plasma membrane of 
the cell. And the spike protein itself has a   region on it called a transmembrane domain that 
sticks it. It's like an anchored...anchors into   that plasma membrane, so it is not freely floating 
out into your circulation. It is stuck there.   And at that point, you have other immune cells 
that recognize this foreign protein and begin   the process of, you know, making antibodies, and 
you have that whole, you know, immunity effect. But the concern was from this Pfizer study where 
rats were given a dose that is 10 times the amount   of what humans are given. So humans are given 
30 micrograms of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine   for one dose. The rat was given 50 
micrograms of the Pfizer-BioNTech   vaccine. So, if you were to do the calculation 
for a rat equivalent dose, so if you want to   give the rat what humans actually get, an 
equivalent dose based on their body mass,   it would be more like 4.86 micrograms. So they got 
50. That's essentially 10 times. Okay. And this   was done for a reason of, ""Okay, what happens when 
we give them a huge amount of the vaccine?"" Well,   what was found...the lipid nanoparticle 
that contains the mRNA was radio-labeled.   It's like a tag that you can visualize things. 
And that radio-labeled tag was found in other   organs. It was, you know, found in a variety of 
organs. Again, it was to a very small degree,   but it was found in other organs. And so people 
got really concerned that these mRNA vaccines were   traveling to other organs and causing damage. And 
a few things to keep in mind there. One, the dose   was super high, and, in fact, within the same 
document, the same Pfizer study, they gave a   more equivalent dose to mice. In this case, they 
give mice 2 micrograms of the mRNA vaccine, and   that vaccine did not go to all these other organs. 
In fact, the only organ that was shown to have any   amount of this radio-labeled tag was the liver, 
and it was completely gone after 48 hours.   And so, I think, that's really good news 
because it suggests, yeah, when you give,   you know, a rat 10 times the amount of what the 
humans are getting, you might have some spillover.   But on top of that, again, the radio-labeled tag 
that we're looking at is the lipid nanoparticle,   and if there is some spillover, you know, in 
the muscle tissue, what surrounds the muscle   tissue is your lymphatic system, lymph, where 
all the immune cells are. So you essentially   have your immune cells like dendritic cells 
recognizing something foreign, in this case,   a radio-labeled lipid nanoparticle with some 
mRNA in it, and they basically chop it up, and,   you know, it undergoes phagocytosis and is taken 
to other tissues for recycling. And so, whatever   we're seeing in those other organs, we don't even 
actually know if that's, you know, the intact mRNA   vaccine lipid nanoparticles. It's probably just 
remnants of it because that's what your body does. So, I think, all of those factors in combination 
give some reassurance that people should not be   so concerned about the spike protein from mRNA 
vaccines or from the Johnson & Johnson vaccine   getting to other organs and causing...you 
know, wreaking havoc essentially. And I will just add one more thing to that, and 
that is another study, and this is something   that I've seen concern about on the internet. 
This study was done in humans. It was a very,   very small sample size. It was 13 people, and 
they were given the Moderna mRNA vaccine. What   was found in that study is that 11 out of 13 
people, the S1 subunit of the spike protein   was detected in their plasma. Three out of the 13 
had the entire spike protein detectable. However,   the assay that was used to detect this S1 subunit 
and the spike protein itself in these 13 people   has a false positivity rate of 25%. That's one 
in four people, showing they have spike protein.   This was another study done, 
they took samples pre-pandemic,   there should be no people with spike protein 
pre-pandemic, and they were showing that they   had spike protein. So with a sample size 
of 13 and a false positivity rate of 25%,   you can't make any conclusions from 
that small study showing, you know,   that 11 out of 13 people had, you know, S1 
subunit of spike protein showing up in the plasma.   It just doesn't make any sense to make any strong 
conclusions from that. So, I guess that, you know,   the bottom line is that, you know, as Roger 
mentioned, we've had over 177 million people   fully vaccinated in the United States. You know, 
if this thing was causing severe damage in people,   we would know about it. And, you know, we do know 
about the adverse effects that are occurring like   the myocarditis that is happening, you know, 
in some young people. It's still quite rare.   It does occur. And, again, as Roger mentioned, 
it's happening six-fold higher in younger healthy   individuals than it is in the same individuals 
that are being exposed to the COVID-19 vaccines. [Kyle]: Well, that is a perfect segue to a 
discussion about adverse events and deaths   reported from the COVID-19 
vaccine. And, Dr. Seheult,   could you explain what VAERS or the 
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System   that we use in the United States is and 
how that data should be interpreted? [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. Thanks, Kyle. So, 
to back up a little bit, let's talk about   a six-month period of time here. So, if 
we look at December, January, and February   of just a few months ago, that was a period 
of time at least where I'm working in Southern   California where there was a lot of COVID. 
In fact, we had to build an entire new ICU   with isolation precautions. We had to have 
nurses trained. We basically used a lot of   resources because surgeries weren't happening at 
the time. And compare that with the next three   months after that, which would be March, April, 
and May. So, the reason why those two groups of   three months are very different is the first 
group of three months had a lot of COVID-19   patients coming in. We were very full. And 
then after that wave went away, we basically   disbanded the second intensive care unit. We 
were able to contract back to what we were   doing before, and this despite the fact that in 
March, April, and May of 2021, we were vaccinating   millions of people a day. And so, again, I just 
want to underline what Dr. Patrick was saying   there. If the spike protein from the vaccine was 
so dangerous, how were we able to contract down   our hospital ICU intensive care services during 
that period of time? However, what did happen   during that time was that there was a huge spike 
of...so the argument may be made, for instance,   that maybe the spike protein is not causing 
disease or conditions that would get people into   the intensive care unit, but it might be causing 
more mild symptoms or more mild problems. And   that might show up in something called the 
VAERS systems. Let's talk about the VAERS. So, as you can see here on the screen, there's 
this chart that has made the rounds on the   internet, and what it does is it shows the 
total reported deaths post-vaccine. And you   can see obviously not post-COVID vaccine because 
the COVID vaccine didn't exist back during these   years. And we're going back way back into 
the early 2000s. And then all of a sudden,   there's this huge spike here in 2000, and these, 
again, are reported deaths. So this is evidence,   some say, that these patients that are receiving 
the COVID-19 vaccine are dying. So, again,   I don't know how they could be dying without 
going through the intensive care unit. I guess   it's possible they could be dying at home 
and never making it to the hospital. So let's   investigate exactly what it is that's going on 
here. The thing that you've got to understand   about this reporting system is that...first 
of all, a couple of things. Number one,   you have to understand that because the vaccines 
that were given emergency use authorization   in the late 2020, because of this, they 
expanded the reporting requirements   for the VAERS. In other words, before a physician 
would make a report to the VAERS if he suspected   that a vaccination led to a death, and they were 
under suspicion that something was connected.   Now that was completely eliminated. Now, no 
matter what happens, if a patient gets a vaccine,   and anything happens, hospitalization, death, 
anything, it should be reported under law. So, I wanted to take a look at this a little 
bit more, and what I did was I looked at this   paper that was published back in 2016, 
so pretty early. And it was looking at   the flu vaccine because a lot of people 
say that this has never happened before.   This huge increase in reporting 
from the vaccine has never happened.   But yet there is a situation that occurred, and 
it was published here in December of 2016 titled,   ""Surveillance of Adverse Events After Seasonal 
Influenza Vaccination in Pregnant Women   and Their Infants in the Vaccine Adverse Event 
Reporting system, July 2010 to May 2016."" So,   as you may recall, in 2009, we had a flu epidemic 
called the swine flu epidemic, and in that year,   there was a huge amount of H1N1 influenza. And you 
can see that here on the screen with that red bar.   So you can see the blue is sort of the endemic 
influenza, and then in 2009, this massive   increase in H1N1 reports. And so what you also 
see here is that purple line is the amount of   vaccinations that happened. So because there 
was a lot of influenza that was going around,   a lot of people were being vaccinated. So what 
you're actually seeing here, these bar graphs,   is the number of reports of adverse events. 
Okay. So that's key to understand that. Even   though the vaccine had not changed, the makeup 
of the vaccine had not changed, what we saw was   because there was more vaccinations being 
given, there were more reports being given.   But there's something actually more to it than 
that even still, and that is that there was more   understanding and more awareness of influenza. 
So what I've done here is I've superimposed   Google trends. So how often somebody would 
get on the internet and search for influenza,   you can see clearly there at the same point in 
time that we're seeing increased reported spikes,   we're seeing an increased interest in influenza in 
general. In fact, the highest that there ever was   during that time because it was a very 
important news item at that time. Now,   again, this was under strict reporting system. 
So, they only could report whether they felt   that there was a connection. But even that after 
they looked at it, and published this paper, this   is the conclusion that they came to. Despite the 
increase in reporting events, they said that the   peak in the number of pregnancy reports observed 
during 2009 to 2010 followed by a decrease in   reporting suggest that the 2009 spike in pregnancy 
reports after 2009 H1N1 inactivated vaccines   may have been due to stimulated reporting. 
In other words, the vaccine hadn't changed,   the side effects hadn't changed, and so their 
conclusion was is that as in 2000 and 2009-2010,   no new or unexpected patterns in maternal or 
fetal outcomes were observed during 2010 and 2016. So, if we take the same kind of methodology that 
we've done, we've looked at this huge spike here   with COVID-19, and this is supposed to be evidence 
that people are dying from the COVID vaccine, we   see a very interesting pattern because, if we look 
at Google trends, and we type in COVID vaccine,   obviously, there's a massive spike at the same 
time, the same kind of recipe that we would see   with the influenza. And then also, again, just 
to make sure that we understand here, this is the   deputy director for the Centers for Disease 
Control, and this is what he says. He says,   ""Health care providers' reporting requirements 
are much broader than for other vaccines.   After someone receives the COVID-19 vaccine, their 
health care provider is required by law to report   all serious adverse health events, that would 
include death, even if the provider does not   think the vaccine caused that event. These events 
can include death, inpatient hospitalization,   or a serious case of COVID-19. That 
reporting protocol is due to the fact   that the FDA authorized the COVID-19 vaccines 
for emergency use."" So you can see that the   rules have changed in the middle of the game, 
and so we have to look at that. If we were to   give a placebo injection, the question is 
is we would still see deaths associated with   the vaccine. Why? Because we're vaccinating 
so many people and because of just chance. I did a little bit of an epidemiological exercise. 
So bear with me. If you look at the U.S. death   rate per 100,000 population per year, it's around 
870 deaths. So, in other words, if you were to   take at random 100,000 people in the United States 
and follow them for a year, you would find at the   end of that year that about 870 people would 
have died. Obviously, as the age goes up, that   can go up to as high as 4,000. Here in the 75 to 
84-year-old age group that's much higher. So let's   just take the average. We'll be conservative. And 
also if you were to look over the period of the   last seven months, going from January this year 
to August, seven or eight months, you'll see that   there's a fairly linear...if you want to take that 
approach, fairly linear increase in the amount of   vaccinations over that seven month period of time. 
And in fact, over that 7 month period of time,   there's been about 166 million people that 
have been vaccinated. So, if that's over a   seven month period of time, the average period of 
time that someone's been vaccinated is about three   and a half months. And over that period of time, 
which started in January, that's when we have the   highest death rates, but then as we go through 
the year, it comes down to the lowest death   rate. So that's over that period of time, there's 
about an average death rate in the United States. So let's do a little bit of calculating. If there 
is 870 dead people per 100,000 people per year,   and we adjust that for the 166 million people 
that we've vaccinated in 1 campaign, and then   we adjust that for instead of 12 months just 3 and 
a half months, which is the average period of time   that people have been on average vaccinated, 
we come to this number of about 421,000   people that should be dead just by chance 
from getting the vaccine. And clearly,   that's not the number of people that we're 
seeing. The reports show maybe 10,000 or   15,000. So, clearly, there is a huge amount of 
underreporting occurring. Now, realize that,   again, most of the people who are being vaccinated 
at least in the country are actually much older.   So this number should actually be higher. And 
number two, that most of the people that were   vaccinated very early on and therefore have a 
longer range of vaccination were the older group   as well. And so when you look at that, you can 
see here that the reported deaths totaling about   5,000 or 6,000 is a huge underreporting of the 
number of deaths that we should have if we just   put a little red dot on their shoulder or gave 
them a placebo injection. That's very important   to understand because some people...some 
disingenuous people will show this and say,   ""Look, the vaccine is causing these deaths,"" and 
that cannot be gotten from that type of data. The other graph that you might see is this graph, 
which shows the number of days after vaccination   that deaths are reported. So, based on our 400,000 
number that we've come up with, if we were to   prorate that on a daily basis, we would come up 
with about 4,000 people dying on a daily basis   on average. Obviously, that gets bigger as more 
and more people get vaccinated. But what we're   seeing here after a vaccination is only 600 to 700 
deaths per day. Again, huge underreporting here at   this point. And again, so because there's huge 
underreporting occurring, one might think that   what would be the most likely reporting situation, 
someone who got a vaccine and died the next day,   or someone who died maybe a month later? 
Obviously, when you have a death occurring close   to an event that has to be reported, the reporting 
is going to happen more likely in that situation,   and you're going to have underreporting occurring 
much more likely a month later. And that's exactly   what is demonstrated here with this graph. We see 
that the most reporting occurs within one or two   days, and then it goes down precipitously 
consistent with that type of pattern. The other last thing I'll leave you with here as 
well is that with the mRNA vaccines, with Moderna,   for instance, it's a four-week interval between 
shots, and for Pfizer, it's a three-week interval.   If, in fact, that second shot is causing 
the problems that we see with myocarditis,   myocardial infarction that's been proposed or been 
suggested, I would expect to see another peak here   about three to four weeks out, but, 
in fact, we don't see any such peak.   And so that, again, lends me to believe that 
this graph is the result of reporting events   and human psychology rather than an actual spike 
protein that's causing deaths in these patients.   I agree that we should look for this stuff. 
This stuff needs to be taken seriously,   and that is exactly the purpose of the 
VAERS system is to look to see if there   are patterns. But to go out and say that simply 
because there are deaths, that that must mean   that the vaccine is causing deaths. I think that 
is disingenuous and not supported by the data. [Kyle]: Dr. Patrick, anything to add to that? [Dr. Patrick]: Yes. I do agree 100% with that 
last statement that Dr. Seheult just said because   people are taking this data that is, 
you know, accessible to the public   from the VAERS system, and they're 
trying to make sense of that data. But   scientists from the CDC and from the FDA analyze 
that data. They have to, you know, stratify it   by age, by gender, by ethnicity, and see how many 
people die of X, Y, or Z in that age range of that   gender, of that ethnic group without a vaccine, 
just what's the normal background death rate. You   need to do that comparison. Otherwise, this is 
like the worst epidemiology data you could ever   imagine without any correction for confounding 
factors. You know, it would be like one year,   you know, there was 200,000 births in the city 
of San Bernardino, and at the same time, we had,   you know, 10,000 storks that flew by, therefore, 
storks have to be causing...delivering   the babies, I mean, you know...or 
causing the births basically. So,   you know, epidemiology is a big mess, and so 
you can't just take that data and make these   correlations. And I think to sort of add 
to what Dr. Seheult's kind of brilliant   epidemiology experiment that he just explained, 
to add to that, in the United States alone,   every 30 seconds, someone dies of cardiovascular 
disease, every 30 seconds. Now, generally   speaking, most of those people are going to be 50 
or older because cardiovascular disease doesn't   usually, you know, affect people in their 20s 
or 30s. It can, but generally speaking, it's   an age-related disease more or less. And so, you 
know, if you look at the reported VAERS deaths,   more than half of them are in a population of 
people that are 50 and older. So, it's like,   what are the chances that some of those people are 
probably just dying from a heart attack or from   cardiovascular disease? Stroke, every 40 seconds, 
someone has a stroke in the United States. They   die from it every about four minutes or so. Like 
Dr. Seheult said, there are a lot of people dying   every day in the United States 
completely independent of COVID-19,   completely independent of vaccines. It's not 
accurate to try to interpret the VAERS data   yourself without stratifying it and looking at 
all the other factors that I just mentioned. But even on top of that, last time I did a VAERS 
report actually was probably close to a month ago,   maybe three weeks ago, and at that time, I was 
stratifying the data by age and looking at the   reported deaths. Over 584,000 people of the age 
of 50 and over have died from COVID-19. And last   time I looked at the VAERS, which is about a month 
ago or so, about 5,000 people over the age of 50   had reported, you know, VAERS deaths. And so even 
if you were to take that 5,000 and triple it,   you're still 40 times more likely to die from 
COVID-19 than you are from a vaccine if you're   over the age of 50. People aged 40 to 49, about 
20,000 people have died from COVID-19, according   to the CDC website. If you look at the VAERS, it's 
much lower than that, about 200 people. And if   again triple that number, even after tripling 
it, you're 33 times more likely to die from   COVID-19 than from a vaccine if you are age 40 to 
49. Bring that age group down even further, 18 to   39-year-olds, about 10,000 people have died from 
COVID-19 in that age range. And if you look at   the VAERS data, it's somewhere around 200, let's 
triple it 600 people, you're still 17 times more   likely to die from COVID-19 than from a COVID-19 
vaccine if you are in the age range of 18 to 39.   So, again, at every age group, you're much, 
much more likely to die from COVID-19 than   you are from a vaccine. We're just directly 
taking the VAERS reporting. And as I said,   you can't do that. We don't even know if 
those deaths are actually causally linked,   right? It's correlation. I think when you look 
at it like that, it makes a lot more sense that   everyone's going to be exposed to 
the SARS-CoV-2 virus at some point,   do you want to be vaccinated when 
you're exposed to it? I do personally. [Kyle]: Okay. Let me summarize my understanding of 
this, and correct me if any of this sounds wrong.   In our country of over 300 million people, there 
is a background number, an expected number of   deaths and other medical problems that are going 
to happen on a daily basis or an annual basis on   average. And then we have this reporting system, 
the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, where   medical professionals are not only encouraged, but 
they're actually required to report any medical   problem or death that happens after someone 
gets a COVID-19 vaccine, whether or not they   think the vaccine caused it or not. So it's 
an epidemiologist and other scientists' job to   look at the number of reports that come into the 
VAERS and compare that with the background numbers   for each age group and other demographics 
and assess, does the number of reports   actually rise above what we would expect for 
that age group and other demographics? And   listening to you, Dr. Seheult, it sounds like 
for deaths reported from the COVID-19 vaccine,   the number of deaths actually falls far below 
the background level that we would expect,   which suggests that there's underreporting. 
But it also suggests it's very unlikely that   a significant number of deaths are happening 
from the COVID-19 vaccine. Do I have that right? [Dr. Seheult]: Yep. [Dr. Patrick]: Absolutely. And I think 
just to kind of even add to that, you know,   the myocarditis link that we now know about 
linked to the mRNA vaccine specifically came   out of the VAERS data, and after the scientists, 
epidemiologists analyzed the data, they found   myocarditis was above that background noise. 
It was higher. So there was something there.   I've heard so many conspiracy theories that, 
you know, the government agencies don't want us   to know about it, don't want us to know about the 
adverse effects. Then I just don't understand why   we would know about myocarditis being linked to 
the mRNA vaccines, or why we would know about rare   blood clots in some cases with Johnson & Johnson, 
very, very rare. If there was some big conspiracy,   why would we know about some of the 
potential rare adverse events but not others? [Kyle]: It's always powerful when someone knows 
someone who got a COVID-19 vaccine and then had   a death afterwards, or, you know, some 
new onset of symptoms. So what would you   both say succinctly to someone who says, you 
know, ""My parent, or grandparent, or whoever,   got the COVID-19 vaccine, and then 3 weeks later, 
they died of a heart attack. I think that those   are links""? What would you say to that person? 
I'll start with you Dr. Seheult on this one. [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. I mean, this is really what 
makes us human beings. We have to put on our   scientific hats when we talk about numbers because 
we can't be attached to it, and on the other hand,   we're also human beings, and we live with it. So, 
it's hard to do that. I can tell you that when   I'm in the hospital, if I give a blood thinner to 
somebody because they have a condition, and they   bleed out and die, and the next person that comes 
in with that same condition, I'll have to tell you   as a human being, I'm a little bit less gung-ho 
about giving that person a blood thinner even   though it's indicated, and it's the right thing 
for that person. In other words, what happened   before doesn't necessarily tell me what's going to 
happen again. It's statistics that tells us that.   That's actually one of the fallacies of medicine. 
So, when you're making medical decisions,   there's always going to be risks. It's 
always going to happen. I can tell you that.   Don't let anybody tell you that we don't do harm 
in medicine. We try to do more benefit than harm.   We give aspirin to people who have heart 
attacks. We give blood thinners to people   with atrial fibrillation. Are you telling 
me that we've never had a situation where   someone has bled on a blood thinner, or someone 
has gotten an ulcer from aspirin? It happens,   but we have to look at the 
benefits versus the risks. So,   in that situation, I would tell them that, you 
know, it's possible that whatever they had could   be linked to the vaccine, that we have to look at 
epidemiological studies to see whether that's the   case. And I would understand if they were hesitant 
to get the vaccine in that situation. I would   completely understand as a human being because 
that's the same struggles that I have as well. But if we want to make policies going forward, 
we always have to realize that no matter how many   times you've rolled the dice, and it's come up six 
every time, that the next time you roll the dice,   there's still a one in six chance 
that it's going to be a six despite   the previous rolls. And unfortunately, that's what 
we have to deal with when we're looking at risk   to benefit ratio. Maybe one day in the future 
we'll be able to do a better job at predicting   who will benefit and who won't, but 
right now we do the best that we can. [Kyle]: Dr. Patrick? [Dr. Patrick]: I think just to add... Sorry. [Kyle]: Yeah. Go ahead. [Dr. Patrick]: Just to add to that, I think, you 
know, the fact of the matter is that in the United   States alone, over 177 million people are fully 
vaccinated, over a billion people worldwide. And,   you know, as Dr. Seheult point out, people 
respond to things differently, to drugs, to   different...the foods that we eat every day, you 
know, if we were to give peanuts to 177 million   people in the United States, a good size of people 
would have a pretty serious adverse reaction.   Same goes for shellfish. You know, it's a really 
big world out there, and there are individual   differences in the way we respond to foods, to 
medications, to vaccines but it does not mean...   So, you know, in other words, it's not 
a zero risk as Dr. Seheult was saying,   but 100% of the population is not 
responding that way. It's not because   there's something inherently... For the 
most part, you can have a medication that   is dangerous, but, you know, we would know 
that by now with 177 million people fully   vaccinated in the United States and over 
a billion people worldwide. We would know. [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. And, Kyle, this is all 
be...probably a good time to also say that,   you know, the purpose for Dr. Patrick and myself 
being on here is really to educate people on   what are the risks and the benefits and the 
relative risks so that they can make a decision.   And the reason why we want to arm them with that 
information is so that they can make a decision.   We're not for forcing people to get vaccines. 
We're not for the purpose of saying it's okay   to be forced to get these vaccines. We're not 
really for mandates. We're really here to educate.   And I think that's an important distinction, 
but Dr. Patrick can speak for herself. [Dr. Patrick]: Yeah. I 100% agree. I would never 
want to force anyone to do anything they're scared   of. I certainly wouldn't want to force a parent 
to do something to their child that they were   scared of. And I think that the purpose of this 
podcast and in general speaking about what the   data shows about vaccines and COVID-19 is 
to really help people that don't have the   capacity to interpret the scientific literature 
to help them have a more...a well-informed,   you know, basically background so that they 
can make a good decision on whether or not   they want to get or choose to get vaccinated. And 
I think that there are people out there that are   not giving good information for whatever 
reason. To be honest, there's a lot to gain from   making sensationalistic claims that something 
you think is good for you is actually not. So   we think vaccines are good for us, but they're 
not. And you can gain a large following,   and there can be a little bit of a 
perverse incentive in some instances   for people that are technically versed in the 
scientific literature that may have a degree,   higher education and yet are cherry-picking 
and misleading people. That does happen, and   in order to counter that, I think it's important 
to put an unbiased approach. Try to, you know,   interpret the data for what it is and 
also put that information out there. [Kyle]: Right. Dr. Patrick, this next question 
is for you. It's about antibody-dependent   enhancement. Can you explain what that is and if 
you think it's relevant or applies to COVID-19? [Dr. Patrick]: Sure. So, antibody-dependent 
enhancement refers to when your immune system   makes antibodies against a pathogen that is...it's 
non-functional. So the antibodies can bind to the   pathogen, for example, in our interest here, 
a virus. They can bind to it, but they don't   neutralize the virus. And, in fact, not only 
do they not neutralize it, they can activate   other immune cells to become more aggressive 
and cause more damage. So, in the end,   the immune system can end up being more 
damaging after being exposed to a virus   than if it hadn't previously had those antibodies. 
And so when I say previously had those antibodies,   most often I'm referring to vaccine-induced 
antibodies. I would say that in the United States,   we really became aware of this phenomenon back 
in the 1960s. So this was when the respiratory   syncytial virus vaccine...one of the vaccines 
was made, and it was being clinically tested   in infants and toddlers. Half of the infants 
and toddlers in the treatment group were given   the vaccine, and the other half were given the 
placebo. And then the infants were then, you know,   going to be exposed to the RSV virus, which as all 
of us parents know like every child gets, and it's   a respiratory virus. They end up having a cough 
that can oftentimes linger for quite a while. So, what was terribly tragic about this vaccine 
story is that the infants and toddlers that   had received the RSV vaccine, about 80% of them 
were hospitalized after being exposed to the RSV   virus naturally versus the infants and toddlers 
that had placebo, only 5% of those infants and   toddlers actually ended up in the hospital after 
being exposed to the RSV vaccine. So this was   terrifying, and, of course, the vaccine never 
made it past this original clinical trial. But,   you know, what was happening is antibody-dependent 
enhancement wasn't quite known at the time,   but you know, much research has...you know, 
decades of research since then have been done,   and it's now known that antibody-dependent 
enhancement occurred. So the antibodies that   were generated from the RSV vaccine were binding 
to the virus. They were not neutralizing it,   and, in fact, they were making the immune system 
worse. They're making the immune system act worse   in response to the virus and become more 
damaging. And so what was figured out by   many scientists, and including some of the work 
of Dr. Jason McLellan who I mentioned earlier,   is that the antibodies that are generated   that play a major role in antibody-dependent 
enhancement are called post-fusion antibodies.   And you probably can guess it. We talked about how 
viral proteins go from a...they make a structural   conformation change. They go from a pre-fusion 
conformation to a post-fusion conformation.   Well, guess what. Your immune system is making 
antibodies to both of those different types of   viral proteins. And so what the brilliant 
work of Jason McLellan showed is that   you could basically lock a viral protein into the 
pre-fusion complex, and when you then, you know,   use that pre-fusion viral protein in a vaccine, 
you don't make post-fusion antibodies because   you don't...your body isn't exposed to that 
structure of the viral protein. That's what we   have in all of our U.S. vaccines, the pre-fusion 
viral protein, the pre-fusion spike protein. We are not making post-fusion antibodies against 
the spike protein, which is so reassuring that   antibody-dependent enhancement is so...it's so 
unlikely to happen because we don't make those   antibodies. And, of course, on top of that, what 
we would see in the hospitals as I mentioned with   RSVs is that if you take an unvaccinated versus a 
vaccinated person and, you know, randomly choose   them at any point, then the vaccinated person 
would always have the most severe disease.   They would be the one that are most likely 
to be hospitalized compared to unvaccinated.   They would be the most likely to die. And I'm not 
talking about, you know, if you have all of your   population vaccinated. Well, of course, you're 
going to end up having some people in the   hospital that have been vaccinated. I'm talking 
about comparing the unvaccinated to vaccinated.   What you would see is that unvaccinated people 
would be less likely to have a severe disease, and   that is not what we've seen at any point during 
this pandemic at all. So, that's also reassuring. I think a lot of concern for antibody-dependent 
enhancement came out of both in vitro studies,   again, those are studies done in cultured 
cells in like a petri dish as well as in   vivo studies. These refer to animal studies, 
it can be, you know, a rodent or a hamster.   Pick your animal. These studies were done 
with the original SARS virus back in 2003   or 2002, what we now call 
SARS-CoV-1. When vaccines were made   for that virus and injected into some animals, 
they did cause antibody-dependent enhancement.   That was not the case with all studies and all 
vaccines for the SARS-CoV-1. So it was sort of an   inconsistent data. But that's really what 
started the initial concern. I myself was   concerned. I was reading this data, and I thought, 
""Oh, geez, well, that's scary."" So, at the time,   I didn't know anything about the post-fusion 
antibodies that were involved in that and how,   you know, Dr. Jason McLellan and his collaborators 
had figured out a way to bypass that,   to lock that viral protein in the pre-fusion 
complex so we don't make those antibodies.   So that is really...at the end of the day gives 
me a lot of peace of mind that antibody-dependent   enhancement is not likely to ever happen with 
our current vaccines in the United States. [Kyle]: Dr. Seheult, anything to add to that? [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. As Dr. Patrick was saying, if 
we look at Israel, which has been vaccinating with   the Pfizer vaccine the longest out of any of the 
countries on the planet, and we look here at the   Delta variant, which is what we're interested 
in, we really need to make sure that we're   concentrating on the Delta variant because that's 
the current variant here in the United States,   there was a study that was released. And 
you can see here on the graph we've got   red as those who are unvaccinated in Israel, 
and green, those who are fully vaccinated in   Israel. And you can see here that over the months 
of July and August, which were just pure Delta   at the time, clearly, you can see that 
it was the unvaccinated that were having   the most severe cases. And that would not be the 
case if we had antibody-dependent enhancement with   the Delta variant. That's clearly not the case. If 
you break it down in the next graph even by age,   you'll see that the same relationship occurs with 
age. But again, in each of these age categories,   if you age stratify them, you will see 
that is the unvaccinated in these that are   leading the severe cases. So this goes against the 
grain of what you may hear that Israel is telling   us that the Pfizer vaccine is just breaking 
down, it's useless, it's not working. That's   just totally not the case in terms of preventing 
severe cases, which is an important endpoint. [Kyle]: Dr. Seheult, this next question's 
for you, and it's about the vaccines and   human fertility. There's an idea that's been 
floating around that the COVID-19 vaccines   somehow impact human fertility. 
What are your thoughts on that? [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. So it's come from many 
places. One place in particular was this idea   that the antibodies made against the vaccine 
would crossreact with proteins in the placenta.   So, let's go back and look at some of the data 
to see if actually this is happening or not.   And you can see here I've got a table of the phase 
three trials in the four different major vaccines   that are available. We have Pfizer, 
Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Janssen,   which is the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. So, in the 
phase three trials, one of the specific exclusions   for entering into the trial was the fact that you 
might be pregnant. So those were excluded, but,   of course, you know, accidents happen. And so what 
we have here is a number of subjects in the phase   three trials that became pregnant after enrolling 
in the study. And so while these aren't huge   numbers, they just sort of give us a little bit 
of an insight. What you can see here is you've got   the control group on the left, the vaccinated 
group on the right, and in all of these cases,   the amount in the vaccinated group and the control 
group were the same. So if you look in the Pfizer   vaccine, we had 12 pregnancies that occurred in 
the control group, 11 in the vaccinated group.   We had seven pregnancies in the control group in 
Moderna and six. We had 9 in AstraZeneca and 12.   Four in the Johnson & Johnson, and four in the 
vaccinated group. So, in terms of miscarriages,   that was also looked at, and as you can see there, 
there was no statistical significant difference   between either pregnancies or miscarriages 
at least in the phase three trials. Well,   that's not where we have to leave 
it because we've looked at this now   after the marketing, of course, so post-marketing, 
and there was a very good trial data that was   published in the ""New England Journal of 
Medicine"" entitled ""Preliminary Findings of   Messenger RNA COVID-19 Vaccine Safety in Pregnant 
Persons."" And what they looked at was a number of   areas. They looked at pregnancy loss, spontaneous 
abortions, stillbirth, neonatal outcomes, preterm   births, small size for gestational age, congenital 
abnormalities, and even neonatal death. And they   compared the rates of people who have gotten the 
vaccine and were pregnant to the registry, so the   V-safe pregnancy registry data, to see...which 
is what they got the data from and compared it   to the published incidents of these occurrences. 
And what they found in every one of these cases   is that there was no statistical significant 
difference in terms of what they saw in   the pregnancy data versus what they 
should see in the regular population. Finally, what I would say from my aspect or 
from my standpoint is to direct you to Dr.   Viki Male who we've had here on MedCram and has a 
Twitter account who's actually updating this. She   is a reproductive immunologist that has found it 
her duty to always constantly being updated in   terms of data in terms of not just pregnancy, but 
also breastfeeding, in terms of getting pregnant,   in terms of all of those risk factors. And I 
would highly recommend that you check her out   on Twitter. But I'll be interested 
to hear what Dr. Patrick has to say. [Dr. Seheult]: I'm just sort of adding on to 
the ""New England Journal of Medicine"" paper   that you just referred to. There was a follow-up 
study. It's still a pre-print to my knowledge.   And this study was done in around 2,500 people, 
and they were women specifically. They were given   a COVID-19 vaccine before 20 weeks of pregnancy, 
and much like you mentioned with the study in the   ""New England Journal of Medicine,"" the miscarriage 
rate was on the low...within the normal range,   and it was actually on the low end. So it was 
about 12.8% of miscarriages that occurred, and   the normal range is between 12.5% to 18.7%. So, 
again, it was on the low end of the normal range. There was another study that was published 
last June, and it was in the American Society   for Reproductive Medicine. And that study 
found that neither having...previously   had a SARS-CoV-2 infection or having had a 
COVID-19 vaccine affected embryo implantation. So,   there was no effect on the ability of the embryo 
to implant into the uterus. On top of that,   there was a very small study looking at fertility 
in men, and this study found that there was no   effect of COVID-19 vaccines on any of the normal 
sperm parameters that are measured like motility,   etc. Like there was no 
effect on that. So, I think,   generally speaking, it seems as all 
the data so far points to no effect   of COVID-19 vaccines on...no real, you know, 
large effect of COVID-19 vaccines on fertility. [Kyle]: Okay. Dr. Patrick, this next question 
is for you. This is in your wheelhouse,   and it's about the mRNA vaccine specifically.   And since this is for a lot of people new 
technology, technology they haven't heard about,   and there are rumors that this is somehow gene 
therapy, and it's going to be impacting our own   DNA within ourselves, can you speak to that, 
and what are your thoughts about those rumors? [Dr. Patrick]: Well, sure. I think it's 
understandable for most people to be a little   concerned because they've never heard of this 
mRNA technology. The word RNA is in it. It's just   overwhelming in a sense. And, I think, as I 
mentioned earlier when I was talking about...you   know, from a thousand foot high...mile high, you 
know, viewpoint, how these mRNA vaccines work,   and how there's, you know, a sequence of the 
messenger RNA inside of a lipid nanoparticle   and along with some other factors that essentially 
when that lipid nanoparticle with the mRNA gets   inside of your cells, your cells themselves, our 
ribosomes translate that mRNA into actual protein.   And so really, it's more accurate to be a protein 
making technology in a way. But nonetheless,   there's been a lot of fear that mRNA vaccines are 
gene therapy that are altering our DNA. And so to   understand that, you need to understand...I mean, 
I think first and foremost, if someone says that   to you, you might want to ask them, ""Where inside 
the cell does DNA reside?"" And if they don't know   the answer to that question, then they probably 
don't understand what they're saying. So our DNA   resides in a part of our cell called the nucleus. 
It's inside of a nucleus. Things don't just freely   pass into the nucleus of the cell. In order to 
get inside of the nucleus of the cell, you have   to have what's called a nuclear localization 
sequence. This is a very specific sequence   that allows something to get inside of the 
nucleus. And so there's no nuclear localization   sequence anywhere in this mRNA, anywhere, you 
know, inside of the lipid nanoparticle. It's   not present. It's not there. There's no way for 
it to get inside of the nucleus of the cell. If   somehow it did somehow miraculously get inside 
of the nucleus of our cell where our DNA resides,   in order for it to alter our DNA, the mRNA would 
first have to become DNA. And in order for that to   happen, you would need an enzyme called reverse 
transcriptase. There's no reverse transcriptase   inside of our nucleus, inside of the, you 
know, lipid nanoparticle with our mRNA. It's   not present. So, that is not likely to happen. 
But if all those things were to happen somehow,   then in order for the DNA...so if you somehow 
got inside the nucleus, turn the mRNA into DNA,   and then in order for it to alter our DNA, 
you'd have to have something called an   integrase enzyme, it would have to integrate 
into our DNA to get in there to change it.   And again, no integrase enzyme present 
there. It's not going to happen. So, the chances of the mRNA 
vaccines actually changing our DNA   are so small. I mean, it would just take 
some sort of grand conspiracy where,   you know, we're somehow getting these enzymes into 
this mRNA, and it's doing all this stuff. I mean,   like it's just not going to happen. 
It's not biologically plausible. [Kyle]: Dr. Seheult, anything to add to that? [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. I mean, the central dogma 
of molecular biology is that DNA goes to RNA,   RNA goes to protein. And what we're doing with the 
vaccine is we're simply instructing the ribosomes,   which reside in the outer portion of the cell, 
to make the protein. This, by the way, is exactly   what the virus does. And so if you're a little 
bit freaked out or creeped out by the fact that   your cell machinery is being taken over to 
make something that it shouldn't be making,   well, let me introduce you to COVID-19 
because that's exactly what's happening   in the viral infection. And instead 
of it happening just in one or two   cells, it's happening in millions of cells. In 
fact, there's billions to trillions of copies   of the virus that's being made in one individual, 
and it goes all throughout the body. So,   what's happening here with the vaccine is that 
it's simply using the ribosomes to make proteins.   There's no aspect of the messenger RNA vaccines 
that do anything with the nucleus. And it's the   nucleus that holds the DNA, and that's where your 
genome is. So, that's basically it in a nutshell. [Dr. Patrick]: Well, just to add 
to that, Dr. Seheult, you know,   speaking of viruses and what viruses do, we know 
some viruses actually can change back into DNA   and affect our DNA. So, HIV is one, 
some of the herpes viruses as well.   If there's anything to be worried about changing 
our DNA, it's actually viruses themselves. [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. [Kyle]: Dr. Seheult, working in the ICU, I know 
you've been following any potential treatment for   COVID-19 very closely throughout the pandemic, and 
you've featured a number of potentially promising   treatments in your COVID-19 update videos. And I 
want to ask your thoughts on this idea that, you   know, viable treatments currently exist or viable 
options exist if one were to get COVID-19 or even   potentially to prevent them from getting COVID-19, 
and therefore they don't need the vaccine because   they can just treat it effectively if they 
get it. What are your thoughts on that? [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. So that's a very interesting 
philosophy. I follow the philosophy of the Swiss   cheese model. Let me explain what that is a little 
bit. Imagine you've got a block of Swiss cheese,   and you've sliced it up all throughout. And if you 
were to pull out one of those slices, you would   see that there may be some Swiss cheese holes 
in there, and each slice would have the holes   in different places. Maybe some slices would have 
more holes than other slices. Maybe some slices   would have very little holes. Maybe others have 
a lot of holes. But the bottom line is, is that   the more slices of Swiss cheese you put in there, 
the less likely you're going to be able to find   a hole that's going to get through all of those 
slices. And that's kind of the general principle   here that we see with the Swiss cheese model of 
making sure that we have the best protection we   have to avoid the outcomes that we don't want to 
have. Let me put it in a different perspective.   In the operating room, we want to make sure 
that we have no post-operative infections,   and we have a lot of layers that we put into 
that. For instance, the surgeon wears a mask.   They sterilize the instruments. They 
put a solution, a sterilizing solution   over the area of the skin that they're going to 
make the incision. I mean, this goes on and on,   positive pressure ventilation in the room, a scrub 
nurse, adjusting the humidity in the room just   right, adjusting the temperature in the room just 
right. So we don't say that because sterilizing   the equipment works, then therefore the mask 
doesn't work, or say the fact that we have to   put sterilization solution on the skin that 
therefore we don't have to humidify the room.   That's foreign to medical thinking. I mean, if 
we even think about it in the general practice,   right, we do crash tests on vehicles, not 
because we don't think seat belts work.   We don't put airbags into vehicles because we 
don't think crashed...I mean, what we're doing   is we're doing multiple layers because the more 
layers we have, the better protection we're going   to have in the end to avoid the undesired outcome 
at the end. So, to hear this about saying that   people are getting vaccinated, but because 
we're making everyone wear masks, that must   mean that the vaccines don't work. Completely, 
I'm lost on that. That's not the way we think   in medicine. We try to avoid these things. And so 
the Swiss cheese model is how we think about this. So one of the things that's come up is the idea of   ivermectin. Ivermectin is this medication that 
was initially studied. This came out in June   of 2020. And what they found was that in high 
enough concentrations in vitro in a test tube,   when they went to something 
called 5 micromolar concentration,   they were able to completely shut down and reduce 
by about 5,000-fold the ability of the SARS-CoV-2   virus to reproduce. And so obviously, there was a 
lot of excitement because perhaps we might be able   to use a repurposed medication like ivermectin, 
which has been around for years and is used as an   anti-parasitic or anthelmintic medication, 
especially in South America and Africa.   Perhaps this could be used to treat COVID-19. And 
so this paper, which was an in vitro paper looking   at 5 micromolar concentration that was required to 
shut down, was one of the things that were looked   at. The problem was is that when you look at the 
actual dosing of ivermectin in a human being,   you only get about 0.28 micromolar. So that's 
a number of orders of magnitude, if you will,   reduced than the concentration that you would 
need to have in the cell to get that. And so this   paper here that was published in the ""British 
Journal of Clinical Pharmacology"" said that   ""The free plasma concentration of ivermectin 
would need to be 250 times lower,"" was actually   250 times lower than the concentration required 
to reduce viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 in   vitro. And so that was one of the things. But 
again, this is all in vitro, and so we look at   actual randomized controlled data and 
meta-analyses. And there was a meta-analysis that   came out in June of 2021 titled ""Ivermectin for 
Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 Infection:   A Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, and 
Trial Sequential Analysis to Inform Clinical   Guidelines."" And what they did was they looked at 
a number of different studies, up to 25 different   studies that were...some of them were randomized, 
some of them were not as well randomized. Some of   them had bias. And they analyzed all of those 
things, and they came up with the conclusion   that there was moderate certainty of 
evidence that there was a reduction   in death compared with no ivermectin. But the 
rest of the conclusions had a very low certainty   evidence. Now, this meta-analysis included 
a randomized controlled trial that was later   retracted because there was basically fraud going 
on in the study. Although that hasn't been fully   investigated yet, but it seems as though there 
were some problems in that study. The authors   of the meta-analysis say that it wouldn't have 
changed the overall conclusion, but you can kind   of see that there are some questions. And a lot of 
these studies were done in patients that were in   basically outside of the United States. And why 
would that be an issue? If you think about this,   ivermectin is a medication that kills off 
parasites. And if you look at some of the data,   for instance, in Egypt, and in the Middle 
East, South America, the amount of clinically   silent parasitic infections in the population 
approaches in some studies 50% to 60%. So you   can imagine, if you take these patients who 
then come down with COVID-19, put them in   the hospital, and apply to them large doses of 
dexamethasone, which is an immunosuppressant,   it's possible...we don't know for sure, but it's 
possible that some of these parasitic infections   may be coming less silent and becoming activated 
with the suppression of the immune system.   And so it makes sense that in those types 
of situations, that adding ivermectin   may be beneficial, not because it's helping 
out COVID-19 specifically, but because it's   suppressing these concomitant infections that 
are going on. That is a potential possibility. And so, if you're asking about 
whether or not ivermectin should be   used in the United States, what you really need is 
randomized controlled trials in the United States,   looking at the United States population. And right 
now I'm happy to say that there are a number of   studies that are undergoing, not only in the 
United States, specifically at Temple University   in Philadelphia, but also there's a trial data 
that's looking at McMaster University and also   in Brazil called the Together Trial. And 
what they've done is they've actually made   this platform where they can rapidly assess the 
efficacy of repurposed medication. So things like   hydroxychloroquine was looked at. That didn't find 
any improvements, so they stopped that study. They   looked at lopinavir-ritonavir, and they stopped 
that study because there wasn't improvement. They   stopped the metformin study because there wasn't 
improvement. But there are two medications that   they're currently looking at. They're looking 
at the ivermectin single dose to see if that   is causing any improvements. They've now gone to 
three doses to see whether or not they are. There   is some evidence that they're seeing some signal 
that may be appropriate, but the one that they're   noticing actually has an even better signal that 
they're studying more is fluvoxamine, which is an   antidepressant medication. It has some claims 
that it may be an anti-inflammatory medication,   antioxidant. The point is, is that we should be 
looking at these medications. It should be done   in a randomized controlled trial under a specific 
study platform, and we shouldn't be writing these   things off. So, the question is, is whether or not 
we should be requiring the high level of evidence   that we normally would have in a pandemic or not. 
And I think that's a reasonable question to have.   But these things do need to be studied. 
They do need to be looked at. But realize,   at the end of the day, this is just one slice in 
the large slices of cheese. We can't all depend   on that one slice because every slice has holes 
in it, and the more slices we have, the better.   And so as part of my philosophy, if there is 
something that works, great, that's a slice,   but it doesn't mean that we don't do the other 
things that are important because nothing is 100%. [Kyle]: Dr. Patrick, what are 
your thoughts on this question? [Dr. Patrick]: Well, I do have many 
thoughts particularly with the ivermectin   being as good as vaccines statement that is very 
sensationalized and I think is doing a lot of harm   because, as Dr. Seheult pointed out, you 
know, we should study any type of therapeutic   that is repurposed, anything we know is 
safe in humans, and anything that could have   even the slightest positive effect on the 
SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 illness because   we need everything that we can to fight this. We 
need multiple therapeutics. We need vaccines. We   need everything. And so, I think, when you 
sensationalize something more than the data   suggests it deserves, then you have a couple 
of problems. One, you're misleading people,   and that's a big problem. And two, you're getting 
a sort of knee-jerk reaction from researchers,   scientists, from physicians that are going, 
""Whoa, wait a minute. Something feels a little,   you know, off."" And so you kind of put off 
those people that otherwise may be more open   to looking at that therapeutic if they otherwise 
didn't hear a very sensationalistic claim   like ivermectin is just as good as vaccines 
at protecting against COVID-19. And so   meta-analysis, Dr. Seheult mentioned a very 
popular one that was a systematic review   and did show some conclusions that 
were positive generally speaking.   But when you actually go down and look at the 
individual studies within that meta-analysis and   other types of analysis that are aggregating 
a bunch of data, what you'll often find is a   common set of problems. And these problems are 
manifold. One, they include the co-treatments,   and the treatments are very different with 
each of these studies. So, for example,   sometimes you'll have ivermectin alone. Sometimes 
you'll have ivermectin plus azithromycin.   Sometimes you'll have ivermectin plus some kind 
of nose spray. Sometimes you'll have ivermectin   plus vitamin C and zinc and blood thinners and 
azithromycin in the kitchen sink basically.   Then you'll compare that to sometimes 
placebo, sometimes hydroxychloroquine,   sometimes hydroxychloroquine and 
azithromycin, sometimes doxycycline.   There's so many variables here that you can't look 
at just one of the variables and say ivermectin   is doing this when you have ivermectin plus 
the kitchen sink, or you have ivermectin   plus something else compared to the kitchen 
sink or compared to...you know, so there's   a lot of variables that are just being 
aggregated together that are very different. The second major problem with a lot of these 
studies is that they are small sample sizes, and   so at the end of the day, when you're looking at 
a clinical endpoint, for example, hospitalization,   when you have 50 people in a group, you know, 
then if 2 people end up in the hospital, so you   have 2 people in the control group end up in the 
hospital, but out of the other 50 people, you have   zero end up in the hospital, so let's say in the 
ivermectin group because you'll find studies like   this, it's such a low sample size that the risk of 
that event happening, the certainty of that event   happening being actually, you know, causal 
by that treatment is so low. Like you can't   make a definitive statement about that. And so 
what you'll see happening is that more and more   studies will be pulled together so that you now 
have larger sample sizes when you pull them all   together, and then your certainty becomes a little 
bit better. But then you have to ask yourself,   well, is that really true? When you have such 
a low sample size within that individual study,   pulling them together is kind of a statistical 
way of manipulating the data in a way saying,   well, look, there's statistical significance when 
you pull it all together. I think that's really   important to keep in mind when you're looking 
at some of these meta-analysis with ivermectin. And then you also have the clinical 
endpoints varying. So you have people looking   at hospitalization. You'll have research 
groups looking at deaths. You'll have   research groups looking at viral clearance 
time to a negative PCR. And in some cases,   they're all being aggregated together, 
and it's like clinical benefit is the   end point. And it's like, well, geez, these 
are vastly different clinical endpoints. So,   you really need to be careful when 
looking at aggregated data. Certainly,   there's a number of websites out there that 
are doing this. And I can tell you that I've   looked at these individual studies, and in many 
cases, I mean, it's everything I just mentioned   and worse. It's where you can't even find 
the numbers that they're coming up with. But sticking to just the scientific literature, 
you know, even that systematic meta-analysis   that Dr. Seheult mentioned, you know, if 
you look at all the different studies,   and a lot of them were pre-prints that they 
included, the only real consistent finding   that was found, consistent meaning every study 
showed it, was basically time to a negative PCR,   in other words, an ivermectin plus the 
kitchen sink or ivermectin plus whatever,   it seemed to lead to a faster viral clearance 
to some degree. And again, it might be that it   takes ivermectin plus the kitchen sink to do it, 
but that ivermectin plays a small role. We don't   really know. And when you take ivermectin plus the 
kitchen sink, you can't pinpoint it and say it's   ivermectin doing it. You just can't do that unless 
you give the kitchen sink without ivermectin to   the control group. And then you can say, well, 
look, they were given the exact other, you know,   array of therapeutics, and they didn't have the 
same improvement as the other group with the array   of therapeutic treatments plus the ivermectin. 
So, there's a lot of nuance to this. And I think   that at the end of the day, there is a little 
bit of a signal. There is something that seems   to be going on with ivermectin, whether or not 
it's in combination with all these other things   or by itself. It's unclear. What is clear is that 
we definitely do need more data. We need more high   quality data. We need more data from, you know, 
states that...or from countries that don't have a   really high background of parasitic disease as Dr. 
Seheult pointed out. It's a very big confounding   factor. But also we need to not sensationalize 
something and, you know, speak about things that   are not true. Like there's just no evidence 
that ivermectin is going to protect you from   infection and from severe disease as well as a 
vaccine. There's no evidence of that, and so don't   make that claim. Make the claim for what the data 
speaks to. There may be an effect. There may be an   effect particularly on viral clearance. If people 
would tone it down and not make these grandiose   claims, there would be a lot more interest 
in ivermectin and studying ivermectin. And, you know, the other thing to keep in mind is 
that there's been a lot of people that have now   sought out a veterinary form of it because it is 
something that in addition to being used in humans   for parasitic diseases and helminths and 
also scabies and lice and things like that,   it's also used in like...you know, 
people are calling it horse dewormer,   which, you know, it's just...it's not a good idea 
to go and get a veterinary type of medication and   try to treat yourself because there's vastly, 
you know, different doses involved. I mean,   you know, horses are much larger than humans. 
It's very dangerous to do something like that.   And I think people have sort of heard these 
sensational claims and sort of taking their   own action trying to get some form of ivermectin, 
and really, that could be quite dangerous.   I agree with Dr. Seheult that we should 
be studying these repurposed therapeutics.   There is a potential for ivermectin. At 
least in my opinion at the very least,   it seems as though it's pretty consistently 
involved in speeding up the viral clearance   to some degree. It's not like a huge, huge effect, 
but there is an effect, and it's consistent with   pretty much all the studies that I've personally 
looked at. So, I think that, you know, we should   really go after that and try to see if 
that's real. That's pretty much my thought. [Kyle]: Excellent. And speaking 
of those studies that you both   talked about and these meta-analyses, one 
argument I've heard for ivermectin is some of   these population-based studies where certain 
countries have decided to give ivermectin   on a large scale. And you can understand, you 
know, potentially their motivation. They want to   protect their population and prevent COVID-19 
if they can, and they're going to use whatever   resources they think they have to do that. What 
are some problems with these population-based   studies for people who aren't 
familiar with what those are? [Dr. Patrick]: So basically, they're known as 
ecological studies. They're great to look at.   They're hypothesis generating. You don't rely on 
hypothesis generating studies to determine whether   or not somebody gets a medication. So first off, 
you know, all the disclaimers, don't take this   as medical advice, talk to your doctor, see if 
it's right for you, and don't get your ivermectin   from the feed store are some reasonable advice to 
take. But in terms of the studies, what you need   to be able to reach the point where you're able 
to prescribe someone something is what the FDA   requires, which is a randomized placebo-controlled 
trial that's usually multi-centered,   and it's very large. And that's what you have 
to do to be able to say this is the medicine   that's indicated for this condition. And we just 
haven't had that yet here in the United States. [Dr. Patrick]: And to sort of add to 
that, Dr. Seheult, I mean, you know,   even going back to the original clinical trials 
with our mRNA vaccines, there were 75,000 people   originally in that randomized controlled trial 
where, you know, half the population was getting   the treatment, which were the vaccines, and 
the other half was getting the placebo. And   then on top of that...so that's a large number of 
people. The sample sizes with this ivermectin is   a fraction of that, I mean, a fraction. And on 
top of that, we now have all this real world data   where we've got billions of people worldwide 
who have had a COVID-19 vaccine, and they are   protecting from severe disease, and to some degree 
they're also protecting against even getting   infected depending on which, you know, vaccine 
a person has gotten. So, we know they're   effective. We know from large, large, large 
numbers. And to sort of even add on to that,   everything has changed since the 
Delta variant. We have had to sort of   start again and look at...aggregate new 
data because this is a new variant where   our vaccines are not as effective at preventing 
infection. And, you know, the reality is, is   all these meta-analysis and all this data 
we just talked about with ivermectin,   this was not when Delta was the dominant variant. 
We don't really know what ivermectin even does   with, you know, the Delta variant. I haven't 
seen data really showing how ivermectin,   you know, affects Delta variant. So I think 
that's also something to consider as well. [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. That's a great point. And, 
you know, FoundMyFitness even more than MedCram,   we've been talking about things that you can do, 
things that are easy for you to do like sleep.   We talked about vitamin D. We're not opposed...I 
mean, look at our video histories, our respective   video histories, we are all in for trying to take 
control of your health care, take control of your   life, and to do this. So let's just take the 3,000 
foot level here or the 30,000 foot level. This   vaccine is indicated for this particular virus. 
I mean, I'm not naive to believe that this is   the only pandemic that we're ever going to see in 
our lifetime. It's not the only illness that we're   ever going to have to deal with. Some of those 
other things that we talked about with vitamin D,   with sleep, with exercise, stress reduction, 
fresh air, sunlight, these things have enormous   benefits, not just with COVID-19, but 
every other aspect of our life. And so   again, it's the Swiss cheese model. The 
more slices you have in there, the better. [Dr. Patrick]: 100%. I mean, the low hanging 
fruit is obviously the things that you can do   to improve your lifestyle, making sure your 
vitamin D levels are high enough, you know,   trying to be metabolically healthy, you know, 
eating the best diet or losing weight if   you're overweight or obese, getting good enough 
sleep. All these things are hugely important for   overall health and certainly for immunity. So, 
again, thank you for pointing that out because   it really...at the end of the day, there are so 
many factors that do need to be optimized as well. [Kyle]: Dr. Patrick, this question's for you, 
and it's about transmission. And we know that   the Delta variant has been a game-changer, and 
we've seen the efficacy of vaccines drop to some   degree with regards to do they prevent symptomatic 
COVID-19. And we're also aware that transmission   of the Delta variant may be happening 
among...well, is happening among   fully vaccinated people. So, what are 
your thoughts on this? Should this   shake people's confidence in 
getting a COVID-19 vaccine? [Dr. Patrick]: Well, I think people 
have...it's always easy to make   generalized statements when you see a little 
piece of data coming in, which, by the way,   new data every day, things are changing 
constantly, hard to keep up with. I think   people have made this overarching statement 
that vaccines do not prevent the transmission   of SARS-CoV-2 virus. In other words, they do not 
prevent people from contracting COVID-19. And,   I think, to understand why that is not true, 
we need to start with the word transmission   because there are two major types of transmission 
when we're talking about a viral illness here.   First is called onward transmission, 
and this is the type of transmission   that is more at the individual level. So 
a person becomes infected with a virus.   They have viral particles in their nose, and, you 
know, they're basically shedding viral particles.   And this can be transmitted through aerosols and 
large respiratory droplets to other individuals,   right? So this is the transmission of 
the virus that most people think about.   But there's also what's called its overall 
transmission, and that is the transmission   in an overall population. This is the 
population level. So if we have a treatment   or a vaccine that is able to prevent even a 
small percentage of people from becoming ill,   then it still reduces overall transmission because 
fewer people are actually getting the illness. And so as you mentioned, the Delta variant 
has sort of changed everything because, when,   you know, we had the Alpha variant and even the 
Beta variant, we know that the vaccines in the   United States were largely effective still 
and, you know, in many cases still 90%, 95%   effective at preventing people from even getting 
COVID-19 symptomatic and seeking out health   care. We know that in addition, people that did 
become...that did get infected with SARS-CoV-2   virus, they actually had fewer viral particles. 
They were not transmitting the virus like an   unvaccinated person was. That's all changed with 
Delta. Now we have to aggregate new data, see,   you know, what the data shows. And, I think, 
I would say that the data shows that in about   July of 2021 is when the Delta variant in the 
United States really started to become dominant,   sort of took over. And so there was a large 
study that was done out of the Mayo Clinic.   Many states were involved in terms of like the 
sample population from many different states in   the United States. And this was like 25,000 
people that were vaccinated versus 25,000   people that were unvaccinated. What the 
Mayo Clinic study was looking at first was   vaccine efficacy, like the ability to, you 
know, prevent people from getting COVID-19   and also looked at the efficacy of preventing 
hospitalization. So that's also very important. And so when the Delta variant became dominant, it 
was clear that efficacy for preventing infection   went down. So people that were fully vaccinated 
with the Pfizer vaccine went from an efficacy of   like 88% to 93% or something like that down 
to 41%. So, there was still some efficacy.   In other words, you know, 41% of people that 
were fully vaccinated were still not getting   COVID-19, which means that the Pfizer vaccine 
still reducing overall transmission. And   on a similar level, the Moderna mRNA vaccine 
also had reduced efficacy in terms of   preventing infections, although it wasn't quite 
as dramatic. So the Moderna vaccine is about twice   as protective as the Pfizer vaccine in getting 
a SARS-CoV-2 infection. So that was about 77%   effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. So, 
again, overall transmission is reduced because,   you know, a large percent of people 
that are fully vaccinated with Moderna   are still not getting even infected. That was good 
news. Both vaccines were still quite effective   anywhere from 80% to 97% effective at 
preventing hospitalizations, which is ultimately   the most important thing. As Dr. Seheult pointed 
out earlier in this discussion, you don't want   your hospitals overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients 
because, when your parents have a heart attack,   or if you get in a car accident, or your 
child comes down with a severe form of RSV,   you know, or fill in the blank, you're not going 
to get the care that you need and you deserve.   So it's good to prevent hospitalizations 
because that protects our health care   system from being overwhelmed, 
which is important for all of us. The other thing that was found was that...not 
with the Mayo Clinic study, but there was another   study, a large study that was done out of the 
U.K. and this study showed that this was...the   most interesting thing in my opinion in this 
study, this also included AstraZeneca vaccine   because AstraZeneca has largely been used 
in some European countries like in the U.K.,   that people that were fully vaccinated 
were still...you know, there was still some   efficacy in terms of protecting against, you 
know, getting the virus as I just mentioned   with the Mayo Clinic study something similar was 
found. But when you looked at peak viral load,   in other words, when the virus is at its peak 
for replicating, the peak viral load was similar   in a breakthrough infection from a vaccinated 
person versus a unvaccinated person that had   contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus. And so that 
sort of caused a media frenzy, you know,   to sort of make this general statement 
that vaccines don't prevent transmission.   And it's just not accurate to say that. 
For one, they're still preventing overall   transmission as we just discussed. But two, you 
need to look at overall viral replication. So,   you know, it's not just peak transmission 
that's important. You're transmitting this   virus to other people at many different stages of 
being infected. And so that's exactly what this   pre-print study out of Singapore, which was 
with the Delta variant showed that while initial   viral loads were similar between a breakthrough 
vaccinated case and an unvaccinated person that   had SARS-CoV-2 virus...infected with SARS-CoV-2 
virus, those initial viral levels were the   same. If you followed those individuals over 
time, the vaccinated people cleared the virus   faster than the unvaccinated. So they actually 
had a shorter negative PCR time. If this was true,   you would have the hypothesis that at any given 
time, if you were to take a random person out of   the population and sample their viral load, then 
you would see vaccinated people at any point in   time should have a smaller viral load because 
they're clearing the virus faster. And that's   exactly what this real-time data that's being 
aggregated out of the U.K., it's called REACT   Study, that study found that if you were to take 
a random sampling of people at any point in time,   vaccinated breakthrough cases, they had 
a lower viral load than unvaccinated. So,   I think, with this data, it suggests 
that not only do the vaccines still   prevent...sorry, still reduce overall 
transmission, they also still reduce onward   transmission. They're still affecting transmission 
on multiple levels. And so, I think, that's really   important to keep in mind. In addition to that, 
understanding who gets the breakthrough infection.   Why are 41% of people vaccinated with Pfizer 
still protected from even getting, you know,   SARS-CoV-2 virus? And why are 77% of people fully 
vaccinated with Moderna not getting infected? There was a big study that came out of Israel 
looking at breakthrough infections. Now,   this wasn't necessarily when Delta 
was dominant, but I think it still   is important to keep in mind that what's 
causing these breakthrough infections.   We don't know exactly everything, 
but if you look at this Israel study,   they were looking at health care workers. 
And there was about 15,000 of them basically.   These health care workers, they took blood 
samples, and they could look at their antibody   levels against...these were vaccinated health care 
workers. They could look at their IgG antibodies,   and I'm not sure what other antibodies they looked 
at, but they could look at the levels of them and   quantitate them. And then if they came down with 
a breakthrough infection, they could sort of use   that data and go, ""Oh, could we predict whether 
or not this person came down with a breakthrough   infection based on their antibody levels?"" And 
that's exactly what was found. People that had   lower antibody titers were much more likely to 
get a breakthrough infection than people that   had higher antibody titers. And there was another 
great study that came...it was a Miles Davenport   group, and it published in ""Nature Medicine."" 
And he did this mathematical modeling to predict   breakthrough infections. And what he found was 
that it seems as though, according to his model,   people need a six-fold higher antibody titer level 
to be protected from contracting SARS-CoV-2 virus.   Then they need to be protected from being 
hospitalized from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In other   words, you need a much lower antibody level or 
titer to prevent yourself from being hospitalized,   but you need a higher level to prevent yourself 
from actually contracting the virus itself. [Dr. Seheult]: So what Dr. Patrick has told us 
is that there is a difference that you have to   look a little bit deeper. I was able to find 
a pre-print of an article that just came out   a couple of weeks ago that looked at the quality 
of those viral particles that are shed from those   that have breakthrough infections. So in other 
words, is it possible that the shedding of the   virus that comes from unvaccinated are the same 
as vaccinated. And what this pre-print showed   very interestingly if you look at this graph, 
here we have the amount of viral load being   shed on the X-axis, and on the Y-axis, what they 
did was they tried to see what was the chances   of these viral particles of actually growing in a 
viral culture, kind of a surrogate to successfully   infecting the next person. What you can see here 
is the dark blue are those that are unvaccinated,   and the light blue are those that are vaccinated. 
You can clearly see here that at any given viral   load, the vaccinated health care worker in this 
study from the Netherlands was shown to have a   less likelihood of infecting somebody based 
on viral culture. So, not only do we see with   the vaccinated less breakthrough infections, 
and when there are breakthrough infections,   they are cleared faster. But we're also seeing 
that the viral particles that come out of   vaccinated people are less likely to infect. 
And that's important because there has been   some talk going around that it's the vaccinated 
people that are transmitting the virus more   and causing these outbreaks to those that 
are unvaccinated, and those are the ones   that are showing up to the hospital. But clearly, 
here, the data is showing that is not the fact. [Dr. Patrick]: Oh, just to 
add to that, Dr. Seheult,   that is very interesting...that the study 
is very interesting because the way that   researchers are measuring, you know, 
peak viral load is through real-time PCR,   and real-time PCR can actually be detecting 
dead viral particles. That makes a hypothesis   even quite likely that there are some dead viral 
particles, which you would even...you'd sort of,   you know, theorize would be true because, if you 
do have antibodies against the spike protein, that   your immune system would start to kill or to, you 
know, clear the virus that you're being exposed to   since you have some antibodies, you'd think there 
would be some effect. So that's very interesting. [Dr. Seheult]: Right. It boils down to the 
thing that I've heard that explains this as PCR   is a way of looking...it's kind 
of like looking at dead body parts   and assuming that those dead body parts are 
alive. All it's looking for is parts of the virus,   and parts of viruses don't infect. 
They just make PCR positive. [Dr. Patrick]: Right. Exactly. The question is, 
is like how many of those viral particles are   actually even alive. If they were alive, you 
would imagine that when you put them in culture   that they would replicate. 
So, very interesting study. [Kyle]: Dr. Patrick, I've heard some people 
say that the vaccines themselves might be   contributing to putting certain pressures on the 
SARS-CoV-2 virus, specifically this idea that the   vaccines can make the virus actually more deadly 
or more virulent. What are your thoughts on that? [Dr. Patrick]: I certainly like coming into   hearing these statements, which I've heard 
and it's proliferated on many different   areas of the blogosphere and people that...you 
know, friends of friends, you know, etc.   My first thought was, well, if this is...we need 
to know whether or not this is true because,   if it is, it changes everything in a way, 
right? You don't want to make a virus,   you know, more deadly to the unvaccinated. And 
that's kind of what the general statement is,   is that vaccines are causing selective pressure 
for the virus to mutate into a more virulent form,   which is more dangerous and deadly to the 
unvaccinated. Nobody wants that. Like if that   were the case, I mean, all of our children are 
unvaccinated. So, you know, as a parent, to me,   I wanted to get to the bottom of this and 
understand, is this something to be concerned   about because, if it is, it's a game changer in 
my mind. So, as a non-evolutionary biologist,   I went on a path to trying to understand to the 
best of my knowledge, you know, the literature and   what the literature out there says on how viruses 
evolve and what the selective pressure is and,   you know, what that typically, you know, entails. 
And so from all of my reading and understanding,   again, I'm not an evolutionary biologist, to 
me, I came out of it with the understanding that   viruses...the selective pressure on viruses 
is to evolve to become more transmissible.   They are not under a selection pressure 
to become more virulent. In other words,   it's not in their best interest to kill 
their host because, if they kill their host,   then their host can't incubate the virus and allow 
them to reproduce and infect more people. And so   all the studies that I've read outlined that 
there's these factors and that virulence isn't   something that's selected for. It is something 
that happens incidentally to transmission. In   other words, it sort of hitchhikes alongside. 
So, a virus evolves to become more transmissible,   like that is its major purpose. And in some 
cases, if it becomes more transmissible,   sometimes it can also become more virulent. It 
can be more, you know, dangerous to its host. So many of the different studies have outlined 
that there are factors that limit transmission.   So, if something limits the transmission, 
then it's also going to limit the potential   of the virus to become more virulent. And the 
factors that limit transmission are, one, physical   constraints. So, the virus infects human cells, 
and the human cells then make viral proteins,   and, you know, are basically allowing the virus 
to replicate. So, our own cellular machinery,   the ability of our cells to assemble viral 
proteins, the ability of ourselves metabolically   to do it quick enough, like there's a limit 
to that. Like we can only do that so quickly.   So once that happens, then, you know, a virus has 
sort of reached its peak transmissibility in a way   because our cells physically can't do it quicker 
than it's already doing it, if that makes sense.   And so with the Delta variant right now, we 
may be at a peak transmissible...you know,   we may be at the point where our cells can't 
assemble all the viral proteins quick enough   for it to become even more transmissible. We 
don't know. Maybe we're not there yet, but   maybe we are. We have no idea. It's definitely a 
much more transmissible variant. So that's the one   thing that limits the ability of a virus to become 
more virulent is the limitation on transmission. The other thing is host mortality. If a virus 
is killing the host within a certain time frame   before transmission ends, then, you know, you 
start to like not be able to transmit the virus   more, and you're not going to have more variants 
crop up because the host is dying. And so this   is something people have been very concerned 
about with vaccines because the argument is that   vaccines are preventing more...they're preventing 
people from dying from COVID-19, and therefore,   they're going to allow the virus to have a chance 
to mutate into something that is more virulent.   Again, it has to mutate into something that's more 
transmissible, virulent hitchhikers alongside of   that. But if you look at the deaths in COVID-19, 
people that are unvaccinated, or just generally   speaking, people usually die much later than the 
transmission phase. They die, you know, days and   days and days after actually becoming infected 
with SARS-CoV-2. And so the transmission phase   is well over before people are even dying. The 
reality is, is that people that are unvaccinated   have...they're creating these mutations and 
allowing variants to evolve even at a greater rate   because, not only are they, you know, able to do 
it even before they potentially succumb to death,   but, you know, the fact that we just talked about 
overall transmission reduced by vaccine, so,   people that are vaccinated are 
less likely to even get infected,   and we talked about onward transmission reduced, 
in other words, people are clearing the virus   faster that are vaccinated than unvaccinated. 
In every sense, people that are unvaccinated,   there's more chances for the virus to replicate 
and to potentially mutate and form another variant   that could become more transmissible, 
and that's potentially more virulent. Now, people are also conflating the vaccine 
escaped immunity. That is a completely different   thing. That is not something that is relevant 
to virulence, if you look at the large body of   scientific literature covering this topic. I 
shouldn't say large body. It's actually quite   limited. So there's no example of human 
vaccines causing a more virulent strain.   There are examples of vaccine escape. So in other 
words, variants crop up that are no longer...that   can evade the antibodies produced by vaccines. 
That's a different thing. That isn't something   that's more virulent. That's something that's 
going to affect people that are vaccinated   because now they're going to be more likely to 
be infected, and their vaccine is less effective.   That's a very different thing than what we're 
talking about, which is the evolution, the   selective pressure on viruses to transmit, become 
more transmissible. And that is the selective   pressure that exists, not virulence. Virulence 
hitchhikes alongside the transmission aspect of   why viruses, you know, mutate basically in the 
selective pressure that's on them to do that. [Kyle]: Dr. Seheult, I want to hear your thoughts 
on that. And also Dr. Patrick mentioned how,   you know, with Delta variant and other variants,   and in the past with vaccines, how 
sometimes a variant can crop up that escapes   vaccine antibodies. Can you talk a little about 
the other big aspect of the immune system,   and that's the T cell response, and how that can 
still offer us a lot of protection potentially? [Dr. Seheult]: Sure. Yeah. So first of 
all, in order for you to have variants,   you have to have replication because it's the 
errors in replication that cause variance.   And so the only way you can have 
replication is if you have viruses   in hosts. So, if you look at the examples that 
we have, whether it's Alpha, Beta Gamma, Delta,   most of these variants, if not all of them, came 
from populations that were not vaccinated. Now,   India's done a great job at producing vaccines, 
and they're well on their way to vaccinating   their population, fortunately. But 
the Delta variant came out early on   when they were not having a lot of people 
vaccinated. Same thing with the South African   variant, and the P1 that came out of Brazil. This 
was during a time where there was not vaccinated.   If it was vaccination that caused variance, then 
we should be seeing variants coming out of Israel,   in the United States. These are probably the two 
most vaccinated countries in the world. And that's   just certainly not the case. Now, in terms of 
B cell, or I should say antibodies, antibodies   are very important when it comes to neutralizing a 
virus that is outside of your cells predominantly.   So, neutralizing it before they become inside 
your cells, before they infect the cells,   that's very, very important. But there's 
a whole another aspect to the immunity   that help in terms of hospitalization, 
in terms of those memory T cells,   and that is what we just mentioned was the T 
cells, the cytotoxic T cells and the rest of it. What's interesting that I found about 
T cells is that when they reproduce,   they also reproduce in a way where they put 
errors in there so that as the virus may mutate,   there seems to be some evidence that the T 
cell response may be able to anticipate and   mutate along with it. Now, that's not 100% science 
yet, but there seems to be some evidence of that   at least in the research articles that I've read. 
And if you look at what's happening right now with   the Delta variant in Israel, in the United States, 
we see a reduction in the ability of the vaccines   to reduce transmission, right? So with the Delta 
variant, instead of the 80% to 90% that we enjoyed   early on in the pandemic, it's been knocked down 
somewhat. But we really haven't seen an erosion   to that extent in prevention of hospitalization 
and severe disease. That has more to do with T   cell responses in cytotoxic because by this point, 
the virus is inside the body already inside the   cells. And antibodies have very limited ability 
to take care of those types of situations. So,   the immune system is very complex, and I 
think we need to just sort of look back and   always couple our in vitro hypotheses with 
real-world data. And so far the real-world data   is still holding up in terms of 
prevention of severe disease. And I'd also like to add, there's been some 
sort of a false equivalence, if you will,   that is made in terms of what we know that 
overuse of antibiotics can cause bacterial   resistance to those antibiotics. And there's 
no question about that. That's a whole other   topic of discussion, the overuse of antibiotics 
in humans and in animals especially. And that   gives rise to these superbugs that emerge that are 
no longer susceptible to the antibiotics that we   have, but that's a different situation. That's 
where the antibiotics that are being used are   basically selectively killing out 
all of these susceptible bacteria   and only leaving those that are resistant. So in 
other words, the resistant bacteria already exist,   but we're knocking out the bacteria that are 
susceptible and allowing the resistant forms   to produce. That's very different than what 
we're talking about with vaccines because,   in the terms of vaccines and viruses, the 
resistant viruses don't exist. What allows them to   be created is the ability to replicate. Okay. And 
that's very different with bacteria. In bacteria,   very few resistant bacteria are occurring 
because they're being allowed to replicate.   The only way that they can become resistant 
is if they acquire DNA that gives them,   they're called plasmids or vectors that allow 
antibiotic resistance to then be incorporated in   their DNA. That's not the case with viruses. 
Viruses and bacteria are very different. [Kyle]: Dr. Seheult, I think the most 
common reason I've heard for people   choosing not to get the vaccine is that they 
feel like the process may have been rushed,   that there isn't enough long-term data yet. They 
may be willing to get the vaccine at some point,   but they will, you know, look at the 
historical timelines for vaccines   and realize that it takes often 10 years, you 
know, maybe the average for a vaccine to actually   be manufactured and go through the 
authorization and approval process.   What are your thoughts about this sentiment? And, 
you know, do you feel like the vaccine was rushed?   Do you feel like we can trust the process in 
this case with this particular technology? [Dr. Seheult]: That's a great question. So there's 
no question in my mind and anyone else's that this   process was accelerated. No question about it. 
The question is, is was the quality of the product   compromised by the acceleration of the process? 
And here you can see on the screen a typical   vaccine timeline. If this was done under normal 
situations, we would have started in 2020,   and we wouldn't have had a product until 2034. 
And the reason for that is because there is risk   in making these vaccines, but there's also 
processes that they have to go through.   So there is the research that has to happen. 
Then there's the pre-clinical trials, the bench   top trials, and then phase one, to figure out the 
right dose, phase two, to do the small randomized   controlled trials to see if there are problems, 
then finally, the big phase three trials,   leading up to building the factories to make 
these vaccines, and then the manufacturing,   and then the approval process, and then finally, 
the distribution. So what you can see in the   lower portion of that screen is everything got 
compressed. Now, notice that nothing got skipped.   So we still had the phase one trials, and the 
phase two, and the phase three. Some of these   were being run concomitantly, which means at the 
same time. But notice something very interesting.   The factories were being built at the same time 
that the phase one and two trials were being done.   Why is that? Why were they able to do that? 
Because what the government did by stepping   in and providing them money and resources and 
providing those barriers is they're saying, ""Look,   we'll give you the money to build the factories,"" 
realizing that if these phase one, two,   and three trials are a bust, you're 
not going to be held liable for the   amount of money that you've spent in building 
these factories that aren't going to do anything.   And so that was one of the major barriers to 
getting this thing done was the risk that the   companies would not normally be willing to take 
on these vaccines. But the government was saying,   ""We don't want you to take that risk. We 
want you to get those things started."" Now, this sort of thing has happened 
before. If we go back to World War II,   and we talk about the Nazis and World War II 
and the tremendous machinery that they had   and the amazing amount of the war machine of 
the Nazis, what happened was Franklin Delano   Roosevelt sat down with a guy by the name of 
William Knudsen, who was basically the most   powerful man in terms of...in Detroit and the auto 
manufacturing process. And he basically offered   him a salary of $1 to basically coordinate the 
infrastructure plan to build the war machine that   would be able to go against Hitler. This is what 
William Knudsen, the president of General Motors,   said in a meeting of the executives. 
Basically, the first half of 1941 is crucial.   He said, ""Gentlemen, we must outbuild Hitler,"" 
and that's exactly what he did. There was a point   in time in Detroit where they were at the Ford 
manufacturing plant putting out a B-24 Liberator,   which is a large plane with four engines, at the 
rate of one per hour. That was because the entire   infrastructure of the United 
States was turned towards one goal,   and that was defeating Hitler in World War II. And 
the same thing happened with the implementation   of the project of coming forth with a vaccine. 
Now, some of the vaccine companies took advantage   of the funds. Others did not. But the bottom line 
is, is that those barriers that created a lag   time because of risk, because of money, those 
sorts of things were completely eliminated,   and they were able to speed up the production 
of the vaccine. Now, the phase one trial still   happened. The animal studies still happened. No, 
the animals did not die in the production. In   fact, it was because the animals did so well that 
they were able to go to phase one, two, and three. The other aspect of this that is tossed 
around is that this is new technology.   Now, I know that Dr. Patrick knows more 
about the technology in terms of the history,   but I will just give you a very short timeline. 
Back in the 1990s, we injected for the first time   mRNA into the muscle cells of a mouse, for the 
very first time. By 2005, we had modified the   nucleotides, which are the signaling in that 
mRNA vaccine to get around early destruction.   So the problem early on was that we couldn't 
allow these messenger RNA molecules to last   long enough to make the protein product. 
The problem wasn't that they lasted forever.   It was that they didn't last long enough, but they 
were able to finally figure out how to do that.   And by 2013, they started working on medications 
that were based on mRNA. And then finally,   we have the vaccines. Here is a paper that 
was published in 1990, so over 30 years ago,   that was for the first time showing that this 
technology actually had viability. And so this   technology is not new. It's been around for 30 
years, and it's been looked at. And with that,   I'll turn it over to Dr. Patrick. I 
think she has some more details on this. [Dr. Patrick]: Yes. I do. You know, in 
addition to this technology not being   new in the sense that everyone...most people think 
this is the first time it's actually been used   in humans, just to kind of speak to your point 
about the acceleration of the process of getting   this vaccine into people, and you were talking 
about all the money that's available for building   the factories, I think another really important 
thing to point out is the difference between   this vaccine and our history of vaccines in 
terms of how we make them. For the mRNA vaccines,   all you need is the sequence. That's all you need 
to make it. And it's so easy to make in mass,   mass, mass quantities versus having to actually 
grow vaccine in some kind of animal cell type. And   like, I mean, you're limited. There's a limitation 
in how much of it you can make, physically,   limitation. So, just going back to the actual 
history of mRNA vaccines and this mRNA technology   in humans. In 2001, we have the first clinical 
trial of this mRNA technology that was made. It   was mRNA-induced dendritic cells. In 2009, we have 
another clinical trial where mRNA was used as a   therapeutic. In 2014, there's the first mRNA 
vaccine in terms of immunotherapy for cancer, so   trying to treat cancer with mRNA vaccines. These 
are all in humans. In 2017, there were 2 clinical   trials, one for mRNA-based vaccine for influenza, 
and another one for mRNA technology used to treat   patients with heart...basically had 
heart failure, and they were injecting   mRNA vaccines into their heart. So, we've got a 
lot of clinical data dating back to 2001 where   we've been using this technology in humans, you 
know. So this is not the new technology that   people in their minds they think that this is the 
first time it's ever been used in humans and how   scary that is. It dates back to decades, well, you 
know, a couple of decades being used in humans. To kind of add to that, I really...moving forward, 
it's amazing how this field has exploded in terms   of all the clinical trials now being started 
and planned for this mRNA technology. There is   so much interest, and there's a lot of funding 
now to understand this technology as a therapeutic   for infectious diseases in addition to the 
SARS-CoV-2 virus for other ones. There are   now clinical studies that are now starting to look 
at this technology to treat genetic disorders like   muscular dystrophy where there's no treatment 
that exists. Can you imagine being the parent   of a son that has muscular dystrophy and knowing 
there is no treatment and having to watch your son   degenerate and die? I mean, we may see a 
treatment for muscular dystrophy in our   lifetime because of this. It's accelerated and 
exploded this clinical arena where now we're   seeing tons and tons of trials for mRNA vaccines 
as immunotherapy for cancers where they're going   to be injecting this mRNA technology into a 
variety of different types of solid tumors.   And again, we may very well in our lifetime now 
see a cure for different types of solid tumors.   Solid tumors are the type of cancers that are 
hardest to treat with chemotherapy because   they often grow far away from blood vessels. 
And so blood vessels, you need them to be close   to the cancer site because that's how the 
chemotherapeutic gets, you know, delivered   to the tumor site. And so you'll get these tumors 
growing far away from them. They're what's called   hypoxic. They're growing far away from blood 
vessels. And so it's one of the reasons why many   different solid tumors are resistant to many types 
of chemotherapeutic treatments. So imagine being   able to directly inject the tumor with this mRNA 
technology where we're going to, you know, test a   variety of different immune generating, you know, 
molecules and things that are going to activate   the immune system to go right directly to that 
tumor and kill it. It's a very exciting time, and   I understand that people are scared because it's 
new to them. And it's always scary when something,   you know, is new, and there's change. But there's 
a bright side, and that bright side is, is that   science is moving forward at an accelerated rate. 
And we are witnessing something that would have   not have happened otherwise without this terrible 
pandemic that obviously a lot of bad has come out   of. But, you know, to try to see the silver lining 
here, the good out of it is that the science   has really catapulted forward, and there's some 
exciting stuff going on with the mRNA technology. [Kyle]: Thank you for that. Definitely 
good to have some silver linings right now.   And before we sign off, any items 
that we didn't cover that you want to? [Dr. Seheult]: I was just going to say 
this, Kyle, is to keep in mind this   image in your mind that I've got here on the 
screen, and that is the U.K.'s second wave,   which was non-Delta, and then the third 
wave, which was Delta. I want the audience   to sort of keep this in mind when it comes to 
the vaccines and what they can potentially do.   In the second wave, which is in red, the left 
half of that shows how quickly the infections   rose as time went on. And concomitantly, on the 
other side of it, on the right side, you can see   how quickly deaths unfortunately also 
rose in that second wave. And that's   without the vaccine. That's without the vaccines 
that we currently have now. And then the third   wave came, which was Delta wave, and what 
you can see there, which is a stark departure   from the wave on the left, is that while you 
have the increasing amount of infections,   which are basically positive PCRs as we've talked 
about, what's missing there from that is the   increased amount of deaths in that third wave. And 
that is with the vaccine, and that's something to   keep in mind that I really want to make sure 
the audience understands is when you hear   news stories talking about the decreased 
effectiveness of the vaccine, make sure that   you understand that they're talking about their 
ability to prevent infections. What they're not   talking about at least up to this point 
in time and with the Delta variant   is that we're still holding on its ability 
to prevent hospitalizations and deaths. Now, there is some data 
that is coming out of Israel   where at least some experts believe that that 
ability to hold may be waning in the most   elderly and in those that have been vaccinated 
the longest. And that's where we're talking   about booster shots and things of that nature. 
I think that data as we're talking right now   at the beginning of September is still needing to 
be settled. The FDA is still looking at that and   deciding whether or not booster shots are 
going to be offered and to whom and when.   And so we don't have the science on 
that settled as yet. But I still want to   at least make sure that people understand, that's 
an issue for people that have been vaccinated for   six to eight months already. That's not an issue 
for those that have not yet been vaccinated   and are concerned about where the Delta variant is 
especially in those states right now where Delta   is raging. So, I just wanted to leave that as a 
general point and as really the motivation for   me and I'm sure for many others in making these 
kinds of videos so people can understand that. [Kyle]: Well, thank you both so much for your time 
and all the information today and throughout this   pandemic. Thank you for empowering people to 
better understand the data and the science of   this pandemic and also ways that they can optimize 
their own health and immunity. And I want to thank   everyone who tuned in for this discussion and made

70,IxCHv7T_mao,Would I Take a COVID Vaccine?,"A thing I really wish I'd had time to say in this video...now that we have vaccines that will be being distributed within 30 days, it is even more valuable to stay home, wear masks, and prevent the spread of this disease. Before now, we were buying time for some eventual moment that we didn't even know would come. Now we are buying time for a goal we can actually see...and a goal that isn't far off.

Vaccines prepare the immune system, getting it ready to fight disease-causing organisms, called pathogens. A vaccine is introduced to the body to mimic infection, triggering the body to produce antibodies against the pathogen, but without causing the illness. Conventional vaccines usually contain a weakened or inactivated pathogen; or a piece of a protein produced by the pathogen, called an antigen. 
RNA vaccines are a new generation of vaccines. Instead of the antigen itself, RNA vaccines contain a messenger RNA – mRNA - that encodes for the antigen. Once inside the body’s cells, the mRNA is translated into protein, the antigen, by the same process the cells use to make their own proteins. The antigen is then displayed on the cell surface where it is recognized by the immune system. From here, the sequence of events is similar to that of a conventional vaccine.
Some RNA vaccines also contain additional mRNA coding for an enzyme, which, after being translated in host cells, can generate multiple copies of the antigen-encoding mRNA. This essentially amplifies the production of antigen from a small amount of vaccine, making the vaccine more effective. These are called self-amplifying RNA vaccines. 
RNA vaccines are easier and safer to produce than conventional vaccines. This is because mRNA molecules can be synthesized in a cell-free system using a DNA template with a sequence of the pathogen; while conventional vaccines usually require a more complicated and risk-prone process of growing large amounts of infectious pathogens in chicken eggs or other mammalian cells. Without the risks of being contaminated by infectious elements or allergens from egg cultures, RNA vaccines are also safer for patients.
Because protein synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm, RNA molecules do not need to enter the nucleus, so the possibility of them integrating into the host cell genome is low. RNA strands are usually degraded by cellular enzymes once the protein is made.
The relative simplicity of the production process makes it easier to standardize and scale, enabling rapid responses to emerging pandemics. Other advantages include lower production costs, and the ease of tweaking RNA sequences to adapt to rapidly-mutating pathogens.
On the minus side, it can be challenging to deliver mRNA effectively to the cells, since RNA sequences and secondary structures may be recognized and destroyed by the innate immune system as soon as they are administered intravenously. These limitations can be overcome by optimizing codons, using modified nucleosides to avoid recognition, and packaging RNA into protective nanoparticles. 
Another disadvantage is that most RNA vaccines require uninterrupted refrigeration for transportation and storage, which can be a hurdle for vaccine distribution.

74,sidjKoHS6NE,British regulators limit covid vaccines,"JCVI makes interim recommendations to government on the COVID-19 vaccination programme for 2023.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-advises-an-autumn-covid-19-vaccine-booster

https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/covid-19-vaccination-programme

Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)

has advised that plans should be made for those at higher risk of severe COVID-19 to be offered a booster vaccination this autumn (2023).

Professor Wei Shen Lim, Chair of COVID-19 vaccination on the JCVI

As the transition continues away from a pandemic emergency response towards pandemic recovery,

In England, the closure of the autumn booster campaign and the first booster offer will be on 12 February 2023. 

(basically no more boosters for healthy under 50s)

Similarly, the JCVI is advising that the primary course COVID-19 vaccination should move, 

over the course of 2023, towards a more targeted offer

Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine

https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/

Everyone aged 5 (on or before 31 August 2022) and over can get a 1st and 2nd dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.

https://www.sst.dk/en/English/Corona-eng/Vaccination-against-COVID-19

we recommend vaccination of people aged 50 years and over as well as selected risk groups.

Regulator funding

Industry money saturates the globe’s leading regulators.",2023-01-25,702061,37868,7234,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg, what a warm welcome just a brief evening update for Wednesday the 25th I wanted to bring you this sort of hot off the press it's from The Joint Committee on uh vaccination and immunization and basically what they're saying is as from the 12th of next month healthy under 50s are not going to be eligible for covert vaccination in the UK some might say this is a sensible targeting of resources as we move towards endemicity others might suggest it's uh frantic backpedaling the report is written in very positive language about this move to a more rational distribution of resources nothing about side effects nothing about adverse reactions nothing about changing risk benefit analysis some of you might find what I'm about to say fairly pathetic but let's do it anyway jvci makes uh recommend interim recommendations and we can expect these to be taken up by the government of course has advised that plans should be made for those at higher risk of severe covid-19 to be offered to booster vaccination this Autumn so looking at head so it's not saying that young people are at minimal risk especially in the age of Omicron it's not saying that we've now got huge amounts of natural immunity it's not saying we've now got huge amounts of mucosal immunity no it's just a simple rationalization and targeting of of resources Professor Lim chair as the transition continues away from a pandemic emergency response towards pandemic recovery yep in England at the closure of the Autumn booster campaign will be on the 12th of uh February 2023 still over two weeks away I guess um two and a half weeks away basically it means no more boosters for health healthy under 50s which we are of course very pleased to um very pleased to see uh similarly the jvcis advising that the primary course of covert vaccination should move over the course of 2023 towards a more targeted offer so this is going to include primary immunization as well as the boosters fairly soon and this is all here really for yourself it's just put in language which makes everything sound so positive there's no mention of anything negative it really does strike me as being it's not written in a genuine way as far as I can see but but there we go now the current recommendations in the UK oh there's also another document here um that that is linked to covert vaccination program this is actually the official document oh uh blood clotting myocarditis and pericarditis and Guillain-Barre syndrome um I guess it's not any longer possible to ignore these uh adverse reactions what's the word that describes that there's a word they use um rare that's it these rare these rare reactions so it's good to see some honesty at least on on that site there now at the moment in the UK and um let me just read it um coronavirus covert vaccinations in the UK everyone age five on or before the 31st of August 2022 I know we can get a first and second dose of the covid-19 vaccine at the moment in my country you can take a perfectly healthy child in to see a professional health care advisor Healthcare practitioner and they will inject a healthy five-year-old child with a messenger ribonucleic acid vaccine that is the current position in my country at the moment I'm not allowed to disagree with this um I merely reported there you go that's the advice there from my government enough of that now Denmark of course is ahead of the uh the curb somewhat as usual um here's the the Danish government site they've already actually adopted this position very kind of the Danish authorities of course to make a full copies available of their documentation in English saves me using Google translate we recommend vaccination of people age 50 years and over as well as selected risk groups so ahead of the game other countries have got to move to this pretty soon haven't they I mean they simply they simply have to the risk of severe disease in young people from Omicron who have been previously exposed to The Vibes and we all have been previously exposed now it's absolutely minimal risk benefit analysis has changed as I've been saying for um well now what we are yeah for over a year now for over a year now radical change now just to finish off on a completely separate matter and this is nothing to do with the history of the MRNA vaccines of course um regulatory funding this article in the British medical journal now the British medical journal says industry money saturates the global leading Regulators not my words British medical journal that's what they say saturates and here we have a table in I'm aware you won't be able to see this I'm going to read some of the uh some of the Salient points about industry money uh proportion of the budget derived from industry so this is it here so Australia it's uh 96 percent Europe it's 89 United Kingdom it's only 86 percent so that means in the United Kingdom 86 of The Regulators money comes from industry and I don't imagine it's you making industry to you in the United States it's actually quite a bit lower it's only 65 percent now of course no one's saying that the fact that Australia get 96 of the money that the Europe get eight to nine percent of the money that UK get 86 of the money the Japan gets 85 of the money that the U.S Regulators get 65 in Canada only 50.5 no one's saying any of these huge percentages have any influence on their decision making of course we merely report what is in the British medical journal the various other things that the bmj has kept this in the public domain so check it out for yourself so there you go um if there was anyone here that wants to rush out and get a vaccine who's healthy below the age of 50 before the expiry time in the UK you've got until the 12th of January um I won't be rushing my last vaccine was on the uh it was November 2021 I haven't had one since then can't tell you what to do of course but I haven't had one since 2021. so there we go uh change from the jvci all in very positive uh language as they move towards consolidation and targeting I'll leave you to make what you like of that but thank you for watching

#davidpakmanshow #covid #vaccine",2024-03-09,94934,4239,2255,UCvixJtaXuNdMPUGdOPcY8Ag," let's go to Matt from New York City Matt from New York City Welcome to the program what's on your mind today hey can you hear me yes I can oh awesome so I just wanted to bring up the vaccine debate um I think it's really concerning with um where excess deaths are right now we're seeing about since the vaccine roll out it's about 600700 100,000 excess deaths and excess deaths is uh deaths over the fiveyear average so these are non-co deaths as well so I think it's really concerning especially with how bad myoc cardias is right now blood plots um I hate to interrupt are you saying that are I can't tell if you're saying the vaccine has caused all this stuff or you're concerned not enough people are getting vaccinated which are the two who is it no I'm saying that these excess deaths and a lot of people have had very bad adverse effects to the vaccine I know two people um that have had very very bad effects to it right after their booster so I don't know why we're not this isn't being investigated with hundreds of thousands of excess deaths and Co is over so if they're going to have a calendar all throughout 2020 2020 how many people are dying from covid why did it stop because deaths right now are even worse so let's go through a CLE couple things here Matt hold on a second Matt you're I I I have to you're saying so many things that are wrong that I have to try to correct some of them and then you tell me where I'm misund understanding so covid is certainly not over in terms of people are still dying from covid part of the reason why we don't know the the number is a lot of states are not reporting it properly or they're reporting on aay LA or they're not reporting at all so people are definitely still dying of covid we don't really know the exact number because I don't think it's being tracked accurately so in that sense covid isn't over what is the case is that increasingly covid including by the CDC is being treated more and more like any other respiratory virus and whether that makes sense or not that's that's a debate but so for isolation and and economic reasons we're seeing it treated more more like the flu and bronchitis sort of Stuff Etc um but that so that's number one number two I'm not aware of anyone who died from myocarditis from the vaccine it is true that the vaccine elevates the risk particularly of men of a certain age of getting myocarditis covid elevates it even more but I'm not aware of a single vaccine death that was because of myocarditis can you cite one um not my carditis not personally got it um my my dad he's 65 years old never had a heart problem um he had basically two minor heart attacks uh five days after the first booster so here's the tough thing about Dad Matt about about that an anecdote about your dad Matt um obviously that's that's terrible I'm so sorry that that happened one of the things that makes this really tough is when you have you know a 4-year pandemic and a whole bunch of people go from being 61 to 65 that's an age at which lots of people start having heart problems and if we are just to look anecdotally and say well he was fine after a bunch of his vaccines but after one he had a heart event it's really difficult to take that and to say the vaccine caused it and it causes it at scale per the the the epidemiological data doesn't bear that out right and so no matter what we want to take care of your dad we want to take care of your dad's heart cardiovascular health but it's it's a bit out of the empirical realm when you make a comment like that and say obviously it's because of the vaccine the vaccine causes heart attacks no no I'm not saying obviously so and and my best friend who's also my CPA um he got he has extreme heart palpitations now he was all about the vaccine he said you know you have to get it you have to get it and now he said that there's no way that it wasn't caused from the uh vaccines he's got now a heart monitor he's he's CPA not a doctor but he but so so I think that that's important right well his doctor said he brought it up and said listen you know I'm Pro vaccine do you think it could be from the VAC and the doctor said yeah it's very high probability it was but you know the these are things that a lot of doctors aren't supposed to be talking about I don't know on what basis you say they're not supposed to be talking about it who tells doctors not to talk about it well I mean that's that's the the question I mean it's but the the reason I'm asking you is you're saying doctors are being told not to talk about it how do you know that who's telling them well that's I that's what my friends said he he said we're not supposed to be talking about this um but why does your friend think that who to who is directing that we're not supposed to talk about it oh that I don't know who who knows so you know but in 20120 just to Pivot to a different point in 2019 average deaths out of 100,000 was 8.8 people out of 100,000 in 2020 it was 8.9 out of a 100,000 in 2023 it's 9.3 now of course you can say oh well population growth right no but you're talking about a rate so it wouldn't population growth wouldn't affect that because it's per 100,000 so let let me give you a couple of reasons why it's let me give you a couple reasons so this is still being studied but there's a few different reasons number one the the population on average continues to age and so if you have two populations and one population is on average older all else being equal they'll have a higher death rate because overall older people are more likely to die than younger people so as you know we continue to see the Baby Boomers enter retirement we are skewing increasingly due to the lower birth rate and Baby Boomers aging to a slightly older population so that's going to tick up your death your all cause mortality rate slightly another reason why it is believed that the death the the all cause death rate is up up a bit um is because of the squil a or the ongoing effects of this period during covid when people were foregoing uh screenings preventative uh uh exams and lots of things which led to issues not being diagnosed as early as they could be and the longer term effect of that is that some of those folks are now dying now I understand some people think oh the vaccine is killing people there's just no evidence of that and we do have other evidence that points in other directions does that make sense Matt I think you bring up a good point with people not going for screenings there were the lockdown you know says stay home in 2020 2021 that definitely was not good for people um but listen in 2021 there was 150,000 EXs deaths they said it's not from covid I mean that's that but hold on a second Matt hold on a second mat hold on I'm sorry to interrupt Matt I'm sorry to interrupt Matt you first were talking about the rate which made a lot of sense to me because then we're really talking about population adjusted numbers now you're talking about uh just raw numbers of deaths why did you switch from one to the other after agreeing that the rate was much more informative to us well I'm not agreeing that that is the sole cause of why the death rate per 100,000 is continuing to go up okay but that was not um that could you know contribute to it but mat listen I just want to get to kind of where you're at on this let's do real quick do you think the vaccines are are causing these deaths I I think it's absolutely I think it's caused potentially 100,000 to 200,000 deaths in this country okay and so like when when Brett Weinstein said he thinks the vaccine might have killed 17 million people you think that number is crazy uh I I think that's High I mean that's globally you know it's it's it's very difficult because this stuff is not being investigated so many people are dying life insurance companies are saying these are workingclass younger people that are making up a lot of these excess debts which is very the covid vaccine has killed a couple hundred thousand people and what do you want done real quick I would like it to be uh talked about on mainstream media I mean I listen I'm very into I don't like Biden I don't like Trump I think uh the government's very corrupt I know you probably wouldn't agree with that I think there's just tons of corruption and I think it's being all brushed under the rug we have a serious epidemic right now where young people are dying I don't know if you looked into that but the the the sudden sudden cardiac death of young people has actually not increased so listen um I've given you a bunch of time I think you've laid out your your beliefs a lot of those beliefs are based in false Notions and you've got the facts wrong but I appreciate you calling in and respectfully telling me what you believe I think it'll be interesting to the audience sure butd keep it up all right there we go Matt with a lot dumping massive dumps of of claims there uh let's take a very quick break if you're holding on just hang on another minute and

Twitter: @HillTVLive",2024-01-22,89121,5088,1465,UCPWXiRWZ29zrxPFIQT7eHSA, there's a new report from The Epic Times which seemingly reveals that the CDC drafted an alert for state and local Health authorities about myocarditis and other complications relating to the covid vaccine but for reasons unknown did not send it now this email that the news Outlet obtained allegedly from Dimitri desalis the cdc's top official for equity in covid-19 data and engagement to to two other CDC officials Bears the subject line draft alert on myocarditis and mRNA vaccines desalis adds that this is the most recent draft of an alert as discussed happy to discuss further the email is stated May 21st 2021 3 days later the CDC acknowledged for the first time that reported cases of myocarditis uh existed after receiving a covid-19 vaccination that there were those levels were higher than expected however the agency still recommended that most Americans 12 and older get vac vacinated here to discuss is RAV Aurora an independent journalist at the illusion of consensus podcast welcome back to Rising hey guys great to be here yes thank you for joining us again I turn to you uh whenever there's news on the vaccine and myocarditis front um specifically how significant is this um development that there was this draft email um concerning this issue which you have talked about so much yeah yeah I think there there should have definitely been an alert and some kind of public engagement on this topic and um you saw there was some early reporting just a couple days prior in The Epic Times as well that Zachary styberg great credit to him for this fantastic reporting um about how in in in April um the CDC I believe April 27th the CDC said um relle binsky in this uh White House Press briefing that they had deliberately looked in over 200 doses uh given to the American public of the MRNA vaccines and they could not find a myocarditis signal when in fact uh there were hundreds of reports and vs already on myocarditis up until that point uh they had already consulted with the Israeli Ministry of Health with the Department of Defense um and uh there was also the the US military as well that reported on uh cases of vaccine myocarditis in the military which is kind of unsurprising because that's a kind of concentrated group of uh younger males um who are incredibly fit and healthy which uh where myocarditis cases are particularly concentrated yet days later in late April the Public Announcement by the CDC was that there's no signal here and then when you fast forward to may you have this alert that's drafted um and it's it's not clear what the alert was going to say this is very vague um but days later they do acknowledge that there is a vaccine myocarditis issue um but then it's they say that well the cost benefit analysis for teenagers and young adults is still to get vaccinated so they later do acknowledge it but they don't actually change their tune and they continue recommending it which I I think is particularly egregious when at that particular point and afterwards as well we knew the infection fatality rates we knew who was at risk from covid we knew this was primarily concentrated among elderly individuals with comorbidities people who are obese so for the CDC to have all this data already in vs Israeli Ministry of Health Etc um and to have this this proposal for this draft not being shared to the public and instead um days later it being promoted uh to uh Young Americans without any clear evidence of benefit um I think is completely wrong and just shows just how captured these regulatory agencies are uh help me understand Rob because my understanding was that although the there's an argument to be made about the diminishing or marginal benefits of the covid vaccine for younger people without coor comorbidities as you've described there are also when you look when you compare the risks of having heart uh disease as a consequence of covid versus the risk of having heart disease as a consequence of the uh covid vaccine myocarditis as a consequence of the covid vaccine it's still even if you think that all being a wash you shouldn't get the vaccine the the balance comes out in favor of uh being vaccinated in terms of having a lower uh incidence of heart rate at least within every population except for the narrow band of men within a certain age bracket so was it inaccurate for the CDC to advise that there was still some benefit even if it is marginal to Young people getting the vaccine especially given that many young people do in fact have comorbid comorbidities R obes these are not um rare uh rare quantities to have and unfortunately in our population yeah yeah no it was it was completely inaccurate and this particular comparison between hard complications from the vaccine versus covid you know I'm not a cardiologist so initially for me I was looking at this topic um and I was wondering like what's going on here CU you read mainstream media and you read you listen to Peter hotz they're all talking about how the cardiac risks from uh covid are far greater than the vaccine then I interviewed this guy Dr Anish Koka who distributed uh covid vaccines at his own clinic in Philadelphia Koka Cardiology um I highly recommend you check out his stuff I interviewed him and that interview is actually going to be coming out soon there was an earlier article that I did with him and we went over this for like three hours um and I I fact checked him and we did rigorous research and he's still operating the clinic and he explained to me and this really Bears out in the data is that Co viroc caritis from covid is fundamentally different from myocarditis from the vaccine because myocarditis from the vaccine particularly affects younger and healthier people and more importantly than that you can still see myocarditis in people in their 40s and 50s but myocarditis from covid is not the same thing it's not myocarditis in any traditional sense it's more like individuals who are in the hospital who are having multiple complications they're being pushed over the edge uh they have they're having lung issues Brea you know breathing issues uh they might not potentially make it and they're also having cardiac issues and when you test them you find elevated cardiac levels so it's labeled as myocarditis whereas with vaccine myocarditis it's just myocarditis it's not 10 other different things going on and the individual um struggling in the hospital uh with with every last breath it's individuals who otherwise would have been uh healthy so those two groups are very very different so that's actually an apples and oranges comparison which is something that I didn't know initially thankfully now I'm educated on this topic so that comparison doesn't really work when it comes to younger healthier people now Brianna you're absolutely right and this is something um that I've I've debated with some people and talked about is that in the United States comorbidities are real it's not just you know 0.00 something percent of the population there are significant rates um of obesity but when it came to the vaccine discussion the CDC just refused and just were not doing an honest conversation about risks and benefits there was just always this very strange from the outside and to many other scientists very strange like dogmatic approval um and promotion of these covid vaccines in younger Americans when they hadn't done that proper risk benefit analysis right how much are we actually lowering mortality you know what are the risk of myocarditis versus uh you know preventing um hospitalization from covid I mean these kind of conversations were not actually uh being had um you know very clearly and instead they were pushing it uh kind of zealously and then it was left to other uh research agencies like around the world like studies in Thailand and Hong Kong um which I don't know why they had to do those studies and we couldn't do those studies but a lot of those countries actually did the myocarditis studies the rigorous myocarditis studies like subclinical myocarditis and they ended up finding like 1 to 2% of uh young uh adolescents uh young teens uh had gotten some form of subclinical or clinical myocarditis and those rates are absolutely terrifying if if if those rates actually apply some of those studies are very small they're in one 100 or 200 people um but there again we weren't clear on the risk benefit analysis the CDC seem to be clear absent the requisite evidence and instead of being cautious about this and instead of when we're talking in April and May when they had gotten all these reports in v and Israeli Ministry of Health and Department of Defense instead of being like Oh let's let's be careful here let's maybe recommend this to elderly people or to people who are vulnerable the CDC never did that they never did what European countries like Denmark and Sweden and certain Asian countries that here we had this potentially predictably very zealous pharmaceutical traditional American approach where it's all about medication vaccination just you got to take these products by fiser and madna and if you question it then suddenly you're antiva that's not how science should be done and the CDC completely failed in my opinion RAV Aurora thank you so much for joining us today we appreciate it [Music] thanks

78,I3kd5SyYHEE,Myocarditis and coronavirus vaccines: Explaining the rare side effect,"Myocarditis can be a side effect of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines, but studies show that rare heart complications are more likely to occur as a result of coronavirus infections than as a vaccine side effect. In fact, coronavirus patients have 16 times the risk for developing myocarditis, compared to people who are uninfected, according to CDC data released in September.

The Food and Drug Administration authorized booster shots of Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccines for 16- and 17-year-olds on Dec. 9, after analyzing data that shows a link between myocarditis and the mRNA vaccines for male adolescents and young men.

Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at the Yale School of Medicine, said that in addition to the vaccines being highly effective at preventing coronavirus infections, they also provide protection from illnesses linked to the virus, including myocarditis.

“These are highly effective vaccines in preventing covid itself, and that provides a lot of offsetting benefits,” Krumholz said. Read more: https://wapo.st/3GIH4P2. Subscribe to The Washington Post on YouTube: https://wapo.st/2QOdcqK

#covid #medicine #research",2024-03-11,19671,2013,615,UCSxeKmlI8XLrI1eMaqqM-kg, hi good evening I'm Dr Philip McMillan thank you for joining me I've been following the covid story since early 2020 my focus has always been around autoimmunity and so I look at it through a different Paradigm so whenever I speak rarely am I going to be following the narrative so if you expect the narrative this is not the place to come so before I start I'll be looking at this very unusual case of a patient who took over 200 vaccines this is the paper in the lcet and I'll be tying this critically to why it is that I think that the boosted keep on getting reinfected and I'll be using the understanding about IGA antibodies to try and make sense of what is going on so before I start I'd just like to remind remind everyone that if you are interested in courses in more information please look at the links below and that's where we try and share as much as we can about what we see from a different angle so join us on this journey research Journey um be open be interested and I'm sure you'll find valuable information so let's get back to this case here this gentleman in Germany took 27 covid vaccines and what's interesting about this is this has been almost a promotion that goodness safe and effective and I'm thinking this is like the worst example you could ever use to it just doesn't make any sense so this is Gaby that was talking about this hyper vaccinated gentleman and they were focused on what happens when you receive hundreds of doses of the same vaccine and as I said quite a number of people are saying wow this just shows how safe it is but I'm thinking we don't know what are the longer term implications please don't imagine that this is ever a good thing but they did indicate from the paper current Research indicates that a three-d dose vaccination coupled with regular topup vaccines for the vulnerable groups remains a favored approach there is no indication that more vaccines are required so that's what they have said from the paper from the people who had done the paper but as I said if you as long as you're not following a narrative and you actually are trying to understand the science you know where to unpick the data this is why I've said don't tell me what I need to know just give me the data let me interpret it and try and make sense of it and so this is what I'll be quickly doing here so that you can understand so again let's go back to the paper and in this case what they have was a gentleman in Germany who for whatever reason he probably was extremely scared from the um from the the the information going out about the pandemic he was 62 years old he deliberately and for private rece reasons received 217 vaccines against Saras kov 2 within a period of 29 months that's incredible I mean for one I don't even know how it was possible that he got that many without people noticing you know when you have an you can't even get vitamin some kind of of normal therapeutic from the pharmacy because you would need a prescription it just shows you how far the system was pushing this where there was no concern about people who took too much I guarantee you he won't be the only one there'll be many of them out there what are the implications what does it mean longterm we have no no idea and just thinking that it should kill somebody within a few months or a few years of taking it doesn't make any sense that's not how disease works but let's get back to what I think is very important here as I said I unpicked the data and so in order to understand what I've been unpicking you have to look at the supplementary data so this is the supplementary data from the paper this is the lanet and you can see here they then add additional information for people to be able to make sense of it so that's the bit that I was interested in the supplementary appendix and it then rolls down it gives you limitations supplementary methods and so on and it gives you a bit more information about the individual as well as what they were studying and how they were sampling it so this document is often times very very important and it's a critical part of understand understanding what is going on so why is it that I have got here in this blue section this is likely to be the explanation as to why the boosted keep getting infected why would I say that it's because one of the really simple questions is that if you understand how the immune system works the First wall that any virus or bacteria or fungus has to get through is the mucosa layer it is very sophisticated it's not just random it's only when it penetrates that mucosa layer that you can then get infection so this is how the immune system works this is an example of how you have um here this is the mucosal barrier these are the cells and they are producing mucus on top of it to try and block it's a physical barrier to prevent bacteria these here in brown are bacteria from getting in to be able to get through this wall this wall is very important and on this side here I've put a few viruses here this is a virus these are bacteria and what you have to notice here this blue thing that looks like a bone represents secretory IGA and this is what the immune system produces in the mucosal barrier because it defends the body even before the micro M microbe gets in or the virus and you can see here this is a very sophisticated system it gets the antigens this t- cell is then stimulated it differentiates into more te- cells these te- cells then stimulate the B cells the B cells then become plasma secreting B cells to produce IGA they then move along and then they produce the IGA the IGA is then pushed out into the mucus and this is how the body will fight infection right at the front these are your pawns almost right at the front line if you play chess so these are your foot soldiers when you look at old moves they are the ones going first to defend the castle really important part of the immune system and what it will do is in this picture here it will then bind to the virus in terms of sasov 2 this is the virus here this represents the IGA coming it binds to it it then prevents the virus from entering it then gets picked up by other immune cells or it gets flushed out with the mucus you blow your nose or whatever and you get rid of virus so this is an integral part of the mucosal immune system so my question was always why are we seeing the boosted continually getting infected well because they were so busy looking at the benefits of over boosting somebody with 217 vaccines they did an important piece of data they looked at the control group that's a group of people who had three vaccines and they were comparing it to the person who had 217 what were the differences so this is now where it comes down to the data I've taken this from the supplementary data and if you are interested you can look at it but here is what it showing so in Black here represents the antibody level in the control group probably the average and you can see here that they had um between 10 to the 1 and 10 to the two times an anti-spike IGM in serum okay that's in the bloodstream you can see here that his IGM after 2117 doses was just a little bit higher but IGM is the early antibod so maybe that makes sense when you then go on now this is the anti-spike IGA so some of the IGA that is produced in the mucosa alining also gets in the serum and you can see here really interestingly the control group didn't have any not detected he had some again between 10 to the 1 and 10 to the 2 now this is the bit that I'd always predicted that was very interesting to me now look at this here this is Spike specific antibodies in saliva okay IA and technically therefore mucosa in the mucus in the mucosa lining for the control group none detected for IG but for the person who had taken 217 or at the time 215 his levels were significantly higher between 1.2 to 1.4 and this is probably why he didn't get covid infection because this remained High in his saliva for such a long period of time but as I said the answer that's really important is this in the control group who had three doses they had no IGG in their saliva no IG he didn't have it either and no IGA so what it indicates here is that for this person with the high IG in the saliva it means therefore that once his serum antibody level Falls he will have no antibodies in the saliva and most likely therefore in the mucosa it is no wonder then that we see these repeated infections the immune system is is no longer functioning as normal this is what I'm saying so think about this just look at this here and get get your head around this they're no longer producing IGA all that's happening is the mucus they're unable to fight at the front they have no soldiers there on the ground no wonder the virus is able to penetrate and this then causes recurrent infection listen as I said for those who are for following a narrative you'll take a look at that and say he didn't die from 217 vaccines that's great for those who are interested in the science this is very significant it has highlighted some really important points that we need to reflect on how then do we protect the vaccinated cohort who have been boosted who are not having an adequate mucosal response to the virus especially Omicron as it continues to spread what do we do down the line is it that they're suddenly going to start producing these antibodies we don't know but I think that ignoring these patterns or not even reflecting on them only focusing on what appears to be a narrative is it's very dangerous we are in very serious times the virus continues to circulate what are we going to do it's a risk to everybody around in highly vaccinated regions so again as I said if you're interested in more information that doesn't follow a narrative please click on the links below there's a lot more that we have to cover in this period of time so have a great evening and I look forward to sharing some more information with you in the near future thank [Music] you [Music]

Here we are, just a year after the first news of the coronavirus we now call SARS-CoV-2 and the global pandemic known as COVID-19… and scientists have already developed more than one safe & effective vaccine. How did they do that so quickly? I visited the lab whose work directly led to these first COVID vaccines, so you can learn how basic research connects to life-saving medicine. This is how to make a COVID-19 vaccine.

their locks, and hijacking your body. But there IS one way to prevent this. By using one of the virus’s weapons on itself…  Hey smart people, Joe here. Right now, there’s about 7 billion 
people all waiting for the same thing:   A vaccine that will protect us 
from the virus causing COVID-19. And if you’re like me you want to know 
what’s in it…  what makes it work?    Making a vaccine and getting it out to the 
public is a long process with a lot of steps,   so we can make sure the 
vaccine is safe and effective.  And it’s pretty typical for 
that to take ten years or more, In an emergency, like this pandemic, 
well… we can’t skip any of those steps,   but we can speed this up by 
doing some at the same time But none of that can happen until 
you figure out the first step:   What do you put in your vaccine 
that will make it protect people. …and it’s what we’re going to talk about today. We’re gonna visit a lab and meet some 
scientists who study the coronavirus.   We’re also gonna meet a really big Awesome 
Science Machine, and learn how they used   it to design this: the key ingredient 
inside the very first COVID-19 vaccines. Here’s my goal with this video: To show you 
what exactly is in the new COVID vaccines   that makes them work—and how they got 
made faster than any vaccine in history.   My hope is that you’ll be better 
informed when you get your shot,   and you’ll have a new appreciation for 
why science like this is so important. This is how to make a COVID-19 vaccine. It turns out that some of the most 
important research for making the   COVID-19 vaccine is happening 
right down the road from me… …at the University of Texas—which is pretty 
cool. Because I did my PhD right *here*,   and in *here* is the lab of… Dr. Jason McLellan. He studies how pathogens 
like the coronavirus cause disease… There are four human coronaviruses that occur seasonally and generally cause the common cold.   And then there've been three coronaviruses that have caused pandemics.   And that's the first SARS 
coronavirus back in 2002,   the MERS coronavirus in 2012. And now 
SARS-CoV-2, which emerged earlier this year. So at the end of December, 2019, it was on the 
news that there’s these pneumonia clusters in   China. Uh, in the scientific community, we thought 
maybe a new flu virus or possibly a coronavirus.  I was actually snowboarding with my family and 
my collaborator, Barney Graham at the vaccine   research center at the NIH called. And he 
said, he's been in contact with US CDC,   Chinese CDC. Uh, it looks like it's a 
betacoronavirus similar to SARS coronavirus, and   they want it to move rapidly, try and make a 
vaccine. And I said, we're definitely in… So you're just like scrolling 
through your phone. in this ski   lodge, and you're 
like we gotta get to work! So while the rest of us were 
focused on royal family drama   and just hearing the first mentions of 
“coronavirus” for the very first time,   scientists like Jason knew this was serious, 
and they were already getting to work. As soon as researchers in China decoded 
the virus’ genome and published it online,   Jason’s lab could start designing a vaccine…
I texted Daniel Wrapp my graduate student   and let them know be on high alert 
because as soon as we get the sequence,   we're going to race on this thing 
and move as quickly as we can. Jason was on that winter vacation and texted 
me that it was a CoronavirusAnd eventually   in early January, the sequence 
was released online publicly. That's when the clock started ticking because we   knew a bunch of people were 
going to be working on this. Uh, and then things started moving pretty quickly… Let’s step back for a minute. 
What does a vaccine do?   It trains your immune system to 
know what a germ, like a virus,   looks like. So it can recognize the germ, fight it 
off, and keep you safe, without you getting sick. This is the virus that causes COVID-19. 
The outer shell is made of a few different   kinds of proteins, butthese proteins 
sticking off the side are the most   important part. The spike.These spikes are 
what give this family of viruses their name:   The coronaviruses, because 
they look kinda like a crown. The coronavirus uses that spike to sneak 
into our cells. The 3-dimensional shape of   that spike is super important, because that 
exact shape is what lets the virus latch on   to receptors on the outside of our cells … almost 
like picking a lock. And then, it sneaks inside. Those shapes sticking out on the outside of 
a virus are also what your immune system is   feeling for, to figure out if this is a 
foreign invader, if it should attack or not. The problem is, the first time your body sees a 
virus, your immune system responds so slowly that   the virus has time to make gazillions of copies 
of itself, and you can still get very, very sick. That’s what’s great about a vaccine. It 
trains your immune system what to look for,   so when the real virus shows up,   your body can respond super fast—and destroy the 
virus before it has a chance to hijack your cells. So what’s actually in a vaccine? Sometimes, 
a vaccine has a weakened or dead virus.   That’s how polio and measles and 
mumps and some other vaccines work.  But these days, a vaccine usually just 
contains a little piece of the virus. The newest COVID-19 vaccines? 
They’re just the spike. But for that spike to work as a vaccine, to train 
your immune system to recognize the actual virus,   it has to have the same 3-dimensional shape 
as the spike on the whole, complete virus. But making the spike all by itself,   not attached to the rest of the 
virus, turns out to be really hard. Because the spike is actually pretty 
floppy just floating around on its own. It doesn’t look much like the 
spike on the actual virus. And this is the key thing Jason’s lab figured 
out how to make.  For years they’d studied SARS   and MERS viruses, which are really closely 
related to the virus that causes COVID.  So they already knew what tiny tweaks 
to make to freeze coronavirus spikes   in the perfect shape. Um, so we got to work 
designing our stabilizing mutations into the   new spike sequence. There was just two amino acids 
that we knew would, uh, if we mutated them that   would stabilize the spike protein and make it a lot easier to work with in the laboratory. A protein, like the coronavirus spike…  ...is a long, folded string of 
individual units called amino acids. And these strings of amino acids are built 
using code written in RNA, and stored in DNA*. By changing, or “mutuating” the letters of 
DNA code, we can change the amino acids in   our protein string. So that's cool. You're like 
building scaffolding into the protein, to be like   “freeze in this shape.”
   Yeah, that's a good way to put it.  How do you get from there to 
making the actual spike protein? I can show you…  Scientists are able to grow special immortal 
human cells outside the body which they use as   factories. They put a modified gene for something 
like their spike protein, into those cells… …and then they'll start spitting out this protein So they're just pumping it 
out into the liquid, right? Yeah, that's right. They take that liquid, run it through 
special purification machines,   and are able to isolate a pure 
sample of their spike protein. But how do they know for sure 
that this special spike protein   looks like the real thing, 3-D shape 
and all? They take pictures of it… …using a big Awesome Science Machine. (VO) This is a cryo-electron microscope.  This machine took a 3D picture 
of the coronavirus spike,   and helped design the first COVID-19 vaccines Check out the big science machine! It looks like a giant microwave Am I ok to walk up here? Yeah, it’s ok. I mean the room is a million 
dollars, and the microscope is another million.  So you’re saying don’t touch 
this screen right here. You can see the floor is separate 
from the instrument, it’s on its   own, free-floating. So vibrations are bad.
These are wall panels that contain water   running behind them to keep the 
temperature constant in the room. Oh wow, that’s… Then it also has to be 
electromagnetically shielded too.  That is nuts. Look at this beefy cable over here. That’s the high-tension, that’s the 
200,000 volts comin in over here Oh ok, so don’t lick that one! Oh this is… Sciencey! Look at all that science happening in there.  It’s kind of a marvel of physics and engineering. Joe N (OS): Can you play Doom on this thing?  Um, some of our computers you 
can play Far Cry at max settings. So maybe this sounds like a super stupid question,   but why can't you just use a regular light 
microscope to take a picture of a protein? Well, the wavelength of visible light is 
on the order of hundreds of nanometers. And that means the smallest things 
you can see with visible light are   also on the scale of hundreds of nanometers. But what we want to see—the atoms in a 
protein molecule—they’re angstroms apart,   tenths of a nanometer, so 
we can’t use visible light.  We have to use a special electron microscope.
So super high energy electrons make very   tiny wavelengths, which lets you see 
very, very small resolution things. Okay. I want a camera like that. That's 
better than 4k. We can go angstrom-K.  So, to take a 3D picture of a protein 
with a cryo-electron microscope,   first you put a drop of protein 
onto a special metal grid.  Then you freeze it in place with liquid ethane. 
When we shoot a beam of electrons at it,those   proteins will be in all kinds of random 
orientations, some like this, some like that. Each orientation leaves a particular “shadow”. Powerful computers look at all those 2D 
images, and combine them into a final 3D shape. It’s kind of like using a bunch of 2D 
photos of someone’s head to make a 3D model. And when Jason and Daniel and their team 
looked at the spike they made, with their   tiny little tweaks and mutations, their spike has 
the same 3D shape as the spike on the whole virus. Now we can put that spike into people, and see if 
it trains their immune system, and protects them   from the real virus. And? It works. This protects 
people from COVID-19. The research you just saw,   from those scientists, is literally what’s 
being used in the very first COVID-19 vaccines. And some of those vaccines work in a 
really cool way. Instead of having to   make the actual spike protein, in big factories, 
with huge tanks of cells like the ones we saw…   some of these new vaccines, the genetic 
instructions for making the spike is   all that’s in the shot, on a molecule called mRNA. Your body uses those instructions to 
make the spike. YOU are the factory.  That’s awesome. This is a really incredible piece 
of science. A year ago, no one had ever seen this   virus before, and thanks to these scientists 
and thousands of others around the world,   now we have vaccines that work. It’s gonna take months, maybe years to get these 
vaccines, and the dozens of others still being   worked on, to the billions of people that need 
them, and that is a huge challenge on its own. But this is a really hopeful story. No 
vaccine in history has ever been invented   this fast, and we were able to do it safely.  And we were able to do this so quickly 
because scientists like Jason and his lab   and others, they were ready. Because they 
were studying basic scientific questions about   other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, they’ve 
spent years trying to figure out their secrets,   so when this one showed up, they were 
already ten steps ahead. And to me,   that’s why work like this—supporting basic 
research—is so important, and why we need it. Stay curious…"

This video explains what happens in your body when you get the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, including how the vaccine helps your immune system recognize and fight the COVID-19 virus, possible side effects from the vaccine, and how long before you are fully-vaccinated against the virus after receiving the vaccine.

Hash tags: #CoronavirusVaccine #COVID19Vaccine #Coronavirus",2021-08-03,1355030,16191,4411,UC85VW73bQLEjs_taFKP7TwQ," Have you been able to get  your COVID-19 jab yet? Many countries are rolling out the COVID-19 vaccines so that the pandemic will be over  and we can get back to normal. If you’ve never had COVID-19,  your body doesn’t know  how to fight it off. Vaccines help train  your immune system to recognize the virus  and be ready to attack. But as we all have  different immune systems,  we respond differently to the vaccine and the virus. Having side effects has nothing to do  with the effectiveness of the vaccine.   So let's see what's going on  once you get the jab. Congratulations! You’ve just had your first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.  For this episode, we'll be focusing on messenger RNA, or mRNA vaccines. Once it enters your body, the mRNA vaccine instructs your cells  to create a spike protein. This simulates part of the SARS-CoV-2 viral structure  and tricks your body  into believing that it's been infected. The spike proteins will then head to the surface of your cell. Your immune cells will detect these proteins that don't belong  and begin making antibodies. If you happen to catch the virus  in the future, these antibodies will attach  to the spike proteins on both  your infected cells and the coronavirus. This will mark them  for immediate termination by your immune cells. To be clear,  the mRNA does not change your DNA  in any way.  Hear what I say? Once the spike proteins are made,  your body destroys the mRNA.  Five minutes after your vaccine shot,  you'll feel some soreness in your arm. To be safe, the Centers for Disease Control recommends you stay at the vaccination site  for at least 15 minutes in case of a severe reaction. While it's rare, you could have anaphylaxis, which is an immediate allergic response. It causes a series of symptoms such as hives or swelling. Thankfully,  trained healthcare personnel will be available at every vaccination site to treat you immediately with epinephrine. And according to the CDC, you have a greater chance of being struck by lighting, around one in 500,000, than having an allergic reaction. Four hours after your vaccine, you could feel nothing at all. Lucky you. But you could also get a slight headache or a low-grade fever and feel tired. This is perfectly normal and is a sign that your immune system has kicked into action. At this point, you may experience mild symptoms as your body acclimatizes to the vaccine. You might feel tired and feverish. Be sure to get some rest and take the day off work if you need to. After about 48 hours, you should start to feel normal again. So let’s keep going. Okay, if you got the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, you’d need to get your second booster shot three to four weeks after the first dose. Your immune system would be stronger than the first time.  But let’s see how it goes next.  After your second dose, you might feel crummy again.  You could feel tired feverish and you might get the chills.   These reactions are more common after the second dose of the vaccine.  But they’re mainly mild to moderate and usually go away in a day or two. And two weeks after your second shot, you’d be fully vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus. So far, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 illness.  In either case, the vaccine can prevent hospitalization and death in people who have gotten sick. So getting a vaccine is your safest path to protect yourself, your family  and your community against this virus.  It could also help reach herd immunity by having vaccinated people act as a barrier between non-vaccinated people and those who have been infected.

fumble him a little bit was on the vaccine issue hi I've got so much to say but such little time my name is John W and I'm one of the covid vaccine injured in this country I want you to look into my eyes R soon I and I want you to look at the pain the trauma and the regret I have in my eyes we have been left with no help at all not only am I in here that vaccin there's another man over there whose life's been ruined by That covid-19 vaccine I know people who have lost legs amputations I know people with heart conditions like myself RI sunak why have I had to set up a support group in Scotland to look after the people that have been affected by That covid-19 vaccine why are the people who are in charge who told us all to do the right thing have left us all to ro and left me and the thousands and the tens of thousands in this country to ro R soon look me in the eye when are you going to start to do the right thing the vaccine damage payment scheme is not fit for purpose in Scotland right now according to the yellow card system there are over 30,000 people have had an adverse reaction to That vaccine and deaths John thank you very much indeed for your question for you to start doing the right thing and you you you've made really strong point John prime minister yeah John well I'm very sorry to hear about your personal circumstances and you said someone over here also seems to have suffered by the similar by a similar thing now obviously I I don't know about the individual situation that you're in we're silenced social media and everything we are silenced we are the most silenced people in this country Sil the Press because my story in the press okay had to go to the government for comment and they made take all the stuff out forgive me forgive me both no one no one no one is saying no yeah okay I've lost my house my wife successful career and Sir You Raised some very valid points I'm sure what I've got to say is though we haven't got you on microphone and as you know we've got to get through this I'm sure we can we can raise your points with the prime minister at a later date but in the mean time Prim Min if you cover I'm I'm very happy to so there is a vaccine compensation scheme that in place as you alluded to in the NHS obviously everyone individually will work through their cases it's difficult for me to comment on anyone's individual case I'm sure you'll appreciate that I'm very happy to go and look at the cases and I'm sure you'll get them to the team here I mean I'm I'm very saddened and shocked to hear that you've been silenced by anybody that is surprising to me so please do get your details to Stephen and the team and I will happily take that away of course you should be able to speak about your experience what's happened to you and as I said we have a compensation scheme in place for that and I'll make sure that we're working through that obviously I think you'll appreciate it's hard for me to comment on your specific circumstances just not knowing them and those things forgive me sir we haven't got a microphone on you so our viewers and listeners won't be able to hear I the the last thing I'd say is you know we went through a pandemic like everyone else at the points when it came to the vaccine those decisions were always taken on the basis of medical advice from our medical experts to tell us as politicians who are obviously not doctors about how best to roll out the vaccine what was in the public health interest the priority order how that should be done who should be eligible that was something that the doctors recommended on and that's something that we followed now obviously if there are individual circumstances which haven't worked out then that's why we have the compensation scheme in place and I'll make sure that we follow up on your cases okay prime minister thank you jents both of you do give us your details we will get that to the Prime Minister and as he said he will I'm sure look at that for you now that is an issue that's haed you a little bit because you were quite Pro vaccine weren't you AB I'm sorry uh what I said was I was Pro the choice it's an individual choice we were the first people to say you shouldn't be vaccinating young people or children and here's the point I commit and I don't think any other party will I commit we need an inquiry into the vaccine in vaccine injuries and that is my commitment here this evening for the first time to you that will be in our contract with the people there has to be an inquiry you heard it from those gentlemen I'm hearing up and down the country Ser so okay let's just have this rise so reform UK If voted will immediately have an inquest into the vaccine injured I'm absolutely right we need that and it needs to happen quickly and there need to be proper interim payments made to those who have been injured"

91,wosyaWiDR2U,Woman Dies 4 days after getting COVID Vaccine | Post Vaccine Deaths,"Woman Dies 4 days after getting COVID Vaccine | Post Vaccine Deaths

Kassidi Kurill, a 39-year-old Single Mom. Her family describes her as healthy, happy, and ""having more energy"" than most. She had no known health problems. Unless you count Trigeminal Neuralgia. She took Botox for that. She also took Birth Control. She worked as a surgical tech for local plastic surgeons. She gets the Moderna Covid vaccine. Her first covid shot goes without incident. Other than a sore arm. Second dose of covid vaccine Moderna - not so much. She gets her 2nd Covid shot on Feb. 1 Monday. Later that evening, she had a sore arm, nausea, and fever. That's not unheard of after someone gets the covid vaccine. Some people get a sore arm, fatigue, body aches, slight fever, and chills. Especially after the second covid shot. Especially for younger people. When this happens, people can take Tylenol or ibuprofen.

----------------------------------------------------------------

No big deal, right? Unless they take too much.  
She did take Tylenol, aka Acetaminophen, but we don't know how much. She felt a little better the next day. By Wednesday, she could not pee despite drinking lots of fluids. She says it's the worst she ever felt. Thursday, 6 am, she tells her parents she needs to go to the hospital. In the ER, she immediately starts throwing up. Doctors say, ""she was very, very sick, and her liver was not functioning."" Blood tests show that her liver is not working. The doctors give her IV fluids. They also give her a drug to counteract the effects of Tylenol on the liver. It's called NAC, or n-acetylcysteine. But the damage was already done. Around this time, she becomes incoherent. Acute liver failure causes the brain to swell, called cerebral edema. If severe enough, it can result in a coma. At this point, her only chance of survival is with a liver transplant.

---------------------------------------------------------

So she was flown to a transplant hospital. But when the liver completely fails, it causes other organs to follow suit. Especially the kidneys and brain, and soon after heart and lungs. She's put on full life support, including a breathing tube. Even if there was a match for a new liver, she is too unstable to undergo that operation. She dies. About 30 hours after she first arrived at the ER. She leaves behind a young daughter who wants people to hear her story. 

A lot of people will conclude that the covid vaccine caused her death. 
But timing by itself does not prove causation. 
And many people want to know, did the covid vaccine cause her death? 
And if not, then what? 
A Utah medical examiner completed a full autopsy...but the results remain private. The Medical Examiner said the autopsy did not show a link between the covid vaccine and death. 

Which is hardly surprising. If a covid vaccine caused someone to die shortly after receiving it, how would it do so? The only medical explanation would be an immunological reaction. Meaning an allergic reaction. So far in the US, there have been over 200 million covid vaccine doses given. No one has died from a severe allergic reaction as a result of the COVID vaccine. 

And in her case, it's obvious that she did not have an allergic reaction. For example, there was no swelling in the face or tongue or tightening of the throat. Deaths after COVID vaccinations are reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.

Between Dec. 14 and mid-March, over 109 million covid vaccine doses in the US. 
Of those, there have been less than 2,000 reports of death on the VAERS system, which is 0.0018%. A reported death in the VAERS system doesn't mean the covid vaccine caused it.

So the big question in Kassidi Kurill's case is…what caused her acute liver failure?
In the US, Acetaminophen accounts for 40% of cases. 
In 18% of cases, there is no identifiable cause. However, 13% are due to idiosyncratic drug reactions. 
The general recommended dose for Acetaminophen in healthy people is no more than 4 grams per day. However, sometimes people end up taking more than they should. This accounts for almost half of the cases of acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure.

enzymes this also means an elevated inr so what   is going on here this is acute liver failure 
aka fulminant hepatic failure or full minute   hepatitis the doctors give her iv fluids they 
also give her a drug to counteract the effects   of tylenol on the liver it's called knack or 
n-acetylcysteine but the damage was already done   around this time she becomes incoherent and this 
is because acute liver failure causes the brain   to swell called cerebral edema if it's severe 
enough it can result in coma at this point her   only chance of survival is with a liver transplant 
so she was flown to a transplant hospital but when   the liver completely fails it causes other organs 
to follow suit especially the kidneys in brain   and soon after the heart and the lungs she's put 
on full life support including a breathing tube   even if there was a match for a new liver she's 
too unstable to undergo the operation she dies   about 30 hours after she first arrived at the 
er she leaves behind a young daughter who wants   people to hear her story and if you want to 
contribute to her gofundme page i'm putting   a link below this video a lot of people will 
conclude that the vaccine caused her death   but timing by itself does not prove causation 
and a lot of people want to know did the vaccine   cause her death and if not then what caused it a 
utah medical examiner completed a full autopsy but   the results remain private the medical examiner 
said the autopsy did not show a link between   vaccine and death which is hardly surprising if 
a vaccine caused someone to die shortly after   receiving it how would it do so the only medical 
explanation would be an immunological reaction   meaning an allergic reaction so far in the 
u.s there have been over 200 million doses   of the vaccine given no one has 
died from a severe allergic reaction   as a result of the covid vaccine and in her case 
it's obvious that she did not have an allergic   reaction for example there was not swelling in 
the face or the tongue or tightening of the throat   deaths after covid 19 vaccinations are reported 
to the vaccine adverse event reporting system   between december 14th and middle of march there 
have been over 109 million vaccine doses in that   time frame in the united states now of those there 
have been less than 2000 reports of death on the   var system which is 0.0018 percent a reported 
death in the var system doesn't mean the vaccine   caused it if someone dies of a car accident on the 
way home after they get the vaccine what was the   cause of death so the big question in Kassidi's 
case is what caused her acute liver failure in   the u.s acetaminophen accounts for 40 of cases 
in 18 of cases there is no identifiable cause   13 are due to idiosyncratic drug reactions 
meaning medications other than tylenol the   general recommended dose for acetaminophen in 
healthy people is no more than 4 grams per day   sometimes people end up taking more than 
they should sometimes it's intentional   overdose sometimes it's accidental overdose 
regardless this accounts for almost half of   the cases of acetaminophen-induced acute liver 
failure acetaminophen toxicity it presents in   three phases the first phase involves nausea and 
vomiting in the first 24 hours in the second phase   during hours 24 to 72 there's a dramatic rise 
in liver enzymes seen on the blood work elevated   ast and alt in high ast to alt ratio during this 
phase acetaminophen causes kidney damage as well   the third phase our 72 through 96 consists of 
encephalopathy here the brain is not working right   because it's swollen there's confusion or lethargy 
this often progresses to coma there's usually   jaundice at this point as well the treatment 
for acetaminophen toxicity is a drug called an   acetylcysteine knack can be life-saving the 
sooner it's given the better the outcome if   it's given within 10 hours of ingestion there's a 
95% chance of survival acetaminophen levels can be   checked in the blood work increased levels help 
make the diagnosis but even if they're normal   it doesn't rule out the possibility of toxicity 
why because it's possible that the liver already   metabolized the acetaminophen in fact it's not 
the actual acetaminophen that destroys the liver   instead it's one of its breakdown products it's a 
metabolite called napqi which turns the liver into   mush here's a picture of what i'm talking about 
this is liver necrosis and this is what a healthy   liver looks like when you look at it underneath 
the microscope this is what you get napqi it also   damages the kidney and when the kidneys aren't 
working people stop peeing this is why it's so   important that people make sure they're not taking 
too much acetaminophen this drug is often combined   with other drugs and toxic levels can sneak up 
on people for example over-the-counter cough   medications percocet vicodin they all have 
acetaminophen in them medicine is complex it   always comes down to risk versus benefit whether 
that be tylenol or other medications the risks   of the virus versus the vaccine that's why it's 
important to stay in the know thanks for watching you"

#Cancer #Covid19 #mRNA",2023-02-04,136051,2538,878,UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg, the International Community is marking World Cancer Day cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide but now thanks to a Cutting Edge covered vaccine technology we might just might be closer to stopping cancer Germany's biotech is launching a trial in the United Kingdom of personalized cancer vaccines this Autumn more on the technology in this upcoming report during the covid-19 pandemic vaccines were rolled out within a year faster than most experts believed possible and messenger RNA vaccines were among the first to gain approvals they work by giving the body's immune system a preview of potentially dangerous Invaders a dose contains many copies of a short stretch of precise genetic information the messenger RNA it induces cells to start making proteins that are otherwise only found on a specific pathogen like the proteins that stud the surface of sarsko V2 the virus that causes covid-19 then when the immune system encounters the virus it quickly recognizes the Invader and wipes it out categorically messenger RNA vaccines have proven to be exceptionally effective they have proven to be able to protect people against severe and life-threatening disease and consequently saved millions of lives there are different types of RNA but all of them are coding molecules and that code can be Rewritten that's why many drug developers describe RNA as medicinal software vaccines that use this software have a major advantage over other platforms their codes can be easily altered to also make other proteins found on other disease-causing microbes teaching the immune system how to fight them as well and RNA can encode for proteins found not just in infectious diseases but also for instance in cancers in addition to messenger RNA a range of other rnas play key roles in metabolism and health so they also have potential as medicines cancer application is quite interesting because it is not a vaccine that will prevent cancer but rather it is a therapeutic vaccine it is a vaccine directed custom tailored to the cancer of the of the patient which enhances and directs the immune response to more efficiently clear the tumor around 20 RNA treatments have been approved so far globally and dozens more are in trials in a wide range of diseases and for more on this we are joined Now by Dan Milner the executive director of access to oncology medicine's coalition thank you for joining us sir there's been as we've been hearing high hopes for this mRNA cancer treatment how different just to begin would it be from the Technologies we now use to cure cancer so great question so currently the technologies that we use are largely directed at killing the tumor using you know either General targets which is classical chemotherapy or targeted therapies which we have for example for lung cancer but in those targeted therapies these are still molecules or antibodies that are manufactured and don't use the body's own immune system naturally our bodies can fight cancer many cancers off and we never develop those cancers because our immune systems take care of them so we're moving away from the traditional approach of attacking the cancer with something exogenous to moving to an RNA or an internal approach where we actually use the body's own immune system to attack those Cancers and Destroy them uh Mr Miller we saw of course uh how during the coveted pandemic how quickly vaccines could be ruled out once they were discovered can we hope for similar speed with cancer I I think so but I think there is a major barrier which we did not do not have with infectious disease and that's choosing the target for an individual patient as you have was described in the piece before this the ability to Target an infectious disease is quite easy because it's a foreign molecule it's a foreign piece of material that's not naturally in the human body but when we talk about cancer and personalizing the vaccine what we're talking about is finding some piece of the tumor that's been mutated or changed enough that we can then Target that protein or that molecule with the vaccine and destroy it and so we have to pick through all of the bits of the tumor using sequencing or other very robust processes to find the target pull it out and say yes this is the best one for this patient and then use it and that process at the moment is still rather tedious and difficult and expensive to do for each patient and again our concept is personalized so we want to do it for each patient so that's the bear really have to overcome is rapid Target selection for patients with cancer and just if we put the cost in the individualized treatment challenges Assad for a moment uh how long you think we'll have to wait for a wide scale rollout well I think that you know the agreement that the British government just signed with bioin tech for 10 000 patients by 2030 is very promising there was also the agreement personality signed with moderna using their sequencing platform I think these are signals that this is coming much more quickly than it would have you know we've been working on these vaccines for more than a decade for cancer with very little progress but now that we've sort of gotten through all the hard Parts with covid we've taken the vaccine to scale we've distributed Etc now we can focus in on what is the one last barrier and I think these kinds of Agreements are going to speed this process up I would say that there are four trials reporting this year one on melanoma two on influenza and one on herpes and that melanoma trial will be really crucial to see the results because I think if that is a positive trial we'll start to see more trials on the back end and we'll see more results coming out that are moving this forward for patients okay thanks for that good news to Ann Milner from the medicines Coalition thanks so much

THE MAJORITY OF OLDER PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE IF THEIR RISK FOR COVID ARE VACCINATED. SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING IF THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE VACCINATED, EVEN IF THE VACCINE SO WORKING, THE MAJORITY OF DEATHS WILL BE IN PEOPLE WHO ARE VACCINATED. THAT'S WHY THE CHART FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES KEY PHRASE, A JUDGE USTED. THE REAL QUESTION IS NOT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF DEATHS THE HOSPITALIZATION AREN'T VACCINATED OR UNVACCINATED. IT'S BY AGE. WHAT'S THE RISK OF DEATH AND VACCINATED VERSUS UNVACCINATED INDIVIDUALS AND BECAUSE WE KNOW IMMUNITY FADES OVER TIME.

jump on in like one minute. - I know, he's almost here. I have the participant window open, and I get to allow him to enter. - It's weird, I'm gonna be smiling, 'cause I'm just excited to see him. - Some nervous energy. - He's a busy man. He's doing lots of world saving. - We were 45 minutes early. - Okay. Ready? He's here, I'm admitting him right now. Here we go. (dramatic music) (bell ringing) - Hey, hey, hi guys, how you doing? - [All] Hi, Dr. Fauci! (upbeat music) (light music) - [Zach] On December 14th,
the first vaccine for COVID-19 in the U.S. was administered, beginning our nationwide rollout. - Now there are a lot of questions and misinformation out there, and today, we are having the one
person who can debunk all of the conspiracy theories joining us. - Although there's a lot of
misinformation out there, today, we're talking to Mr. Information. - Today, we're speaking
with Dr. Anthony Fauci, a physician and immunologist. I certainly have a crush on him. (Zach laughs) - He's the most important
man of the last year. - The Beyonce of medicine. - Right? - He is the Beyonce of medicine. - [Narrator] Immunologist,
Dr. Anthony Fauci. - Dr. Fauci. - Dr. Fauci. - There's nothing more important
than him doing his job. - I'm Dr. Anthony Fauci. - My name is Dr. Tony Fauci. - During the course of the
pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci has been the physician most
Americans have relied upon for their information. - [Narrator] Fauci
graduated first in his class at Cornell Medical College. His career spans six presidents and over 30 years of research. - [Narrator] Not only
did Dr. Fauci foresee this kind of pandemic,
scientists at the NIH have spent years preparing for it. - We're gonna use public health measures to help us safely get
to where we want to go. - Hey.
- Hi, Dr. Fauci. - Hello.
- Hi, everybody. Hi, guys, how you doing? - We're so good.
- Wonderful. - Doing well, thank you.
- Good. - We love you. - So Dr. Fauci, this
is the fastest vaccine in human history. People wanna know, did
we undermine the safety of the vaccine because it was done so fast and without long-term studies? - Okay, so that's a great question. It's the most commonly asked question. There was no cutting corners. Safety was not compromised. Scientific integrity was not compromised, and I think people need to
understand that the speed was related completely to the breathtaking scientific advances that had been made over the previous 10 or more years, where you can get the genetic
sequence of the virus, which then take that sequence and insert the appropriate gene into these very new and unbelievably efficient
vaccine platforms, and that didn't sacrifice
any safety at all. That was purely a technological advance. Then the Moderna trial was 30,000 people. The Pfizer trial was 44,000 people, and it happened to be
taking place in the middle of a ferocious outbreak. So when you're trying to
prove a vaccine works, and there are just a few infections here and there in society, it could take seven
years to get a vaccine. There was so many infections
that we went from sequence to getting the vaccine in
people's arms in less than a year. That is historic, but it's historic from a scientific standpoint. There was absolutely no
cutting of corners at all. - So you're saying that there's no chance that there's some weird side
effects that are gonna pop up three years down the road? - The chance of that happening
is spectacularly low, and let me tell you why. If you look at the history
of all vaccinology, and you say when did these so-called longer term effects occur? The overwhelming majority,
90 plus percent of them occur between 30 and 45 days after
the vaccine trial ends. That is the reason why the FDA said that in order to make an
emergency use authorization, you had to wait 60 days from the time 50% of the people in the
trial got their last dose. So if you wait 60 days,
you're already beyond when essentially all of the
long-term effects occur. I've never seen one, where
I get vaccinated in 1982, and I get a toxic effect in 1986. I mean, it just, I've
never seen that happen with any vaccine. - Mm, mm-hmm. - Wow, that's amazing. Okay, I'm gonna ask you a question here. Can I still infect someone
else after I get the vaccine and do I have to keep wearing
a mask after I get it? - The answer is yes, and I'll explain why. It is still conceivable
that you could get infected and be asymptomatic, and
even though the vaccine protected you from getting sick, it didn't protect you
from getting infected. So you may not even know
that you're infected and be completely asymptomatic, and then spread it to somebody else. - I think that's been the scariest part of this whole pandemic, is
that I could totally have it and not know, and that terrifies me. - We can pull back on masks when we get such an overwhelming proportion of the population is vaccinated that there's herd immunity,
which means that the level of virus is so low that it's not a threat. - What percentage of people
need to get the vaccine for us to achieve that? - You know, we don't
know the exact number, but we can make a back of
the envelope calculation that it's somewhere between
70 and 85% of the population needs to be vaccinated
to get herd immunity. - Here's, you know, some
people, there's a lot of people talking about things out there. Some people think maybe it'd be easier to just achieve herd
immunity by letting the virus spread rampantly through the population. What do you think about that? - Okay, well that's maybe the worst idea. (both laughing) - [Keith] Okay. - I don't want to compare it to anything. I don't want to insult anybody. - It's not my question. It's just a question that I have read, and I'm relaying to you
because you're the expert. - Did you read it on Facebook, Keith? - I did read it on Facebook.
(Fauci laughs) - The general level of
herd immunity right now in the country, the last
time the CDC looked at it, was like 10%, 12%. Some cities like New York, it was 22%, because New York got hit
so badly in the beginning. So let's say that the
level in the country today, let's say is 20%. So with 20% of the people infected, we've already had 352,000 deaths. To get to 80, you'd have to
have four times as many people. So are you willing to
accept 1.2 million deaths in order to get to herd immunity? I don't think so. So the road to herd immunity is a vaccine, not just letting people get infected. - And how soon after getting
the vaccine would I be immune? - So let's say you get
vaccinated, and then 21 to 28 days later, you get a boost, anywhere from 10 to 14
days following the boost, you can consider yourself protected. - Dr. Fauci, a new COVID
variant has been reported in over 40 countries and is
said to be more transmittable. Will that make the vaccine irrelevant? - That has a mutation,
which is causing the virus to be much more easily
transmissible from person to person. According to the Brits, who've
looked at it very carefully, and we will also be doing the same thing, they find that the mutation
does not make people sicker or even more people
dying, nor does it seem to interfere with the protection that's afforded by the vaccine. So the only thing that's
functionally different, it appears to spread more easily. - My fiancee, Maggie, she actually got the
vaccine already at work. They've been prioritizing nurses. For me, there's like a lot of contrasting information out there. Like I'm immunosuppressed,
and I don't know, am I supposed to get it? - You can take a vaccine. The only time an immunocompromised person should not take a vaccine is when it's a live attenuated vaccine, because the virus can then
replicate a lot in you, and not stop replicating the way a person who has a normal immune system would be. But you should get vaccinated, because even though the immune compromise may not get you to have
as robust a response, a less than robust response
is better than no response. So go get vaccinated. - Some protection is better
than no protection, yes. - I learned that in college. (group laughing) - Stop guys, stop, stop.
(Keith laughs) - I have a newborn child. We just got his two months' vaccines for all of the other stuff, but I've been really worried about COVID. When can my kids get the vaccine? Do they need to get it? - They do, but let me tell
you what the strategy has been for decades and decades
and decades with vaccines. Children and pregnant
women are vulnerable. So the general policy has been
you do not vaccinate children or pregnant women until
you've proven that the vaccine induces the same sort of
response that it induces in normal adults and protects them. And you do what's called a bridge. You bridge the immunogenicity
study in the children and the pregnant women
with the efficacy study that you've already completed, and you make a determination that it's okay to give it to children. We're gonna start that likely
towards the end of January, we'll be doing that in children. - Oh, that's soon. - So Dr. Fauci, we know that the vaccine doesn't instantly make everything better. So what can you tell us about what the next few months look like? - By the time we get to April, I think it would be open season. Namely, anybody can get vaccinated. There's no restrictions on it at all, because all the priority
people have been vaccinated. If we then vaccinate at a very good rate, President Biden has made the announcement that he's gonna try and
get 1 million doses a day, so that a hundred million
in the first hundred days. If we do 1 million a day, by the time we get to
the end of the summer, we will have reached that a
percentage of herd immunity. So that in the fall, if
everybody gets vaccinated that should get vaccinated, we can start approaching
a degree of normality. That doesn't mean nobody wears a mask, but that does mean kids
can feel secure at school, you can go to a sporting event, you can go to a restaurant
and have dinner, you can go to the
theater, things like that. The critical issue is that
we wanna really make sure that this vaccine hesitancy
that we see around gets overcome by the truth, that the vaccine is safe
and it's efficacious, and it will protect you, your family, and ultimately all of society. So go out there and beat the bushes. Tell your friends to get vaccinated. - Dr. Fauci, you've been
interviewed by the best of the best the world has to offer, but
never by four idiots at once. Next up, we have a lightning round. Are you ready? (dramatic music) - [Announcer] Lightning Round - These are some of the
most widely believed COVID vaccine conspiracy
theories on the internet. - Okay, Dr. Fauci, are
you lying when you said you got the vaccine? - No. (laughs) Right here. - [Announcer] Lightning Round. - Does the COVID vaccine cause COVID? - Absolutely impossible. - [Announcer] Lightning Round. - Are the vaccine ingredients more toxic than COVID-19 itself? - Absolutely not. - [Announcer] Lightning Round. - Will the vaccine change my DNA? - Absolutely impossible. - [Announcer] Lightning Round. - Well, do the vaccines
deliver a microchip barcode into my arm to keep a
track of me wherever I go? - (chuckles) No, it doesn't.
(both laugh) - [Announcer] Lightning Round. - And Dr. Fauci, one final question. Will coupons that are redeemable for one vaccine shot be called Faucers? - (laughs) I hope not. - Think about it.
- That's a good idea. You know? You can run with that. - Dr. Fauci, we wanna thank
you so much for your time. Is there any one last thing
you would say to people who do not want to get the vaccine? - Yeah, I think they really
need to examine carefully in their mind the reasons for that. If it's really based on a lot
of people talking about hoaxes and things like that, you
really gotta take a look at the risk that we're going through. We're going through a
real historic challenge, the likes of which we
haven't seen in 102 years and all of this nonsense
about fake news and hoax and all that, I mean, that just results in more people dying. - We wanna thank you so much- - Thank you so much.
- For everything you do. - Yes, it's been a real pleasure. - [Ned] Go get vaccinated, everybody. - You bet! Do it. - [All] Bye, Dr. Fauci! - I love you. Oh, he hung up. - Guys, thanks so much for watching. We hope you are taking this as seriously as we need to take it. When you can get vaccinated,
you should get vaccinated. There's gonna be some links
in the description below with more information and
thanks again, Dr. Fauci. What an amazing experience
for us and for you. We all basically got to hang
out with him for a few minutes and that's pretty awesome. - Ned, you made him laugh. - I know. (laughs) Whoa! - I made him horrified.
(Zach laughs) (upbeat music) - He didn't hear that I loved him. - Well, he'll watch. He watches all our
videos, so he'll see it. - Oh, okay, good, good. - Yeah, he has, he's actually a Sapphire Triceratops.

97,g_8N3CczKEg,An update on neurological adverse events from COVID-19 vaccines,"Jennifer Frontera, MD, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, discusses a review of data in the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System) relating to vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. This is a robust, publicly available dataset, reliant on passive reporting by anyone on adverse events (AEs). Limitations of the database include that there is no policing and clean-up of the data. Looking at 314,000 AEs reported over a six-month period following the administration of FDA-approved vaccines, it was found that neurological events were, overall, very uncommon post-vaccination. AEs already identified by CDC as having a relationship with the vaccines, including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and Guillain-Barré syndrome, happened at a higher frequency than expected in the baseline population. Seizures were also shown to occur more frequently following certain vaccinations. Prof. Frontera reminds us that serious AEs happen in less than one in a million people, with most AEs not exceeding a frequency expected in the general population. This interview took place at the American Academy of Neurology 2022 Congress in Seattle, WA.",2022-07-11,37656,276,0,UC5UlvCrYsS8axWEQ9Kd1sAg, [Music] we took a look at the vares data set which is the vaccine adverse event reporting system it's co-managed by the fda and the cdc and it's just publicly available data so you could go to the cdc website and just download this gigantic data set for you know hundreds of thousands of adverse event reports it's a passive reporting system which means that um you know anybody can put put their reports in so it could be the average person on the street entering an adverse event it could be a nurse it could be a doctor etc and there's nobody policing this site right i mean there's consequences you can't go file a false report it's technically punishable by law um but it's not uh it's it's not uh the data's not re reviewed and cleaned there are certain things that people have to report there's certain adverse events that clinicians must report and industry who has uh you know produced these vaccines is required to report their adverse events into the system also so there's limitations to the system but it's also robust because it has a high number of of patients uh and adverse events reported so we looked at this um there were 314 000 adverse events that we looked at over about a six and a half month period from january 2021 to june mid-june of 2021 so when the vaccines first were rolled out in the united states and we only looked at fda approved vaccines so that would be the you know um mrna vaccines of pfizer and moderna and then the johnson janssen jnj vaccine as the adenovirus vector vaccine that we have that's approved here and so what we found overall is that neurological events are very uncommon post-vaccination the things that had already been identified by the cdc as possible relationships between the vaccine and adverse event namely cerebral sinus thrombosis and guillain-barre syndrome were happened at higher frequency than what you would expect in the baseline population following the jansen vaccination what we also did find was that there was a higher frequency of seizures happening after the jansen or jngi vaccine than what you would normally expect in the population in terms of baseline seizure rates um you know that was novel kind of thing that we reported but if you look at the original trials that led to the approval of the j j vaccine there was a higher risk of seizure in the patients that received the vaccine compared to the placebo group and that sort of did bear out in this kind of you know quaternary type of study or real world study um but overall most serious events happen in less than one in a million people so very very uncommon um and most of them besides the three i mentioned related to the jansen vaccine did not happen at a higher frequency than what you would just generally expect to occur in the population when we looked at you know covet itself the neurological events related to covet itself occur 500 times more often than they after a vaccine for example so you're much higher risk if you get covert of having a neurological event than after a vaccine

But what does the law say and how does an employer decide? ABC 10s Kurt Rivera explains in tonight's cover story at Destiny Christian Church in Rockland, and so on the form. All the scripture references a pastor signs exemption forms, citing religious beliefs as protection from the need for a COVID-19 vaccine for us who choose not. 2. We put our faith in the Lord, but how does that hold up in the workplace? According to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, employers must provide quote reasonable accommodations for workers who have quote sincerely held religious beliefs. It doesn't mean that they have to grant all exemption requests. Michelle Mello is a Stanford law School and health policy professor for the University School of Medicine. She says in the past, employers have granted a quote fairly large birth for religious exemptions. But with Kovid that has changed in this context, there are some distinct challenges because many of the people who are filing religious exemption requests have never refused vaccines before. This is the only vaccine that they object to, and the nature of their objection isn't truly religious. It's more of a personal belief exemption that they're trying to shoehorn into their religious exemption channel, and she says under the law employers are allowed to question the employee about their exemption. That doesn't require that you've tide to a recognized denomination or that you have a letter from your clergyperson It does require that you articulate an argument that is religious in nature and not more generally just about your personal beliefs. And then there's a portion that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says gives the employer the right to deny a religious exemption on what's called undue hardship that's defined as quote more than a de minimis or minimal burden or cost to run an employers business. It could lead to an employee getting fired for certain industries. There isn't a reasonable accommodation in the employee is going to be faced with a hard choice. And health care is certainly one of those industries. Education is probably another where you know remote work is not really feasible and some of the other accommodations that the employer might think about just aren't going to do the trick in terms of reassuring everyone that they can operate a safe workplace. San Joaquin County Public health officer Dr Maggie Park says, quote, the California Department of Public Health guidelines stress religious exemptions should be based on sincerely held religious beliefs. San Joaquin County Public Health Services continues to reach out to our faith based. Organizations to help answer questions about the COVID-19 vaccine and making the shots readily available to the community and the Federal Labor Code also allows an employer to grant a different religious accommodation than what the employee is asking for if it poses undue hardship to the business."

Census released the Covid vaccine and booster in the medical community and the U. S government as safe and effective. But despite the voice of confidence from the experts, there are those who continue to reject the vaccine and booster shots. I am definitely against it. Me and my family because there's just too many complications with it. They want us to take a vaccine they made in less than three weeks. No it's saying the shots of causing strokes took my third booster side lost my taste and smell. So what's the benefits of me? Keep taking more sets? Cardiologists at core? Well East, formerly Beaumont say they hear the concerns. I believe it's coming from the fact that we know that the vaccination in the booster, especially the Moderna is associated With a very small but real risk of my own card itis, also known as inflammation of wall that can cause heart failure and even cause someone to die. Therefore we have to review the risks of that vaccination. So what I'm hearing from you is that there is a real possible connection between Cardiac arrest and the covid vaccine. Is that correct? Well what I would say is there is a definite association. But doctors still question if other factors could be involved, So could it be from the covid vaccine itself, causing that risk of myocarditis and therefore sudden cardiac arrest? Could it be from the coronavirus? Itself which caused long term effects, or could it be the lack of medical care patients received during the lockdown when people had to stay home? We don't have the full story Let It Rip in the next few months, we will have a better understanding as long as that data is published, So should you get the vaccine and booster shot at this point? I think it's irresponsible to say Don't get it. I think it's irresponsible to say definitely get it Its seek information about the vaccine. Through an Internet search or social media. Talk to your doctor, Talk to your family , and then come up with the night an idea or a treatment plan that works for you and sell field. Ingrid Kelley Fox two news.

https://mcmillanresearch.com/kickstarter_2024/",2024-01-22,421822,13669,4619,UCSxeKmlI8XLrI1eMaqqM-kg, hi good evening I'm Dr Philip McMillan thank you for joining me and today I'm sharing with you the wonderful news from the wh that covid vaccines have saved 1.4 million lives across Europe it's remarkable how you can understand how successful this is but can't explain how people get severe disease well from my perspective from the scientific view I'm interested in how patients die and therefore if I understand how they die I can then explain the nuances like for instance how did Africa not get decimated with covid-19 they had low vaccination rate so if you can't explain that how then can you go on to make claims and credit for everything else so today what I'll be going through I'll give you a quick quick insight into what the topics are here I'll be talking about The Who and the fact that um this is the uh the the media coverage that they've had I'll go through that quickly I'll also be talking about what has happened in Africa with regards to vaccine coverage I'll also be looking at our worlding data and the vaccine doses being done in one specific area which is Zambia and I'll quickly mention something about the prevalence of pre-existing serological cross reactivity for SARS COV 2 additionally I'll be linking you in to some of the research that I've done which breaks down why you get severe disease and who is actually at risk for severe covid-19 so that's essentially what I'll go through quickly in a minute or two before I start I just like to remind everyone who may be interested coming up in a few days or if you've missed it you will see a link for it is our nitric oxide and covid presentation so nitric oxide and covid potential strategies for improving outcomes again being creative with research and science to come up with unusual patterns that may help to prevent severe disease Additionally you can join us on our huming heroes where in collaboration with Lena and putting together a book that will hopefully clarify some of the ideas around mucosal immunity and how nitric oxide could help join our Kickstarter on the link below so and why is this now an important topic so I've got here the World Health uh uh organization statement and this is from uh January 2024 and what they've said here is covid-19 vaccinations have save more than 1.4 million lives in the European region a new study finds uh firstly I couldn't yet find the study I'm not sure if it's peer-reviewed as yet but it's relevant in terms of these are likely to be computational models where they are anticipating the reason that they so many lives were saved and you can see here and as they pointed out since the introduction in December 2020 covid 19s have reduced deaths due to the pandemic by at least 57% saving more than 1.4 million lives in the wh Eastern European region now what is what I'm clarifying here is not that covid vaccines may have reduced deaths from severe disease but to say 1.4 million when you don't fully explain the mechanism of severe disease and you don't explain what has happened in Africa how do you explain Africa now let's just break that down into a little bit more detail and then I'll come back to why it's so important to understand the science so what I've got here is the Africa dashboard and this here is showing the CDC covid-19 vaccine dashboard and they're looking at all of Africa and they have delivered one um technically 1 billion doses of vaccines 1.13 7 and they've covered 51% 51.8% of Africa and they've shown it here by member State and which vaccine they have given that link is in the description the first thing that I will say is that I am very disappointed that Africa didn't take the lead on covid-19 by far they had the best outcomes up until probably certainly 2022 even after Omicron they had by far the best outcomes from the pandemic how do you explain that because they also had the lowest vaccine coverage now those numbers when I show you 51% I'm going to break it down because the timing is actually very very important so here you have a situation where you first have to ask what was happening in Africa and I've picked one country in Africa I've picked Zambia just because they've done a significant amount of vaccination and this is from our world in data and I've I've got here these are the peaks in terms of deaths daily new con confirmed covid-19 deaths and this is from the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 all the way out till now and you can see here that in August 2020 they had a peak then in February 2021 they had another Peak and that's uh and that um that was probably the the beta variant and then you had the Delta variant here this peak now what's important to note is that even though this was a peak you are talking about just about 250 deaths so this is not a lot of numbers compared to what was happening in the rest of the world this is a tiny number then they had a little bump here with regards to Omicron and then it ended so that was the situation of Africa now what you have to then do is look carefully at what they then did around vaccination because that's the bit that I was trying to understand they had a brilliant response low deaths in terms of Zambia yet they have gone to vaccinate most of their population I'm not talking about just a high-risk care who that could make sense but trying to Target your whole population I'm trying to understand the logic in it so here you have the daily covid-19 vaccine doses administered and you can see here again this is in uh 2021 because they didn't really get anything prior to April 2021 they started to get some vaccines low amounts all the way into December this was one of the horrific situations in the pandemic is that if covid was as lethal we would have left Africa to die but anyway here they're plotting along still getting some vaccine doses and then at this point here and this is just about May 2022 so that's after Omicron you see one big Surge and then they have another surge here in October 2022 let it be clear this was probably after the rest of the world had been not taking their vaccines so there was vaccines left over it's important for Africa to know you are not the priority here just reminding you this is what was after what was left that you were given why did you doubt your results in the first place and again you can see here from our world in data you can see for Zambia as I said you can see this is the number of people who had at least one dose you can see it was plotting along here until in about May 2022 you see the surge this is after they had faced Omicron and therefore had broad population level mucosal immunity why didn't they take the lead they had the best results the best outcomes why didn't they say why don't you explain why we have done so well with poor health infrastructure huge rural populations and limited access to vaccines how did Africa as a whole do so well so here is now the science and I'll try and explain this science to you as simply as I can the first thing you have to understand is what causes severe disease in covid-19 in truth we knew this from the data or the research that was done in about 2016 with SARS C the mechanism of disease is technically the same and it's all about the interferon response if you have a disregulated interferon response you're going to get severe disease this is Most Fascinating look at this carefully here this dark blue is interferon and what it's showing you here is that and green here represents the viral load so when someone gets infected if they have an early interferent response that means that the immune system the mucosal immune system recognizes it they have mild disease they don't end up with severe disease and again even when you have a huge surge of virus in Co and in SARS COV if they had a poor interferent response that means if they were immune supressed if they were old very frail again they had mild disease what caused severe disease was a delayed strong interferent response now that's just the science and it explains why some people even very frail people with comorbidities didn't die from covid-19 and this leads me to another very very important slide I think that I I put together just to try and explain this if you get this you understand severe covid-19 you have a number of factors that need to come together so I've created this ven diagram one you need to have have the representative age obesity comorbidities if you have this in theory you're at risk of severe covid-19 so this was a cohort who probably would have benefited most from vaccination additionally interferon Auto antibodies our problem was we didn't know which people who could be younger had interfer and auto antibodies the other thing was a strong systemic immune response that means me that that's the delayed interference so if you had weak immunity and this is talking about the first and second waves it's a bit different now but if you had strong systemic immunity that's what predisposed you to severe covid-19 in combination with all of this plus critically no recent exposure to any Corona virus I didn't say sarov 2 any Corona virus any cold virus would have caused the mucosal immunity to give an interferent response which would have prevented severe covid-19 unless that person had interfer on all to antibodies that's the science if you understand the science you can then understand why it was that some areas probably did so well and you can see as well in Africa and this is a paper that um I pulled up here they recognized that from 2021 there was high prevalence of preexisting serological cross reactivity against SARS kov 2 in subsaharan Africa so a lot of people were exposed to other Corona viruses and therefore they had high levels of mucosal immunity which would have prevented severe disease you can look at the paper it's not a big study but it's still quite relevant additionally in many parts of Africa they have been using at population level a number of drugs that are not considered to be relevant with covid-19 if we had been thinking about the science and if we had just been looking for answers the scientific Community would have gone back to look at Africa and say how did they have such a good outcome with regards to covid-19 and they would have looked at every option including the drugs that they were using at population level that could have had an impact and we could have been in a completely different place than we are now so taking it from another angle just a reminder in terms of my slides I've put this together to try and see if I can help somebody understand it first question have you got prior exposure to any Corona virus if if the answer is yes the next question is do you have interferon Auto antibodies if you don't you have more protection but if you have interferent autoantibodies that that disregulated that interferent response you are at risk and on top of it if you have the comorbidities and a strong systemic immune response you're at much higher risk of severe covid-19 so a weak immune response initially was almost protective you wouldn't get severe covid-19 what's remarkable is this has changed since we have done broad population level vaccination that those people who seem to be at lower risk are no longer the same so people who are immune suppressed in the first wave are no longer as protected subsequently these are important scientific questions that we really really need to answer so the point is this in order to make that claim and this is why I think the science is so important so I'll take you back to what that claim was that more than 1.4 million lives were saved if they don't include in their analysis the fact that almost 90% of the population was already exposed to any Corona virus and would not have a delayed inter response then those numbers are unlikely to be inaccurate but who am I this is coming from our lead organization so just a reminder as to what I said anything that delays this interferent response is likely to lead to severe disease and so whether it's interferon Auto antibodies or no prior exposure to any Corona virus or covid-19 you are at higher risk of SARS uh severe disease just remember at this point almost everybody has been exposed to um Omicron and so there is going to be only a small number of people if any who don't have mucosal immunity and therefore wouldn't respond in that way to interferon and so seeing severe covid-19 as an illness is unlikely to occur at this point unless there are other mechanisms at Play and so what we have to prepare for now as excess deaths remain up especially across highly vaccinated regions the question that needs to be asked is are we moving into a different phase of the pandemic where different mechanisms leading to severe disease are now extremely important to understand this is a different phase but just remember if we had taken or let Africa Take the Lead it's very unlikely the world would be where it is now we still have challenges in front of us and there no amount of um hiding those facts is going to change that reality have a good [Music] evening [Music]

109,o2HLkFi4Qtw,5 things NOT TO DO after getting the COVID-19 vaccine,"COVID-19 vaccines are opening up to more people across the Carolinas, but experts say there are a few things we shouldn't do after getting the shot. 

1. Getting a tattoo or piercing. The CDC says there's a slight chance this could trigger an immune response on top of the vaccine. Your best bet it to wait a few days.

2. Don't book other vaccines. Scientists say there's just not enough evidence right now to know how the vaccines interact with others in a short period of time. They recommend waiting at least two weeks before getting any other vaccination.

3. Don't push yourself too hard exercising. If you feel bad after getting your shot, take the day off instead. Forcing yourself to workout might only make you feel even worse. 

4. Hydrate. All that water you drink helps your body process the immune response. Plus, if you do get a fever, drinking water will help your body fight it. 

5. Don't lose your vaccine card. We don't know exactly where or when we'll need it just yet, but whatever you do, keep your vaccine card in a safe place. #WakeUpCLT #COVID19 #Vaccine",2021-04-01,1630985,9107,1530,UC-RxXi2Xws6Uk22vp-sLbGA," HAPPENING HAPPENING ACROSS HAPPENING ACROSS THE HAPPENING ACROSS THE CAROLINAS HAPPENING ACROSS THE CAROLINAS

THANK YOU SO MUCH.  >>> A NEW STUDY FINDS THAT  COVID-19 IMMUNITY, THE NATURAL  KIND CAUSED BY GETTING THE  VIRUS AND BEATING IT, CAN BE  JUST AS PRODUCTIVE AS GETTING A  VACCINE.  THE STUDY FOUND INFECTION  GENERATED IMMUNITY CAN CUT THE  RISK OF HOSPITALIZATION AND  DEATH COVID-19 BY UP TO 88% FOR  UP TO 10 MONTHS.  >> A DISTINGUISHED CHAIR AT THE  UNIVERSITY OF IOWA JOINING US  NOW.  THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.  YOUR BIG TAKE AWAY FROM THE  STUDY?  >> FIRST, THANK YOU FOR HAVING  ME.  MY TAKEAWAYS FROM THIS STUDY  ARE REALLY THAT NATURAL IN  ACTION WORKS PRETTY WELL IN  PREVENTING HOSPITALIZATION ON  SUBSEQUENT RECHALLENGE.  THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE  SURPRISE.  THIS IS WHAT WE EXPECT IT TO  DO.  THE PARTS OF THE STUDY THAT I  THINK RAISE QUESTIONS OR THAT  ARE INTERESTING, IS THE QUESTION IS HOW IT COMPARES TO  VACCINATION AND WITH THIS STUDY  DOES IS IT COMPARES PROTECTION  FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN  IMMUNIZED WITH THE BASIC TWO  SHOT SERIES VERSUS REINFECTION  AND THE REINFECTION DOES A  LITTLE BETTER.  AS WE ALL KNOW NOW, PEOPLE HAVE  RECEIVED BOOSTERS, PARTICULARLY  THE FIRST BOOSTER IS IMPORTANT  FOR PROTECTION AND THE SECOND  BOOSTER MAY HELP SOME,  ESPECIALLY AGAINST THE OMICRON  TYPE VARIANCE.  >> IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE  BUILDING TO IT.  THE BOTTOM LINE, DO PEOPLE  STILL NEED TO GET BOOSTERS AND  VACCINES IF THEY'VE ALREADY HAD  THE VIRUS?  AND THEREFORE HAVE IMMUNITY?  >> I THINK THAT IS THE QUESTION  AND IT HAS TO BE A NUANCED  ANSWER BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW IS  FOR MANY PEOPLE BEING INFECTED  AND BEING READ BOOSTED BY  GETTING THE INFECTION AGAIN,  MAY PROTECT THEM, BUT THERE ARE  GROUPS THAT THIS IS NOT TRUE.  PEOPLE NEVER INFECTED OR  VACCINATED CAN GET SEVERE  DISEASE AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER, THIS WAS A STRATEGY THAT WAS  USED IN SWEDEN INITIALLY AND  WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING IS  PEOPLE ENDED UP DYING.  WE STILL HAVE 500 PEOPLE A DAY  DYING IN THE U.S. MOST OF THOSE  PEOPLE ARE EITHER BABIES WHO  ARE NEVER VACCINATED OR OLDER  PEOPLE WHOSE IMMUNITY IS IN  GRADE OR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE  A GOOD IMMUNE SYSTEM.  >> THE STUDY DID NOT INCLUDE  HYBRID IMMUNITY WHICH I  UNDERSTAND COMES WHEN SOMEONE  CONTRACTS A VIRUS AND IS ALSO  FULLY VACCINATED.  IS THAT THE IDEAL LEVEL OF  PROTECTION?  >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT IDEAL IS,  BUT IF ONE IS VACCINATED, AND  WHAT HAS BEEN INSPECTED AND  DONE WELL IN THEM VACCINATED,  THAT SEEMS TO WORK WELL.  THE REVERSE SEEMS TO BE GOOD AS  WELL.  THE CHALLENGE WITH THIS VIRUS  IS IS EVEN WITH IMMUNITY,  WHETHER IT BE FROM NATURAL  INFECTION OR FROM VACCINATION,  PEOPLE ARE STILL GETTING  REINFECTED.  SO, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO THE  HOSPITAL OR DYING, BUT THERE  ARE STILL LOTS OF INFECTIONS "

#COVID19 #Omicron #Coronavirus",2023-02-26,494316,11213,3284,UCG-iSMVtWbbwDDXgXXypARQ, [Music] welcome to another medcram covid-19 update today we're going to review a couple of papers that go into detail about autopsy findings in patients with disease in the heart related to Spike protein who have been previously vaccinated and specifically we're going to look at the brain and the heart in a particular case where someone died with Encephalitis we at medcram have talked extensively about the vaccines and not only their efficacy but also side effects and that goes back to April of 2021 when we covered the vaccine pause of the Johnson Johnson vaccine as it related to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis there was about six cases out of six million cases at that time and we also covered in September of 2021 in our video called coveted vaccines 10 key questions answered with Rhonda Patrick where we delved into the connection between mRNA vaccines and myocarditis as a pulmonary and critical care physician in full practice and on the faculty at two medical schools the side effects of medications are not foreign to me I use these medications all the time in the Intensive Care Unit and one of the medications that we see used often but also with side effects are blood thinners and so it was a privilege for me to be involved in research prior to the pandemic in 2017 where we looked at clinical outcomes of prolonged anticoagulation with rivaroxaban which is a blood thinner after unprovoked venous thromboembolism people who have blood clots and we don't know why they have blood clots get put on anticoagulation for a set period of time and then they are taken off of anticoagulation and so the question is how long should they be on it and whether or not they should be on it indefinitely so this was a real world study where we actually looked at patients who had discontinued anticoagulation which you see here in red and those that had continued anticoagulation clearly you can see that those that discontinue initial month period had a higher risk of venous thromboembolism than those who actually had stayed on it and so that's an important thing to see the efficacy of a medication but the flip side of it is to see the safety if we're getting benefit but also seeing worsening and side effects that's not good so we asked the same question of the same cohort except in a little different way we asked how many of these actually had major bleeding which of course we see all the time in the Intensive Care Unit when patients are put on blood thinners and as you can see here there really wasn't much difference so this was a boon this is basically a situation where there's very little risk of continuing the medication and if you continue the medication you reduce their chances of getting blood clots no-brainer in this one we came to the conclusion that continued riverox event in this case beyond the initial three or six month treatment period significantly lowered the risk of recurrent thromboembolism without a significant increase in major bleeding compared to the treatment that discontinued at three or six months and so the key here is that for any medical intervention that you're ever going to do you have to understand that there's always risk it would be very surprising to me to hear that perhaps there's never been any kind of side effects in any way shape or form to the vaccines I think that's just Preposterous any medical intervention that we do even drinking water to an excess can cause difficulties so when those side effects happen they have to be characterized and I think that's a legitimate thing and here we're going to talk about a case that was published back in October of 2022 titled a case report multifocal necrotizing Encephalitis and myocarditis after bnt-162b2 which is basically the Pfizer mRNA vaccine against covet 19. this was published recently in just October of last year it talks about a 76 year old gentleman who had gotten three doses of a covid-19 vaccine now the first one was actually the AstraZeneca the Oxford AstraZeneca which is not an mRNA vaccine but rather a DNA this one actually goes into the nucleus it is a Dental viral vaccine chimpanzee specifically according to this article when they interviewed the family they said that the patient on day one of that injection actually started to have cardiovascular side effects dose 2 which was in July of 2021 so a good two months later was actually the Pfizer vaccination and after some time it doesn't say how long after that but sometime after that there was behavioral and psychological changes and worsening of their Parkinson's disease so this patient had already been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease is not only a neurological degradation it's also a manifestation of mitochondrial dysfunction and it also has cardiovascular effects so there is a confounder there in the fact that Parkinson's disease is well known to cause cardiovascular issues and neurological issues of course and autonomic issues that's the shrine Drager aspect of the parkinsonian disease and then finally in December of 2021 so a full five months later the patient had the second dose of the Pfizer biotech vaccine two weeks after that had collapsed while eating apparently the patient was continuing to do worse ever since shortly after July and then again in one week where the patient actually collapsed it was felt that the patient had had an aspiration to money that's where the patient cannot control how they swallow which is actually very common in Parkinson's disease the food goes down the wrong way and causes a pneumonia and actually that was what was seen on autopsies we'll talk a little bit a family was quizzed about this there was no symptomatic coveted disease although the paper does not mention whether or not the patient was actually ever tested for SARS cov2 infection they don't mention it so I don't believe they probably were by the way you can find this article here in this link you can also search it by title let's get into this in a little bit more detail on the lungs microscopically there was cloudy secretions they're purulent spots brittle parenchyma bilateral muco purulent tracheal bronchitis dissol is basically code words in the anatomic pathology and Pulmonary discourse for basically pneumonia copious purulent secretions that is what I would see on a bronchoscopy if I was to Bronk this patient or put a scope down into the lungs and this is basically the manifestation of a significant and very bad pneumonia which in people who are immunocompromised don't really cause a lot of symptoms unfortunately people who are older and immunocompromise when they get pneumonia they don't complain of shortness of breath they don't complain of chest pain instead they become lethargic sleepy tired and pass away I see this often so yes bilateral broth and ammonia was known in the lower lungs there was multiple stages development of lobe filling with secretions and fragile parenchyma this is basically what you would see in chronic aspiration that's exactly what you would see in Parkinson's disease as well as the patient has difficulty controlling their ability to swallow things will silently aspirate down into the lungs no surprise there but some surprises here as we go along there was actually quite a lot of findings in the heart macroscopic examination revealed manifestations of acute and chronic cardiovascular insufficiency that just means basically coronary artery disease there was a pulmonary edema so when the heart doesn't work the fluid backs up into the brain congestion chronic hepatic congestion this is one of the organs right behind the heart renal tissue edema pituitary tissue edema evidence of shock kidney disorder and so forth and so forth there was hyper contraction of cardiomyocytes there was a number of histiocytic infiltrates this just means inflammation prominent endothelial swelling this is not what you want to see and also something called coagulation necrosis as well as fibrin clots so a lot of damage going on and what they did was they started to stain the tissues to look for two things specifically one is the spike protein and the nucleocapsulin protein now why that's important is because of the following when you have the virus the virus is made up of Spike proteins which sit on the surface and has been the target of vaccines for antibodies and then there are the nucleocapsid proteins which are inside which are not the target of vaccines and so this is what a virus would look like a true virus and the vaccine of course is just going to make Spike proteins or ask your cells to make those Spike proteins nucleocapsids if they are seen are basically indicative that the virus is there and that's the important part with understanding about nucleocapsids when they stain for Spike and when they stain for nucleocapsid this is a respiratory secretion in a patient who has been infected with SARS cov2 this is not the patient that we're talking about who died and is in the autopsy and is part of the paper this is in the paper but they're showing you a control that you can stain for this you can use an antibody which has the dye Amino bin benzodine marker on it and that's what you're seeing here with this brown so what you're seeing here is antibodies against the spike protein so we're seeing spike in respiratory secretions in a patient who is positive for SARS cov2 in those same respiratory secretions we're staining for nucleocapsid proteins these are in the respiratory epithelial cells in the respiratory secretions that's primarily where the infection is taking place so that's important to understand this is the control that they're doing in this situation now let's go back to the patient that died and was getting the autopsy so when they looked at the patient's brain they did the same sort of staining here they're looking for the presence of Spike protein in the brain of the deceased patient who they never tested for SARS cov2 but what did they find as you remember he was vaccinated three times and the purpose of those three vaccinations is to make Spike protein and what are they seeing here they're seeing Spike protein here in the brain so this is lighting up on this immunohistochemical staining for SARS cov2 Spike subunit one when they do the same thing for the nucleocapsid protein it's crickets they don't see anything there's no staining whatsoever in the brain why is there no nucleocapsid protein that is up for discussion but there isn't any as we can see here on this page let's go to another specimen from the same patient also brain again we're looking for the presence of Spike and as you can see here there is Spike protein Spike protein this blue arrow by the way is not Spike protein it is actually an individual glial cell so just ignore that that is not Spike protein Amino histochemical stating again brain deceased they're looking for nucleocapsid protein and again we don't see anything there's no nucleocaps in protein staining all right let's keep going now let's look at the hearts in the same deceased patient we're looking for Spike protein and we see again Spike protein staining on immunohistochemical staining we look for nucleocapsid protein and once again we do not see any nucleocapsulin protein in that individual so what did this lead the author of this paper that was published in October to say well first of all on the autopsy the final diagnosis was this is the official death diagnosis after the autopsy bilateral bronchopneumonia undeniable because the patient was probably silently aspirating Parkinson's disease necrotic Encephalitis based on what they saw and myocarditis as well let's see what the author says they say immunohistochemistry for SARS cov2 antigens which is the spike protein and the nucleocapsid revealed that the lesions with necrotizing Encephalitis that means dying part of the brain inflammation as well as acute inflammatory changes in the small blood vessels in the brain and heart were associated with abundant deposits of Spike protein subunitive one since the nucleocapsid protein of SARS cov2 was consistently absent it must be assumed that the presence of Spike protein in affected tissues was not due to an infection of SARS cov2 but rather to the transfection of tissues by the gene-based covid-19 vaccines the reason why they can safely say that this was not an infection from SARS cov2 is because there was no nucleocapsid proteins seen on the autopsy they go on importantly Spike protein could be only demonstrated in the areas with acute inflammatory reactions brain heart and small blood vessels and in particular the endothelial cells microglia and astrocytes this is strongly suggested that the spike protein may have played at least a contributing role to the development of the lesions and the course of the disease in the patient they go on based on the alteration pattern in the brain and heart it appear that the small blood vessels were especially affected in particularly the endothelium endothelial dysfunction is known to be highly involved in organ dysfunction during viral infections he does mention that this can happen in viral infections as it induces a pro-coagulant state microvascular leak and organ ischemia this is also the case for SARS cov2 infection so in other words this is looking like a SARS cov2 infection however he's not calling the SARS cov2 infection because there's no nucleocapsid proteins in the extra respiratory tissues they say here where a systemic exposure to the virus and a spike protein elicits a strong immunological reaction in which the endothelial cells play a crucial role leading to vascular dysfunction immunoth thrombosis and inflammation and those of you who know us at medcram we've talked extensively about this and how oxidative stress in the endothelial cells can lead to damage releasing on von Willebrand's fractor which causes these small micro clots in the circulation of the lungs and causing hypoxia that's probably what leads to happy hypoxics he goes on although there was no history of covid-19 for this patient immunochemistry for SARS cov2 antigens was performed Spike protein could indeed be demonstrated in the years of acute inflammation in the brain particularly within the capital endothelium and the small blood vessels of the heart remarkably however the nucleocapsid was uniformly absent during an infection with the virus both proteins should be expressed and detected together he says it doesn't give a reference for that interestingly but it makes logical Sense on the other hand the gene-based covid-19 vaccines encode only the spike protein and therefore the presence of Spike protein only but no nucleocapsid protein in the heart and brain on the current case can be attributed to vaccination rather to infection this agrees with the patient's history which includes three vaccine injections the first one was a DNA the last two were RNA and the third one just three weeks before his death but no positive laboratory clinical diagnosis of the infection doesn't sound like the patient actually had a covid-19 test which could be asymptomatic so the conclusion illusion was numerous cases of encephalitis and encephalomyelitis have been reported in connection with the gene-based covid-19 vaccines with many being considered causally related to vaccination however this is the first report to demonstrate the presence of the spike protein actually in these encephalitic lesions and to attribute it to vaccination rather than infection these findings corroborate the causative role of gene-based covid-19 vaccines and this diagnostic approach is relevant to potentially vaccine-induced damage to other organs as well he's making the point here that the absence of the nucleocapsid is the cinquequinone to speak the Latin that this is definitely vaccination contrast this with this paper this is a paper that was published in the annals of diagnostic pathology its original contribution notice here that this was available online even though it was published in October around the same time as the other paper the results of this paper were available since May of last year let's find out what this paper says they say here cardiac manifestations are common in severe coven 19. so these these are looking at covid-19 deaths these are deaths that are attributed to covid-19 and they're looking actually at 11 of these and 11 controls and what they're able to do is something called insight to hybridization which is a way of measuring RNA samples and they're also using exactly the same technique that they used in the first paper which is immunohistochemistry for viral proteins and what did they do they looked for ace2 expression which we're not going to get into because that's not really the purpose of this they did see that ace2 expression was 10 times greater than the heart tissues of cases and controls with obesity or type 2 diabetes I think that's really interesting but what they found is these are covid-19 cases that died and what they found starting right here is interesting however in each case abundant SARS Kobe 2 Spike protein was evidence but SARS cov2 RNA and nucleocapsid protein were rarely detected in situ in any covid-19 heart let me repeat that again here these are known to have covid-19 from source cov2 even in these cases in non-respiratory tissue whereas they found plenty of Spike protein they did not find nucleocapsid protein as well what they conclude though is that the viral Spike protein is endocytized by macrophages in the lung and are carried to the heart and the brain and other organs and that's the reason why you're seeing the spike protein and not the nucleocapsid so let's take a look at some of the data here here's what's called a western blot from proteins extracted either from the nasopharynx which is NP that's part of the respiratory where you'll see a lot of nucleocapsidin Spike with no evidence of SARS cov2 or a positive result so here's the nasopharynx it's negative and you can see here we don't see any proteins here's the nasopharynx with someone with a very high copy count of SARS cov2 and what you see here is you see this band and you see this band this blue band at the top is the spike protein and this Brown Band down here is the nucleocapsid protein notice that when you look at the nasal pharynx and you have low copy count you can see still the spike protein but this nasal frenchial sample of nucleocapsid protein is almost non-existent which means that even in respiratory tissue where there's a high copy count you might not pick up nucleocapsid protein even if you are infected with SARS cov2 all right let's move on to the nucleocapsid proteins specifically so here we have nucleocapsid protein and this is the band that you want to look at because that is the nucleocapsid protein these are covered lungs covered lung one covered lung two notice in normal lung we do not see that nucleocaps at protein by the way these are just reference lines let's take a look at these covid organs we have covid liver organ one there is no band if we look in the brain in this coveted patient no band covid cns-1 no band how about the spleen in covid no band of course the normal CNS there's no band either they said their nucleocaps of protein is only evident in the lung samples and nasopharynx that's respiratory that's where it divides and it's not found in any of the other organs tested what about Spike maybe it's just not there maybe the spike isn't there either maybe it just didn't go it was a mild infection no because most of the covid-19 heart samples showed a band that analyzed for viral spikes so where's the spike protein this is Spike this is Spike so in the lung we see spike in the heart we see a light spike in this heart we see a light spike in this heart we see a light spike in this coveted heart too we see a light Spike pre-covet heart no Spike spike can go to extra respiratory organs but we have not seen an example here where the nucleocaps that goes to extra respiratory organs in SARS Kobe 2. they say here quote interestingly only the covid-19 lung and nasopharyngeal samples showed a signal for the nucleocapsid protein specifically 0 out of 11 cardiac cases were positive for the nucleocapsid protein whereas 7 out of 11 were positive for the viral Spike and the envelope proteins they did not show that data in this but that's what they showed now let's take a look at the immunohistochemical staining which is what they did in that first study and let's see what we see here we see lung do we see nucleocapsid absolutely we see nucleocapsid in the same way that we would normally see it but do we see heart Spike yes these little pink things are heart Spike well if we're seeing heart Spike we should also see heart nucleocapsid right because this is a viral infection but we see crickets here we see nothing there is no nucleocapsid in viral infections so what do they say they say the source of the endogenous Spike protein in severe covid-19 would likely be the extremely high copy viral load seen in the lungs of these patients they're saying here that in the lungs of patients this is where the virus is replicating so much that you're going to be able to see both Spike and nucleocapsid the virus in the lung induces a micro angiopathy that causes viral degeneration and is a logical source of viral Spike proteins entering the circulation this is exactly what we've been talking about and docking in organs with a high perivascular bed and ace2 population that would be Hearts preliminary data suggests that the viral Spike protein alone with the Matrix and envelope proteins are carried by macrophages in the circulation this could explain in many studies which have shown that the viral Spike protein per se or more accurately the S1 subunit the spike protein which has the RBD sequence for ace2 can demonstrate cytotoxic effects so you may never see the nucleocapsid going to distant organs that are non-respiratory because it's the spike that gets picked up by the macrophages and not the nucleocapsid so remember when we go back to that first study remember there was a control and here we saw a spike in the respiratory secretions and here we saw nucleocapsid in the respiratory secretions but we never saw this for non-respiratory secretions remember that the author of the first study says since the nucleocapsid protein of stars cov2 was consistently absent it must be assumed that the presence of Spike protein in affected tissues was not due to infection I'm not sure if that is a logical assumption anymore based on the data that we have now and that was actually available at the time of publication even back as far as May of 2022 it seems very likely in fact that you're not going to pick up the presence of nucleocapsid proteins in non-respiratory organs of the body in patients who are infected with SARS cov2 let's go back to our case study again I would be very surprised if there wasn't a single case out there or multiple cases even where there has been significant injury or even death from an intervention right I see this all the time in my Intensive Care Unit I have patients that come in with head bleeds because they're on anticoagulation and clearly as a result of the anticoagulation that they're on but the Hope was is that that anticoagulation would prevent a stroke and indeed we know that every year thousands and thousands of Strokes are prevented because people are put on blood thinners but we also get maybe a few tens 20s 30s of people who have head bleeds and we look at that risk benefit and so I think it's important to continue to look for these things but we also have to look at the data and make the analysis here to see whether or not in fact this is going on and this is what I've done looking at data and actually telling you things that could falsify my interpretation conclusions in this situation the patient had a mRNA vaccine dose 3 and it was two weeks later that the patient collapsed and then one week later the patient died so three weeks after this basically this mRNA Pfizer vaccine was given so the question is if this is actually happening we should see a signal after people have been vaccined so I go again to the graph of vaccination versus excess deaths here up on the top we see daily SARS cov2 infections during the beginning of the pandemic we have the first wave this is a scale going to 1 million you can see here the first wave was about 300 000 and this Delta wave here again was probably maybe 250 000. this was up here almost a million we didn't catch all of these people some of them weren't tested but we tested as many as we could and we can kind of get relative looks at these things down here we have excess mortality so this is anybody who died and the thing I like about excess mortality not none coveted mortality it doesn't matter what's put on the death certificate whatever's on the death certificate is on the death certificate all you need is a death certificate and a date and it goes in here so it doesn't matter if the patient is misdiagnosed as having covet or not having coveted or they died of encephalitis and they didn't think it was from covet it's all going in here it's all being captured notice here that the same pattern of SARS cov2 matches the same pattern here of this excess wave happening exactly at the time that it should happen maybe two to three weeks after it we have the same thing here with the Delta wave and we see again here because that Delta wave was just so virulent we see it exactly popping up two weeks later because it takes about two weeks for people to die once they get infected from Stars Kobe 2. the Omicron wave once again so we see here that the Peaks completely line up superimposed on top of that and reversed for ease of looking at here is the number of vaccinations whereas we had about 300 000 Stars Kobe 2 cases here in a single day we vaccinated three and a half million people over 10 times the number of people got a spike protein from the vaccine then the people that got a spike protein from the first wave of SARS Kobe 2. and so if this is what we're seeing as a result of excess deaths from the first wave we should see something approximately three weeks later down approximately right here as a result of vaccination with an mRNA vaccine I'm not saying that it doesn't happen as I said I would be very surprised if there was absolutely no risk associated with a intervention there's risk associated with every intervention but what I am saying is that whatever the magnitude of that risk is has to fit underneath this curve at that point if we're talking about an immediate effect from SARS cov2 vaccinations If This Were happening I would have expected depending on the magnitude I would have expected something to look like this you know be a little bit delayed or I would expect it's something to look like this or if it was less in magnitude or even less in magnitude something that would look like that when this is the number of I have it upside down here right so that's the peak this here is the peak of all vaccinations in the United States we vaccinated in one day on this day three and a half million people doesn't mean that there's not long-term effects but I'm not seeing an acute Association here at least on this curve going back to the publication that I was involved with we have to realize that there is always going to be side effects and we can see that here that as time goes on regardless of if you're on the anticoagulation or not on the anticoagulation there are going to be people who have major bleeding events but the key to understanding whether or not and how you can prevent those is not to compare somebody who would never have an event with someone who did have an event you have to compare someone who did have an event with someone who didn't get the intervention and that's where it's important to be able to look at things epidemiologically and with studies and with data the other thing that this shows is that sometimes things may seem logical but this is the reason we press for evidence-based medicine even though something may seem logical or it may seem like it makes sense like in this case it would seem logical that if you see the spike protein without the nucleocapsid that it would make sense that since the vaccine only makes the spike protein without the nucleocapsid this would implement Kate the vaccine however there could be other factors that are preventing that nucleocapsid protein from getting out of the respiratory tissue and into non-respiratory tissue organs the second paper highlights that even though this thing made sense it may not be the case and without my condolences to all of these people that had perished from one reason or another that were used in these studies and with the families as well I know all too well the impacts here we talk about statistics and numbers but each one of these people have families loved ones and again my condolences I am a Frontline doctor that works in the Intensive Care Unit so I understand the actual reality of all of these issues and with that this concludes I just wanted to remind you to subscribe turn on notifications and leave a comment below about what you think and I also invite you to watch this video on the ability of near infrared light to neutralize toxicity from Spike protein regardless of its source in this video we talk about the toll-like receptor 4 dependent hyperinflammation and how near infrared light can actually ameliorate this toxicity and don't

118,-3EBnIsDqao,13 Year Old Boy Dies 3 Days After COVID Vaccine | Post Vaccine Deaths,"13 Year Old Boy Dies 3 Days After COVID Vaccine | Post Vaccine Deaths

A 13 year old boy in Michigan recently died 3 days after getting the COVID vaccine; it was the Pfizer vaccine. The cause of death is being investigated by the CDC. According to the patient’s Aunt on Twitter, the preliminary autopsy report showed fluid around his heart. What caused his death? Before I tell you my thoughts on that, it first helps to background on what myocarditis is. Inflammation of the heart. And pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardial sac. Sometimes pericarditis can cause fluid to buildup within the sac, and this is called a pericardial effusion. The first reports of myocarditis after COVID mRNA vaccination involved (US) military patients and patients from Israel4,5.

---------------------------------------------------------

The Israeli cohort identified a male predominance with an incidence of 1/20,000 (men aged 18 to 30 years old). We know that the COVID vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna can cause it. But actual COVID infection is a much more common cause. The CDC has received 1,226 preliminary reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following about 300 million total doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Myocarditis is most common between age 12 and 30 and more common in boys. Among people 12 and older, there were 267 reports of heart inflammation after one dose of vaccine, 827 after the second dose, and 132 after an unknown dose. So overall, the number of cases of myocarditis related to the COVID mRNA vaccines is very low. And for those who do get it, it's usually a small amount of heart inflammation that lasts for a week or so, requiring minimal treatment. 

In fact, myocarditis is way more common from COVID; the risks to the heart from infection can be more severe. Take a look at this ultrasound of the heart, aka echocardiogram, of a young patient with COVID myocarditis…that is a poorly pumping heart. This is why the CDC still recommends vaccination for those 12 and older. Now, 3 recent studies came out that looked at specific cases of myocarditis that developed after getting the COVID mRNA vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna. In the first study, in the journal Pediatrics, they reported 7 cases of myocarditis from the Pfizer vaccine. 

All the patients were 7 otherwise healthy male teenagers. All of them tested negative for COVID. None of the patients met the criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). All had an elevated troponin level. Troponin is a protein in heart muscle cells. Whenever there is heart tissue damage, as occurs with a heart attack, or inflammation of the heart, troponin is leaked into the bloodstream. The higher the troponin, the more heart tissue damage. An echocardiogram, which is excellent for looking at how the heart functions, was normal in all but one patient. Cardiac MRI, which is especially great for looking at the detailed structure of the heart, especially when looking for heart inflammation, showed myocarditis in all the patients. 

This study had 8 patients hospitalized with chest pain within 2-4 days of receiving the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. All of them were otherwise healthy males between the ages of 21 and 56. All but one patient developed symptoms after their second dose. Most had chest pain with a day or 2 of the vaccine. All had elevated troponin levels and myocarditis on MRI. Two of them had a slight reduction in their heart function. One of them had a heart biopsy done, and the pathology results did not show any abnormality. All patients had resolution of their chest pain and were discharged from the hospital in stable condition.

#covidvaccine #vaccine #covid",2021-06-29,1003288,23187,8836,UCMSsLqxqvZsNXi0Z-VjN89A," welcome to another video for those of you 
who don't know me my name is doctor mike hansen   and in this video i'm going to be talking 
about a 13 year old boy in michigan who died   three days after getting the pfizer vaccine the 
cause of death is being investigated by the cdc   and according to the patients on on twitter 
the preliminary autopsy report showed that he   had fluid around his heart so what caused his 
death before i tell you my thoughts on that it   first helps to understand what the background 
on what myocarditis is it's inflammation of the   heart muscle and pericarditis is inflammation of 
the pericardial sac that's where the heart sits   in there sometimes pericarditis can cause fluid 
to build up within the sac but around the heart   muscle and this is called a pericardial effusion 
the first reports of myocarditis after covid 19   mrna vaccines that involved u.s military 
patients and patients from israel the israeli   cohort identified a male predominance with an 
incidence of one out of every twenty thousand men   aged eighteen to thirty we know that the covid 
vaccines from pfizer and modern can cause it but   actual covid infection is a much more common 
cause the cdc has received 1226 preliminary   reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following 
about 300 million total doses of the pfizer and   moderna vaccines myocarditis is most common in 
the ages of 12 to 30 and it's more common in boys   among people 12 and older there were 267 reports 
of heart inflammation meaning myocarditis after   one dose of vaccine and 827 after the 
second dose and 132 after an unknown dose   so overall the number of cases of myocarditis 
related to the covid mrna vaccines is very low   and for those who do get it it's usually a small 
amount of heart inflammation that lasts for about   a week or so requiring minimal treatment in fact 
not only is myocarditis way more common from covid   the risks to the heart from infection can be 
more severe take a look at this ultrasound   of the heart aka an echocardiogram this is 
of a young patient with covid myocarditis   this is a poorly pumping heart this is why the 
cdc still recommends vaccination for those 12 and   older now there's three recent studies that came 
out that looked at specific cases of myocarditis   that developed after getting the covid mrna 
vaccines pfizer and moderna in the first study   in the journal pediatrics they reported on seven 
cases of myocarditis from the pfizer vaccine   all the patients were seven otherwise healthy male 
teenagers all of them tested negative for covid   none of the patients met criteria for multi-system 
inflammatory syndrome in children or misc   all had an elevated troponin level troponin is a 
protein in heart muscle cells and whenever there's   heart tissue damage as occurs with either a heart 
attack or inflammation of the heart that troponin   ends up being leaked into the bloodstream the 
higher the troponin the more heart tissue damage   an echocardiogram which is great for looking at 
how the heart is functioning was normal in all but   one patient cardiac mri which is especially great 
for looking at detailed structure of the heart   especially when looking for heart inflammation 
showed myocarditis in all of the patients   three patients receive nothing more 
than nsaids meaning non-steroidal   anti-inflammatory agents this includes things like 
ibuprofen or the more powerful toradol aka ketorolac   these drugs not only help to suppress 
inflammation or fight inflammation   but they also help to alleviate pain four patients 
received iv ig meaning intravenous immunoglobulin   and they receive steroids and all of them had 
their symptoms resolved in less than a week for   the one who did have an abnormal echocardiogram 
let's take a closer look at his case so he's a   14 year old previously healthy male who gets the 
pfizer vaccine one day later he develops a temp of   38.3 celsius and one day after that starts getting 
shorter breath and he has pleuritic chest pain   pleuritic chest pain meaning it hurts more when 
he takes a deep breath or hurts more if you cough   or sneeze so he goes to an urgent care clinic ekg 
shows st segment elevation st elevation can mean a   lot of different things depending on the clinical 
context sometimes it means there's a heart attack   sometimes it happens with myocarditis and then 
sometimes it happens with pericarditis especially   when you see it in most of the leads and that's 
what he had and his ultrasound showed mildly   depressed left and right ventricular systolic 
function meaning his left ventricle and his right   ventricle weren't pumping quite as strong also 
he had an elevated troponin eye level of 22.1   ngs per ml which normal range for that hospital 
was noted to be less than 0.045 ngs per ml now   in hospital day 3 cardiac mri showed some areas 
of heart muscle swelling meaning edema as well as   some areas of scarring he was treated with nsaids 
first it was toradol and later with naproxen he   was also treated with a diuretic called lasix aka 
furosemide they later repeated the echocardiogram   which showed improvement and he was discharged 
from the hospital after four days on follow-up   13 days later he appeared well but he did have 
chest pain with exertion despite instructions   to avoid strenuous exercise now an ekg showed 
non-specific changes at that time and a third   echocardiogram was also done at that time which 
was back to normal so overall the seven cases   of covet vaccine myocarditis in this study had 
good outcomes then there was this study which had   eight patients that were hospitalized with chest 
pain within two to four days of receiving either   the pfizer or the moderna vaccine all of them were 
otherwise healthy males between the ages of 21 and   56 so older age range in this group all but one 
patient developed symptoms after their second dose   most had chest pain within a day or two of the 
vaccine and all had elevated troponin levels and   myocarditis seen on cardiac mri two of them had 
slight reduction in their heart function one of   them did undergo a heart biopsy and the pathology 
results didn't show any abnormality all patients   had resolution of their chest pain and they were 
discharged from the hospital in stable condition   then there was this study that involved seven 
patients hospitalized for acute myocarditis-like   illness following covid vaccination all were men 
less than 40 years old six patients received the   mrna vaccine either moderna or pfizer and then 
one received the johnson and johnson vaccine   all the patients presented within three to seven 
days after they got the vaccine they all had acute   onset of chest pain and it's basically more of 
the same as the other patients that we just talked   about the one patient in this study that did have 
a heart biopsy done it didn't show any evidence of   myocarditis when they did the pathology study now 
although the heart biopsy was normal that doesn't   necessarily mean that there wasn't myocarditis 
present in a different part of the heart because   trying to hit that right spot is like throwing 
darts blindfolded when doing an autopsy though   this changes because you can look at essentially 
the entire heart underneath the microscope and   finally there's this case report this is a 52 year 
old man who developed myocarditis shortly after   the moderna vaccine and was ultimately discharged 
from the hospital they had special permission   from the patient to test him for just about every 
marker of the immune system that you could think   of all these different cytokines and chemokines 
and so forth they're trying to identify an   immunological pattern but the authors were unable 
to identify a characteristic profile so back to   the 13 year old boy in michigan who died three 
days after getting the pfizer vaccine according   to the patients on twitter the preliminary autopsy 
report showed that he had fluid around his heart   now the cdc is investigating this but there is 
no official autopsy report but one of the biggest   questions is what did the pathology show when they 
looked at the heart underneath the microscope did   it look normal or did it show that there was an 
inflammatory infiltrate like either one of these   regardless people especially males between the 
ages of 12 and 30 who get the mrna covid vaccines   should be aware especially aware 
of the possibilities of myocarditis   especially after the second dose even though it's 
still very rare getting covid is still far worse   compared to the vaccine including adolescents 
aged 12 through 15. so right now pfizer is the   only one approved in this age group between 
12 and 15 and studies with the other vaccines   in younger children are underway covid is 
less severe in children compared to adults   but the risk of getting misc following 
acute covid infection plus the risk of   severe disease in children who have underlying 
medical conditions and the general desire to   prevent covid in children they're all valid 
reasons for vaccination of children also because   misc is associated with immune dysregulation 
that's precipitated by covid immune related   side effects following vaccination in children 
has to be closely monitored so that's all for   this video thanks for watching and don't forget 
to like it if you liked it and if you haven't   done so already hit that subscribe and bell

Just 11% of Australians are vaccinated for COVID-19, and the hope is the shocking images will encourage young people to get the shot.

covert vaccination uh program let's just look at what's been publicized over the last couple of days this is from the government sites first and second doses of covid-19 vaccines will end for many 30th of June checking book now or again says much the same I think so it looks like this is now um winding down for many quite what that means we don't know the full details of now this is happening on the ground people are voting with their feet let me show you what I mean here so here we have the graphic of the um this actually our world in data daily covid-19 vaccination doses administered per 100 people now of course it was high during the pandemic but as of late it's been really quite low as we see down here and if we look at a more recent time frame we can see that the amounts of people taking the vaccine now are remarkably low now for some strange reason New Zealand seem to have had a bit of a blip there um looks like New Zealand have got a slightly different view of the risk to benefit analysis for the covert vaccination if this data is accurate but all other countries basically very much winding down now United States Canada Australia Ireland and uh Denmark um Denmark being the lowest now um that is uh encouraging and of course the pandemic is essentially over now which is good I think the World Health Organization said it was essentially over didn't they now um let's have a look at what they are saying here so this is being publicized on Twitter in various places like that UK to stop primary covered vaccination courses the first and the second dose but the UK Health Security Agency here surprisingly um if you had and I had the first or second dose of the covid vaccine please come forward for them so they're inviting people to still come forward for them who were unvaccinated so just to clarify uh on the 23rd of May 2023 the UK Health Security Agency is still encouraging people to come forward for covert vaccination do with that information as you see fit um but this is what they're saying that I took this from Twitter just this morning actually uh book now to make sure you get the jobs before the offer ends so it makes it sound like a supermarket sale doesn't it anyway um getting the first and second dose of the covered vaccine now I think this has to be distinguish from the booster doses because the booster dose is in the Autumn campaign where you backpedaled when I say we the United Kingdom backpedal to over 55s then for the spring campaign it back pedal to over 75s and those with particular risks but this is still what is on their website at the moment um anyone aged over five on or before the 31st of August 2022 can get a first second dose of covid vaccine so according to the UK regulations you can have your six-year-old vaccinated and some might think it's incredible that this is still uh this is still available and the situation in the United States um is is actually uh is is pretty similar as well I haven't got the CDC one that I thought oh no I've got the CDC on it's there um this is the CDC one here everyone six months in order should get a covert vaccine but as we've seen from the very low update figures of late in the states people are voting with their feet against this this possibility so that's that's the link there for the uh United Kingdom uh site still advising it um the boosters of course are currently over 75 or those with comorbidities just talking about the first and second dose and that was the CDC advice as of today so really quite incredible um CDC as of today everyone over everyone six months and older should get a covid-19 vaccination that is what they're advising but not many taking it up now um Johnson and Johnson in the United States withdrawn now of course now I was just reading today the um the stocks of Johnson and Johnson the uh adenovirus Vector vaccine kind of similar to our AstraZeneca vaccine in this adenovirus Vector vaccine the saying that the stocks they have that have now expired they've no plans to make new ones and they're going to dispose of all the stocks that they have so that one seems to be completely out now don't seem to read much about why it's not being used in the states anymore whereas in the United Kingdom we know that the AstraZeneca has had a lot of issues with uh um what's the word there's a word rare rare adverse reactions um so that's the Johnson Johnson one but 19 million people have had more than 31.5 million doses um let's hope there's no uh no further Adverse Events now uh this is December 21 for the United Kingdom we were pretty slow really to really recognize the dangers from the AstraZeneca a spokesman from The Joint Committee of vaccination immunization the results of the Cove boost trial conducted during the summer of 2021 [Music] um proved good evidence provided good evidence that the MRNA vaccines our most effective option for the UK's booster program so the jvci was saying here when when they moved away from the um AstraZeneca vaccine that's because the other ones were better they're not saying it's because the other ones had Adverse Events they seem to be same because it's the other ones were better um I really think the British public is old enough to be able to handle the truth and on objective explanation for changes but that's just a quote from a popular news Outlet in the UK the full link for the uh communication from the jvci is there for perusal to be fair they do admit rare very rare side effects adverse reactions of the vaccine Denmark of course more on the ball stopped AZ in April 2021. now this article here from the British medical journal and just there patients launch legal action against AstraZeneca over its covid-19 vaccine what's this about um well AstraZeneca has been sent to a pre-action protocol letters apparently by the legal people acting and the first step seems to be like it seems I don't know is this a test case or something I don't know but 75 claimants so far some have survived now this is direct quote from the British medical journal article some have survived with catastrophic injuries following blood clots relative representing others who suffered adverse reactions so some people um who had uh injuries from the vaccine are making claims on their behalf other people who had other adverse reactions from the vaccine um other adverse reactions serious adverse reactions are unable to make their own claims um so relatives are making it for them and I don't think I'm allowed to tell you more than that the claim is under the consumer protection act um and uh they must show that the vaccine was not as safe as the public were entitled to expect now I would have thought I would have thought that they could give evidence to that effect I would have thought so of course there'll be counter argument but um just as a matter of personal opinion do you think that the vaccine was as safe as the public were entitled to expect let me think about that tell me what you think now the vaccine damage scheme in the United Kingdom it's limited to 120 000 000 pounds per applicant to prove Sierra severe disablement or indeed people who can no longer make the application themselves but rely on relatives to make that application for them would just be entitled to that same amount um the Stafford Ministries administering this scheme have gone up from four to eighty so there's now 80 people administering this scheme in the United Kingdom um Freedom of Information requests why do things always have to come by Freedom of Information requests NHS bursary Services Business Services by the 6th of March 2023 so it's by the 6th of March 2023 scheme had received 4017 claims 622 concerned AstraZeneca 348 the Pfizer 43 the moderna vaccine and 344 of these claims were for a severe adverse reaction where the person that suffered the adverse reaction is no longer in a position to make the claim for themselves and the claim has to be made by the relatives now this is not just the UK this is this seems to be an international phenomenon let me just give you one example here from Australia population is only 26 million in Australia remember but they've had a 3 374 claims to their equivalent uh equivalent scheme and I got that from this um Senator Babette speech in the Australian Senate which we might look at more detail but I'll put the link if you wanted to watch that for yourself so um the adenovirus vector vaccines well and truly now um part of the past it looks like um I've got a video here somewhere um is this it of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine in um in in Oxford here it is it's in it's in a Showcase in uh in Oxford here there we go this is in one of the Oxford colleges they're kind of showing it off so this is the Adeno now to be fair I don't know that that's still there it may well have been removed from public display it's a couple of months probably since I was there but it's an artistic uh representation of the uh what you're actually looking at here of course is the uh this is the adenovirus vector with the DNA inside of it that codes for the so in just a few months ago or a couple of months back whenever I was there they were celebrating this as a major scientific success in one of their Museum colleges um if you live in Oxford um do let me know if it's still there or whether it's been removed I'd just be curious to know that so first of all we moved away from the uh adenovirus Vector vaccines to the MRNA vaccines now we're seem to be uh downplaying all of those so hopefully we can look forward to a position in in the not too distant future where these vaccines are not required and already we've seen that people are not taking up the vaccines or uptake of the vaccines is now really remarkably remarkably low I'll just show you that video again at that clip again actually um if I can get that yeah there we go people just aren't taking the vaccine aren't taking the vaccine up anymore looking like the public has made its own um risk benefit analysis that's all we'll do for now um tell me what you think and uh thank you for watching
123,RyT3veZRMcg,Program to pay for COVID vaccine injuries seeks $15 million to fix problems,"The pandemic is over, but thousands of people say they’re still struggling with injuries from the COVID-19 vaccine and other treatments.",2023-05-13,10447,159,152,UCzF4Ryn8TKn64md77gS5Q5Q," Well, the pandemic, as you know, is over, But thousands of people say they're still struggling with injuries from the covet vaccine and other treatments. Tonight, our Rebecca Lindstrom investigates the push to fund the federal program that promised to make it right. Lawmakers across the country say our investigation prompted them to demand answers about why it's taking the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program or CICP, so long to process claims. I appreciate you bringing to everybody's attention Congressman Mike Collins saw 11 alives investigation on frustrations. All of this is paperwork mounting with the CICP. People like Collins story recovering from a cascade of health problems after receiving the vaccine. 2 years later, he still has no idea if his claim will be approved. They keep asking for more. It's just roadblock after roadblock. It seems like Collins sat down to talk with the program's director and says part of the problem. Is technology. They did not even have a computer system in place, a software system to handle people making requests or even inquiring about what their status was, which was what you were talking about and and and and Y'all's reporting. The CSEP has asked Congress for $15 million to enhance communication and substantially increase its capacity to review at least 2000 claims, but with nearly 11,000 claims waiting. It would take more than five years to get through them, especially when you consider the CICP has only processed 706 so far. A third of the federal employees have been working from home, and that just doesn't work very well. The budget request asks to hire 42 fulltime employees and claims 34 positions were funded last year. But to date, the CICP has not answered our fundamental question. How many people are actually working? You're asking the same questions that we ask in every agency up here. Isn't that crazy? They don't know how many people they employ. Of the process cases, 684 were denied, only 22 were eligible for compensation, and the average payout so far is $1500. The story say they have a box full of receipts and haven't even started to add them up. His prescription last week was 600. You know, out of pocket. That was out of pocket upfront and you couldn't get it if you didn't have $600.00 upfront. The CICP has recently created an online portal to track claims, and while it may take years to get a response, people who feel they have been injured only have one year to file a claim."

#COVID19 #SARSCoV2 #Coronavirus",2021-10-27,1107853,10086,461,UCG-iSMVtWbbwDDXgXXypARQ," Welcome to another MedCram COVID-19 update. Here's 
the question that everyone seems to be asking and   that is: which booster should I take? Well in true 
MedCram form, we're going to look at the data   and make a decision. Recently there's been a study 
that's come out that has not been published or   peer-reviewed, but is on this pre-print server 
that was conducted by a number of experienced   researchers out of a number of universities 
across the country and also in medical schools   across the country, including the NIH, and also 
major hospital systems like Kaiser-Permanente,   and this study was performed in the United 
States, and it looks at just that question.  So it takes a look at people who have been 
vaccinated with Moderna, people who have been   vaccinated with Johnson and Johnson, and people who 
have been vaccinated with Pfizer, and they waited   about 12 weeks and they randomized them to receive 
a Moderna booster, a Johnson  and Johnson booster, and a   Pfizer booster. In each one of these categories, 
there were about 50 in each of these groups,   and they split it evenly, so that 25 in each 
group was less than the age of 55 and 25 were   greater than the age of 55. And as it turns out, 
there was 154 in the Moderna group, 150 in the   Johnson and Johnson group, and 154 in the Pfizer 
group. So a total of 458 subjects in this study.   And what these scientists wanted to ask is what 
was the safety data like for each one of these   categories, and what was the efficacy data like in 
terms of the ability to mount an antibody response?   Well, let's take a look at the data. So let's look 
first at the safety data, and what we see here   is we see the cohort that had Johnson 
and Johnson as the original vaccination,   and then were boosted with the Moderna vaccine, but 
notice that in this study they used the full dose   Moderna vaccine, because that's what they 
had available to them. Currently, though, if   you were to go and get a booster shot with the 
Moderna vaccine you would get the 50 microgram   dose or what is known as the half dose. Be aware of 
that Moderna is the only one out of these three   that have reduced the dosages for the booster shot .
Also notice that there are three different colors   here in terms of the graph. There is the light, 
which is mild. There is the darker, which is the   amount of moderate reaction, and then there is 
the darkest which is the most severe. So what   we're going to do is we're going to look back 
and forth here at the different slides, because   if you have had the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, we 
want to see how these side effect profiles look. If   you were to have the Moderna vaccin,e if you were 
to have the Johnson Johnson vaccine as a booster,   or if you were to have the Pfizer vaccine as 
a booster. So this is what it looks like, here, if you focus on this first box, is if you were 
Johnson and Johnson getting the Moderna booster,  and this is what it would look like if 
you had Johnson and Johnson and gotten   the Johnson and Johnson booster, again as 
the second shot, you can see that there are   a little bit more severe reactions here under 
malaise or fatigue and the amount of pain   and tenderness at the local site has gone up 
just a little bit, which is perfectly normal   and acceptable for a vaccine side effect, and 
let's also remember that a lot of these symptoms   are the results of the immune response that we're 
hoping to get with the vaccines in the first place.   And here is the boosting with the Pfizer 
vaccine. You can see a little bit less   in the way of severity, but still a little bit on 
the higher side, so not much difference in terms   of which of the three would give you the more side 
effects. Okay let's concentrate now on those that   got Moderna as their original vaccination and look 
and see what would happen if they got a booster   with Moderna. You can see here that there 
is a side effect profile that you can see.  There is more moderate symptoms here as you can 
see with Moderna what would happen if they got the   Johnson and Johnson as a booster. Here you can see 
also some moderate side effects, especially in the   headache, myalgia, and fatigue category. What about 
if Moderna patients got the Pfizer booster? And   you can see here that there seems to be a little 
bit more mild reaction to those who get the Pfizer   booster who had Moderna originally. Okay let's 
finally look at those who got the Pfizer vaccine.   In this case, those who got the Pfizer vaccine and 
get the Moderna boost, you can see that there is   some side effects there in terms of moderate 
myalgia, malaise, headache, etc. When I say side   effects, I'm referring to the effects that we would 
expect to have happen if somebody got a vaccine,   but would be considered a negative on the face of 
it, but something completely expected in this case.   For those who had the Pfizer vaccine and get 
the Johnson and Johnson booster, you can see   that there's also a little bit higher levels in 
this area of malaise and headache, but not much   different. And finally those going for their third 
shot of Pfizer, that would be the Pfizer booster   for those that had Pfizer before, you can see 
here again a very similar type of profile and   while these symptoms after the vaccine boost were 
quite frequent, most if not all of them went away   quite shortly after the boost. Now, let's talk about 
efficacy, and here again we're going to be looking   at very similar types of situations in this graph. e
We're looking at the IgG binding to s2pwa1 which   is basically using spike protein as a surrogate 
for immunity. So in other words, what we're looking   at here is, how well do the antibodies or the IgG 
that's made after the booster, how well does it   bind the spike protein that we see in SARS-CoV-2? 
And in this case, it's a surrogate of   the actual viral spike protein, so the higher the 
numbers here, the better the immune reaction from   the booster shot. And what we're looking at here is 
looking at the amount of IgG binding on day one, so   that's basically the baseline and you can actually 
get a lot of information just by looking at all   of these different day ones on all of these 
different graphs. And so what we have here is   those with the Johnson and Johnson here in the 
first column getting a Moderna boost, those here   Johnson and Johnson getting a Johnson and Johnson 
boost, and in the first column Johnson and Johnson   getting a Pfizer boost, but before we go to that, 
looking at the boost. Let's just take a look at   where things stand. On the first day, you can see 
here that the antibodies from the Johnson and   Johnson is considerably and consistently lower 
than the Moderna and or the Pfizer, and this goes   along with what we've seen clinically in terms 
of prevention of hospitalization. So I do believe   that this surrogate marker is actually predictive 
of clinical outcomes. So the higher this goes,   potentially, the better protection one would get 
from getting a booster. Also remember too that this   scale here on the y-axis is logarithmic, so the 
higher up you go, the bigger the differences are.   Now again, I want you to remember that this is the 
full dose for Moderna, not the half dose that you   might pick up when you went to go get your actual 
booster shot. Let's talk about what happened. So   those who get the J and J shot, what happens 
when they get a Moderna booster? You can see   that there's quite a rise in those antibodies. What 
happens when J and J gets a J and J booster? Not much   of a rise in comparison to the full dose Moderna. 
What happens when a Johnson and Johnson gets a Pfizer   booster? You can see there that there is quite 
a bit of a jump. So I would say for a J and J   person, they should either get the Moderna or 
the Pfizer booster. What about those that have   Moderna to begin with? You can see here that out 
of all three, typically the Moderna recipients   have the highest binding antibody levels, so 
the question is, what happens when they get   a booster of the three different types? A Moderna 
being boosted by a Moderna does go up even still.   A Moderna going up with a Johnson and Johnson 
does actually go up, and if you compare   the 29-day in both cases, it's actually not too 
different. A Moderna however being boosted with a   Pfizer seems to go up even higher than either one, 
and the reason again why we don't have day 29 data   on the Pfizer boost there on the far 
right is because this is a preliminary   data release, and that data has not yet come 
in. So one can make the judgment here that   when you compare this to this one even still a 
Moderna vaccinated with the Moderna gives you   the highest antibody levels anywhere on this chart. 
And so it could still be reasonably argued that   even though you've had Moderna before and you're 
gonna get a booster, it might be best to get   Moderna for a third shot, but again we're still 
missing this data. We don't know where this is   going to go afterwards. Let's talk about those that 
have had the Pfizer vaccine. So those that have   the Pfizer vaccine and get the Moderna do go up 
significantly here. Those that get the Pfizer and   boost with Johnson and Johnson don't seem to go up 
as much, and those that have the Pfizer and boost   with the Pfizer do seem to go up as much as those 
with the boost for Moderna. Remember, we don't have   some of this data and also this is full dose that 
we're testing here, and what's actually available   for a booster is the half dose. Another way of 
looking at this is looking at the neutralizing   antibody titers in the same situations that 
we looked at before, and as you can see here   the results were nearly identical to looking at 
the IgG binding to the spike protein surrogate.   So of note, if we're interested in looking at the 
efficacy of a booster on top of a fully vaccinated   person, then the question is what does a randomized 
placebo-controlled trial show and the results of   such a randomized placebo-controlled trial was 
published as a press release on October 21st   from Pfizer. This has not been peer reviewed 
or published as yet, but Pfizer's record in   terms of releasing data in press releases has been 
pretty good, and the numbers have turned out to be   pretty accurate. So because of that, we shared 
these numbers here, so what they basically did   is they took fully vaccinated patients with two 
shots of the Pfizer vaccine and there was about 10,000 subjects in this study, which was randomized 
one to one with a third shot of the Pfizer vaccine   and placebo and the participants in this study 
were 16 years and older, and remember now that's   a little bit different than what the FDA recently 
allowed for boosters, but again this is the trials,   the phase three trials, for the booster and in 
terms of the ages you probably want to know   how many of these were in what age category. 
What they have told us is that the median age   was 53 years of age and that 23 of the people 
in this cohort were above the age of 65 years.   Again, they've told us that there were 10,000 in 
this study, so we're assuming that there were about   5,000 in each arm since it was a one-to-one study 
and they began looking for symptoms seven days   after the shot. They finally reached the end point 
in the study with five cases in the intervention   group. The people that got the third shot of the 
Pfizer vaccine the booster and there were 109   cases of symptomatic COVID in the placebo group. 
So again we're looking for symptomatic COVID-19.   And because of those cases, they're saying 
that there was a 95.6 percent efficacy   of the vaccine to prevent symptomatic 
COVID-19 in patients who have already had   two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Now I'm going to 
make some assumptions here that if there were 5000   in both groups and the mean follow-up time was 
about 2.5 months, which is important to understand,   and that means if they had five cases in 5,000 
that would mean that there was a .00  chance of having symptomatic COVID 
in the intervention group, and about 0.0218 chances of having COVID with just two shots 
of the Pfizer vaccine. So you can see these are   pretty low. Here you have a one in one thousand 
chance as the absolute risk, and over here you   have about a two percent absolute risk. So the 
real key that we need to know in terms of the   value of an intervention is what is the absolute 
risk reduction? The absolute risk reduction is   simply one minus the other, and in that case 
the absolute risk reduction is 0.0. Now you'll know from statistics that if you want 
to prevent one person from having symptomatic   COVID-19, how many people need to get the booster 
to prevent one of those people from getting   symptomatic COVID-19? That's known as the 
number needed to treat or in this case the   number needed to vaccinate and that's simply 
the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction,   and in this case that's about 48. And to give 
you an idea of what this means, to prevent death   in somebody with a stroke TIA or myocardial 
infarction, giving an aspirin to them daily   given to 67 people, in fact, will prevent one death, 
and that's a little bit less effective than what   we're seeing here in terms of the number of people 
that need to get one immunization to prevent one   of these people from getting symptomatic COVID-19 
is 48. That's actually not too bad, but remember   of course that it actually could be even better 
than 48 because the follow-up time here was only   2.5 months, and I think most people agree that 
the vaccine shots, well we don't know how long   they last, probably last longer than 2.5 months. 
It'll be interesting to see once this paper   gets published and peer-reviewed what the final 
conclusions are, but I thought I'd bring this up   in terms of the data out there and what it is 
looking like. Some might be wondering whether   or not this has a higher effect in those that 
are older versus younger. Pfizer did say in the   statement that multiple subgroup analysis 
of the efficacy were performed and there   was no difference of other core morbidities. 
They also mentioned that the adverse events   were consistent with all of the patterns 
that had been done before with the initial   vaccination schedule. As always there'll be more 
data to come and analyze. Thanks for joining us."

Is The COVID 19 Vaccine The Mark Of The Beast? With the COVID 19 vaccine being administered all around the world and as many as 100 million Americans already having recovered it, many Christians and non-Christians alike are asking if this vaccine is indeed the Mark of the Beast mentioned in Revelation. Does the coming of this vaccine mean the antichrist is also on his way? If you got the COVID 19 vaccine are you doomed for all eternity? Pastor Greg opens God's Word and also gives us his answer to either or not he believes The COVID 19 Vaccine The Mark Of The Beast.

Each one is being seen as a way out of the global pandemic and the quickest way to get things back to normal.

In many countries, having a vaccine is not mandatory yet the success of vaccination programmes depends upon how many people take up the offer of one.

So what will happen if you choose not to get the vaccine?

131,IGqDGeDssmY,The Unstudied Link Between the COVID Vaccine and Periods,"After Katharine Lee got her COVID-19 vaccine, she noticed an unusual side effect: a heavier period. She shared her observation with a fellow anthropologist, Kathryn Clancy, who had the same reaction. Clancy posted her findings on Twitter and the tweet went viral––apparently, they weren’t alone in this: thousands of people were experiencing similar side effects from the vaccination. The two biological anthropologists went on to launch a research study into the effects the COVID-19 vaccines might have on the menstrual cycle. Early findings: even some people who had aged out of periods, or were on hormone-suppressing drugs, experienced sudden, heavier periods. 

But this wasn’t one of the side effects that the CDC looked for in its studies. 

As it turns out: this comes from a long lineage of periods, and people with periods, being overlooked in scientific studies. VICE News digs into the history of how and why scientists have failed to adequately study periods and kept any information they do have away from the people who have them. And how that’s having very real consequences today.

WILLIAM: GEOFF, THANKS TO WIDESPREAD VACCINATION, MEASLES WAS DECLARED ELIMINATED BACK IN 2000 IN THE U.S., SO SEEING THESE OUTBREAKS IN DIFFERENT STATES, WHILE THEY ARE STILL SMALL IN NUMBER OF CASES, HAS BEEN DISTURBING TO MANY. DR. PAUL OFFIT IS A PEDIATRICIAN AT THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF PHILADELPHIA WHO SPECIALIZES IN VIROLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGY. HIS NEW BOOK, ABOUT WHERE WE ARE IN OUR STRUGGLE AGAINST COVID, IS CALLED ""TELL ME WHEN IT'S OVER."" WELCOME BACK. I WANT TO PUT UP THIS GRAPH THAT SHOWS THE RISING NUMBER OF CASES OF MEASLES THE LAST FEW MONTHS. IT STARTS ON THE LEFT IN 23 AND GOES TO THE PRESENT. WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS DRIVING THIS UPTICK? DR. OFFIT: A CRITICAL PERCENTAGE OF PARENTS ARE CHOOSING NOT TO VEX AND I -- VACCINATE THEIR CHILDREN. THE RATE OF IMMUNIZATION AMONG KINDERGARTNERS IS STARTING TO DROP AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING THIS IS THE DISEASE YOU SEE BECAUSE THIS IS THE MOST CONTAGIOUS OF THE VACCINE FOR VEGETABLE DISEASES. WILLIAM: THE CDC JUST SAID THAT 92% OF AMERICAN KIDS WHO RECEIVED THE MEASLES, MUMPS AND RUBELLA VACCINE, THAT'S A FEW NOTCHES BELOW 95% THAT GETS US TO HERD IMMUNITY. THAT IS ENOUGH TO MAKE A DIFFERENT? DR. OFFIT: ABSOLUTELY. TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE, THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED THE CONTAGIOUSNESS INDEX, HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD YOU INFECT ASSUMING YOU ARE INFECTED AND EVERYBODY IS SUSCEPTIBLE FOR DISEASES LIKE COVID AND INFLUENZA -- SUSCEPTIBLE. PRODUCES LIKE COVID AND INFLUENZA IT'S THREE, MEASLES IS 18. WILLIAM: I DON'T WANT TO DATE YOU, BUT I KNOW YOU HAD MEASLES AS A CHILD BEFORE THE VACCINE. FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T REMEMBER, IN YOUR MIND IS HOW SERIOUS OF A VIRUS OR WHAT TALK ABOUT? DR. OFFIT: BEFORE THERE WAS A MEASLES VACCINE IN 1963, EVERY YEAR IN THE COUNTRY THERE WOULD BE THREE TO FOUR CASES OF MEASLES AND 3000 TO 4000 PEOPLE HOSPITALIZED AND 500 PEOPLE DIED, MOSTLY CHILDREN. THEY DIED FROM SEVERE DEHYDRATION, SEVERE PNEUMONIA, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE BRAIN. IT IS A TERRIBLE DISEASE AND I THINK WHAT WE ARE SUFFERING RIGHT NOW IS NOT JUST BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING MEASLES IN THE MANNER OF BEFORE, WE DON'T REMEMBER MEASLES. WE DON'T ROOM OR HOW SICK THE VIRUS CAN MAKE YOU. WILLIAM: ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE ALSO SEEN IS A SOMEWHAT CONFUSING AND CONFLICTING OFFICIAL GUIDANCE. IN FLOOR THERE WAS AN OUTBREAK AT A SCHOOL AND THE STATE SURGEON GENERAL SENT A LETTER TO FAMILIES THAT SEEMED TO CONTRADICT ALL OF THE OFFICIAL GUIDANCE. HE DIDN'T RECOMMEND PARENTS GET VACCINATED, HE DIDN'T RECOMMEND UNVACCINATED CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN EXPOSED QUARANTINED THEMSELVES. HOW ARE PEOPLE SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT TO DO IF THEY ARE GETTING THIS MIXED MESSAGING? DR. OFFIT: THE MESSAGING THEY WERE GETTING IN FLORIDA WAS ERRONEOUS. THE TWO WEAPONS, ONE IS ISOLATION OF PEOPLE INFECTED, THEY NEED TO ISOLATE FOR 21 DAYS, AND THE OTHER IS VACCINATION, AND GIVING A VERY SOFT SELL FOR THOSE, HE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DO A LOT OF HARM. WILLIAM: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF A LARGER DECLINE IN PUBLIC FAITH IN PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU DEAL WITH IN YOU KNEW -- YOUR NEW BOOK AND YOU TALK ABOUT MISSTEPS THAT WERE TAKEN DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC. HOW DO WE REPAIR THIS BREACH SO THAT WHEN THE NEXT OUTBREAK COMES, PEOPLE KNOW WHERE TO GET GOOD, SMART INFORMATION? DR. OFFIT: I THINK BY MANDATING COVID VACCINES, WE INADVERTENTLY LEANED INTO THIS LIBERTARIAN LEFT HOOK. NOW YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF PIECES OF LEGISLATION PUSHING BACK AGAINST VACCINE MANDATES AND MASKING MANDATES BECAUSE IT WAS SEEN AS AN ISSUE OF BODILY AUTONOMY. BUT IT'S NOT A PERSONAL CHOICE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MEASLES BECAUSE IT IS A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE. WHEN YOU MAKE A DECISION FOR YOURSELF, YOU ALSO MAKE A DECISION FOR OTHERS. THERE'S ABOUT 9 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WHO CANNOT BE VACCINATED BECAUSE THEY ARE GETTING CHEMOTHERAPY, OR THEY HAVE HAD A TRANSPLANT. THEY DEPEND ON THOSE AROUND THEM TO BE PROTECTED. DO WE HAVE ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR NEIGHBOR? I THINK WE DO. WILLIAM: THAT WAS ARGUMENT MADE DURING COVID AND WE ARE MAKING IT AGAIN DURING MEASLES AND WE ARE STILL SEEING THIS PUSHBACK BOTH LEGISLATIVELY AND PERSONALLY. THIS WILL BE AN AND NORMA'S CHALLENGE FOR THE COUNTRY MOVING FORWARD. -- AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE FOR THE COUNTRY MOVING FORWARD. DR. OFFIT: YES GOOD AND SOME TEXTURES THE WORD VACCINE HAS BECOME -- YES. IN SOME SECTORS OF THE WORD VACCINE HAS BECOME A DIRTY WORD. CHILDREN DON'T NEED TO SUFFER, IT'S THE MOST VULNERABLE WHO SUFFER. WILLIAM: THE NEW BOOK IS CALLED ""TELL ME WHEN IT IS OVER."" THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DR. OFFIT: THANK YOU."

UVA Critical Care and Infectious Disease physician, Taison Bell, was surprised to learn that even nurses who care for patients with COVID-19 are hesitant to seek answers to their questions about the vaccines. He describes the impromptu chalk talk session he had with nursing colleagues and their discussion about the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.

Transcript

TAISON BELL, MD: My name is Taison Bell. I'm a critical care and infectious disease physician at the University of Virginia. 

There was a day, I was in the ICU and I was talking to one of my nurses about the COVID-19 vaccine, and then I noticed that there were many other nurses who were kind of coming and crowding around. And I actually decided to just do a chalk talk and just talk about the COVID-19 vaccine for my staff. And I think what was kind of a barrier was this assumption that if you're a healthcare worker, if you are a nurse, then you shouldn't have questions about the vaccine, that you should just take it. And these were nurses who were working in the COVID ICU, and we were taking care of pregnant women who are coming in very sick, on mechanical ventilation, or the breathing machine. So they knew first and forehand how severe COVID-19 could be if they were to get infected, but yet and still, they had a lot of questions about the vaccine. 

So that was a moment where I understood if the nurses who were working here have questions, then almost everyone probably has these questions. And so we just decided to talk about it. You know, what do we know about the vaccine and its potential to affect your fertility? It's potential to affect the health of your baby if you're pregnant or if you're breastfeeding, and really to get into that. 

Now what's frustrating about the trials is that they did not include women who were pregnant during the time of enrollment. But what we know is that there were women who became pregnant during the course of the vaccine. We know that based on the ingredients in the vaccine, that they break down relatively quickly. There's nothing that's expected to cause any harm to the fetus or to the mom. The Pfizer and Moderna have both done trials in animal models to demonstrate that there's no danger to both the developing fetus and to the mother itself. So we have plenty of data points as to show us that this is a safe and effective vaccine. 

But we also talk about what is the risk of being a woman of childbearing age and getting COVID-19 because we've seen data showing that it's associated with higher rates of miscarriage, higher rates of preterm labor, and higher rates of women getting sick with COVID-19 and going to the hospital. And so when you balance those two effects, and when I've talked to women that were pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant, and really thinking through what are the risks versus the benefits, particularly if you are in the community and potentially getting exposed, it really weighs towards protecting yourself, protecting your health, protecting the health of the baby and getting the vaccine. 

So for my family members, I have family members who are thinking about getting pregnant, some who are pregnant, I've advised them all to get the vaccine because I want them to do, I want them to be safe. But I think for each person who has to put yourself in that decision journey, you want to make sure that you have accurate and good information. Knowing that over 10,000 women have been vaccinated now who have been pregnant and we've had no signal that there's anything concerning about that. But we do know that those women are now protected from having a bad outcome from COVID-19. That's the message that we have to get out there, that this is a safe thing to do for yourself and for your baby. Speak with your physician as always, but we're really leaning towards making sure that women are protected.",2021-03-25,73068,509,0,UCAUMuw4KF1mPdOlxaAbTDmw," My name is Taison Bell.

Why You Can Be Forced To Get The Covid Vaccine",2021-04-01,1397808,12280,33476,UCvJJ_dzjViJCoLf5uKUTwoA, [Music] record numbers of americans are getting vaccinated against the coronavirus the us the most vaccinated large nation in the world dozens of countries are now working to vaccinate their populations in an effort to end the global pandemic president biden says that by the end of his first 100 days the united states is aiming to have administered 200 million doses and by may 2021 every american adult who wants one will be eligible to get in line for a shot that said 30 percent of u.s adults still don't want to get the covet vaccine but they may not have much of a choice the federal government can can require vaccination and things like that for coming in and out of the country both the state and city can have vaccine laws based on their legislative authority requiring a vaccine is a health and safety work rule an employers can do that bonnie jacobson knows us all too well the brooklyn resident was recently let go from her job after refusing to get inoculated i was sitting at home and i all of a sudden just opened an email sitting on my couch and it said basically while we respect your decision at this time your employment has been terminated so can you actually be forced to take the coveted vaccine against your will in the united states [Music] to be clear the white house's chief medical advisor has already said that he doesn't think the federal government will ever make the colvin vaccine mandatory however powers at the city and state level not to mention the legal rights granted to employers under u.s labor law may make it pretty difficult for some americans to evade inoculation against the coronavirus this isn't as unprecedented as you might think there are a lot of required inoculations which are easy to take for granted just take the chickenpox all 50 states and the district of columbia have laws requiring children entering child care or public schools to have some sort of provable protection against the disease whether that's a vaccine or evidence of immunity in fact schools from preschool through university typically require a battery of inoculations before you can step foot on campus when i was a health commissioner in washington d.c we had passed laws that required anyone who went to a school to be vaccinated against certain preventable diseases there are religious medical and philosophical exemptions that vary state by state but for around 170 years america's schools have done a pretty thorough job controlling vaccine preventable disease in the u.s the very first school vaccination mandate was in massachusetts back in the 1850s it was to protect against smallpox transmission by the start of the 20th century almost half of all states required students to be vaccinated before matriculating in the early 1970s schools with a measles vaccine mandate had incidence rates that were up to 51 percent lower than states without the laws and from there school vaccine mandates expanded over the next few decades [Music] the while schools had been requiring vaccines since the mid-19th century states didn't explicitly have that same power to roll out universal inoculation rules for all residents for another 50 years in 1905 the supreme court case of jacobson versus massachusetts set the legal precedent which now allows states to require vaccines the supreme court said yes you can limit individual rights to protect the public health and one way you can do it in that case is require vaccination we've seen states exercise this authority to varying degrees in the year since take for example the 2019 measles outbreak in new york new york imposed the mandate it imposed an mmr mandate but it limited it to the neighborhoods where the measles cases were high and it was accompanied by a one thousand dollar fine for those who did not have mmr legal experts say that narrowing the vaccine mandate to particular zip codes made it easier to justify in court rather than a statewide mandate but critics warn that these types of targeted requirements may lead to discriminatory practices in general these things are done at the state level but big cities for example also have vaccine laws when i was the city health commissioner in washington dc although that certainly functions as a state we also have vaccine laws in the in washington d.c so far no cities or states have made the covid vaccine mandatory though some places have started the conversation in november 2020 the new york state bar association recommended making the shot mandatory for all residents except those with a medical exemption and then of course there's the biggest rule maker of them all the federal government which in this case actually has pretty limited powers expressly spelled out in the constitution there isn't in the constitution the power to protect the public health well the federal government doesn't mandate vaccines um what they do is they make recommendations there are however software powers at the federal level that have been used before to incentivize mass inoculation the federal government has acted in the public health in the past using other parts such as its commerce parts so it could for example mandate vaccines before you travel in the interstate channels or before you engage in interstate commerce if you're a truck driver that drives across state maybe the federal government can mandate that you'll be vaccinated the power of the purse is another key tool in washington's arsenal it can pass a law saying states will give you three million dollars if you mandate the vaccine but that's up to a limit it can't do it to the degree that's cursive the federal government could also theoretically impose it as a condition of getting a passport so states and cities can require vaccines and the federal government has a lot of influence as well but the big question is whether the government will actually go through with rolling out a universal mandate the first challenge is we won't have enough vaccine doses for people who want them you can't require vaccines that's not available that people can't get another major factor to consider none of the three coveted vaccines in circulation here in the u.s are fully licensed by the fda instead they are all cleared under something known as an emergency use authorization or an eua until they are officially approved mandates seem to be off the table and then there's the even bigger question of enforcement mandates to some degree this depend on pretty widespread compliance you can't enforce a mandate if 40 of your population is fighting back if the problem is widespread mistrust mandate won't fix it you need communication you need education you need to earn the people's trust by by transparently showing them that the vaccine is safe and effective by explaining to them the process of approving it and so forth and keep in mind if any city or state did implement a mandate the kinds of repercussions we're talking about are relatively tame no one is floating the idea of jail time or coming to your house and holding you down while they administer a shot refusal would probably just mean a fine or maybe some sort of other tax or penalty experts say it may also mean you are barred from entry to concerts or can't book a seat on certain airlines in israel for example they use the green passport to allow access to businesses like hotels and restaurants to those who have been vaccinated against the virus or have already had kobit 19. implementation though might be tough here in the u.s so how will this actually play out experts tell me the most likely scenario is a repeat of what we've seen in the past once the copit vaccines are fully approved by the fda a vaccine may eventually be a requirement for school-age children in both public and private institutions starting at daycare and extending to universities let's say the city where you live decides against requiring the covet vaccine does that mean you're free from mandatory covet inoculation not necessarily your employer may not be willing to take no for an answer jacobson was a waitress in brooklyn and served patrons all through the pandemic she told nbc new york that while she isn't an anti-vaxxer she did have concerns about getting the shot because she's trying to get pregnant my general manager has told me multiple times it wasn't going to be mandatory when her former employer red hook tavern asked if she planned to get the vaccine now that it's available for restaurant workers she shared those worries over the last couple months i had just heard a few things about how it can affect fertility and pregnancy and i just wanted to have a better understanding of that and do a little more research i said that once i had more information i would definitely be willing to change my mind on getting the vaccine i expressed that you know i understand why they're important i think that the vaccine's a good thing i'm not against them within a few days she received an email from her employer saying that they respected her decision but they would be terminating her employment because of their new policy to maintain a safe working environment you know i've made it clear to my lawyer that i want to go in whatever direction i think will help the most amount of people have this same situation not happen to them cnbc reached out to red hook tavern for comment and we didn't hear back as of the date of publication jacob's inspiring appears to be totally legal here in the us i spoke with lawyers across the country and they all say that their clients are reaching out to them in record numbers to ask what they should do about the vaccine clients of mine that are most interested in making a mandatory vaccine a condition of employment are brick and mortar operations that have a lot of foot traffic from their customers they view it as a selling point look you can come to our business location and it's safe because all employees have been vaccinated that's particularly important for restaurants bars gyms and salons and so my clients in that segment of service industry are particularly looking hard at making it mandatory as a sales point to their customers while this is in part a pr tactic it's also totally within an employer's rights to roll out this kind of requirement legal experts say private businesses have pretty extensive rights requiring a vaccine is a health and safety work rule employers like some hospitals already require employees to get the annual influenza vaccine so there's precedent that under the law an employer can force an employee to get vaccinated and if they don't fire them there are a few ways that employees could apply to be exempt from a blanket requirement if a workforce is unionized the collective bargaining agreement may require negotiating with the union before mandating a vaccine anti-discrimination laws also provide some protections now other employers think that incentives are the better route to widespread inoculation in the workplace that could mean that if you get the vaccine you don't have to wear the same level of ppe in the office or have your temperature taken every day there's also talk of offering financial perks many of my clients who are struggling with this issue have said well while we think it's a good idea to make it mandatory we are going to make it voluntary but we're going to try to offer economic incentives bonuses as well as paying for the vaccination and offering optionally if the family wants to have the vaccination to pay for that too also because an eua is not a license there is a legal question as to whether you can mandate an emergency authorization well they're not a fully licensed product so the ability to to require your employees to be vaccinated will be highly controversial in fact i would argue that an employer cannot require you to be vaccinated with anything other than a fully licensed product mandatory vaccination protocols therefore may have to wait until the fda completes the entire approval process for the coveted vaccines ultimately a big part of whether the u.s achieves herd immunity against the coronavirus comes down to whether the population buys into the science pfizer and moderna built their coven vaccines with a new kind of technology that's never before been licensed in the u.s mrna vaccines are pretty revolutionary in the world of medicine but they also signify a natural progression of science so far it does seem that a concerted effort to educate the general public about covid vaccine safety and efficacy is working a 2021 pew research survey published in march showed that 69 of us adults have either already gotten the vaccine or they intend to dr fauci says that if 75 to 80 of americans are vaccinated then by the end of the summer of 2021 we may be able to achieve herd immunity if this polling bears out over the coming months we'd certainly be trending in that direction and mandates may not even be necessary

147,IxCHv7T_mao,Would I Take a COVID Vaccine?,"A thing I really wish I'd had time to say in this video...now that we have vaccines that will be being distributed within 30 days, it is even more valuable to stay home, wear masks, and prevent the spread of this disease. Before now, we were buying time for some eventual moment that we didn't even know would come. Now we are buying time for a goal we can actually see...and a goal that isn't far off.

148,sidjKoHS6NE,British regulators limit covid vaccines,"JCVI makes interim recommendations to government on the COVID-19 vaccination programme for 2023.

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-advises-an-autumn-covid-19-vaccine-booster

https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/covid-19-vaccination-programme

Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)

has advised that plans should be made for those at higher risk of severe COVID-19 to be offered a booster vaccination this autumn (2023).

Professor Wei Shen Lim, Chair of COVID-19 vaccination on the JCVI

As the transition continues away from a pandemic emergency response towards pandemic recovery,

In England, the closure of the autumn booster campaign and the first booster offer will be on 12 February 2023. 

(basically no more boosters for healthy under 50s)

Similarly, the JCVI is advising that the primary course COVID-19 vaccination should move, 

over the course of 2023, towards a more targeted offer

Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine

https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/

Everyone aged 5 (on or before 31 August 2022) and over can get a 1st and 2nd dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.

https://www.sst.dk/en/English/Corona-eng/Vaccination-against-COVID-19

we recommend vaccination of people aged 50 years and over as well as selected risk groups.

Regulator funding

https://www.bmj.com/content/377/bmj.o1538

Industry money saturates the globe’s leading regulators.",2023-01-25,702061,37868,7234,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg, what a warm welcome just a brief evening update for Wednesday the 25th I wanted to bring you this sort of hot off the press it's from The Joint Committee on uh vaccination and immunization and basically what they're saying is as from the 12th of next month healthy under 50s are not going to be eligible for covert vaccination in the UK some might say this is a sensible targeting of resources as we move towards endemicity others might suggest it's uh frantic backpedaling the report is written in very positive language about this move to a more rational distribution of resources nothing about side effects nothing about adverse reactions nothing about changing risk benefit analysis some of you might find what I'm about to say fairly pathetic but let's do it anyway jvci makes uh recommend interim recommendations and we can expect these to be taken up by the government of course has advised that plans should be made for those at higher risk of severe covid-19 to be offered to booster vaccination this Autumn so looking at head so it's not saying that young people are at minimal risk especially in the age of Omicron it's not saying that we've now got huge amounts of natural immunity it's not saying we've now got huge amounts of mucosal immunity no it's just a simple rationalization and targeting of of resources Professor Lim chair as the transition continues away from a pandemic emergency response towards pandemic recovery yep in England at the closure of the Autumn booster campaign will be on the 12th of uh February 2023 still over two weeks away I guess um two and a half weeks away basically it means no more boosters for health healthy under 50s which we are of course very pleased to um very pleased to see uh similarly the jvcis advising that the primary course of covert vaccination should move over the course of 2023 towards a more targeted offer so this is going to include primary immunization as well as the boosters fairly soon and this is all here really for yourself it's just put in language which makes everything sound so positive there's no mention of anything negative it really does strike me as being it's not written in a genuine way as far as I can see but but there we go now the current recommendations in the UK oh there's also another document here um that that is linked to covert vaccination program this is actually the official document oh uh blood clotting myocarditis and pericarditis and Guillain-Barre syndrome um I guess it's not any longer possible to ignore these uh adverse reactions what's the word that describes that there's a word they use um rare that's it these rare these rare reactions so it's good to see some honesty at least on on that site there now at the moment in the UK and um let me just read it um coronavirus covert vaccinations in the UK everyone age five on or before the 31st of August 2022 I know we can get a first and second dose of the covid-19 vaccine at the moment in my country you can take a perfectly healthy child in to see a professional health care advisor Healthcare practitioner and they will inject a healthy five-year-old child with a messenger ribonucleic acid vaccine that is the current position in my country at the moment I'm not allowed to disagree with this um I merely reported there you go that's the advice there from my government enough of that now Denmark of course is ahead of the uh the curb somewhat as usual um here's the the Danish government site they've already actually adopted this position very kind of the Danish authorities of course to make a full copies available of their documentation in English saves me using Google translate we recommend vaccination of people age 50 years and over as well as selected risk groups so ahead of the game other countries have got to move to this pretty soon haven't they I mean they simply they simply have to the risk of severe disease in young people from Omicron who have been previously exposed to The Vibes and we all have been previously exposed now it's absolutely minimal risk benefit analysis has changed as I've been saying for um well now what we are yeah for over a year now for over a year now radical change now just to finish off on a completely separate matter and this is nothing to do with the history of the MRNA vaccines of course um regulatory funding this article in the British medical journal now the British medical journal says industry money saturates the global leading Regulators not my words British medical journal that's what they say saturates and here we have a table in I'm aware you won't be able to see this I'm going to read some of the uh some of the Salient points about industry money uh proportion of the budget derived from industry so this is it here so Australia it's uh 96 percent Europe it's 89 United Kingdom it's only 86 percent so that means in the United Kingdom 86 of The Regulators money comes from industry and I don't imagine it's you making industry to you in the United States it's actually quite a bit lower it's only 65 percent now of course no one's saying that the fact that Australia get 96 of the money that the Europe get eight to nine percent of the money that UK get 86 of the money the Japan gets 85 of the money that the U.S Regulators get 65 in Canada only 50.5 no one's saying any of these huge percentages have any influence on their decision making of course we merely report what is in the British medical journal the various other things that the bmj has kept this in the public domain so check it out for yourself so there you go um if there was anyone here that wants to rush out and get a vaccine who's healthy below the age of 50 before the expiry time in the UK you've got until the 12th of January um I won't be rushing my last vaccine was on the uh it was November 2021 I haven't had one since then can't tell you what to do of course but I haven't had one since 2021. so there we go uh change from the jvci all in very positive uh language as they move towards consolidation and targeting I'll leave you to make what you like of that but thank you for watching

Is The COVID 19 Vaccine The Mark Of The Beast? With the COVID 19 vaccine being administered all around the world and as many as 100 million Americans already having recovered it, many Christians and non-Christians alike are asking if this vaccine is indeed the Mark of the Beast mentioned in Revelation. Does the coming of this vaccine mean the antichrist is also on his way? If you got the COVID 19 vaccine are you doomed for all eternity? Pastor Greg opens God's Word and also gives us his answer to either or not he believes The COVID 19 Vaccine The Mark Of The Beast.

#BBCNews",2021-05-09,91141,938,1017,UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA, i think it's understandable to be a little bit confused a little bit anxious about it and just not sure what to do if you're pregnant breastfeeding or just thinking about having a baby then the advice from the experts is you should be offered the covered vaccine i'm dr stephanie ue i'm a gp and i had my baby during first lockdown there is a history of having vaccines given to pregnant women every pregnant woman is recommended to have the flu vaccine and whooping cough vaccine and those are known to be safe in pregnancy research from the usa involving more than 90 000 pregnant people who had mainly the pfizer or moderna shot found no safety concerns and now we're beginning to see similar data here in the uk all the data that we've had so far suggests that there is not an increased risk of miscarriage and in fact there is no biological mechanism by which that could happen because we don't think that the vaccine actually crosses the placenta and affects the baby but in the uk only the pfizer and moderna shots are being recommended so far but that may change in the future the experts say you can have your shots at any stage of your pregnancy as you can become ill with covid at any time however a lot of women do feel more vulnerable in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy so i don't think there's any problem in delaying um your vaccination until after 12 weeks if you feel more comfortable to do so so if you decided to wait until after your 12-week scan then you would still be able to get your second shot before entering the third trimester which is the period where kovid is more likely to cause the most harm your baby's not helping you at that point because it's stopping the diet from moving your lungs aren't working in the way that they usually would and so then if you get a an infection a bad infection on top of that it can cause more significant problems what if you've already had a dose of oxford astrazeneca and you were fine well then the recommendation is you still go get your second dose because if you're fine the first time you should be fine the second time as well it's okay to have questions about the vaccine and talking to your gp or your midwife will help you make a decision that's right for you you know it's not like pregnant women are being told you must all have the vaccine ultimately it's your decision you do what you feel is right for you and you're making sure you're getting your information from the right resources you

Each one is being seen as a way out of the global pandemic and the quickest way to get things back to normal.

In many countries, having a vaccine is not mandatory yet the success of vaccination programmes depends upon how many people take up the offer of one.

So what will happen if you choose not to get the vaccine?

157,IGqDGeDssmY,The Unstudied Link Between the COVID Vaccine and Periods,"After Katharine Lee got her COVID-19 vaccine, she noticed an unusual side effect: a heavier period. She shared her observation with a fellow anthropologist, Kathryn Clancy, who had the same reaction. Clancy posted her findings on Twitter and the tweet went viral––apparently, they weren’t alone in this: thousands of people were experiencing similar side effects from the vaccination. The two biological anthropologists went on to launch a research study into the effects the COVID-19 vaccines might have on the menstrual cycle. Early findings: even some people who had aged out of periods, or were on hormone-suppressing drugs, experienced sudden, heavier periods. 

But this wasn’t one of the side effects that the CDC looked for in its studies. 

As it turns out: this comes from a long lineage of periods, and people with periods, being overlooked in scientific studies. VICE News digs into the history of how and why scientists have failed to adequately study periods and kept any information they do have away from the people who have them. And how that’s having very real consequences today.

161,GtYNX69Abv0,Can the Covid vaccine harm unborn babies during pregnancy? - BBC News,"Over half of the world’s population has received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. Supply is still a big problem, especially in poorer countries where less than 10% of people are vaccinated. But even when vaccines are available, some remain hesitant to take them.

BBC Reality Check's health reporter Rachel Schraer answers some of your concerns - from pregnancy side effects to the speed at which vaccines were developed.

 #BBCNews",2022-01-17,93929,1558,1079,UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA, over half of the world's population has received at least one dose of a vaccine against coronavirus but there are big differences in vaccination rates across the globe less than 10 percent of people in low-income countries have been vaccinated vaccine supply is still a big problem in many countries but even when vaccines are available many are concerned about taking them we've looked into some of the most common concerns the reason i'm skeptical or hesitant about taking the coved 19 vaccine is because of the speed at which the vaccine is reproduced vaccines against covid have been produced at record speed not because they've skipped steps or rushed the research but because so many scientists and companies from all over the world have shared the work covered vaccines have been comprehensively tested for safety first in trials of hundreds of thousands of people to pick up any common side effects and then through careful monitoring as the vaccines were given to millions of people in the general population allowing scientists to spot much rarer reactions but even now they are still being studied and monitored but what about the idea that people who've been vaccinated without any problems might suddenly develop issues months or years down the line scientists who study vaccines and the immune system say this is extremely unlikely we know enough about how the human body works and we have enough experience from previous vaccines to know that any side effects will emerge within the first two months or so so we've had more than enough time for any possible side effects to show up here no vaccine can give you 100 protection from getting ill but crucially if you do develop symptoms they are likely to be much milder the vaccines still give high protection against becoming very ill and ending up in hospital even with newer variants although you can still catch the virus you are less likely to and if you do catch crovid after being vaccinated you're also less likely to pass it on protecting the people around you during pregnancy it's totally understandable that people want to be extra cautious but the data so far is reassuring millions have been vaccinated and we haven't seen any worrying side effects related to pregnancy or fertility yet large studies have found vaccinated pregnant women are no more likely to experience complications including miscarriage than unvaccinated women there are however increased risks to people during pregnancy if they catch covert those who get the virus particularly in later pregnancy are more likely to become severely ill or have a premature or stillbirth some people are worried that getting vaccinated may affect their future fertility but there's no evidence or scientific basis for believing this to be the case we know that there are very rare serious side effects to the coping vaccines the risks of long-term health problems and death are much more common from catching covid than from the vaccine even in younger people that's important to be aware of so you can balance those risks and benefits when making your decision whether to get vaccinated you

vaccinations or the pandemic in general, they’ll be in the playlist 
linked in the description. [♪♪♪] With the COVID-19 vaccines finally 
getting into people’s arms, you might’ve heard that your second dose 
might feel a little rougher than the first. And it’s true. Participants in clinical 
trials, plus the recently vaccinated public, saw more frequent and more intense side 
effects on their second jab than their first. This is actually a sign that the 
vaccines are working properly. So while you should prepare to feel crummy 
for a couple days, it’s a good thing overall! And it might hint at the 
possibility of more good news: that people who’ve recovered from 
COVID-19 could only need one shot! The key thing to understand is 
that these reactions to vaccines, things like fever, chills, and other side-effects, 
aren’t really from the vaccine itself. They’re natural byproducts of your 
immune system learning to fight the germ the vaccine is teaching it to spot. And that response is stronger 
after the second shot because the first shot did 
what it was supposed to do! To understand what I mean, let’s have 
a quick refresher on how vaccines work. In general, vaccines teach your 
immune system to spot a pathogen by giving it some harmless version 
or just part of it to study. That way, if ever encounters a real 
deal, it’ll know how to fight it. We call this adaptive immunity — 
but it doesn’t happen immediately. It takes weeks to fully develop the strong, 
targeted response that vaccines are aiming for. So the first time a vaccine introduces 
your immune system to a new pathogen, any discomfort you feel is something 
else: your innate immunity kicking in. This is a generalized first line of defense that 
attacks anything the body perceives as a threat. And it can definitely have some 
uncomfortable side effects. For instance, within a few hours, 
you can have local reactions, which are things like pain and 
redness at the injection site or tenderness in the armpit of the 
arm that received the injection. You can also have systemic 
reactions that point to a more widespread activation of your immune system. These are symptoms like fatigue, 
headache, and all over muscle pain. But often, these side-effects are 
minor, or maybe not noticeable at all. What matters is what’s 
happening in the background. While your innate immunity is doing its thing, the immune cells that do the 
heavy lifting in adaptive immunity   are studying the foreign material and building up targeted weapons like antibodies. That way, by the time you get 
your second dose of the vaccine, your adaptive immunity has the 
tools it needs to fight the invader. And it does. That, too, can set off local 
and systemic reactions. So following your second shot, you get both 
innate and adaptive immunity acting at once! Which is why the side effects 
are often more severe. This strong, dual immune 
reaction also ensures your body takes the threat seriously and ramps 
up its defenses against it even more. So as much as we dislike 
the potential side-effects, the result is lasting protection from the virus. Now, some people get the 
short end of the stick here. Thanks to their unique 
experiences and genetic makeup, they really feel it when their immune 
system gets riled up, while others don’t. And we don’t totally know why. But, if you’re going to feel crummy, the odds 
are higher it’ll happen in dose number two. And that’s not news—that’s exactly what was 
seen in the clinical trials for these vaccines. For example, across all age 
groups in the Moderna trial, more participants reported some 
kind of local or systemic reaction on their second dose of the vaccine. And something similar was seen with the BioNTech 
vaccine, now being distributed by Pfizer. While pain at the injection site was 
more common after the first dose, the researchers noted more redness 
and swelling after the second dose, as well as more body-wide reactions 
like fatigue, fever, and muscle pain. Thankfully, in trials, these effects almost 
always went away after two or three days. There’s also nothing really special 
about the side effects occurring now. You’re hearing about them because lots of 
people are getting vaccinated all at once, and this is a really big deal, 
and everyone is talking about it. But these side effects are on 
par with what’s seen following other multi-dose vaccines given to adults. Take Shingrix, for example—a shingles vaccine 
you might get if you’re over 50 years old. Most people get a sore arm, while some 
feel fatigue, headaches, or muscle pain that lasts a couple of days. That said, some people who’ve already had 
COVID-19 are reporting something different: they seem to be having those stronger, 
“second-dose” side effects after dose one. That may be because the disease itself 
can act kind of like a first vaccine dose, in that it teaches the immune 
system to spot the virus. So, the first dose of the vaccine may be having 
similar effects to everyone else’s booster. What’s nifty about that is that it 
could mean they only need one dose. To be clear, the vast majority of the 
clinical trials for these vaccines have only used a two-dose vaccination strategy. So no one has tested this one-vaccine hypothesis! But two recent preprint articles 
concluded that we might be able to reallocate the limited doses of the 
mRNA vaccines being distributed by Pfizer and Moderna without compromising safety. One found that people who had 
recovered from COVID-19 developed at least ten times as many 
antibodies after one dose of an mRNA vaccine as previously 
healthy people who got two. And the other found that healthcare 
workers who had previously had COVID-19 had antibody levels on par with folks 
who got two doses of the mRNA vaccines but had never been infected. That might mean that previously 
infected individuals might only need one shot to protect them long term! And if that’s the case, we may be able to 
give that second vaccine dose to someone else, and hopefully get people vaccinated even faster. Now, each of these studies only 
had a few hundred participants, and neither has been peer-reviewed, so we 
can’t start making sweeping statements yet. And there are no changes in policy or anything. So, in the meantime, keep doing what your 
medical professionals tell you to do! Still, if you have had COVID-19, be warned 
your first vaccine shot could be the rough one. And for everyone else, it might be helpful 
to set your expectations ahead of time. Yes, there’s a good chance you’ll feel 
bad after your second dose in particular, and need to take a day or 
two to rest and recuperate. But it’ll be worth it, because these 
expected temporary side effects are way less intense and debilitating 
than getting a bad case of COVID-19, and we all just want to get through this 
pandemic so we can relax a little bit. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow News! We’re here every Friday with an

BUT JUST THREE MONTHS INTO THIS YEAR, THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN 41 CASES ACROSS 16 STATES. THE OUTBREAK OF THIS HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS VIRUS IS CONCERNING PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. WILLIAM BRANGHAM DELVES DEEPER INTO WHY IT'S OCCURRING. WILLIAM: GEOFF, THANKS TO WIDESPREAD VACCINATION, MEASLES WAS DECLARED ELIMINATED BACK IN 2000 IN THE U.S., SO SEEING THESE OUTBREAKS IN DIFFERENT STATES, WHILE THEY ARE STILL SMALL IN NUMBER OF CASES, HAS BEEN DISTURBING TO MANY. DR. PAUL OFFIT IS A PEDIATRICIAN AT THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF PHILADELPHIA WHO SPECIALIZES IN VIROLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGY. HIS NEW BOOK, ABOUT WHERE WE ARE IN OUR STRUGGLE AGAINST COVID, IS CALLED ""TELL ME WHEN IT'S OVER."" WELCOME BACK. I WANT TO PUT UP THIS GRAPH THAT SHOWS THE RISING NUMBER OF CASES OF MEASLES THE LAST FEW MONTHS. IT STARTS ON THE LEFT IN 23 AND GOES TO THE PRESENT. WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS DRIVING THIS UPTICK? DR. OFFIT: A CRITICAL PERCENTAGE OF PARENTS ARE CHOOSING NOT TO VEX AND I -- VACCINATE THEIR CHILDREN. THE RATE OF IMMUNIZATION AMONG KINDERGARTNERS IS STARTING TO DROP AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING THIS IS THE DISEASE YOU SEE BECAUSE THIS IS THE MOST CONTAGIOUS OF THE VACCINE FOR VEGETABLE DISEASES. WILLIAM: THE CDC JUST SAID THAT 92% OF AMERICAN KIDS WHO RECEIVED THE MEASLES, MUMPS AND RUBELLA VACCINE, THAT'S A FEW NOTCHES BELOW 95% THAT GETS US TO HERD IMMUNITY. THAT IS ENOUGH TO MAKE A DIFFERENT? DR. OFFIT: ABSOLUTELY. TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE, THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED THE CONTAGIOUSNESS INDEX, HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD YOU INFECT ASSUMING YOU ARE INFECTED AND EVERYBODY IS SUSCEPTIBLE FOR DISEASES LIKE COVID AND INFLUENZA -- SUSCEPTIBLE. PRODUCES LIKE COVID AND INFLUENZA IT'S THREE, MEASLES IS 18. WILLIAM: I DON'T WANT TO DATE YOU, BUT I KNOW YOU HAD MEASLES AS A CHILD BEFORE THE VACCINE. FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T REMEMBER, IN YOUR MIND IS HOW SERIOUS OF A VIRUS OR WHAT TALK ABOUT? DR. OFFIT: BEFORE THERE WAS A MEASLES VACCINE IN 1963, EVERY YEAR IN THE COUNTRY THERE WOULD BE THREE TO FOUR CASES OF MEASLES AND 3000 TO 4000 PEOPLE HOSPITALIZED AND 500 PEOPLE DIED, MOSTLY CHILDREN. THEY DIED FROM SEVERE DEHYDRATION, SEVERE PNEUMONIA, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE BRAIN. IT IS A TERRIBLE DISEASE AND I THINK WHAT WE ARE SUFFERING RIGHT NOW IS NOT JUST BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING MEASLES IN THE MANNER OF BEFORE, WE DON'T REMEMBER MEASLES. WE DON'T ROOM OR HOW SICK THE VIRUS CAN MAKE YOU. WILLIAM: ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE ALSO SEEN IS A SOMEWHAT CONFUSING AND CONFLICTING OFFICIAL GUIDANCE. IN FLOOR THERE WAS AN OUTBREAK AT A SCHOOL AND THE STATE SURGEON GENERAL SENT A LETTER TO FAMILIES THAT SEEMED TO CONTRADICT ALL OF THE OFFICIAL GUIDANCE. HE DIDN'T RECOMMEND PARENTS GET VACCINATED, HE DIDN'T RECOMMEND UNVACCINATED CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN EXPOSED QUARANTINED THEMSELVES. HOW ARE PEOPLE SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT TO DO IF THEY ARE GETTING THIS MIXED MESSAGING? DR. OFFIT: THE MESSAGING THEY WERE GETTING IN FLORIDA WAS ERRONEOUS. THE TWO WEAPONS, ONE IS ISOLATION OF PEOPLE INFECTED, THEY NEED TO ISOLATE FOR 21 DAYS, AND THE OTHER IS VACCINATION, AND GIVING A VERY SOFT SELL FOR THOSE, HE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DO A LOT OF HARM. WILLIAM: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF A LARGER DECLINE IN PUBLIC FAITH IN PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU DEAL WITH IN YOU KNEW -- YOUR NEW BOOK AND YOU TALK ABOUT MISSTEPS THAT WERE TAKEN DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC. HOW DO WE REPAIR THIS BREACH SO THAT WHEN THE NEXT OUTBREAK COMES, PEOPLE KNOW WHERE TO GET GOOD, SMART INFORMATION? DR. OFFIT: I THINK BY MANDATING COVID VACCINES, WE INADVERTENTLY LEANED INTO THIS LIBERTARIAN LEFT HOOK. NOW YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF PIECES OF LEGISLATION PUSHING BACK AGAINST VACCINE MANDATES AND MASKING MANDATES BECAUSE IT WAS SEEN AS AN ISSUE OF BODILY AUTONOMY. BUT IT'S NOT A PERSONAL CHOICE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MEASLES BECAUSE IT IS A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE. WHEN YOU MAKE A DECISION FOR YOURSELF, YOU ALSO MAKE A DECISION FOR OTHERS. THERE'S ABOUT 9 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WHO CANNOT BE VACCINATED BECAUSE THEY ARE GETTING CHEMOTHERAPY, OR THEY HAVE HAD A TRANSPLANT. THEY DEPEND ON THOSE AROUND THEM TO BE PROTECTED. DO WE HAVE ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR NEIGHBOR? I THINK WE DO. WILLIAM: THAT WAS ARGUMENT MADE DURING COVID AND WE ARE MAKING IT AGAIN DURING MEASLES AND WE ARE STILL SEEING THIS PUSHBACK BOTH LEGISLATIVELY AND PERSONALLY. THIS WILL BE AN AND NORMA'S CHALLENGE FOR THE COUNTRY MOVING FORWARD. -- AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE FOR THE COUNTRY MOVING FORWARD. DR. OFFIT: YES GOOD AND SOME TEXTURES THE WORD VACCINE HAS BECOME -- YES. IN SOME SECTORS OF THE WORD VACCINE HAS BECOME A DIRTY WORD. CHILDREN DON'T NEED TO SUFFER, IT'S THE MOST VULNERABLE WHO SUFFER. WILLIAM: THE NEW BOOK IS CALLED ""TELL ME WHEN IT IS OVER."" THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DR. OFFIT: THANK YOU."

UVA Critical Care and Infectious Disease physician, Taison Bell, was surprised to learn that even nurses who care for patients with COVID-19 are hesitant to seek answers to their questions about the vaccines. He describes the impromptu chalk talk session he had with nursing colleagues and their discussion about the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.

Transcript

TAISON BELL, MD: My name is Taison Bell. I'm a critical care and infectious disease physician at the University of Virginia. 

There was a day, I was in the ICU and I was talking to one of my nurses about the COVID-19 vaccine, and then I noticed that there were many other nurses who were kind of coming and crowding around. And I actually decided to just do a chalk talk and just talk about the COVID-19 vaccine for my staff. And I think what was kind of a barrier was this assumption that if you're a healthcare worker, if you are a nurse, then you shouldn't have questions about the vaccine, that you should just take it. And these were nurses who were working in the COVID ICU, and we were taking care of pregnant women who are coming in very sick, on mechanical ventilation, or the breathing machine. So they knew first and forehand how severe COVID-19 could be if they were to get infected, but yet and still, they had a lot of questions about the vaccine. 

So that was a moment where I understood if the nurses who were working here have questions, then almost everyone probably has these questions. And so we just decided to talk about it. You know, what do we know about the vaccine and its potential to affect your fertility? It's potential to affect the health of your baby if you're pregnant or if you're breastfeeding, and really to get into that. 

Now what's frustrating about the trials is that they did not include women who were pregnant during the time of enrollment. But what we know is that there were women who became pregnant during the course of the vaccine. We know that based on the ingredients in the vaccine, that they break down relatively quickly. There's nothing that's expected to cause any harm to the fetus or to the mom. The Pfizer and Moderna have both done trials in animal models to demonstrate that there's no danger to both the developing fetus and to the mother itself. So we have plenty of data points as to show us that this is a safe and effective vaccine. 

But we also talk about what is the risk of being a woman of childbearing age and getting COVID-19 because we've seen data showing that it's associated with higher rates of miscarriage, higher rates of preterm labor, and higher rates of women getting sick with COVID-19 and going to the hospital. And so when you balance those two effects, and when I've talked to women that were pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant, and really thinking through what are the risks versus the benefits, particularly if you are in the community and potentially getting exposed, it really weighs towards protecting yourself, protecting your health, protecting the health of the baby and getting the vaccine. 

So for my family members, I have family members who are thinking about getting pregnant, some who are pregnant, I've advised them all to get the vaccine because I want them to do, I want them to be safe. But I think for each person who has to put yourself in that decision journey, you want to make sure that you have accurate and good information. Knowing that over 10,000 women have been vaccinated now who have been pregnant and we've had no signal that there's anything concerning about that. But we do know that those women are now protected from having a bad outcome from COVID-19. That's the message that we have to get out there, that this is a safe thing to do for yourself and for your baby. Speak with your physician as always, but we're really leaning towards making sure that women are protected.",2021-03-25,73068,509,0,UCAUMuw4KF1mPdOlxaAbTDmw," My name is Taison Bell.

and forehand how severe COVID-19 could be if   they were to get infected, but yet and still, 
they had a lot of questions about the vaccine.   So that was a moment where I understood if the 
nurses who were working here have questions,   then almost everyone probably has these questions. 
And so we just decided to talk about it. You know,   what do we know about the vaccine and its 
potential to affect your fertility? It's potential   to affect the health of your baby if you're 
pregnant or if you're breastfeeding, and really   to get into that. Now what's frustrating about 
the trials is that they did not include women who   were pregnant during the time of enrollment. But 
what we know is that there were women who became   pregnant during the course of the vaccine. We 
know that based on the ingredients in the vaccine,   that they break down relatively quickly. 
There's nothing that's expected to cause any   harm to the fetus or to the mom. The Pfizer and 
Moderna have both done trials in animal models   to demonstrate that there's no danger to both 
the developing fetus and to the mother itself.   So we have plenty of data points as to show us 
that this is a safe and effective vaccine. But   we also talk about what is the risk of being a 
woman of childbearing age and getting COVID-19   because we've seen data showing that 
it's associated with higher rates of   miscarriage, higher rates of preterm labor, and 
higher rates of women getting sick with COVID-19   and going to the hospital. And so when you balance 
those two effects, and when I've talked to women   that were pregnant or thinking about getting 
pregnant, and really thinking through what are the   risks versus the benefits, particularly if you are 
in the community and potentially getting exposed,   it really weighs towards protecting yourself, 
protecting your health, protecting the health   of the baby and getting the vaccine. So for 
my family members, I have family members   who are thinking about getting pregnant, some 
who are pregnant, I've advised them all to get   the vaccine because I want them to do, I want 
them to be safe. But I think for each person who   has to put yourself in that decision journey, 
you want to make sure that you have accurate and   good information. Knowing that over 10,000 women 
have been vaccinated now who have been pregnant   and we've had no signal that there's anything 
concerning about that. But we do know that those   women are now protected from having a bad outcome 
from COVID-19. That's the message that we have to   get out there, that this is a safe thing to do 
for yourself and for your baby. Speak with your   physician as always, but we're really leaning 
towards making sure that women are protected."

Why You Can Be Forced To Get The Covid Vaccine",2021-04-01,1397808,12280,33476,UCvJJ_dzjViJCoLf5uKUTwoA, [Music] record numbers of americans are getting vaccinated against the coronavirus the us the most vaccinated large nation in the world dozens of countries are now working to vaccinate their populations in an effort to end the global pandemic president biden says that by the end of his first 100 days the united states is aiming to have administered 200 million doses and by may 2021 every american adult who wants one will be eligible to get in line for a shot that said 30 percent of u.s adults still don't want to get the covet vaccine but they may not have much of a choice the federal government can can require vaccination and things like that for coming in and out of the country both the state and city can have vaccine laws based on their legislative authority requiring a vaccine is a health and safety work rule an employers can do that bonnie jacobson knows us all too well the brooklyn resident was recently let go from her job after refusing to get inoculated i was sitting at home and i all of a sudden just opened an email sitting on my couch and it said basically while we respect your decision at this time your employment has been terminated so can you actually be forced to take the coveted vaccine against your will in the united states [Music] to be clear the white house's chief medical advisor has already said that he doesn't think the federal government will ever make the colvin vaccine mandatory however powers at the city and state level not to mention the legal rights granted to employers under u.s labor law may make it pretty difficult for some americans to evade inoculation against the coronavirus this isn't as unprecedented as you might think there are a lot of required inoculations which are easy to take for granted just take the chickenpox all 50 states and the district of columbia have laws requiring children entering child care or public schools to have some sort of provable protection against the disease whether that's a vaccine or evidence of immunity in fact schools from preschool through university typically require a battery of inoculations before you can step foot on campus when i was a health commissioner in washington d.c we had passed laws that required anyone who went to a school to be vaccinated against certain preventable diseases there are religious medical and philosophical exemptions that vary state by state but for around 170 years america's schools have done a pretty thorough job controlling vaccine preventable disease in the u.s the very first school vaccination mandate was in massachusetts back in the 1850s it was to protect against smallpox transmission by the start of the 20th century almost half of all states required students to be vaccinated before matriculating in the early 1970s schools with a measles vaccine mandate had incidence rates that were up to 51 percent lower than states without the laws and from there school vaccine mandates expanded over the next few decades [Music] the while schools had been requiring vaccines since the mid-19th century states didn't explicitly have that same power to roll out universal inoculation rules for all residents for another 50 years in 1905 the supreme court case of jacobson versus massachusetts set the legal precedent which now allows states to require vaccines the supreme court said yes you can limit individual rights to protect the public health and one way you can do it in that case is require vaccination we've seen states exercise this authority to varying degrees in the year since take for example the 2019 measles outbreak in new york new york imposed the mandate it imposed an mmr mandate but it limited it to the neighborhoods where the measles cases were high and it was accompanied by a one thousand dollar fine for those who did not have mmr legal experts say that narrowing the vaccine mandate to particular zip codes made it easier to justify in court rather than a statewide mandate but critics warn that these types of targeted requirements may lead to discriminatory practices in general these things are done at the state level but big cities for example also have vaccine laws when i was the city health commissioner in washington dc although that certainly functions as a state we also have vaccine laws in the in washington d.c so far no cities or states have made the covid vaccine mandatory though some places have started the conversation in november 2020 the new york state bar association recommended making the shot mandatory for all residents except those with a medical exemption and then of course there's the biggest rule maker of them all the federal government which in this case actually has pretty limited powers expressly spelled out in the constitution there isn't in the constitution the power to protect the public health well the federal government doesn't mandate vaccines um what they do is they make recommendations there are however software powers at the federal level that have been used before to incentivize mass inoculation the federal government has acted in the public health in the past using other parts such as its commerce parts so it could for example mandate vaccines before you travel in the interstate channels or before you engage in interstate commerce if you're a truck driver that drives across state maybe the federal government can mandate that you'll be vaccinated the power of the purse is another key tool in washington's arsenal it can pass a law saying states will give you three million dollars if you mandate the vaccine but that's up to a limit it can't do it to the degree that's cursive the federal government could also theoretically impose it as a condition of getting a passport so states and cities can require vaccines and the federal government has a lot of influence as well but the big question is whether the government will actually go through with rolling out a universal mandate the first challenge is we won't have enough vaccine doses for people who want them you can't require vaccines that's not available that people can't get another major factor to consider none of the three coveted vaccines in circulation here in the u.s are fully licensed by the fda instead they are all cleared under something known as an emergency use authorization or an eua until they are officially approved mandates seem to be off the table and then there's the even bigger question of enforcement mandates to some degree this depend on pretty widespread compliance you can't enforce a mandate if 40 of your population is fighting back if the problem is widespread mistrust mandate won't fix it you need communication you need education you need to earn the people's trust by by transparently showing them that the vaccine is safe and effective by explaining to them the process of approving it and so forth and keep in mind if any city or state did implement a mandate the kinds of repercussions we're talking about are relatively tame no one is floating the idea of jail time or coming to your house and holding you down while they administer a shot refusal would probably just mean a fine or maybe some sort of other tax or penalty experts say it may also mean you are barred from entry to concerts or can't book a seat on certain airlines in israel for example they use the green passport to allow access to businesses like hotels and restaurants to those who have been vaccinated against the virus or have already had kobit 19. implementation though might be tough here in the u.s so how will this actually play out experts tell me the most likely scenario is a repeat of what we've seen in the past once the copit vaccines are fully approved by the fda a vaccine may eventually be a requirement for school-age children in both public and private institutions starting at daycare and extending to universities let's say the city where you live decides against requiring the covet vaccine does that mean you're free from mandatory covet inoculation not necessarily your employer may not be willing to take no for an answer jacobson was a waitress in brooklyn and served patrons all through the pandemic she told nbc new york that while she isn't an anti-vaxxer she did have concerns about getting the shot because she's trying to get pregnant my general manager has told me multiple times it wasn't going to be mandatory when her former employer red hook tavern asked if she planned to get the vaccine now that it's available for restaurant workers she shared those worries over the last couple months i had just heard a few things about how it can affect fertility and pregnancy and i just wanted to have a better understanding of that and do a little more research i said that once i had more information i would definitely be willing to change my mind on getting the vaccine i expressed that you know i understand why they're important i think that the vaccine's a good thing i'm not against them within a few days she received an email from her employer saying that they respected her decision but they would be terminating her employment because of their new policy to maintain a safe working environment you know i've made it clear to my lawyer that i want to go in whatever direction i think will help the most amount of people have this same situation not happen to them cnbc reached out to red hook tavern for comment and we didn't hear back as of the date of publication jacob's inspiring appears to be totally legal here in the us i spoke with lawyers across the country and they all say that their clients are reaching out to them in record numbers to ask what they should do about the vaccine clients of mine that are most interested in making a mandatory vaccine a condition of employment are brick and mortar operations that have a lot of foot traffic from their customers they view it as a selling point look you can come to our business location and it's safe because all employees have been vaccinated that's particularly important for restaurants bars gyms and salons and so my clients in that segment of service industry are particularly looking hard at making it mandatory as a sales point to their customers while this is in part a pr tactic it's also totally within an employer's rights to roll out this kind of requirement legal experts say private businesses have pretty extensive rights requiring a vaccine is a health and safety work rule employers like some hospitals already require employees to get the annual influenza vaccine so there's precedent that under the law an employer can force an employee to get vaccinated and if they don't fire them there are a few ways that employees could apply to be exempt from a blanket requirement if a workforce is unionized the collective bargaining agreement may require negotiating with the union before mandating a vaccine anti-discrimination laws also provide some protections now other employers think that incentives are the better route to widespread inoculation in the workplace that could mean that if you get the vaccine you don't have to wear the same level of ppe in the office or have your temperature taken every day there's also talk of offering financial perks many of my clients who are struggling with this issue have said well while we think it's a good idea to make it mandatory we are going to make it voluntary but we're going to try to offer economic incentives bonuses as well as paying for the vaccination and offering optionally if the family wants to have the vaccination to pay for that too also because an eua is not a license there is a legal question as to whether you can mandate an emergency authorization well they're not a fully licensed product so the ability to to require your employees to be vaccinated will be highly controversial in fact i would argue that an employer cannot require you to be vaccinated with anything other than a fully licensed product mandatory vaccination protocols therefore may have to wait until the fda completes the entire approval process for the coveted vaccines ultimately a big part of whether the u.s achieves herd immunity against the coronavirus comes down to whether the population buys into the science pfizer and moderna built their coven vaccines with a new kind of technology that's never before been licensed in the u.s mrna vaccines are pretty revolutionary in the world of medicine but they also signify a natural progression of science so far it does seem that a concerted effort to educate the general public about covid vaccine safety and efficacy is working a 2021 pew research survey published in march showed that 69 of us adults have either already gotten the vaccine or they intend to dr fauci says that if 75 to 80 of americans are vaccinated then by the end of the summer of 2021 we may be able to achieve herd immunity if this polling bears out over the coming months we'd certainly be trending in that direction and mandates may not even be necessary

Travis Susan , several 1000 people here right now listening to performers and speakers, some of whom even say they were injured by the vaccines, But they're insistent that this isn't a vaccine protests but rather a mandate protest closed our school. And left the strip clubs open frustration on full display. These mandates are affecting people's lives and their livelihood and ability to live defeat the mandates rally in downtown Los Angeles. I'm not an anti-vaxxer. I actually got all my vaccines, thousands crowding into the point in front of L. A City hall with similar concerns for a certain percentage of the population. It is they are actually taking a real risk of severe injury or death. How is that? How is that acceptable to mandate that product, among them the remaining COVID restrictions and a slew of new vaccine laws some legislators are trying to push through in Sacramento. My body my choice. This crowd here just hopes to be heard. There's a brighter future ahead. Our Children will correct this mistake that is made to us. You think kids will fix this? You think they can see the logic in it? They're raised right? It's not right and we deserve to have medical freedom in America, especially Julie Roberts says she wants the mandates lifted for her fellow frontline workers. I'm fully, um, backs and unfortunately you know my co workers. A lot of the co workers are without jobs. And um, I think from here on out, every citizen here should have a choice. Their message. Let's keep our options open Pro choice . Our whole life is about choice . We live in a free country to choose our what we want to do and what we choose to do. And so a mandate is not choice. So that's just going to restrict us from having our kids go to school. It's going to restrict us from things that we I can do. And they restrict us now from one. They're going to restrict us later from others. Most states do offer vaccine exemptions. It's also worth mentioning that one of the more controversial vaccine bills has been shelved in the Sacramento State house. For now, meantime, back out here in downtown Los Angeles. There's a few more speakers at this event will go on for about three more hours, and we also are expecting to hear from a couple of the more notorious positions here that have been opposed to this vaccine mandates reporting live in downtown Los Angeles.

Information Regarding COVID-19 Vaccine - Everything you need to know about Covaxin and Covishield

Is it mandatory to take the vaccine?
Vaccination for COVID-19 is voluntary. However, it is advisable to receive the complete schedule of COVID-19 vaccine for protecting one-self against this disease and also to limit the spread of this disease to the close contacts including family members, friends, relatives and co-workers.

Will the vaccine be safe as it is being tested and introduced in a short span of time?
Vaccines will be introduced in the country only after the regulatory bodies clear it based on its safety and efficacy.

Is it necessary for a COVID recovered person to take the vaccine?
Yes, it is advisable to receive complete schedule of COVID vaccine irrespective of past history of infection with COVID-19. This will help in developing a strong immune response against the disease.

Out of the multiple vaccines available, how is one or more vaccine chosen for administration?
The safety and efficacy data from clinical trials of vaccine candidates are examined by Drug regulator of our country before granting the license for the same. Hence, all the COVID-19 vaccines that receive license will have comparable safety and efficacy. However, it must be ensured that the entire schedule of vaccination is completed by only one type of vaccine as different COVID-19 vaccines are not interchangeable.

Will the vaccine introduced in India be as effective as the ones introduced in other countries?
Yes. The COVID-19 vaccine introduced in India will be as effective as any vaccine developed by other countries. Various phases of vaccine trials are undertaken to ensure its safety and efficacy.

If one is taking medicines for illnesses like Cancer, Diabetes, Hypertension etc, can s/he take the COVID-19 vaccine?
Yes. Persons with one or more of these comorbid conditions are considered high risk category. They need to get COVID-19 vaccination.

What about the possible side-effects from COVID-19 vaccine?
COVID vaccine will be introduced only when the safety is proven. As is true for other vaccines, the common side effects in some individuals could be mild fever, pain, etc. at the site of injection. States have been asked to start making arrangements to deal with any Covid-19 vaccine-related side-effects as one of the measures towards safe vaccine delivery among masses.

IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, IT  DOESN'T SEEM THAT GRAY THERE'S PLENTY OF LEGAL  PRECEDENT FOR OTHER TYPES OF VACCINES AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF  THE ISSUES WHERE IT DOES GET STICKIER I'M THINKING MORE PUBLIC SCENARIOS AND MAYBE COLLEGES AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WITH MINORS WHERE IT MIGHT GET A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT IN TERMS OF LEGAL  EASE >> AS YOU'VE SAID, IN THE WORK PLACE, WE HAVE A HISTORY OF  VACCINE MANDATE. WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS REQUIRING VACCINES SOME RESTAURANTS REQUIRE H HEPATITIS A VACCINES THE EMPLOYER CAN PROVIDE THE REQUIREMENTS ONE PLACE WHERE THESE ARE STILL  UNDER EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION  WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION CAN  YOU MANDATE UNDER THE EMERGENCY  AUTHORIZE. THAT IS A LITTLE UNCLEAR BUT IT IS EASY TO SAY THAT UAI ACT ONLY LIMITS THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT AND DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING TO PRIVATE EMPLOYERS. THAT'S WHAT THE RECENT FEDERAL COURTROOMED. >> PROFESSOR, IT SEEMS YOU CAN MAKE THE CASE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IN THIS CASE MAY HAVE TO GIVE UP SOME OF HIS RIGHTS  FOR THE COLLECTIVE GOOD, FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF EVERYONE. I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT. AT THE SAME TIME, AND I THINK A  LOT OF FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE WELL INTENDED AND DO THEIR VERY BEST. IT DOES SEEM LIKE THE INDIVIDUAL IS CEEDING SOME OF HIS RIGHTS  AND TRUSTING THAT THEY WILL NOT  CUT CORNERS OR THEY COULD BE JUST WRONG ABOUT THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS. AND I'M THINKING PEOPLE UNDER 18 WHERE PARENTS FEEL THE RISK/REWARD THE RISK OF THE  DISEASE WHATEVER THEY PERCEIVE,  WHATEVER THESE ARE YOU ARE CEEDING AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF AUTHORITY TO THE GOVERNMENTS THAT GOING TO DO ITS BEST BUT THE SCIENCE MIGHT NOT ALWAYS BE WHAT YOU THINK AT THE  TIME >> YOU ARE RAISING THREE REALLY  IMPORTANT THINGS THE FIRST IS A QUESTION OF IF  THE EMPLOYER MANDATES THE  VACCINE, IS THIS A MANDATE OF  RIGHTS RIGHT NOW, WE ARE NOT TALKING  ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT YOU ARE TALKING PRIVATE  EMPLOYERS. YOU DON'T HAVE RIGHTS WITH THE EMPLOYER YOU MAY HAVE LEGAL RIGHTS  BECAUSE OF DISABILITY. WITH TWO PRIVATE ACTORS, THE EMPLOYER ALSO HAS RIGHTS PART OF THE BARGAIN OF THE WORK  PLACE IS, YOU AGREE TO OBEY THE  WORK PLACE RULES AND YOU GET THE SALARY THAT DOES MEAN YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE WORK PLACE RULES AREN'T  SOMETHING YOU LIKE, YOU ARE NOT  GIVING UP YOUR RIGHTS. YOU ARE MAKING A CHOICE. IS THIS WORK PLACE WORK IT THE OTHER POINT, IT IS AN  IMPORTANT ONE, DO WE HAVE A  PROPER REGULATION OF VACCINE AS YOU ARE SAYING, NO REGULATION IS GOING TO BE 100% PERFECT. WE HAVE THE MOST ROBUST  OVERSIGHT THAT WE HAVE ANYWHERE  ELSE WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE AGENCY LOOKING AT IT AND TWO EXPERT AGENCIES LOOKING AT IT AND FOUR  SYSTEMS TO COLLECT DATA ON THIS. AGAIN, THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE KNOW EVERYTHING NOW WE NEVER KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING BUT WE HAVE DATA FROM OVER 160 MILLION AMERICANS WHO GOT THE VACCINE. AS YOU ARE SAYING, WHEN  SOMETHING COMES UP, WE TEND TO IDENTIFY IT. EVEN IF IT IS RARE THE MYOCARDITIS CASES ARE RARE AND WE IDENTIFIED THEM THE J&J BLOOD CLOTS WERE RARE  AND WE IDENTIFIED THEM THE OTHER THING YOU MENTION IS MINORS THESE ISSUES DON'T GENERALLY APPLY TO MINORS.

The correspondents and contributors of 60 Minutes are Sharyn Alfonsi, Anderson Cooper, John Dickerson, Norah O’Donnell, Scott Pelley, Lesley Stahl, Bill Whitaker and L. Jon Wertheim.",2020-12-21,871628,8802,3141,UCsN32BtMd0IoByjJRNF12cw, more than 15 000 of our family members friends and neighbors fell to the coronavirus this past week so we could almost hear a national sigh of relief when the pharmaceutical company pfizer started delivering the first doses of its vaccine across the country pfizer a frequent advertiser on this broadcast and its german partner biontech were the only major vaccine developers to refuse federal money for research and development yet they were the first to get emergency use authorization from the fda friday the biotech company moderno was granted authorization ii under operation warp speed the federal government set a target of 20 million inoculations by the end of the year but that goal might be ambitious the vaccine's rollout has been rocky still for the first time since the pandemic hit there appears to be an end in sight thanks to a revolutionary advance in biotechnology the story will continue in a moment this is a worldwide pandemic the worst in a century a vaccine with this technology had never gone to market before that's a big bet you made that this would work yeah i didn't see it as much uh maybe as a bet because we are scientists that's what we do for living every day we discover new things everything is new catherine jansen is head of vaccine research and development for pfizer based in new york it's one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world the day the vaccine jansen who developed an interest in science as a child in germany grew up to develop vaccines for pneumonia and the hpv virus so when she first heard of the novel coronavirus her thoughts turned immediately to a vaccine when you were starting off on this mission new york was on fire with this virus yeah we were living in the hot zone in new york and we saw firsthand what was happening every day and build the most chilling thing for me was when we walked our dog and you see one refrigerated truck after the other appearing in the parking lots in front of the hospitals the refrigerator truck morgues morgs right that was absolutely uh fueling the desire to come up with with the vaccine no matter what it takes this was kind of personal i took this very personally i wanted to fight it beat it fight it down it was nothing else mattered across the atlantic in mainz germany doctors uger shaheen and oslem terechi were also focused on fighting the coronavirus founders of a cutting-edge biotechnology company called biontech they had been collaborating with pfizer on a flu vaccine when shaheen read an article on january 24th about a mysterious disease in wuhan china we knew that we are most likely running into a global pandemic and we knew that we don't have time to vase we started to think about how to implement a vaccine development program from scratch basically and so we had to pivot the entire company did you have any doubts about doing that i did not have doubts the only thing that concerned me is that we might be too late the married couple's company biontech is doing pioneering work on vaccines made with mrna molecules in our cells that pass genetic instructions from our dna to particles that make proteins the building blocks of life we felt responsibility to start to develop a vaccine because we knew the potency of our technology manipulating mrna molecules in the lab to fight disease has been considered promising technology for more than 30 years but it has never produced a proven vaccine with the coronavirus spreading through europe shaheen and terechi redoubled their efforts by february biontech had produced 20 different versions of mrna that triggered immune responses in mice and monkeys shaheen knew his small company would need help taking its research beyond the lab so he picked up the phone and called his friend at pfizer catherine jansen and she said ugo why are you calling me and i said catherine we started to make a vaccine against covet 19. i wanted to ask you if you think that faiza would join us and she said of course ugga actually i wanted to call you because we are also interested to develop a vaccine and it will become our most important project it became more like an obsession for pfizer ceo albert borla what i was thinking was if if not us then we are having a lot of experience with vaccines we have a lot of manufacturing capabilities with vaccines i i went and i said we need to do something to see if we can help in developing a medical solution since march he had been pressing pfizer scientists to develop a vaccine quickly he set an october deadline then of course i gave them also some tools in their hands i told them that they should think this is not business as usual there is no consideration of return on investments they should consider whether they have an open checkbook an open checkbook yes did you have any idea how much you'd be willing to spend it will cost us around two billion dollars and they knew that if we fail and we have to write it off it's going to be very painful but will not take pfizer down catherine jansen convinced her boss albert borla that mrna technology had the best chance of meeting his tight deadline from her work with biontech on a flu vaccine she was convinced mrna was on the cusp of a breakthrough so pfizer ceo borla signed off on the partnership and rolled the dice on the experimental technology there was a big chance that you might not succeed i believe in the power of science i believe in the power of the private sector and i believe in the miracles that science in the private sector can do for mankind unlike old school vaccines made with real virus often grown slowly in eggs these mrna molecules are produced rapidly in a lab programmed with a bit of the virus's genetic code we've all seen pictures of the coronavirus with its crown of spike proteins the mrna vaccine instructs your healthy cells to make replicas of the spikes they can't make you sick but they do teach the immune system what the virus looks like if the real virus shows up your immune system antibodies will attack by may pfizer was ready to start testing the vaccine at different sites in the u.s and i raised my hand and said yes they tapped dr mark mulligan why did you want to be in this study he's director of nyu langone vaccine center in manhattan i've worked on hiv aids vaccines zika ebola flu pandemic vaccines so this is really the moment for for us to jump in and say okay let's do it let's try to be part of the solution almost 44 000 people around the world volunteered for the phased double-blind trials testing the vaccines against a placebo most were between the ages of 16 and 85. researchers faced some skepticism when they reached out for african-american and hispanic volunteers were these communities well represented in the trials i feel that they were if you add the hispanic population and the african-american black population and the indigenous american population it came in at just under 40 percent we would like to have done a little better particularly with african americans we were just under 10 percent but i think overall that's good we've had several town halls with community partners in harlem it's important for us to be able to say yes we tested it in your community yes it was equally tolerated safe and equally protective participants on the schedule for today normally phased trials run sequentially to speed up the process the fda allowed these trials to run simultaneously dr mulligan told us he had never seen it done so quickly what do you say to people who worry that that was too fast that this is being rushed to market given the huge public health emergency that we're in internationally it was appropriate that all speed be used i've done vaccine trials for 30 years and i i promise no corners have been cut on the usual safety evaluations volunteers blood samples were brought to this pfizer facility in pearl river new york where these robots ran day and night helping to analyze the effectiveness of the vaccine they'll continue collecting and analyzing samples for two years these robots have taken care of probably about over 180 000 tests when the critical third phase results were revealed last month catherine jansen was taking a break in the country with her husband she got a call from pfizer ceo albert borla and i said what's up albert he said well calcium we spoke to the fda we can say the vaccine is over 90 percent efficacious and i said what that is fantastic so my husband and i he was standing right next to me we are jumping up and down to have a vaccine that was needed so much and to have it be 95 protective and to have it happen so quickly is unparalleled in my experience can we all just say goodbye to our masks i'm afraid not we aren't sure yet that the vaccines will prevent asymptomatic infection the vaccine isn't probably going to make a difference for this current surge that we're in we're still going to be going through this for a while absolutely this won't be like a light switch that's on off but rather like those dimmer switches that we slowly turn up to bring up the lights five percent 10 20 50 of people getting vaccinated over months but to end the pandemic in 2021 we need to get probably 75 percent of people vaccinated and then we can stop the pandemic there are still a number of unknowns about this vaccine how long does it last are there long-term safety issues why a few people have had severe allergic reactions it still needs to be tested on young children and pregnant women but the most pressing issue the bumpy roll out the development of the vaccine was rapid but so far the distribution has been anything but pfizer cut the projected number of doses for 2020 by more than 50 percent citing a shortage of raw materials states are complaining they're not getting clear guidance from the federal government's operation warp speed about what they're getting and when at the moment the light at the end of the tunnel is still faint this past week when the u.s death toll from the pandemic hit 300 thousand the bells at the national cathedral in washington dc rang 300 times once for every thousand americans killed by the virus this vaccine has been called a miracle how would you describe it we can call it a miracle but a miracle always has a sense of it just happened it didn't just happen right it was something that was deliberate it was with passion dumbest passion was urgency it was always having in your sight that devastating disease

#JenniferAniston #COVID19 #Friends #GMA",2021-08-05,82556,885,1360,UCH1oRy1dINbMVp3UFWrKP0w, now to jennifer aniston who is revealing she's cut people out of her life because they are unvaccinated haley hartung has a story and tips for managing those tough conversations about the covet vaccine we were on a break that's what friends star jennifer aniston is doing she's taking a break and cutting ties with people in her life who are unvaccinated there's still such a large group of people that are afraid of the of the vaccination or the anti-vaxxers are they really they just don't listening to actual facts it's a real shame and you know i've lost a few people recently in my daily my weekly routine who sort of are have refused and also did not disclose and it was unfortunate aniston who's been a vocal advocate for masks and social distancing telling instyle's podcast ladies first she feels a moral and professional obligation to disclose vaccination status it's tricky it's a tricky thing because everyone is really entitled to their own opinion but there's also a lot of opinions that don't feel to be actually based in anything except for fear propaganda or whatever so what's the best way to tackle the touchy topic if you know someone who hasn't gotten the shot you have to have that honest conversation so that they understand your feeling about being around people who have not been vaccinated and the risks that are associated with that have an informed conversation about the risks of not getting vaccinated this is a subject that is based upon the risk of life or death and like aniston you can rethink your relationships they are not in your daily routine or a very close family member that's actually living in the home with you then you might want to avoid asking that question and the drummer of offspring pete pirata he says he's been fired from his band as he's refusing to get vaccinated even though this is a doctor's order because of his medical history just another reminder to really listen when talking through this with people in your life robin all right kaylee thank you very much it's like the governor who you're just talking to have informed conversations well hey there gma fans robin roberts here thanks for checking out our youtube channel lots of great stuff here so go on click the subscribe button right over right over here to get more of awesome videos and content from gma every day anytime we thank you for watching and we'll see you in the morning on gma

BUT IT'S NOT OUGHT OF HERE ESPECIALLY FOR THE START OF YOUR WEEKEND COMING UP. >> TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. AND A WARNING, AS THE NUMBER OF CASES INCREASE. BE ESPECIALLY CAREFUL THIS MOTHER'S DAY WEEKEND. SO FAMILY GATHERINGS DON'T TURN INTO SUPER SPREADER EVENTS. IN NEW YORK CITY, THE SEVEN-DAY POSITIVE RATE IS NOW 6.5%, WITH MORE THAN 2800 NEW CASES. THIS COMES AS THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED STRICT NEW LIMITS ON THE JOHNSON & JOHNSON VACCINE BECAUSE OF RARE SIDE EFFECTS. NOW, J&J IS ONLY RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T OR WON'T GET ONE OF THE OTHER SHOTS. CBS 2'S JESSICA MOORE SPOKE WITH A WOMAN WHO SAID SHE WISHES SHE KNEW ABOUT THE SIDE EFFECTS SOONER. >> Reporter: FROM SMILING WITH HER FAMILY TO AN AGONIZING HOSPITAL STAY, 51-YEAR-OLD NICOLE ADIA SAYS THE JOHNSON & JOHNSON VACCINE SENT HER INTO A PHYSICAL TAILSPIN. >> I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR SIX WEEKS, OUT OF WORK FOR 10. AND MY LIFE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. AND THAT STINKS. >> TWO WEEKS AFTER GETTING THE J&J SHOT, SHE HAD A STROKE. HER HAIR FELL OUT IN CLUMPS.

HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL? >> LIKE A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT. I WISH I KNEW THAT. >> THE FDA IS NOW STRONGLY SUGGESTING PEOPLE GET PFIZER OR MODERNA. BEGGING WAS ENOUGH TESTING DONE? >> A BAD SIDE EFFECT IS FAR RARER THAN THE SIDE EFFECT FROM A DAILY ASPIRIN. IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASILY PICKED UP IN A CLINICAL TRIAL. >> THE DOCTOR SAYS PEOPLE WHO GOT IT A WHILE AGO SHOULDN'T WORRY. THE RISK OF BLOOD CLOT VANISHES WITHIN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS EVER INJECTION. >> I WANT MY HAIR BACK. IT'S COMING BACK. I WANT MY LIFE TO BE WHERE IT WAS.

193,qa9_EqFgD04,Why can&#39;t you mix and match Pfizer &amp; Moderna COVID vaccines?,"Nearly half of all Americans have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, a situation that does not allow mixing and matching.

A shot of Moderna needs to be followed by another shot of Moderna. A Pfizer shot means a second dose of Pfizer. Why?

“From a scientific point of view, they’re likely to be ok,” says Dr. M.G. Finn of Georgia Tech. “but we don’t know for sure.”

The vaccines are being administered according to FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization.

“What’s authorized is using Pfizer with Pfizer, Moderna plus Moderna,” says Dr. Mark Tompkins of the University of Georgia’s Center for Vaccines and Immunology. #COVID19 #Vaccine #Pfizer

194,wWCLBraM4gE,Covid vaccine: First &#39;milestone&#39; vaccine offers 90% protection - BBC News,"The first effective coronavirus vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19, a preliminary analysis shows.

The developers - Pfizer and BioNTech - described it as a ""great day for science and humanity"".

Their vaccine has been tested on 43,500 people in six countries and no safety concerns have been raised.

The companies plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of the month.

Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog",2020-11-09,177397,2181,2061,UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA, we're going to bring you right up to date with our breaking story this hour that announcement that trials carried out by the u.s pharmaceutical giant pfizer and the german manufacturer bioentech suggests they have created a coronavirus vaccine which is more than 90 percent effective our health correspondent anna collinson joins me now anna we've been hearing uh from the ceo of pfizer saying this is a great day for science and humanity and a significant step forward it feels that way is it yes definitely it definitely feels like a huge milestone you know with with these vaccines they're one of the greatest tools that we have to get out of the lockdown restrictions that some of us are living in the social distancing not being able to see our loved ones vaccines are seen as a tool to help us get there and this is a huge moment so this vaccine has jointly been developed by the u.s drugs corporation pfizer and the german company by in tech and it's the studies enrolled more than 43 000 people from across six different countries and they say the vaccine so far with as part of ongoing trials is ninety percent effective in preventing coveted infections and they say there's no serious safety concerns but they do have to keep collecting data these two companies are now calling for the ability to have emergency licensing so they can get this vaccine out to the general public as quickly as possible ideally before christmas and that is the big question what needs to happen now so that it can become available quickly well while this data is extremely encouraging and this does feel like an extremely positive moment the trials are still ongoing and what's most important with when you are thinking about a vaccine is safety there are also lots of caveats that come with this vaccine so for example it's reported the vaccine would need to be kept at -80 degrees so there are issues about how you would roll this out to places you know we're talking about in england nhs england are talking about preparing gps and pharmacists to administer a vaccine how are they going to be able to store that vaccine in a minute there's not enough cold storage well exactly exactly how are you going to get that out across across the globe to everywhere and have that stored appropriately you're also battling attitude certain people don't want to be vaccinated they don't trust it they don't believe in it um and also it's also important to point out that this vaccine probably almost certainly won't work for everyone multiple different types of vaccines will be needed like what we see with a seasonal flu for example and also it just won't work for some people so other measures will still be needed so when they say it's 90 effective have they broken that down does that mean across every age group because obviously there's more concern for the elderly and the vulnerable so what we have at the moment and as you know this story's only broken in the last hour or so as they are saying 90 across the board but they have covered a wide range of groups of people people as young as 16 uh people with hiv and hepatitis c so and they've covered people from across six different countries so they do have a real overview of what's going on but another question that often springs up and we're talking about vaccine how long would it be effective for do we know that well again this is this is it you know they're trialling a vaccine that up until now it's it's however old you know it could be working up to this point but we don't know so it's all about trying to um get as much data as possible and uh being as hopeful as possible getting it out as quickly as possible and testing and making it sure it's as safe as possible but yeah the hope is that it would uh deal with the symptoms the concern is it may not completely tackle the infection okay anna stay with us we're going to bring in dr sophie harman who is global health expert and professor of international politics at queen mary university london sophie your reaction to this news from pfizer well of course it's very exciting i think you know the world has been waiting for this vaccine so i think it's a testament to how pharmaceutical companies scientists governments have been working together however let's not get carried away as your correspondent was just saying there is an issue of safety scale we still don't know a lot about it but there is a pause for thought this does come with some cautions though this shouldn't be a reason for us to take you know the foot off the pedal with in terms of getting the basics right around tracking the virus test and trace and things like that we still need those vaccines are not a silver bullet and again we have this wider question of trust and access and i think these are the two issues that are going to really come into play globally what needs to be done about that issue sophie because actually in the past 10 minutes we've heard from the german health minister as well and he has said we're really going to need a high level of acceptance of a vaccine like this for it to be effective what can the health professionals governments do to you know ensure that that exists amongst the public well this is a huge challenge and i think the one thing is there is good will towards science and public health so trying to increase transparency around the trials i think having a lot of volunteers participate also helps so people can understand that this isn't science happening somewhere in a laboratory it involves us as citizens as well but of course it's about countering these false narratives around concerns around vaccines it's about not necessarily dismissing people but meeting where the kind of unease is and trying to explain it it's also about community mobilizing so we know that in previous anti-vaccination issues actually having building trust within community among community leaders is huge so it's not just about world leaders or public health officials you know making announcements around the safety of vaccines it's about looking at community healthcare workers and community politicians really driving home that message of trust you mentioned world leaders they do have a very big role to play though and the news today that joe biden is setting up a task force straight away that is his main priority as he is president-elect now of the us what do you make of that sophie and the importance of that moment of saying i'm making upper task force it's going to have scientists experts republicans democrats but you know we're going to tackle this and science is going to be you know the main argument that we use now yeah absolutely so joe biden was consistent on the campaign trail that he was going to follow the science and you know day one as president-elect or working day one he's come out with this task force now remember there were scientists and public health officials on trump's task force for covid19 but it was led by vice president mike pence not the case with biden he's got three scientific scientists and public health officials leading this and not only that he's saying right you tell me what to do i'm going to follow you now that's not the whole case because of course biden is going to have to do some really sophisticated political bipartisan support to back his plan we know that the us is divided we saw that with the election results and if he's going to get his strategy to have americans wear masks as a mandatory intervention he's going to need to get the republicans on side well it also just helped though sophie in terms of global cooperation around tackling the pandemic if we have joe biden in charge in the white house his attitude for instance towards the who and other organizations just may change the whole tone of discussion oh yes very much so so i think on saturday you could probably hear the sigh of relief coming from geneva from the world health organization that biden was going to become president-elect he has been very explicit in saying that he will recommit the us to the world health organization but he has also noted that the who is you know it's not without its flaws so he's going to be a supporter of it but this doesn't mean he's not going to be a critical supporter of the who but really when it comes to global health security we're seeing a reset to 2016. we're seeing global health security directorate reset up in the white house more money towards the centers for disease control and as you say a commitment to multilateral institutions like the who what's going to be important is to see what biden does around kovacs now kovacs is the organization around vaccines and ensuring equitable access to vaccines in lower middle income countries trump has shown very little interest in that so let's see what biden says dr sophie harmon great to have you with us thanks so much for joining us sophie they're talking about kovacs i wanted to ask you well as well anna about availability and distribution of the fisa vaccine it's not the only one in development there are other vaccines bring us upstairs in terms of where they are at and then what happens which countries get which vaccine how does that whole process work yeah sure so i mean there's hundreds of vaccines sort of in the pipeline and around 12 that are at this stage and fizer's the one that sort of beat those other to the post with this big announcement today another vaccine that has been in the running particularly the uk's had their eye on is a vaccine from the university of oxford and astrazeneca now they are all in a similar stage to uh pfizer and as i say as the the data from pfizer is looking particularly encouraging we still have to wait to the end of this trial to see how that turns out and it's the same with the other vaccines that are also in the pipeline uh so yeah so as i say this this vaccine has sort of taken the lead at this point but it could be that as time goes on other ones overtake that certain vaccines have um are more useful for treating a certain type of people a certain group of people and so it's really still so much to play for but a huge moment thank you so much for being with us anna and i will let you get back to looking into what's happening with the spies of vaccine we'll bring you more as soon as we get it but certainly a very big moment in terms of tackling the pandemic
195,Qmc0gXFspek,WATCH: How the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine works,"Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine was the third to be authorized in the United States, but it was the first to deliver full protection with one shot. Also different from the mRNA-based vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna, this one uses a ""viral vector"" -- in this case, an adenovirus -- to inoculate recipients against the coronavirus.

On Thursday, Johnson & Johnson announced that new data from small studies suggest that its vaccine protects recipients against the more transmissible delta variant of the virus, and that overall protection lasts for at least eight months.

Here’s a look at how it works.

than a particle of dust, has turned daily life on earth into something deeply unfamiliar. In the ten or so months since it first emerged,
the virus has settled at a steady clip of killing 5,000 people per day, or nearly a
million total, currently. It has played havoc with the world economy,
plunging the globe into the worst economic crisis since World War Two. It has interrupted an era of mounting globalization,
and pushed us into a more insular, nationalistic state. The effects of this virus are truly all encompassing
and consistently dreadful, but time has bestowed upon us a reward for our patience. We are potentially nearing the beginning of
the end, meaning we could now be at the end of the middle. That end of this virus will take far longer
than the beginning—we’re likely far from halfway through the pandemic in terms of time—but
the slow decline in dreadfulness is potentially on the horizon. That’s because a vaccine is coming. There was previously a period of doubt on
whether an effective vaccine could be developed, it’s never a sure shot, but all indications
currently suggest, given the unprecedented extent of scientific effort, that it is indeed
coming. The only and paramount question is when. Right now, in September, 2020, all attention
is focused on the late-October, early-November timeframe. That’s the earliest possible moment when
any of the frontrunner vaccines, from major manufacturers including AstraZeneca, Pfizer,
and Moderna, could enter regulatory review. If all the data confidently point to the vaccine
exhibiting an acceptable level of safety and effectiveness, it is possible that one of
these will then be granted emergency use authorization by the American FDA, or its equivalent by
other major national regulators. It’s worth noting that this is far from
a sure-shot, but experts do say that having a vaccine in 2020 is a less-than-long-shot
possibility. However, it is almost certain that you will
not be injected by a COVID-19 vaccine in the year 2020. It is possible, but for the average person,
when you actually get a dose of a COVID vaccine has much less to do with when it’s approved,
and more with how fast it is manufactured and distributed. The full effects of the pandemic—health,
social, and economic—will not end until a critical mass of people are vaccinated. That means that when we get back to normal
life has much more to do with when the last person is vaccinated, rather than the first. This is why some have said that the fast distribution
of a vaccine will be an even greater challenge than the development itself. This process, this challenge of getting the
majority of the world's population vaccinated, can quite legitimately be described as the
most daunting and consequential single logistical challenge ever. The stakes have never been higher, but the
challenge has also never been greater. Let's look at why. First and foremost, it's a scale problem. Shipping and administering one vaccine to
one person is not difficult, but shipping and administering five billion vaccines to
five billion people is. That’s because there just isn't enough room
in our world's logistics network, as it is now, to do that. Making it even tougher, there’s more chance
than not, based on the current leading candidates, that the first major vaccine to be approved
will require two doses administered 21 or 28 days apart. That doubles the challenge. Distributing ten or more billion doses of
a vaccine would be difficult enough in normal times, but these are far from normal times. With international travel all but nonexistent—currently
sitting at more than 90% down—passenger airlines have dramatically cut back their
international route networks. Now, this is an issue because traditionally,
some 50% of pharmaceuticals are shipped in the belly-hold of passenger aircraft, rather
than on dedicated freighters, as this can help get them closer to their final destination
faster. With limited passenger service, overall cargo
capacity is down about 30%, while cargo demand is only about 15% down, meaning there is already
a supply crunch. This has led to existing dedicated freighter
aircraft being used more, additional dedicated freighters coming into service, but still,
due to constrained supply, a dramatic increase in shipping costs. Even already, before the COVID vaccine comes
into the global logistics network, pharmaceutical manufacturers have had to come up with new
techniques to ship their goods including, for example, flying their product to where
shipping rates are cheaper and trucking them to their final destination or charteri ng
private planes. Of course, the world already experienced a
massive logistics challenge this year with the distribution of personal protective equipment,
and shippers were able to scale up for that reasonably successfully, but there’s one
simple reason why it won’t be so easy this time around: the cold chain. Vaccines are temperature-sensitive. Most all of them have to be stored in a highly
precise, climate controlled environment in order to stay safe and effective. So, the cold chain is the supply chain suited
to shipping goods that need to be kept cold or frozen, such as meat, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Of course, the difficulty with the cold chain
is that everything used has to be specialized—the origin warehouse, the truck, the plane, the
en-route warehouse, and the final destination each need to have the equipment to keep the
goods at the specified temperature or the goods have to be shipped in packaging that
keeps them at the specified temperature. Both options are complicated and complication
compounded by other complication is what makes a true logistical challenge. It doesn’t end there, though. One of the leading vaccine candidates, Pfizer’s
BNT162b2, must be stored and transported at around -90 °F, or -68 °C. That is far, far
colder than the requirements of most vaccines, which can ship either at refrigerated temperatures
or a wider range of freezing temperatures. A thermal requirement such as this is a whole
different ball-game, and it means that they'll be able to use only a subset of cold chain
infrastructure, which is already a subset of the overall logistics infrastructure. Beyond the issue of actually getting such
a vaccine to a distribution site, most hospitals don't even have facilities to keep a vaccine
at such a temperature, let alone clinics or pharmacies, meaning that even finding places
that can receive this vaccine is a challenge. Part of the reason why this obstacle has come
up is that traditionally, vaccines are thoroughly tested to determine what sort of storage and
shipping conditions they can endure while still staying safe and effective, but with
the breakneck pace of development for these COVID-19 vaccines, there likely will not have
been enough time to conduct these tests before distribution, meaning they'll have to keep
the standards at what's already proven. So, to reiterate, already, a likely vaccine
will only be able to be shipped through a subset of a subset of a subset of an already
strained logistics network, to a subset of sites, and it'll need to happen many billions
of times, but even the solutions to these challenges present additional challenges. Pfizer, for example, knowing that the unique
distribution requirements of their vaccine could limit its commercial success, has developed
a partial solution. It’s essentially a highly specialized stand-alone
box that can, with the use of dry ice, keep the vaccine at the required temperature for
up to ten days. This means that, hypothetically, the vaccine
could be shipped through a more traditional logistics network, however, this box has highly
specific requirements. For one, upon arrival, it can only be opened
twice per day, not more than one-minute at a time, in order to keep the vaccines at the
required temperature. That means that a distribution site would
need to accurately predict how many doses they would need in a given day before that
day—if they take out too little, they’d be slowing the process by not vaccinating
everyone they can, but if they take out too much, they’d have potentially life-saving
vaccines go to waste at the end of the day. Also, this box can only carry vaccines in
multiples of a thousand, and keep in mind that it only keeps cold for ten days. So, how, for example, do you go about getting
the vaccine to a clinic that can only vaccinate fifty people in a day—like a rural clinic
in a small town. Even if shipping was instantaneous, they could
only vaccinate five-hundred people in ten-days, meaning half their vaccines would go bad. Pfizer is apparently developing a smaller
temperature-controlled box to solve this problem, but that means adding a whole other type of
distribution, which increases complexity, which slows the process down. In its scenario planning, the American CDC
mapped out a distribution process for if both Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines are approved
and, if this happened, the Pfizer vaccine would be directed to only large distribution
sites that would either have the facilities for ultra-cold storage, or the capacity to
vaccine enough people that the short shelf-life of these vaccines wouldn't be an issue. Then, the Moderna vaccine, which only requires
traditional freezer temperatures, would be directed to smaller sites with less advanced
facilities. This would certainly create a scenario in
the US, and likely elsewhere, where the Pfizer vaccine would be primarily distributed to
people in cities, while the Moderna vaccine would be the vaccine of choice for rural areas. Another challenge that needs to be confronted
is the order of operations for distribution. The Coronavirus affects different people in
different ways. This means that if we want a vaccine to save
the the most number of lives possible, the first person in line should be that who is
most susceptible to COVID-19, and the last person in line should be that who is least
susceptible. One set of research modeled two scenarios—the
first where, of the first 3 billion doses available, 50 high-income countries buy up
2 billion of them. The second was where the first 3 billion doses
were distributed to countries proportionally based on their population, regardless of wealth. In this model, twice as many people died overall
with the first scenario—the wealthy countries first scenario—than the equitable, proportional
approach. However, for vaccination purposes, it is the
least wealthy countries, arguably those that need the vaccine most, that are toughest to
distribute to. Poor countries tend to have limited cold chain
infrastructure, let alone normal logistics infrastructure, and fragmented, poorly-funded
healthcare systems. Distributing and administering a complex vaccine
like Pfizer’s will already be tough enough in the wealthy countries like the United States,
but just imagine how difficult it will be to get a vaccine from distributor to someone’s
arm in rural Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, in ten days, while keeping it
at -90 °F. How soon a COVID vaccine is administered will
quite directly correlate to how many lives are saved. Every day of delay will, with certainty, lead
to more death and despair. The manufacturers are working as fast as they
can, they are already producing millions of doses of their vaccines before they’re approved
so they can be distributed as fast as possible, and regulatory agencies have been preparing
for months for an unprecedentedly fast review process, so it is now truly down to every
member of the global logistics network to save lives. Of course, many of those that will be involved,
especially once we get to wide-scale distribution, will be companies, not governments or nonprofits,
and for them, this presents a massive business opportunity—in addition to the positive
public relations potential. UPS, for example, has built two freezer farms
in Louisville, Kentucky, and Venlo, Netherlands, near their hubs, which can each hold 48,000
doses and can go down to the temperatures required for the Pfizer vaccine. DHL and FedEx too are reportedly massively
upscaling their cold-chain infrastructure to be able to handle some of the surge in
demand, while other lesser known logistics companies are too. Ultimately, though, its tough to find someone
in-the-know who doesn’t admit that shipping will be a bottleneck. We already know it’s not going to go perfectly,
so right now, it’s about doing as much work as possible to make sure the process goes
as well as it can be. This will come down to making sure that as
much planning work as possible is done now, before the vaccine is approved, so that distribution
can happen as fast as possible when that does happen. Now is the time to figure out how and where
the vaccine will be distributed. If you are a healthy, relatively young person
thinking selfishly, you should care tremendously about the distribution process, because you
are at the back of the line. When you get your shot, when you get to start
letting your guard down, has everything to do with how fast everyone in front of you
gets theirs, and how fast they get theirs will also impact how many of them will die. We know this process will not be perfect,
and it wouldn't be reasonable to ask for perfect given the complexity of the challenge, but
if we truly put every effort into planning and preparing for this now, and create a system
that orders people by need, rather than wealth, we can at least know, at the end of this,
that no lives could have been saved if only the vaccine got to them faster. For our collective consciousness, looking
back far in the future, this moment will be defined not by when we get to go back to concerts
or parties or the gym, but rather by how many lives we saved when confronting what is hopefully
the greatest global challenge of this generation. As you’ve heard before, the point of Nebula—the
streaming site that I and other independent creators founded—is to make a greater variety
of content types possible. For example, I know many of you were fans
of my and Brian from Real Engineering’s old podcast, Showmakers, where we interviewed
different educational creators about their background, story, and process, but the financials
of that show just didn’t work so we stopped it. Nebula, however, has made it possible for
us to re-launch it, so we’ve just done exactly that—Showmakers is now a Nebula original
podcast. This is in addition to the two Wendover originals
we’ve done already, the Half as Interesting original, and another Wendover original that
is coming out next month. Of course, the best way to get access to Nebula
is CuriosityStream’s bundle deal, on sale now for $15 a year. With that, you also get access to CuriosityStream
where you could watch, for example, the piece they made about how the development of the
COVID vaccine works, filmed with the actual scientists involved. That’s, of course, in addition to the thousands
of other educational shows and documentaries they have, and together with Nebula, this
represents, truly, the best deal in streaming. Sign up today for the bundle deal for just

198,w_5zQzIb5Uc,How does Moderna&#39;s Coronavirus vaccine work?,"Early data from US biotech Moderna has revealed that its Covid-19 vaccine candidate is 94.5 per cent effective, raising hopes that a range of immunisations will be available to help end the pandemic. 

The interim analysis of the vaccine, currently known as mRNA-1273, comes after 95 trial participants contracted Covid-19, including just five who were given the coronavirus jab.

While the data was published via a press release, it includes significant details that remain unclear around the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - which uses the same mRNA technology to target the coronavirus spike protein and an immune response.

199,4qFQ1UPFicw,India celebrates one billion COVID-19 vaccine doses | DW News,"India has administered 1 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine so far, officials said on Thursday. The new figure marks a milestone for the South Asian country, where the delta variant fueled a devastating wave of the virus earlier this year.

Around 75% of India's total eligible population have received at least one dose, while nearly 30% have received both shots.

The country, which has a population of 1.4 billion people, is the second to distribute more than a billion doses, after China did so in June.

#COVID19 #India #vaccine",2021-10-21,128969,4074,1412,UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg, and we're going to stay in india that country has administered its billionth covet 19 vaccine dose six months after surge in cases brought its health system close to collapse about three-quarters of adults have now had one shot and around 30 percent are fully vaccinated however hundreds of millions of indians under 18 who make up some 40 percent of the population have not yet been vaccinated and i'd like to now welcome gautama menon a professor of biophysics at india's ashoka university professor a very warm welcome to dw news 1 billion shots i mean that is truly a milestone but when less than one-third of india's population is fully vaccinated is this really a cause for celebration well it's a milestone and certainly a few months ago it didn't seem as though we might reach there when vaccination rates were flagging so i think it's important to note that at least 75 percent of the adult population of india has some level of protection either been through being fully vaccinated or partially vaccinated and that's at least a step forward and it should help to slow any potential third wave that might be waiting for us we have to worry now about the 25 which have not been vaccinated yet and how to ensure that they're vaccinated fast over the coming weeks professor can you tell us and fill us in about how the pandemic is evolving in india right now numbers are very small they're certainly very small across much of the north of india there's still there there is one southern state in particular the state of kerala where numbers have been reducing after staying fairly steady at about 20 000 to 30 000 cases for quite quite a while now it's dipped well below that so it looks as though the pandemic is on its way out at least for the time being in india because the case load has significantly reduced and the test positivity is really low at the moment and what are the the biggest challenges right now that india faces when it comes to tackling the pandemic we'll have to see in a few weeks because right now this is festival season in india that the big festival is unfolding at the moment whether people will let down their caution at this period and that whether that might lead to a rise in cases and potentially initiate another wave that could be large is something that still we don't know so we will know this in the weeks to come whether extended mixing that we will see in this period might have longer term consequences and is there also a difference between how the pandemic has evolved in in rural areas and in urban areas in in the second wave which was really the devastating wave that crossed much of india the distinction between urban and rural was pretty much wiped out and rural india saw a lot of debts unrecorded deaths at that point so i think now there isn't too much of a difference between urban and rural parts of india as far as infections prior infections go and that certainly is a different from what happened in the first week which really hit the city is much more than it did the villages and professors and final thoughts from you what's your assessment of the indian government's handling of the pandemic so far the handling has been good in recent weeks and months i'd say because we have now ramped up vaccination rates to above somewhere between 10 to 20 million per day which is pretty good right now it's a little low but that's the number that we've sustained from about two weeks ago and before that the handling of the second wave of the pandemic left much to be desired that was a place where really cases exploded across the country and the health system pretty much gave up at that point so i think i hope lessons from that have now been learned lessons that are really about strengthening the public health system overall in india and i hope that that's one lesson that we take forward into the future professor gautam menon of india's ashoka university sir thank you for your time thank you

london um well it sounds like we're the first to approve it jonathan it does this has just come through in the last few minutes uh susana hasn't it and it's a fantastic news for us the uk regulator has now approved use for the pfizer vaccination as we speak we understand within eight hours or so the vaccination some 40 million doses of it are now going to be transported to various sites around the country including here the nhs nightingale hospital it may not have been used to treat many patients but from now on we understand it could be used to vaccinate thousands of people so they have granted uh the use for the fisa vaccination they have said that it has after months of trials and tests that it has met strict safety standards that's important and there's a lot of sort of concern out there and it will be transported to around 10 sites around the country we understand from sports stadia to sports centers to race courses in leicestershire for example the military are also working behind the scenes to create these vaccination hubs and that means from as early as next week next week we could see nhs staff being vaccinated care home workers and the residents also receiving this vaccination along with the over 80s so breaking news this morning and i think it is the news that after months of lockdowns and worry and concern that we've all been waiting for uh let's just go to dr hillary for a reaction hillary this is huge it is absolutely vast it's the first approval to we've seen in europe so this could be rolled out as early as next week with the military and the nhs and voluntary vaccinators starting to give this jab this job is effective it's safe it's been well trialled and to get approval for emergency use this quickly has been a magnificent effort and hillary to those who say well how can it be safe given how fast it's come to the to the marketplace what do you say sorry say that again to those who doubt whether it could be safe what do you say because it's so it's so swift well it's swift because they they have done things at the same time usually what they do is phase one two three trials and then they then they they look at the data then the approval takes a while uh and then production but they've done it all at the same time which is good they haven't cut corners in doing this they've just moved swiftly and when you think of some of the incompetence that we've seen this year it is really good to see that some things can be done if you give it to the the researchers and scientists who know what they're doing and who i trust at least then i think uh we should give them a huge pat on the back i'll take you we're the first in europe i'll take it as soon as you know what i would take this live on air suzanna and i talked about this but earlier we would take it live on air on monday morning if we're allowed to honestly yep i would just encourage other people to do it this this is the vaccine that has to be stored at minus 17 minus 80 degrees so there are logistical problems which is why you need the military that's why you need the big sites to get a lot of people to those sites all in one go because you can't waste any of this vaccine once you've opened the canister at that temperature you have to use it so there will be logistical problems but we can overcome those if we can do this we can overcome those dr hillary this is the vaccine which is 95 effective isn't it i mean i mean and that's more effective than many other common vaccines for other conditions absolutely it's it's more effective than the flu vaccination it's more effective than than many other vaccinations that we use in the routine schedule so it's really good news what we don't know is how long the immunity is conferred for so we need to look at that and it doesn't mean there's there can now be a free-for-all now that we've got a vaccine we need to carefully vaccinate as many people as possible going forward high priority groups first and then everybody else and then see how long it lasts because you know we could we're still going to be living with covert 19 for some time no room for complacency and dr hillary does this vaccine i don't know if you if you know if you have this detail to hand but does this vaccine stop you getting covered does it stop you transmitting covid or does it stop you getting it badly if you get it what we do know is it stops you getting it severely if you should get it what we don't know is whether it stops you getting it at all the likelihood is that it does because it will hopefully confer immunity through both killer t cells which is cellular immunity and antibodies which circulate in the blood so if it's doing both of those things it should stop you even if you're exposed to it developing the disease passing it on to others but it also should stop you from getting severe well a huge moment also healthy care workers around the world actually who've been seeing their colleagues lose their lives in the battle for this they will be some of the first people to have the vaccine you

But, while it may be unpleasant, these intense side-effects are actually a sign that the vaccines are working. And there may be even more good news when it comes to people who've already had COVID-19 getting the vaccine.

vaccinations or the pandemic in general, they’ll be in the playlist 
linked in the description. [♪♪♪] With the COVID-19 vaccines finally 
getting into people’s arms, you might’ve heard that your second dose 
might feel a little rougher than the first. And it’s true. Participants in clinical 
trials, plus the recently vaccinated public, saw more frequent and more intense side 
effects on their second jab than their first. This is actually a sign that the 
vaccines are working properly. So while you should prepare to feel crummy 
for a couple days, it’s a good thing overall! And it might hint at the 
possibility of more good news: that people who’ve recovered from 
COVID-19 could only need one shot! The key thing to understand is 
that these reactions to vaccines, things like fever, chills, and other side-effects, 
aren’t really from the vaccine itself. They’re natural byproducts of your 
immune system learning to fight the germ the vaccine is teaching it to spot. And that response is stronger 
after the second shot because the first shot did 
what it was supposed to do! To understand what I mean, let’s have 
a quick refresher on how vaccines work. In general, vaccines teach your 
immune system to spot a pathogen by giving it some harmless version 
or just part of it to study. That way, if ever encounters a real 
deal, it’ll know how to fight it. We call this adaptive immunity — 
but it doesn’t happen immediately. It takes weeks to fully develop the strong, 
targeted response that vaccines are aiming for. So the first time a vaccine introduces 
your immune system to a new pathogen, any discomfort you feel is something 
else: your innate immunity kicking in. This is a generalized first line of defense that 
attacks anything the body perceives as a threat. And it can definitely have some 
uncomfortable side effects. For instance, within a few hours, 
you can have local reactions, which are things like pain and 
redness at the injection site or tenderness in the armpit of the 
arm that received the injection. You can also have systemic 
reactions that point to a more widespread activation of your immune system. These are symptoms like fatigue, 
headache, and all over muscle pain. But often, these side-effects are 
minor, or maybe not noticeable at all. What matters is what’s 
happening in the background. While your innate immunity is doing its thing, the immune cells that do the 
heavy lifting in adaptive immunity   are studying the foreign material and building up targeted weapons like antibodies. That way, by the time you get 
your second dose of the vaccine, your adaptive immunity has the 
tools it needs to fight the invader. And it does. That, too, can set off local 
and systemic reactions. So following your second shot, you get both 
innate and adaptive immunity acting at once! Which is why the side effects 
are often more severe. This strong, dual immune 
reaction also ensures your body takes the threat seriously and ramps 
up its defenses against it even more. So as much as we dislike 
the potential side-effects, the result is lasting protection from the virus. Now, some people get the 
short end of the stick here. Thanks to their unique 
experiences and genetic makeup, they really feel it when their immune 
system gets riled up, while others don’t. And we don’t totally know why. But, if you’re going to feel crummy, the odds 
are higher it’ll happen in dose number two. And that’s not news—that’s exactly what was 
seen in the clinical trials for these vaccines. For example, across all age 
groups in the Moderna trial, more participants reported some 
kind of local or systemic reaction on their second dose of the vaccine. And something similar was seen with the BioNTech 
vaccine, now being distributed by Pfizer. While pain at the injection site was 
more common after the first dose, the researchers noted more redness 
and swelling after the second dose, as well as more body-wide reactions 
like fatigue, fever, and muscle pain. Thankfully, in trials, these effects almost 
always went away after two or three days. There’s also nothing really special 
about the side effects occurring now. You’re hearing about them because lots of 
people are getting vaccinated all at once, and this is a really big deal, 
and everyone is talking about it. But these side effects are on 
par with what’s seen following other multi-dose vaccines given to adults. Take Shingrix, for example—a shingles vaccine 
you might get if you’re over 50 years old. Most people get a sore arm, while some 
feel fatigue, headaches, or muscle pain that lasts a couple of days. That said, some people who’ve already had 
COVID-19 are reporting something different: they seem to be having those stronger, 
“second-dose” side effects after dose one. That may be because the disease itself 
can act kind of like a first vaccine dose, in that it teaches the immune 
system to spot the virus. So, the first dose of the vaccine may be having 
similar effects to everyone else’s booster. What’s nifty about that is that it 
could mean they only need one dose. To be clear, the vast majority of the 
clinical trials for these vaccines have only used a two-dose vaccination strategy. So no one has tested this one-vaccine hypothesis! But two recent preprint articles 
concluded that we might be able to reallocate the limited doses of the 
mRNA vaccines being distributed by Pfizer and Moderna without compromising safety. One found that people who had 
recovered from COVID-19 developed at least ten times as many 
antibodies after one dose of an mRNA vaccine as previously 
healthy people who got two. And the other found that healthcare 
workers who had previously had COVID-19 had antibody levels on par with folks 
who got two doses of the mRNA vaccines but had never been infected. That might mean that previously 
infected individuals might only need one shot to protect them long term! And if that’s the case, we may be able to 
give that second vaccine dose to someone else, and hopefully get people vaccinated even faster. Now, each of these studies only 
had a few hundred participants, and neither has been peer-reviewed, so we 
can’t start making sweeping statements yet. And there are no changes in policy or anything. So, in the meantime, keep doing what your 
medical professionals tell you to do! Still, if you have had COVID-19, be warned 
your first vaccine shot could be the rough one. And for everyone else, it might be helpful 
to set your expectations ahead of time. Yes, there’s a good chance you’ll feel 
bad after your second dose in particular, and need to take a day or 
two to rest and recuperate. But it’ll be worth it, because these 
expected temporary side effects are way less intense and debilitating 
than getting a bad case of COVID-19, and we all just want to get through this 
pandemic so we can relax a little bit. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow News! We’re here every Friday with an

BUT JUST THREE MONTHS INTO THIS YEAR, THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN 41 CASES ACROSS 16 STATES. THE OUTBREAK OF THIS HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS VIRUS IS CONCERNING PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. WILLIAM BRANGHAM DELVES DEEPER INTO WHY IT'S OCCURRING. WILLIAM: GEOFF, THANKS TO WIDESPREAD VACCINATION, MEASLES WAS DECLARED ELIMINATED BACK IN 2000 IN THE U.S., SO SEEING THESE OUTBREAKS IN DIFFERENT STATES, WHILE THEY ARE STILL SMALL IN NUMBER OF CASES, HAS BEEN DISTURBING TO MANY. DR. PAUL OFFIT IS A PEDIATRICIAN AT THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF PHILADELPHIA WHO SPECIALIZES IN VIROLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGY. HIS NEW BOOK, ABOUT WHERE WE ARE IN OUR STRUGGLE AGAINST COVID, IS CALLED ""TELL ME WHEN IT'S OVER."" WELCOME BACK. I WANT TO PUT UP THIS GRAPH THAT SHOWS THE RISING NUMBER OF CASES OF MEASLES THE LAST FEW MONTHS. IT STARTS ON THE LEFT IN 23 AND GOES TO THE PRESENT. WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS DRIVING THIS UPTICK? DR. OFFIT: A CRITICAL PERCENTAGE OF PARENTS ARE CHOOSING NOT TO VEX AND I -- VACCINATE THEIR CHILDREN. THE RATE OF IMMUNIZATION AMONG KINDERGARTNERS IS STARTING TO DROP AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING THIS IS THE DISEASE YOU SEE BECAUSE THIS IS THE MOST CONTAGIOUS OF THE VACCINE FOR VEGETABLE DISEASES. WILLIAM: THE CDC JUST SAID THAT 92% OF AMERICAN KIDS WHO RECEIVED THE MEASLES, MUMPS AND RUBELLA VACCINE, THAT'S A FEW NOTCHES BELOW 95% THAT GETS US TO HERD IMMUNITY. THAT IS ENOUGH TO MAKE A DIFFERENT? DR. OFFIT: ABSOLUTELY. TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE, THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED THE CONTAGIOUSNESS INDEX, HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD YOU INFECT ASSUMING YOU ARE INFECTED AND EVERYBODY IS SUSCEPTIBLE FOR DISEASES LIKE COVID AND INFLUENZA -- SUSCEPTIBLE. PRODUCES LIKE COVID AND INFLUENZA IT'S THREE, MEASLES IS 18. WILLIAM: I DON'T WANT TO DATE YOU, BUT I KNOW YOU HAD MEASLES AS A CHILD BEFORE THE VACCINE. FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T REMEMBER, IN YOUR MIND IS HOW SERIOUS OF A VIRUS OR WHAT TALK ABOUT? DR. OFFIT: BEFORE THERE WAS A MEASLES VACCINE IN 1963, EVERY YEAR IN THE COUNTRY THERE WOULD BE THREE TO FOUR CASES OF MEASLES AND 3000 TO 4000 PEOPLE HOSPITALIZED AND 500 PEOPLE DIED, MOSTLY CHILDREN. THEY DIED FROM SEVERE DEHYDRATION, SEVERE PNEUMONIA, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE BRAIN. IT IS A TERRIBLE DISEASE AND I THINK WHAT WE ARE SUFFERING RIGHT NOW IS NOT JUST BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING MEASLES IN THE MANNER OF BEFORE, WE DON'T REMEMBER MEASLES. WE DON'T ROOM OR HOW SICK THE VIRUS CAN MAKE YOU. WILLIAM: ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE ALSO SEEN IS A SOMEWHAT CONFUSING AND CONFLICTING OFFICIAL GUIDANCE. IN FLOOR THERE WAS AN OUTBREAK AT A SCHOOL AND THE STATE SURGEON GENERAL SENT A LETTER TO FAMILIES THAT SEEMED TO CONTRADICT ALL OF THE OFFICIAL GUIDANCE. HE DIDN'T RECOMMEND PARENTS GET VACCINATED, HE DIDN'T RECOMMEND UNVACCINATED CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN EXPOSED QUARANTINED THEMSELVES. HOW ARE PEOPLE SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT TO DO IF THEY ARE GETTING THIS MIXED MESSAGING? DR. OFFIT: THE MESSAGING THEY WERE GETTING IN FLORIDA WAS ERRONEOUS. THE TWO WEAPONS, ONE IS ISOLATION OF PEOPLE INFECTED, THEY NEED TO ISOLATE FOR 21 DAYS, AND THE OTHER IS VACCINATION, AND GIVING A VERY SOFT SELL FOR THOSE, HE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DO A LOT OF HARM. WILLIAM: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF A LARGER DECLINE IN PUBLIC FAITH IN PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU DEAL WITH IN YOU KNEW -- YOUR NEW BOOK AND YOU TALK ABOUT MISSTEPS THAT WERE TAKEN DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC. HOW DO WE REPAIR THIS BREACH SO THAT WHEN THE NEXT OUTBREAK COMES, PEOPLE KNOW WHERE TO GET GOOD, SMART INFORMATION? DR. OFFIT: I THINK BY MANDATING COVID VACCINES, WE INADVERTENTLY LEANED INTO THIS LIBERTARIAN LEFT HOOK. NOW YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF PIECES OF LEGISLATION PUSHING BACK AGAINST VACCINE MANDATES AND MASKING MANDATES BECAUSE IT WAS SEEN AS AN ISSUE OF BODILY AUTONOMY. BUT IT'S NOT A PERSONAL CHOICE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MEASLES BECAUSE IT IS A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE. WHEN YOU MAKE A DECISION FOR YOURSELF, YOU ALSO MAKE A DECISION FOR OTHERS. THERE'S ABOUT 9 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WHO CANNOT BE VACCINATED BECAUSE THEY ARE GETTING CHEMOTHERAPY, OR THEY HAVE HAD A TRANSPLANT. THEY DEPEND ON THOSE AROUND THEM TO BE PROTECTED. DO WE HAVE ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR NEIGHBOR? I THINK WE DO. WILLIAM: THAT WAS ARGUMENT MADE DURING COVID AND WE ARE MAKING IT AGAIN DURING MEASLES AND WE ARE STILL SEEING THIS PUSHBACK BOTH LEGISLATIVELY AND PERSONALLY. THIS WILL BE AN AND NORMA'S CHALLENGE FOR THE COUNTRY MOVING FORWARD. -- AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE FOR THE COUNTRY MOVING FORWARD. DR. OFFIT: YES GOOD AND SOME TEXTURES THE WORD VACCINE HAS BECOME -- YES. IN SOME SECTORS OF THE WORD VACCINE HAS BECOME A DIRTY WORD. CHILDREN DON'T NEED TO SUFFER, IT'S THE MOST VULNERABLE WHO SUFFER. WILLIAM: THE NEW BOOK IS CALLED ""TELL ME WHEN IT IS OVER."" THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DR. OFFIT: THANK YOU."
211,emuTXyu_ei8,Meet the Black female scientist on the forefront of COVID-19 vaccine development,"Along with manufacturing and distribution issues, public health officials are concerned about millions of Americans who are resistant to taking the coronavirus vaccine. To address this, some of those officials are shining a light not just on the science behind the shots, but on the scientists who helped bring the vaccines to fruition. Michelle Miller has the story.",2021-01-09,87610,1137,947,UC-SJ6nODDmufqBzPBwCvYvQ, [Music] according to the centers for disease control and prevention more than six and a half million americans have now received their first dose of the vaccine against the coronavirus it's a number that will be growing every day though it's well behind what public health experts had been hoping to see along with manufacturing and distribution issues public health officials are concerned about millions of americans who are resistant to taking the vaccine to address that some of those officials are shining a light not just on the science behind the shots but on the scientists who help bring the vaccines to fruition when the president paid a visit to the national institutes of health last march the leads at the vaccine research center explain their life-saving mission why shake proteins that will bind the key to it a 34 year old doctor named kismikia corbett i was just there telling the task force about the work that we've been doing two weeks later dr corbett's team began the first stage of clinical trials we have taken a lot of the knowledge that we have gained over the last six years and applied it to a fairly revolutionary vaccine platform in collaboration with moderna that vaccine rolled out within 10 months the vaccine teaches the body how to fend off a virus because it teaches the body how to look for the virus by basically just showing the body the spike protein of the virus the body then says oh we've seen this protein before let's go fight against it that's how it works for a lot of people seeing you as the person who is part of this process there's there's a trust factor to be honest i didn't realize the level of impact that my visibility might have i do my work because i love my work dr corbett's interest in science began at an early age but one opportunity made a key difference she attended the university of maryland baltimore county as a meyerhoff scholar an aggressive program that mentors minorities and women in science graduates include surgeon general jerome adams was she someone who's going to make it all along she was definitely going to make it in life dr freeman rabowski has been president there for nearly 30 years she had strong science background but she also was very comfortable with people we need more scientists who can connect to people she could do that when she was 17 easily what we do at umbc is to support students of color black but also students in general to make sure they make it in science only 18 percent of all students graduate with a stem degree according to the national center for education statistics around 2 percent are black it's important for those people to see people looking like them like themselves who can be involved if it's about women or it's about blacks because it shows that you've got people who understand what you've gone through dr corbett and i have worked together for maybe 15 or 16 years since she was in high school dr barney grahams not only corbett's mentor he's her boss when you recognize somebody has special qualities you need to do things that can keep those other things out of the way and and avoid some of the dismissiveness that often happens not only to minority people but to women and historically that bias strikes not just professionals in the field but those that they serve let's talk about the impediments to the trust i grew up in birmingham all of my life i was hearing about the tuskegee study the federally sanctioned tuskegee experiment sought to examine the long-term effects of civilis by letting infected black men go untreated with no regard to the suffering it caused how do you feel about being used as a guinea pig well i thought once it was pretty rough another example the special cells of baltimore cancer patient henrietta lacks were taken without her explicit permission and were subsequently used in billions of dollars worth of medical research without compensation there are many other examples of supposedly objective scientists who were caring about everyone who valued people of color less it's a painful truth and this is what's significant when i say cozmica corbett is from a small town in north carolina a young woman of faith who understands the socio-cultural issues that we face who knows what racism means she gets all of that what's your message to people who are hesitant to take this vaccine number one is that i get it number two is that to really take advantage of the level of transparency that we are attempting even i haven't even seen before such as fda hearings and briefings being broadcast online and data coming out almost instantly and to try and address them and in one of those webinars fully dr anthony fauci gave her a ton of credit the vaccine that you're going to be taking was developed by an african-american woman and that is just a fact i mean that is a fact a fact offering illumination to those often left in the dark she cannot be a hidden figure she cannot be a hidden figure she needs to be in textbooks little girls need to see her of all races this is what's possible she's not a hidden figure now yeah no she's not and it's just it is a testament to the work of dr rabowski and others like dr graham her boss who pushed and also moved out barriers in her way so she could have that opportunity yeah yeah and look at all of us benefiting now from it i was gonna say the only way you can undo all those years of damage is to start right now and start moving those to the side put her

national sigh of relief when the pharmaceutical company pfizer started delivering the first doses of its vaccine across the country pfizer a frequent advertiser on this broadcast and its german partner biontech were the only major vaccine developers to refuse federal money for research and development yet they were the first to get emergency use authorization from the fda friday the biotech company moderno was granted authorization ii under operation warp speed the federal government set a target of 20 million inoculations by the end of the year but that goal might be ambitious the vaccine's rollout has been rocky still for the first time since the pandemic hit there appears to be an end in sight thanks to a revolutionary advance in biotechnology the story will continue in a moment this is a worldwide pandemic the worst in a century a vaccine with this technology had never gone to market before that's a big bet you made that this would work yeah i didn't see it as much uh maybe as a bet because we are scientists that's what we do for living every day we discover new things everything is new catherine jansen is head of vaccine research and development for pfizer based in new york it's one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world the day the vaccine jansen who developed an interest in science as a child in germany grew up to develop vaccines for pneumonia and the hpv virus so when she first heard of the novel coronavirus her thoughts turned immediately to a vaccine when you were starting off on this mission new york was on fire with this virus yeah we were living in the hot zone in new york and we saw firsthand what was happening every day and build the most chilling thing for me was when we walked our dog and you see one refrigerated truck after the other appearing in the parking lots in front of the hospitals the refrigerator truck morgues morgs right that was absolutely uh fueling the desire to come up with with the vaccine no matter what it takes this was kind of personal i took this very personally i wanted to fight it beat it fight it down it was nothing else mattered across the atlantic in mainz germany doctors uger shaheen and oslem terechi were also focused on fighting the coronavirus founders of a cutting-edge biotechnology company called biontech they had been collaborating with pfizer on a flu vaccine when shaheen read an article on january 24th about a mysterious disease in wuhan china we knew that we are most likely running into a global pandemic and we knew that we don't have time to vase we started to think about how to implement a vaccine development program from scratch basically and so we had to pivot the entire company did you have any doubts about doing that i did not have doubts the only thing that concerned me is that we might be too late the married couple's company biontech is doing pioneering work on vaccines made with mrna molecules in our cells that pass genetic instructions from our dna to particles that make proteins the building blocks of life we felt responsibility to start to develop a vaccine because we knew the potency of our technology manipulating mrna molecules in the lab to fight disease has been considered promising technology for more than 30 years but it has never produced a proven vaccine with the coronavirus spreading through europe shaheen and terechi redoubled their efforts by february biontech had produced 20 different versions of mrna that triggered immune responses in mice and monkeys shaheen knew his small company would need help taking its research beyond the lab so he picked up the phone and called his friend at pfizer catherine jansen and she said ugo why are you calling me and i said catherine we started to make a vaccine against covet 19. i wanted to ask you if you think that faiza would join us and she said of course ugga actually i wanted to call you because we are also interested to develop a vaccine and it will become our most important project it became more like an obsession for pfizer ceo albert borla what i was thinking was if if not us then we are having a lot of experience with vaccines we have a lot of manufacturing capabilities with vaccines i i went and i said we need to do something to see if we can help in developing a medical solution since march he had been pressing pfizer scientists to develop a vaccine quickly he set an october deadline then of course i gave them also some tools in their hands i told them that they should think this is not business as usual there is no consideration of return on investments they should consider whether they have an open checkbook an open checkbook yes did you have any idea how much you'd be willing to spend it will cost us around two billion dollars and they knew that if we fail and we have to write it off it's going to be very painful but will not take pfizer down catherine jansen convinced her boss albert borla that mrna technology had the best chance of meeting his tight deadline from her work with biontech on a flu vaccine she was convinced mrna was on the cusp of a breakthrough so pfizer ceo borla signed off on the partnership and rolled the dice on the experimental technology there was a big chance that you might not succeed i believe in the power of science i believe in the power of the private sector and i believe in the miracles that science in the private sector can do for mankind unlike old school vaccines made with real virus often grown slowly in eggs these mrna molecules are produced rapidly in a lab programmed with a bit of the virus's genetic code we've all seen pictures of the coronavirus with its crown of spike proteins the mrna vaccine instructs your healthy cells to make replicas of the spikes they can't make you sick but they do teach the immune system what the virus looks like if the real virus shows up your immune system antibodies will attack by may pfizer was ready to start testing the vaccine at different sites in the u.s and i raised my hand and said yes they tapped dr mark mulligan why did you want to be in this study he's director of nyu langone vaccine center in manhattan i've worked on hiv aids vaccines zika ebola flu pandemic vaccines so this is really the moment for for us to jump in and say okay let's do it let's try to be part of the solution almost 44 000 people around the world volunteered for the phased double-blind trials testing the vaccines against a placebo most were between the ages of 16 and 85. researchers faced some skepticism when they reached out for african-american and hispanic volunteers were these communities well represented in the trials i feel that they were if you add the hispanic population and the african-american black population and the indigenous american population it came in at just under 40 percent we would like to have done a little better particularly with african americans we were just under 10 percent but i think overall that's good we've had several town halls with community partners in harlem it's important for us to be able to say yes we tested it in your community yes it was equally tolerated safe and equally protective participants on the schedule for today normally phased trials run sequentially to speed up the process the fda allowed these trials to run simultaneously dr mulligan told us he had never seen it done so quickly what do you say to people who worry that that was too fast that this is being rushed to market given the huge public health emergency that we're in internationally it was appropriate that all speed be used i've done vaccine trials for 30 years and i i promise no corners have been cut on the usual safety evaluations volunteers blood samples were brought to this pfizer facility in pearl river new york where these robots ran day and night helping to analyze the effectiveness of the vaccine they'll continue collecting and analyzing samples for two years these robots have taken care of probably about over 180 000 tests when the critical third phase results were revealed last month catherine jansen was taking a break in the country with her husband she got a call from pfizer ceo albert borla and i said what's up albert he said well calcium we spoke to the fda we can say the vaccine is over 90 percent efficacious and i said what that is fantastic so my husband and i he was standing right next to me we are jumping up and down to have a vaccine that was needed so much and to have it be 95 protective and to have it happen so quickly is unparalleled in my experience can we all just say goodbye to our masks i'm afraid not we aren't sure yet that the vaccines will prevent asymptomatic infection the vaccine isn't probably going to make a difference for this current surge that we're in we're still going to be going through this for a while absolutely this won't be like a light switch that's on off but rather like those dimmer switches that we slowly turn up to bring up the lights five percent 10 20 50 of people getting vaccinated over months but to end the pandemic in 2021 we need to get probably 75 percent of people vaccinated and then we can stop the pandemic there are still a number of unknowns about this vaccine how long does it last are there long-term safety issues why a few people have had severe allergic reactions it still needs to be tested on young children and pregnant women but the most pressing issue the bumpy roll out the development of the vaccine was rapid but so far the distribution has been anything but pfizer cut the projected number of doses for 2020 by more than 50 percent citing a shortage of raw materials states are complaining they're not getting clear guidance from the federal government's operation warp speed about what they're getting and when at the moment the light at the end of the tunnel is still faint this past week when the u.s death toll from the pandemic hit 300 thousand the bells at the national cathedral in washington dc rang 300 times once for every thousand americans killed by the virus this vaccine has been called a miracle how would you describe it we can call it a miracle but a miracle always has a sense of it just happened it didn't just happen right it was something that was deliberate it was with passion dumbest passion was urgency it was always having in your sight that devastating disease

217,xnTVis4scUc,N.Y.C. companies &#39;blindsided&#39; by Covid vaccine mandate,"CNBC's Robert Frank joins 'Squawk Box' to report on how New York City businesses are responding to Mayor Bill de Blasio's latest Covid-19 vaccine requirements. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

New York City is imposing a vaccine mandate for all private sector employers as a preemptive measure to fight a surge of Covid cases this winter, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday.

The mandate covers 184,000 businesses and will go into effect on Dec. 27, and it doesn’t give unvaccinated employees the option to get tested regularly, de Blasio said. They must have at least one dose by that date. The policy applies to in-person employees who are in a workplace with other co-workers, de Blasio said during a news conference Monday.

The city will publish guidelines on Dec. 15 to provide more information on implementation and enforcement, de Blasio said. The outgoing mayor said he has spoken with Mayor-elect Eric Adams about the policy.

“We’ve got omicron as a new factor, we’ve got the colder weather, which is really going to create additional challenges with the delta variant, we’ve got holiday gatherings,” de Blasio told MSNBC earlier Monday morning. “We in New York City have decided to use a preemptive strike to really do something bold to stop the further growth of Covid and the dangers it’s causing to all of us.”

The New York City policy comes after the Biden administration was forced to halt implementation and enforcement of national vaccine and testing requirements for businesses with 100 or more employees to comply with a federal court order.

“The commissioner of health has the authority to issue a mandate like this to protect the public health and his authority to do that has been upheld time and again,” Georgia Pestana, the city’s corporation counsel, said during the news conference with de Blasio. “The trouble that the Biden administration has run into in court doesn’t really apply here.”

The city will also require everyone 12 and older to show proof of two vaccine doses – as opposed to one dose under the prior policy – for indoor dining, fitness, entertainment and performance venues starting Dec. 27 unless they received Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose vaccine.

Children ages 5 to 11 will be required to show proof of a single vaccine dose by Dec.14 for those venues, the mayor said. They will also have to show proof of one dose for high-risk extracurricular activities such as sports, band, orchestra and dance by the same date.

De Blasio said the purpose of the vaccination requirements is to avoid the shutdowns imposed in March 2020 when Covid devastated New York City and its economy.

“We cannot let those restrictions come back, we cannot have shutdowns here in New York City, we got to keep moving forward,” de Blasio during the news conference. “Vaccination works and vaccine mandates work, that’s the bottom line.”

New York City already has a high rate of vaccination, with 77% of residents having received at least one dose, according to city data. New York has identified eight cases of the omicron variant as of the weekend, seven in the New York City area and one in Suffolk County on Long Island.

“I’m sorry to say that you can expect community spread,” de Blasio said. “We have to assume it’s going to be widespread. We have to assume it’s going to give us a real challenge.”

“We’ve been to this movie before, we’ve been down this road before. We know what happens when we get a new variant, particularly one that’s highly transmissible,” De Blasio said. “We are not going back to what happened in 2020,” he said.

Covid cases are increasing in New York City, with more than 1,500 new cases confirmed daily on average, according to the city’s health department.

218,k_YrHglsKho,Woman accused of selling 250 fake COVID vaccine cards over Instagram,"Fifteen people were charged Tuesday in what the Manhattan District Attorney's office called a fake vaccine card conspiracy.

Among those charged is a woman who allegedly sold 250 fake cards on Instagram, believed to be among the first alleged seller of phony vaccine cards charged in the country.

Officials say 31-year-old Jasmine Clifford sold the forged cards over social media and worked with 27-year-old Nadayza Barkley to fraudulently enter at least 10 people into the New York State Immunization Information System database.

Thirteen people who purchased the cards -- all of whom are believed to work in frontline and essential-employee settings, including hospitals and nursing homes - were also charged.

220,ELwYEqzTgSk,The race to make a variant-proof COVID vaccine,"Billions of people have been vaccinated against COVID-19 - an effort which has saved more than 20 million lives. But as variants of the virus keep evolving, vaccine developers are working on dozens of new ‘next-generation’ COVID-19 vaccines in the hopes of keeping up with the ever-changing threat.

In this film, we explore some of the leading designs, platforms and delivery methods of the COVID vaccines of tomorrow. Some could provide broader protection, others might be cheaper, more potent or have fewer side effects, whilst others still might be easier to administer and further reduce transmission. But with more than fifty vaccines already approved, and hundreds more in early and late-stage clinical trials, only time will tell which may have the greatest impact.

https://go.nature.com/371OcVF",2023-02-01,28780,642,406,UC7c8mE90qCtu11z47U0KErg, billions of people worldwide have been vaccinated against covid-19 but dozens of research teams are still working on more coronavirus vaccines why in a word evolution the first covid-19 vaccines protected against SARS cov2 the original version of the virus that emerged in 2019 but as new covid variants evolved the protection provided by the original vaccines did not while some immune cells like B cells can mature and develop to some extent the antibodies they produce after exposure to early vaccines still struggle to latch on to newer variants like Omicron and that contributes to a higher risk of infection and so researchers are developing a whole host of Next Generation vaccines in the endless race to stay one step ahead one approach is to update and combine vaccines companies like moderna Pfizer and bioentec have already started to introduce new bivalent mRNA vaccines designed to Target both the original version of the virus and the new Omicron variants these boosters encode molecules from the original and Omicron Spike proteins the goal is to retrain existing B cells as well as stimulate the creation of new B cells all in the hopes of producing antibodies that bind more tightly to the newer variants although as of yet it's unclear how much of a difference this will make this approach is also being used to create combination vaccines which could protect against covert variants as well as other diseases like influenza while potentially helpful updating covered vaccines in this way will always be a step or two behind the virus and so scientists also want to develop broadly protective vaccines that can Target future variants and even related coronaviruses before they arise one way to do this is by creating a vaccine that targets parts of the virus that don't tend to mutate currently most covid-19 vaccines are based on the spike protein but several groups are now focusing more specifically on the part of Spike which binds to human cells the receptor binding domain or RBD now the RBD contains some regions which mutate relatively little between covert variants and are even conserved in certain related coronaviruses what's more researchers can pepper vaccine particles with many different rbds from a whole host of covid variants and close relatives this is called a mosaic vaccine to train antibody producing B cells you want them to bind to your vaccine particle and those that bind more strongly are more likely to replicate and flourish in the case of this Mosaic vaccine the strength of The Binding relates to how many rbds the B cell can latch onto the theory therefore is that B cells that can only latch onto one or two specific rbds won't bind strongly enough to replicate but the B cells that flourish will be those that can bind to many rbds and the reason they'll be able to do that is they can recognize the regions that are shared between them in effect you end up with an immune response that sees past the variation and focuses on the shared broad features of these viruses clinical trials are due to start in the next two years while spike is the most potent Target for B cells it's not the only vaccine Target for the immune system for example T cells that destroy infected cells can recognize many other viral proteins and scientists are hoping to create vaccines that capitalize on this using proteins such as off-3a nucleoproteins or membrane proteins this could better mimic a natural infection only far more safely several of these vaccines are in late stage trials and there's more currently there are four different types of covid-19 vaccine known as platforms which have been approved for use but next Generation vaccines could include updates to these designs first mRNA mRNA vaccines helped turn the tide of the pandemic particularly in wealthier countries where the vast majority of doses have been sold but a Twist on this technology might make vaccines cheaper more potent and even reduce side effects mRNA vaccines contain instructions for our bodies to create a modified version of spiked packaged in a fatty nanoparticle but new generations of mRNA vaccines might also include instructions for a replicase protein which can tell cells to churn out more copies of Spike this means that a smaller dose of these self-amplifying RNA vaccines could potentially induce the same or an even stronger immune response whilst simultaneously being cheaper and reducing side effects protein-based vaccines are also in for an update typically these vaccines are based on a single protein like Spike which stimulates the immune system but now in a new class of vaccine researchers are building nanoparticles using self-assembling proteins which can then be studied with things like Spike or RBD the Mosaic vaccine we discussed earlier is an example of this the repetitive arrangement of the viral molecules in these vaccines mimics the actual virus and its hope that it will generate an especially potent response and it isn't just the platforms that could see an overhaul new delivery methods are also on the horizon for example nasal vaccines which are inhaled as a Mist through the nose or mouth or administered as nasal drops by prompting an immune response where the coronavirus enters the body the thin mucous membranes that line the nose and mouth these vaccines could in theory stop the virus before it spreads helping further interrupt transmission not to mention being much simpler to administer there's a lot of innovation on the horizon but in a crowded Market all of these new vaccines face the same key Challenge and that's proving they offer genuine improvements over the existing Jabs and that's not as easy as you might think many of them will try to focus on new selling points like further reducing transmission of covid or treating multiple infections such as covid and flu but with over 50 vaccines already approved and hundreds more actively in clinical trials new vaccines will really have to stand out to make an impact foreign

Moderna enrolled over 30,000 volunteers age 18 and older in its double-blind placebo-controlled study.  11,000 were from communities of color, 7,000 were 65 and older, and 5000 were under 65 with conditions that increased their risk for severe COVID.  Half received the vaccine, and half received a placebo, 15,000 in the placebo group, 15,000 who got the vaccine. Symptomatic COVID was confirmed in 185 people in the placebo and 11 vaccinated groups, making the vaccine 94.1 percent effective. Researchers actively monitored the vaccine recipients for local and systemic side effects for seven days after vaccination, recorded unsolicited side-effects for 28 days, and more severe side effects and medically-attended adverse events from day 1 through 759. 

Summary of The Safety Profile
Like Pfizer, those under 65 experienced more frequent mild to moderate side effects than those over 65. However, the safety profile was similar across age groups, genders, ethnic and racial groups, participants with or without comorbid conditions, and participants with or without evidence of prior COVID infection. These systemic side-effects are unpleasant and are at a higher rate than seen in most vaccines. They are more likely related to the lipid nanoparticles with super tiny amounts of polyethylene glycol in most cases.

Moderna reported no anaphylactic or severe allergic reactions to the vaccine, but a hypersensitivity reaction was reported in 1.5% of vaccine recipients and 1.1% of placebo recipients. The FDA's website has the list of ingredients found in all vaccines and advises that people with a history of severe allergic reactions check the list and discuss the risk of vaccination with their doctor. For example, a Boston doctor had a severe allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine. 

However, he did have a history of having an allergic reaction to shellfish in the past. He was rushed to an emergency room, treated, and released. It was also initially recommended that pregnant women or those who intend to become pregnant in three months should not get the vaccine due to their inclusion in the studies. But the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has recently released a statement supporting vaccination for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers.

Other Reactions
Bell's palsy was observed in three people in the vaccinated group and one in the placebo group. Bell's palsy is a condition that causes temporary weakness or paralysis in the muscles on one side of the face. It is frequently a reaction to a viral infection. A recent study in Italy reported that out of 38 people presenting to a local emergency room for symptoms consistent with Bell's Palsy, 21 percent had COVID. In 2019, at the same emergency room, 22 people were treated for Bell's palsy. Bell's palsy usually resolves on its own within six months. Bell's palsy incidence as a side effect from the vaccine will be tracked compared to Bell's palsy incidence in the unvaccinated population.

Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a neurological disorder that can cause muscle weakness or even paralysis, has not been reported during covid vaccine clinical trials. Therefore, in Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) does not list Guillain-Barré Syndrome's history as a general vaccination precaution.

With the latest guideline, the only people who should not get the vaccine are those known to be allergic to any of its ingredients, which is a cutoff that holds true for every medical product. Ingredients include lipid nanoparticles and polyethylene glycol. Anaphylactic reactions can occur with any vaccine but are usually extremely rare—about one per 1 million doses. As of 19 December, the United States had seen six cases of anaphylaxis among 272,001 people who received the COVID vaccine and 2 recorded cases in the UK. As with everything we do, from driving a car to eating food that may be potentially allergenic, we weigh the risks and benefits that need to be weighed against each other. In this case, the risks and potential consequences of COVID far outweigh the risks from the vaccine.

#modernavaccine #covidvaccine #vaccine",2021-01-05,641392,10263,2211,UCMSsLqxqvZsNXi0Z-VjN89A," is the moderna vaccine safe what are the side 
effects allergic reactions guillain-barre syndrome   bell's palsy let's break it down in this video 
so the moderna they took the genetic code from   the sars coronavirus 2 virus they identify 
the section that codes for the spike protein   the protein that binds to human ace2 receptor 
and they use this mrna sequence for its vaccine   short additional genetic sequences were 
added to both ends to help stabilize   this mrna the mrna strands are encapsulated in 
a lipid nanoparticle what is especially nice   about messenger rna vaccines is that there are 
no weakened killed or gutted viral particles in   the vaccine making it much safer for those who are 
immunocompromised and this vaccine is 95 effective   so like the pfizer bio and tech vaccine 
there are two doses with the moderna vaccine  they're administered on days 1 and day 29 so 
it's a little bit different from pfizer pfizer's   first one and then you get the second one three 
weeks later so very similar once the messenger   rna vaccine is injected human cells that used the 
mrna code to produce a viral spike protein but   not the other 28 proteins required to make a sars 
cov2 virus without the complete genetic code the   sars-kov2 virus can't be manufactured in a human 
being once the viral spike protein is produced the   human immune system recognizes it as foreign then 
there's a series of complicated immune processes   including the production of antibodies that 
are triggered and that's what allows your body   to fight off that virus in the future so in the 
new england journal medicine moderna enrolled   over 30 000 volunteers age 18 and older and 
it's a double-blinded placebo-controlled study   eleven thousand were from communities of 
color seven thousand were 65 and older   and there were 5 000 that were under the age of 
65 but they had conditions that were considered   risk factors for severe covid half the people 
received the vaccine half the people received   placebo so 15 000 and placebo group 15 000 who got 
the vaccine symptomatic covid 19 was confirmed in   185 people in the placebo group and only 11 in 
the vaccinated group so that's a 94.1 percent   efficacy now researchers actively monitored 
the vaccine recipients for local and systemic   side effects for seven days after vaccination and 
they recorded unsolicited side effects for 28 days   and more severe side effects and medically 
attended adverse events from day one all the way   through day 759 which means it's continuing to be 
monitored let's first start off by talking about   the local side effects so injection site reactions 
in the seven days after the first vaccination dose   that occurred in 84 of the vaccinated group and 
that's compared to 20 percent in the placebo after   the second dose 89 of the vaccinated group and 
19 of the unvaccinated group recorded injection   side effects overall the vaccine side effects 
were rated as mild to moderate in severity   and lasted an average of 2.6 and 3.2 days after 
the first and second vaccine doses respectively   the most common local side effect was injection 
site pain that was reported 84 percentage and 88 percentage in the   vaccinated group after the first and second 
vaccine dose respectively injection site pain   was reported by 20 percent and 17 of the placebo 
group after the first and second dose the average   duration of pain was two days after the first 
dose and three days after the second swollen   axillary lymph nodes meaning lymph nodes 
and your armpits they were swollen and 21   of people under the age of 65 and 12 percent of 
people over the age of 65 in the vaccine group   and then it was about five percent in four 
percent of individuals in the placebo group the   median duration of swelling was one day after 
the first dose in two days after the second   other local side effects were uncommon such 
as redness and swelling at the injection site   so what about systemic side effects just like with 
the pfizer vaccine systemic side effects were more   common after the second vaccine with 55 percentage reporting 
a systemic side effect after the first dose   and 79 after the second dose in the vaccine 
group in the placebo group 42 percentage had side effects   that were systemic after the first dose and 37 
after the second dose the most commonly reported   systemic adverse event was fatigue that was at 69 
percent of the vaccine group and 36 of the placebo   and that fatigue lasted for about a couple 
days headache was reported in 63 in the   vaccine group and then 37 at the placebo group 
muscle pain was reported 60 in the vaccine   20 in the placebo group now in the vaccine group 
45 reported joint pain compared to 17 and placebo   then there was other things that occurred less 
frequently but more commonly in the vaccine group   such as chills and fever about half of those 
in the vaccinated group reported systemic side   effects starting at 15 hours after vaccination 
with no long-term side effects systemic reactions   lasting longer than seven days were about 12 
percent in the vaccine that's compared to 10   percent in the placebo so about the same in both 
groups severe adverse reactions defined as those   that prevent normal daily activities that was 
0.2 to 7.7 percent of participants overall   fewer than one percent of vaccine recipients 
reported fever over 102 degrees fahrenheit   severe fatigue was reported in 7.7 of vaccine 
recipients muscle pain and 6.1 joint pain in 3.7   and headache in 4.4 severe adverse reactions 
were more frequently reported after the second   vaccine dose and less commonly in the groups that 
were over 65 years old systemic side effects are   expected as the immune system responds to foreign 
viral proteins so a decrease in reactorgenicity is   expected in older adults as aging brings about 
a gradual deterioration in the immune response   however the immune response or reactogenicity 
of the immune system to the moderna vaccine   it may be more than most people have previously 
experienced with other vaccines so in summary   just like with pfizer those who were younger less 
than the age of 65 they had more frequent mild to   moderate side effects compared to the older groups 
the safety profile was similar across age groups   genders ethnic and racial groups participants with 
or without comorbid conditions and participants   with or without evidence of prior covid infection 
these systemic side effects are unpleasant and   are at a higher rate than seen in most vaccines 
and in most cases they're more likely related   to the lipid nanoparticles that have super tiny 
amounts of polyethylene glycol moderna reported no   anaphylactic or severe allergic reactions to 
the vaccine but a hypersensitivity reaction   was reported in 1.5 percent of vaccine 
recipients and that's compared to 1.1   percent of placebo recipients the fda's website 
has the list of ingredients found in all vaccines   and advises that people with a history of severe 
allergic reactions check the list and discuss the   risk of vaccination with their own doctor so there 
was a boston physician who had a severe allergic   reaction to the moderna vaccine he did have a 
history of having allergic reaction to shellfish   and he was rushed to the emergency 
room he was treated and released   also it was initially recommended that pregnant 
women or those who intend to become pregnant in   three months should not get the vaccine due 
to the lack of their inclusion in the studies   but the american college of obstetricians and 
gynecologists has recently released a statement   supporting vaccination for both 
pregnant and breastfeeding mothers   bell's palsy was observed in three people in the 
vaccinated group and one in the placebo group   bell's palsy is a condition that causes temporary 
weakness or paralysis in the muscles on one side   of the face it's frequently a reaction to a viral 
infection a recent study in italy reported that   out of 38 people presenting to a local er for 
symptoms that were consistent with bell's palsy 21   had covid 19 in 2019 at that same er 22 people 
were treated for bell's palsy bell's palsy usually   resolves on its own within 6 months the incidence 
of bell's palsy as a side effect from the vaccine   will be tracked and compared to the incidence of 
bell's palsy in the unvaccinated population   Guillain beret syndrome which is a neurological disorder 
that can cause muscle weakness or even paralysis   has not been reported during coronavirus vaccine 
clinical trials and in general the advisory   committee on immunization practices does not list 
a history of guillain-barre syndrome as a general   vaccination precaution with the latest guideline 
the only people who should not get the vaccine are   those who are known to be allergic to any of his 
ingredients which is a cut off that holds true for   every single medical product ingredients include 
lipid nanoparticles and polyethylene glycol   anaphylactic reactions can occur with any vaccine 
but are usually extremely rare about one per one   million doses as of december 19th the united 
states has seen six cases of anaphylaxis among   272 000 people who received the covid 19 vaccine 
and there were two recorded cases in the uk as   with everything we do whether it's driving a 
car to eating a food that could potentially be   allergenic we have to weigh the risks versus 
the benefits and when it comes to covid 19   the risks of getting covid 19 and the 
potential consequences that come with that   far outweigh the risks that 
come from the vaccine itself  "

Patrick Bet-David is the founder and CEO of Valuetainment Media. He is the author of the #1 Wall Street Journal Bestseller Your Next Five Moves",2024-01-03,657569,12429,2552,UCIHdDJ0tjn_3j-FS7s_X1kQ, Rob did you see the Seth McFarland debate with Bill Maher on the vaccine did you see that what you think about I I I loved it because well two things a I got to see like I I I I've I've been around Seth M McFarland at at a nightclub drinking Jack Daniels really really really cool guy really really generous but to see that you know they're both obviously liberals for him to to have that point of view and for them to actually Pat have the conversation and it not become no no you're wrong you're wrong and then the conversation stopped at least I got to how long how long is the longest one Rob can you see what do you have right there 641 what's the one above it they're all 641 except for this 30 second clip play the 32nd one see what it is let's see what the 32nd one is uh go ahead play this clip here and but tell me what we disagree on when you do real time and we'll try to make that that the topic because I'd love to uh as I I think I mean look I I think we disagree on the fact that I think that the public health infrastructure despite being being absolutely inadequate prior to co did as good a job as they could have done no during Co and it pisses me the [ __ ] off when I see people [ __ ] on them when I see I see it must because you like like steered it all the way back to that again like but tell me what that is pretty wild to say that they did a good job during Co even though it was inadequate pre-co do you think he's getting P does he have to say that you think or he genuinely in his heart feels that cuz this is said McFarland guy is this is a professional actor he's in that Community he is he's in that space what do you think Tom you look you had to look like I not not I'm not say why don't you do this but Rob why don't you go play the six minute clip but just don't play the whole six minutes and just play the first like minut go and play this clip and maybe fast forward a little bit go ahead but then why are doctors wrong about so much about a lot too and yes and but very often people who aren't doctors have been writer about things um like like like what would be an example of that I would think uh this country did not allow for um uh natural immunity to be considered and I know this is a subject dear to your heart even if you had the disease you still had to get a vaccine that's powerful stupid they don't do that in Europe I think they do that here there's mandatory vaccination in grade in school right but if you already but if you already had the disease you have natural immunity we didn't see didn't to believe in that that was debunked though I mean that was that don't you know people who' had Co four or five times I do that's not natural immunity there's no immunity there you've had Co five times watch what he says probably because you had too many vaccines I didn't have Co did you did the vaccine gave you co uh well that's certainly there nothing unscientific about the fact that the vaccine which does weaken you in order to strengthen you says do all vaccines exactly yeah but while you're in a weakened State yes that's why why so many people like me got it did not have it I I thought it was a great exchange but but the point is here's a point okay Vinnie two years ago that conversation is not being had absolutely I'm telling you right now two three years ago that conversation is not that would have been Tak taken down off the internet right but but the fact that this conversation is being had gradually we are being forced to go this way you know why here's how this works think about the longest time you held a grudge with somebody how long was it okay I don't we're not give a names might still be going okay but but think think about the longest and by the way let me kind of bring you close I'm talking family I'm talking blood I'm not talking like a friend a friend okay I'm talk maybe even best friend what is the longest grudge you ever had like years give me a timeline 10 years go honestly Rob two years and it was my best friend from seventh grade up until three or four years ago where we started arguing about the covid vaccine I didn't take it my my employer mandated it I said no I lost my job employ Tim and maor take no not this employ freaking let me talk to these guys my previous employer I worked in radio they they mandated it I said no my best friend worked for Live Nation at the time he took it we had several arguments I tried to explain to him why I didn't think it was necessary for me to take it we didn't talk for two and a half years until he finally came back and said hey I'm sorry about that you were right and I was wrong best friend can he said that to you yes again best friend for 20 years holy [ __ ] you guys better now yeah best friends shout out to your best friend for acknowledging that he should have been better the longest you've gone with a grudge family or a best friend not friend couple okay what's yours Tom it's probably family about five years uh Vinnie Vinnie still holding on but when it comes to friends and stuff and this past 20123 I called the two people that I was not even talking to and I initiated that hey whatever it was I'm sorry I forgot about it one never got back to me the other one just two days ago hit me now let's categorize grudges okay let's categorize grudges one Grudge is what hardcore betrayal that's permanent forever set that aside right let's set that aside we're not we're not going to talk about well why don't you go and apologize to them no bro that's betrayal okay that is gone all right let's put the other Grudge as what you're offended cool all right let's put that over here let's put the one in Middle disrespected and did something that was a real stupid thing that one or the other person did and they apologize right how long can we go with a grudge two years two and a half years three I don't know it ain't 50 years okay so what's the point here dude America's so sick and tired of holding grudges against the other side they want to sit down and say dude I don't hate you as much as you think I do yeah you and I had different things with vaccine why do we let the mainstream media make me think you're a horrible person why do we think the mainstream media make me think that you're an idiot for not taking a vaccine you know what bro I effed up yeah effed up too all right cool you want to have a drink here let's smoke a joint and that's what bill marah is doing here right I don't know if America can go for too long holding a grudge I don't think it's a natural thing that we have in our bodies some of us again what's betrayal you can't like you know a snake uh I saw something the other day a snake betrays you and then they shed and then they may look a little bit better but they're still a snake they're still going to betray you if you keep you know forgiving a snake in your life you're the [ __ ] okay that guy's DNA is to betray you consistently over and over and over again but for everybody else you know in this community that guy's a Democrat so guess where Seth lives in he lives in Hollywood what does Hollywood look like a Hollywood is him they're invited to the same parties they're on the Tablo they're on all the magazines they're being talked about you're in that space the managers the ca the WME the all that stuff he is in that Community what do you expect him what do you think the people around him believe the same exact thing he believes in what is Bill [ __ ] he's sitting there debating conversations challenging all this other stuff the fact that we're having these conversations as crazy as this sounds we are getting closer to each other this doesn't mean we're going to be 100% over it it just means we're making progress this is a very good sign when you see these two guys talking to one another I know I agree but but when it comes to the like the powers that be though the one that he's talking about that's the the science the fouches the president saying it's a winter of death it's a war and unvaccinated that's a grudge p i don't give up not your friend though remember I said family or friend that's not a friend that is a divider I have a list of people whom I watched how well they divide oh my God I got a list of I can you know in who who's one of the top ones I'm talking in my personal life business there's a few guys and I I studied their playbook I'm like wow you are so good and I called them out one time and I said to his face I said hey you know this is what you do you know that right you do I watch you to divide people said you do and it's like you know no no you think no man I've seen you do it to this guy to that guy to this guy to that guy to You're So Proud with you you're so good at what you do so with that guy that's not a friend that's not a grudge that's a dark human being that I'm not trying to be friend I'm talking about somebody you love care friend family care about that now you're saying I hate you how the hell did we get here what happened did you truly betray me maybe you did okay then you're in this category don't worry about it we don't need a friendship ever again in America yesterday the the T and Dylan are saying so Dad what do you think about our country being called ESS I said what he said yeah America's essay I said what the hell is that essay what so I'm like okay here we go another FNAF book you read Five Nights at Freddy's that I have to sit here and learn about another character say no we're we're we're essay what the hell that I'm like what the guys up says no we're the States of America we're no longer United oh wow that might have been me Pat might have said that yeah t and Dylan they're like we're no longer USA we're the ESS we're the States of America wherever they picked it up maybe they bad influence me but but it's not bad influence it was it was true freaking he's already dividing America I'm holding a grudge right now I'm telling you publicly me and Vinnie have a grudge officially so

228,GE8XM0TXAJI,Moderna: Covid vaccine shows nearly 95% protection - BBC News,"A new vaccine that protects against Covid-19 is nearly 95% effective, early data from US company Moderna shows.

The results come hot on the heels of similar results from Pfizer, and add to growing confidence that vaccines can help end the pandemic.

Both companies used a highly innovative and experimental approach to designing their vaccines.

Moderna says it is a ""great day"" and they plan to apply for approval to use the vaccine in the next few weeks.

However, this is still early data and key questions remain unanswered.

Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog",2020-11-16,89816,1094,924,UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA, more positive news for a coronavirus vaccine this time one has been shown to be 94 and a half percent effective at preventing covid19 and doesn't need to be stored at such low temperatures the trial is ongoing and the u.s firm modena plans to apply to regulators in the coming weeks to get approval for emergency use of the jab the results come after similar results from pfizer and add to growing confidence that vaccines can help end this pandemic so let's take a closer look because interim results for this phase 3 trial show that the vaccine is 94.5 percent effective at stopping symptomatic infections it can be transported at a standard freezer temperature of around minus 20 degrees celsius which could be a significant benefit over pfizer's vaccine which needs to be stored at minus 70. the vaccine requires two doses four weeks apart the united states has pre-ordered stocks of this vaccine and modena expects to have 20 million doses available for the us by the end of the year and it plans to make 500 million to 1 billion doses available for use around the world in 2021. while the company's president dr stephen hodge spoke to our medical editor fergus walsh obviously we're thrilled it's been a long year for many of us and at our company it's been a long hard slog to get to the point where we now have clear evidence of efficacy of the vaccine to prevent 19 disease there was a moment of of pretty intense relief it's been a long hard stride as i said but that quickly passed after about a minute it became a realization that now that we know the vaccine works we have to get busy uh to work manufacturing and distributing it but um clearly an important milestone and a great milestone for us as a company and hopefully for us more generally as we fight this pandemic well let's talk now to dr maria sundaram who's an infectious disease expert for the institute for clinical evaluation sciences in toronto and joins me live here on the program how excited are you by this development extraordinarily so this is really great news just in terms of what we've discovered a week after the pfizer results were were revealed is that a coincidence or or is there some form of data sharing how is it that we're getting these results in quick succession it's possible that uh the sort of timeline at which we're getting these results is uh purely coincidental i think uh you know we're getting them as soon as they can come out and uh it happened that pfizer and moderna both were able to sort of report those results on similar timelines but great news for us a great couple of weeks i think and which bit makes you most optimistic is it that statistics of 94.5 effectiveness is it the fact that storage temperature is only -20 what is it that most excites you the mo the thing that most excites me is a combination of the 95 94.5 effectiveness uh estimate and the fact that they were able to observe so many coca-19 cases uh normally when we do a trial we want to see a certain number of people having the outcome that we're trying to prevent just so that we know that the treatment is truly effective and not just uh you know due to random chance so the number of cases that uh were seen in the modern trial that are being reported in these interim results are promising that this 94.5 effectiveness estimate is really very much a true representation of what we can expect to see in a broader group of people so i find that very hard being very reassuring both both last week and this week we're still waiting for the safety analysis what do you think is the likely time frame on that i hope it's quite soon um i know that a lot of people myself included are really very very interested in the safety results i think the preliminary results uh from moderna are very promising um they're they're similar safety profile to other vaccines that we might be familiar with like flu vaccine so you might experience some pain at the injection site you might feel junky for maybe a day but uh not something uh quite so severe uh it's like a prolonged fever anything like that so also very very good news increasingly is the focus now do you think uh turning to manufacturing to distribution to fairness all those sorts of absolutely fundamental questions yes absolutely um what i like to say and i hope this will be relevant for your viewers as well as an american i like to say this is just one inning in the baseball game so uh you know we needed a vaccine and uh once we have a vaccine we're going to need to be able to deliver that vaccine so every vaccine that remains in the vial and not in people's arms is zero percent effective uh so now absolutely you're right we need to focus on exactly how we're going to manufacture all the other components that come with vaccines the needles the syringes the boxes that they're packaged in and they need to be delivered fairly and equitably as well as quickly well doctor thank you so much for joining us just as a quick post script to what we were talking about there interesting because the company have been obviously giving that to information about distribution and temperatures and just a line from the head of vaccines for the u.s operation warp speed program saying mordona's vaccine will be easy to distribute particularly to rural areas because it can be stored for one month at standard refrigerator temperatures so they too at the head of the vaccines at the u.s operation warp speed program encouraged by what they've heard from the company there in america we'll have plenty more on that story throughout the course of our program

231,z3QI_0461_4,UK approves Pfizer Covid vaccine: Your questions answered - BBC News,"The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for mass vaccination.

The first doses of the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, are already on their way to the UK.

So why is the UK the first to approve it, and how will the vaccine be rolled out? We answer your questions.

Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog",2020-12-02,37861,396,735,UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA, we've had lots of questions about what today's approval of the fisa biotech vaccine actually means our health correspondent anna collinson is here to answer some of them straight off with raymond why is the uk the first to approve the vaccine yeah well russia and china have approved a vaccine of their own but the uk is the first to approve the pfizer and bayern tech vaccine and it's down to the speed of the uk's regulator the mhra which started its work in january has been working around the clock since then pouring through thousands of pages of data trying to see if the jab meets the efficacy and safety standards now the ema the body which regulates uh the vaccine for the eu has questioned the speed that this has happened but the head of the mhra said this morning that no corners have been cut okay david asks why are those who are classes extremely vulnerable and over 65 so low on the list yeah so this refers to the vaccine priority list which has been drawn up by the joint committee on vaccinations and immunizations and they see age as the biggest risk factor so what they want is the older age groups to be right at the front of the queue when it comes to getting the vaccine due to logistical issues however the vaccine needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees it's likely the very first people to actually get the vaccine will be those in hospital patients workers care home staff and those classified in the extremely vulnerable and over 65 group they are still in phase one so they are likely they're going to be some of the first people to get the vaccine probably early 2021 but if they are concerned you can also get the flu jab if you haven't already okay bill asks if you've had covered 19 already will you be getting the vaccine yeah so the eventual aim is for everyone to get the covert 19 vaccine regardless if you've had the virus before or not the reason is we don't yet know if the vaccine stops you catching and spreading the virus or does it just stop you from getting ill so more work needs to be done on that and this morning the health secretary matt hancock who previously had covert said he would be signing up for the vaccine when it was his turn okay now terry asks is the vaccine going to be compulsory and what are the potential side effects it's a really good question no vaccines in the uk are compulsory and it's the same for covert 19. the reason being experts say making it compulsory can really damage confidence but the prime minister boris johnson is urging people to take up the vaccine particularly those in the most at risk groups as for side effects data from the fisa trials say they're mostly very mild of course no medication is a hundred percent risk free if millions are immunized we're going to see potential side effects appearing but the hope is that they're going to be monitored very closely and patients will report any problems they have along the way anna thank you very much anna constance
232,B88lSMwQS84,Sweden to stop administering Moderna COVID-19 vaccine due to risk of heart inflammation,"스웨덴, '심근염 심낭염' 우려에 모더나 백신 접종 중단... 美 감염 10만 명 아래

Some European countries like Sweden and Denmark, have decided to stop using the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for certain age groups, due to the risk of heart inflammation.
Meanwhile, the U.S. is seeing a gradual drop in its daily infections due to the success of its vaccination campaign.
Choi Won-jong has more.
Sweden has stopped administering the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to younger men... particularly those under 30.
According to Swedish health officials on Wednesday... the reason is due to a risk of heart inflammation, such as myocarditis and pericarditis.
Pericarditis... is the inflammation of the outer part of the heart.... and Myocarditis is the inflammation of the heart's muscles.
Sweden's health officials added that.... it's rare to see these side effects... but will stop administering the Moderna vaccine as a precautionary measure... until new data is available.
In other parts of Europe... with similar concerns over side effects, Denmark has decided not to give the Moderna jab to anyone under the age of 18.
Norway is yet to make its own decision about the Moderna vaccine... but has urged men under 30 to get a Pfizer shot instead.

Meanwhile, in the United States... the country is seeing a major drop in daily COVID-19 cases.
Over the last two months... the figure has dropped to below 100-thousand...
and deaths have dropped by 12 percent to around 18-hundred a day.
Experts say increasing vaccination rates across the country have helped... adding that the fourth wave has come to an end.
However, the authorities are stressing... that a fifth wave could occur over the winter months due to the flu season.

the covid19 pandemic more than 20 vaccines are in development globally but as scientists move closer to success possible breakthrough in the development of a coronavirus vaccine there's a problem a growing number of people say they won't take a vaccine i don't want to inject anything like this into my body this is linked to declining trust in scientific experts and political leaders [Music] problems brought into even sharper focus by the pandemic and fueled by a spiraling emphademic anybody who has trusted the president has been lied to and many people like my dad have paid with their life this crisis of trust could have catastrophic consequences so what can be done to rebuild trust in vaccines and to protect the world from future disasters all vaccine advocates need to be more tech savvy we have science and evidence and right and fact on our side [Music] [Music] [Applause] this is the front line in the race to find a covid19 vaccine professor jonathan heaney is one of those leading the charge it has very much been a race against time and sometimes i wish time could stand still the professor has been developing vaccines for over 25 years now we have representatives of those viruses that are closely related to sars1 or sars2 but finding one to fight a virus which has brought the world to its knees feels different i do know people who've had kovid and it's a terrible terrible death it is an agonizing disease this project in cambridge is about to begin clinical human trials and the stakes could not be higher if we don't have a vaccine we'll be stuck in this lifestyle of isolation social distancing masks for a long long time [Music] for a vaccine to immunize populations effectively against covid19 around 70 percent of people need to be willing to take it trust is absolutely critical if only part of the population is on board we're never going to bring this virus to its knees and control this epidemic [Music] but in the rich world especially polls suggest that persuading people to take vaccines may be as difficult as producing them in the first place [Applause] many of these protesters belong to a growing minority who believe a covert 19 vaccine would actually be harmful to their health do i worry about vaccinations this one in particular yes definitely it's been rushed and imposed on us and i you know i want to have my choice and i don't want to inject anything like this into my body and into my children's body some here see a vaccine as part of a wider government conspiracy to exaggerate the dangers of covid19 many of these people have lost trust in their government and we will not give up until we get the truth we are not going to stand for being lied to by our governments by people that we should trust they want us to trust us but we can't trust them the views being expressed here are extreme and belong to a minority the proportion of the global population opposed to vaccines generally is estimated to be well under 10 percent but anti-vaxxers as they're often called are a vocal minority and their views are increasingly influencing broader society distrust can be infectious a poll carried out in america in september found that only 36 of adults said they would take a vaccine when one becomes available with 64 saying they wouldn't take one or weren't sure [Music] in another survey under four-fifths of people in 16 countries responded positively to the idea of taking a covid19 vaccine if proven safe and effective in the context of covid i think empathy is absolutely crucial professor heidi larson is an anthropologist and a leading expert on why significant sections of the global population feel hesitant about vaccines she says a failure to confront the root causes of vaccine hesitancy as she calls it is driving more of these people towards anti-vaccination views the majority of the public that is questioning their hesitant they're anxious these are people who have genuine questions who are open to vaccination but are feeling they're not getting their answers and then migrate more to the more anti-end that seem more acknowledging their concerns endorsing their concerns professor larson argues that one of the historic problems has been a failure by the medical establishment to listen to the concerns of parents who have doubts about inoculating their children a lot of parents feel like they're being judged called names for even asking questions and that's not at all been helpful in trying to support people in their decision making and positive sentiments towards a vaccine it's really fundamentally about trust relational trust breaking news testing has been paused for one of the leading candidates developed by oxford university in september a volunteer from a leading covid19 vaccine trial was admitted to hospital and the project was temporarily halted professor larson says an opportunity was missed to build trust with the public i wish in the news instead of just this is normal process safety events happen we're taking care of it that the voice of a participant said i appreciate the care and the attention that the clinical team gave to me during this uncertain time the message is sent that there is a caring team that they're not just putting vaccines in people to count numbers and get to the perfect vaccine that there is human empathy in this the medical and pharmaceutical professions have been far from immune to missteps during the history of vaccines and this has helped fuel today's climate of vaccine hesitancy and opposition not least the legacy of a british doctor named andrew wakefield in 1998 he published research in a highly respected medical journal claiming there was a link between a measles vaccine and autism wakefield and colleagues altered facts about patients in their studies but his research turned out to be highly compromised studies have shown no connection between the mmr vaccination and autism the journal eventually retracted the research and wakefield was struck off the medical register in the uk in 2010 but many members of the public continue to see wakefield as a credible expert this guy has been set up it's nothing but lies and millions across the world still have reservations about taking the measles vaccine it's symptomatic of a wider decline in trust in traditional experts and governments in rich world countries [Music] [Music] dr jonathan kennedy is an expert in global public health and has investigated the link between trust and government and authorities and hesitancy about vaccines in this class we're going to talk about the question of how to think critically about global health dr kennedy analyzed voting data and surveys on public confidence in vaccines across 14 countries he found a broad pattern where levels of electoral support for populist parties were higher levels of mistrust in vaccines also tended to be higher populist sentiment this distrust of elites and experts isn't just isn't just isolated in politics the forces driving scientific populism are all very similar to those that drive political populism [Applause] dr kennedy argues there's a strong relationship between vaccine hesitancy and political social and economic crisis at a time when trust between people and politicians has been breaking down a number of countries have seen a resurgence of measles how dare you yes you racist it certainly wasn't a coincidence that the uk last summer lost its measles-free status how about that at a time where there was massive conflict over brexit during the covid19 pandemic the response of governments has further decreased trust in public health experts and politicians not least in some countries with populist leaders the test and trace isn't improved significantly it could be a second wave in britain under prime minister boris johnson's leadership public health guidance has changed constantly and confusingly we're constantly working to improve that delivery system buying ppe from around the world creating a sense that the government is failing and incompetent in a huge policy reversal affecting hundreds of thousands of pupils what's more senior political figures have failed to follow their own health guidelines trust in the british government is a reliable source of information about coronavirus fell from 67 in april to 44 in august don't let it dominate you don't be afraid of it in america false information about the virus has flowed from a president whose contempt for truth has done more than anything else to sow distrust in politicians and experts one month ago today president trump said that the coronavirus was quote dying out i've read a lot about hydroxy i happen to think that it has an impact and then i see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute researchers at cornell university analyzed 38 million english language articles about the pandemic they found president trump was the single largest driver of misinformation around kovid 19. this is me and my mom and my dad in new york after i graduated from college for some this has had lethal consequences in june christine urquisa lost her father mark to covet 19. 65 year old mark was a lifelong republican voter and trump supporter from arizona he died after arizona's governor reopened the state encouraged by the president when the governor and the president went um around pushing a reopening strategy and saying to the public it was safe if you didn't have an underlying health condition it was safe to go out resume normal activities my dad listened and thought it was safe mark contracted kovid 19 after visiting a karaoke bar his daughter says placing trust in his political leaders proved a fatal mistake both the president and the governor of arizona are on record through that time downplaying the virus anybody who has trusted the president has been lied to has been misled and many people like my dad have paid with their life as a result while the actions of populist politicians have undermined trust in public health advice and institutions there is another factor which has driven this trend the unprecedented speed at which misinformation can spread in february the world health organization warned of twin dangers a global pandemic but also an infodemic a crisis in accurate public health information these insufferable globalist elitists like bill gates he tells us we need a nationwide shutdown for months this foundation is leading the charge to lower the world's population much of this infidemic is concentrated online social media users who may not hold strong views about particular issues can rapidly be exposed to misleading and extremist content folks i think they're trying to force a vaccine on all of us [Music] neil johnson is a professor of physics at george washington university his research shows how fake news can gain the upper hand in the online battle for hearts and minds what we expected to find was that there'd be a core of communities maybe public health agencies that we're promoting vaccines and establishment health thinking and that around this central strong core there'd be other opinions sort of extremes but that's not what we found we found that that was actually sort of inside out professor johnson's team mapped conversations on facebook about vaccines between 100 million people all over the world they discovered that misinformation was exerting more influence than accurate information in some sense it's almost like a network of trust and if they flipped either way of course they could become red they could become blue and that completely changes the battlefield on this battlefield map red represents facebook pages and members with anti-vaccination views and their spread over time blue represents pages and members with pro-vaccination views while green signifies the all-important groups of people who are undecided the undecided greens are more engaged with the red anti-vaccination clusters than the pro-vaccination blues the reds they are completely entangled with the greens they're not shores the communities of pet lovers parents groups organic blueberry lovers the ones that can tip the balance one way or the other the worry is as we see the greens and the reds entangle what we're really seeing is a beginning of an entanglement of trust away from establishment science trust is the glue because in the end when we trust the community if they happen to start talking about vaccines which is something that i don't ordinarily think about i will follow them in their thinking this entanglement matters research has found that online exposure to recent misinformation about a covid19 vaccine may significantly affect intent to take one and professor johnson believes this kind of content will continue to spread online with the result that anti-vaccination sentiment could become the majority view within a few years red with the concerned greens will rise to essentially dominate that space and it'll be very hard to reverse that so something different needs to be done now social media platforms have increased their efforts to stop the spread of untruths about vaccines and kovid 19. in april facebook put warning labels on about 50 million pieces of content related to the virus the platform partnered with reliable sources like the who and the nhs and in october facebook banned anti-vaccine ads yet campaigners argue the platform isn't going far enough and is failing to take down the majority of harmful content about vaccinations more broadly facebook's own algorithm undermines efforts to stem the tide of the infidemic says fadi kuran from the online political campaign group avaz facebook's algorithm is sabotaging the efforts of the platform to fix the misinformation problem it cares about keeping individuals engaged interested and online sensationalist outrageous content not the cdc guidelines but q anon for example gets more engagement and hence the algorithm pushes it up in your news feed one solution might be to detoxify the algorithm what facebook isn't doing is redesigning its algorithm redesigning its business model to ensure that it's not continuing to amplify this content and this does not mean that the algorithm should be designed to censor content it just means that the algorithm would downgrade instead of putting this malicious content at the top of one's news feed the platform would make sure that it is at the bottom of the news feed social media platforms could save lives they have the power this is a problem that mark zuckerberg and jack dorsey could literally say we're going to solve this right now yet redesigning algorithms and tightening regulations on tech companies is unlikely to get to the root causes of mistrust in vaccines to do that health bodies and experts will need to be proactive about building relationships with the public in person and especially online according to doctors at this pediatric practice in pittsburgh the key to tackling distrust and misinformation is to fight fire with fire hello this is a yucky doctor coming in how are you guys doing today i'm doing okay while it might look like any other children's surgery the kids plus practice has its own in-house video production suite getting messages out to patients constantly and quickly vaccine advocates are online using our voices not the same way we are in the office we're saving lives we're protecting them against myth truths and disinformation that can literally kill people i think all vaccine advocates need to be more tech savvy kids plus routinely post evidence-based videos and information about vaccines on all major social media platforms i'll start things off until we see our questions start rolling in again hello to tick-tock hello to facebook live and this presence allows them to respond to questions from parents and families who feel uninformed and concerned our parents our families are living their entire lives right here on their phones on their tablets on their laptops their desktops if people hear good evidence-based information before they hear the miss and disinformation that miss and disinformation is much less likely to affect them what you are essentially doing is inoculating them against that before it can take root in them these doctors also argue that it's vital to take on the stream of highly organized and targeted viral attacks from anti-vaccine forces the reality of online vaccine advocacy right now is if you post it they will come the anti-vaxxers will find you and they will attack you they want to terrorize providers into silence it's a challenge the practice knows all about together we can prevent cancer in your children in 2017 kids plus released a video promoting an hpv vaccine that prevents cancer and faced a barrage of hostility they attacked our post they attacked our facebook page they attacked the private pages of our families and our patients who defended us on our post they came right after our reputation kidsplus has since created a toolkit for health professionals and built a digital cavalry of global vaccine advocates who can quickly come to the aid of those under fire from anti-vaccine forces now as a vaccine for kovid-19 grows closer kids plus and it's self-styled keyboard crusaders are stealing themselves for a bitter but all-important new fight there's no vaccine yet there's no hurt immunity for covid and look this is what life is like without herd immunity this is what life is like without vaccines past evidence suggests some people could end up taking vaccines after saying they might not but herd immunity to covid19 may require around 70 take-up of a vaccine and just a six percentage point decline in acceptance could endanger this goal and for many alarm bells are ringing we're losing in large part because the anti-vaccine forces are much more passionate and organized than we are there are far fewer of them than there are of us we have science and evidence and right and fact on our side that's how we win hello i'm slovaya chankova

#COVID19 #SARSCoV2",2020-11-24,3778199,32802,3195,UCG-iSMVtWbbwDDXgXXypARQ," Welcome to another MedCram COVID-19 update,
and we're gonna be talking about the AstraZeneca vaccine in this update. But first, let's take a look at the numbers
real quick. Daily new cases in the United States are at
an all time high. But it may be peaking. We don't know, need to get some more data
here. But if you look at the data you can see that
there has been somewhat of a slowdown in the number of cases. Of course with deaths, they lag behind, maybe
a couple to three weeks, and the daily new deaths are increasing as well at this point. Again, we're gonna have to wait for further
data. So now we're gonna talk about the AstraZeneca-Oxford
vaccine, and we're gonna compare to the ones that have gone before it, like the Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine, and the Moderna vaccine. Now, as you will recall, the Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine and the Moderna vaccine are basically new vaccines in the sense that they are injecting
messenger RNA into your cells to tell the cells to produce the protein that is the same
as a portion of the spike protein that is on the virus, and that is what generates the
immune response. So in other words, we're giving instructions
to the cell to make the form protein, which causes the immune response. And that is actually very similar to the AstraZeneca-Oxford
vaccine, except, instead of using messenger RNA, they're using DNA to do that. So once again, in terms of a picture, imagine
we have the cell and we've got the nucleus. And what we were doing before, was we were
taking messenger RNA and that messenger RNA was being translated by ribosomes and converted
into the protein. And what we did with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine
and the Moderna vaccine, is we were getting the messenger RNA into the cytoplasm of the
cell. The cytoplasm is the outside portion, as opposed
to the nucleus. How do we get that messenger RNA in the Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine and the Moderna vaccine in? Well we used a lipid bilayer, or a micelle
as we called it, to get those fragments, or the messenger RNA, into the cytoplasm. And then from there, it's fairly straightforward. The cell uses its own cell machinery, which
is the ribosomes, to cause translation to occur and you make the protein in question. How this is different is AstraZeneca uses
a different technique. And it uses a virus called an adenovirus,
but not a human one, but a chimpanzee. Now why would it do that? Chimpanzee adenoviruses have not really been
exposed to the human population, so it's very unlikely that humans would create an immune
response against the adenovirus specifically itself. We don't want that to happen. Because if that happens, then the vaccine
is not going to be effective at getting its instructions into the cell. And of course, AstraZeneca knows that if this
vaccine is successful and is used on a number of people -- millions, billions of people
worldwide -- then it's probably going to have to abandon the chimpanzee adenovirus platform
for delivering instructions. Now, the adenovirus here does not use RNA,
like we've been talking about. It uses DNA, and DNA is a double-stranded
form of instructions. Now, there's a portion there in the middle
of that, that is used for replication of the virus. Well, the genetic engineers simply delete
that portion, so the virus can no longer replicate and cause an infection in the human body,
and instead they replace that portion of the DNA with genetic code (the instructions) that
the geneticists have engineered. And so what happens when you deliver this
adenovirus in the vaccine, it goes into the cell and it releases the DNA into the cytoplasm,
and then that gets taken up and goes into the nucleus. That DNA -- according to scientists at AstraZeneca
-- does not get incorporated into the host's genome. It does not go into your DNA in the cell,
but rather it is transcribed into RNA, and that RNA then exits the nucleus as a messenger
RNA and then exactly the same thing happens as what we saw with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine
and the Moderna vaccine, which is that the messenger RNA, which is now a product of the
transcription of the DNA, gets converted into the spike protein through translation by the
ribosomes and then this goes on once again to cause the immunogenic response. Now there's a couple of points that you should
understand about the trial, the AstraZeneca and Oxford trial, that's been looking at this
vaccine. And let me just stress to you that the results
that we have gotten here in the last few days are via press releases and not peer-reviewed
articles that have been published and reviewed. So the first differences we talked about is
that it is a DNA virus platform. And there's been many areas that they've been
doing research and predominantly, let's take a look at two of those areas. The first one was in Brazil, and the second
area that they did the trials was in the UK. Be also aware, though, that they are doing
trials in the United States as well. And from the numbers -- and I'm rounding these
off -- there's been about 9,000 people that have been enrolled in Brazil, and about 3,000
that were enrolled in the UK. Now, just like the other two vaccines that
we were talking about, this is also a two-step process. So, there's two injections, or two vaccinations,
and they're about a month apart. Now by some error that occurred in the UK
trial, they gave half a dose first, followed by a full dose. Now, in the Brazil trial, they gave a full
dose, like they were supposed to, followed by a full dose, and this happened approximately
28 days apart. Now, if you've listened to us when we talked
about the other two vaccines, you'll know that in those other two vaccines they did
the trial a little differently in terms of the fact that they waited for subjects to
become symptomatic with COVID-19 symptoms before looking at the end point there, or
a midway point, to see whether or not the vaccine was effective. Here in the AstraZeneca case, they were not
doing it that way. No, in fact they were doing swabbing and they
were checking for infections. This is a huge deal, because whereas with
the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine candidate and also the Moderna vaccine, all we can really
say about those two -- even now with the results that we have -- is that it is definitely effective
if what they're saying is true at preventing the symptoms of COVID-19, at preventing the
disease, at preventing the things that cause people to go to the hospital. What we don't know right now about those two
vaccines is whether or not the vaccine prevents infections. And that's important because infections leads
to transmission and transmission leads to spread of the virus. Now here with the AstraZeneca-Oxford study,
they actually checked for infections by doing nasal swabs, and so what we can say here is
that whether or not there has been a stoppage or a ceasing of transmission and therefore
infections. Now what was really interesting and kind of
a headscratcher is in the Brazilian portion of this study where they gave the full dose
on the first injection and the full dose on the second injection, the efficacy was only
about 62 percent. Now I say ""only"" because we're comparing it
to what we know now about the other two vaccines, but 62 percent is not a bad result. And it certainly meets the benchmark, or the
threshold, for getting emergency-use authorization from the FDA both here in the United States
and also in Europe. However, the part that's kind of a headscratcher
is that when they, by some serendipitous error, they injected the subjects in the UK with
half a dose on the first shot and then a full dose on the second shot, this one was actually
90 percent effective, and that's not just for preventing COVID-19, as I said. That may also, according to the preliminary
results, prevent infections from what they're telling us. And so the US trial was paused because there
were some events in two subjects in the United Kingdom, and one subject in Brazil, that was
deemed later not to be related to the vaccine, but it took them time to investigate. They have restarted the USA portion of the
trial, but now they want to see if they can, in midstream, modify that to introduce some
half-dosing as well, combined with perhaps full-dosing to see whether or not they're
going to get a similar result, either 62 or 90 percent or something in between. Now the other thing that was very interesting
about this is that obviously some people are getting placebos, but in not every situation
are those placebos just saline or salt water. In fact, in the first injection, what they
have been doing is getting a meningitis vaccine dose, because they wanted to reproduce the
symptoms that people got when they got an injection. Because when you get an injection with saline,
it doesn't cause irritation at the site as much, it doesn't cause pain at the site as
much, but a regular vaccine that would have nothing to do with coronavirus, such as a
meningitis vaccine, might do that. And so , AstraZeneca-Oxford trial is a little
different than the other two in that they were giving other vaccines as placebo. And the reason that they're doing this is
to get a more realistic placebo effect so that the subjects can't tell whether or not
they've gotten the vaccine, in this case, or whether they're in the placebo arm. So what are the other possible advantages? Well, with the Moderna vaccine, as we talked
about, it had to be stored, if you wanted to store it for 30 days, at negative 20 degrees
centigrade or negative 4 Fahrenheit, and as you recall from the Pfizer vaccine, it was
even more extreme. It was at negative 70 degrees Centrigrade
or negative 94 degrees Fahrenheit to store it for six months. Here, just a regular refrigerator is all that
is necessary. In fact, it only needs to be stored at 2 to
8 degrees Centrigrade or 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit. So those are some advantages there. And of course because of that you don't need
to build an infrastructure system, you just need regular refrigeration to store this vaccine. The other thing that's very interesting as
well, is that AstraZeneca has promised not to make any profit during the pandemic on
this vaccine. And so while the cost of giving the other
two vaccines is around the $20 range, the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is going to be
sold for anywhere between $3-5. And not only that, the AstraZeneca-Oxford
vaccine is potentially going to hit about 3 billion doses. And what's interesting is that because they
only needed a half dose for the 90 percent efficacy, they would actually be able to save
some of that material and that could immediately go as high as 4.5 billion doses worldwide. The other thing thats interesting politically
as well is that because the United Kingdom is leaving the EU, they would be able to get
this fast-tracked within their own country without depending on EU approval. However they are applying for EU approval
as well. Other things that came out in the press release
is that there were no serious side effects. The other thing that said too was that there
were not severe COVID cases in those patients that got the vaccine. So let's review: how is the AstraZeneca-Oxford
vaccine similar to the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna vaccine. Well, it's similar in that two vaccinations
are necessary, approximately one month apart. It's also similar in that it delivers the
instructions to the cell, for the cell itself to make the protein antigen that stimulates
the body to make the immune response. But this candidate is different in the fact
that it's a DNA virus. It's also different in that it doesn't really
require subzero temperatures to preserve it. It's also different in terms of the fact that
it's going to be a lot more affordable, especially for countries that don't have the infrastructure
to keep these vaccines at very low temperatures. And it's also different that there is this
headscratcher type of situation here, where we don't really understand why this small
UK group had such high efficacy especially with only half the dose on the first dose. So right now we're kind of feeling around
in the dark. What we really need to have and what we are
going to have very shortly is the actual data released that will be peer-reviewed and published. And if you want to read more about this, I'm
going to put in the description below the links where we got this information from,
so you can do more research and find out for yourself. If you want to hear more medical topics explained

240,vIG5zTLB3hw,WHO covid vaccine revised roadmap,"WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (people who are good at stuff)

https://www.who.int/news/item/28-03-2023-sage-updates-covid-19-vaccination-guidance

revised the roadmap for prioritizing the use of COVID-19 vaccines, 

to reflect the impact of Omicron and high population-level immunity due to infection and vaccination. 

The roadmap newly considers the cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination for those at lower risk

 – namely healthy children and adolescents – 

Revised roadmap reemphasizes the importance of vaccinating those still at-risk of severe disease,

mostly older adults and those with underlying conditions, 

Chair Dr Hanna Nohynek. 

“Countries should consider their specific context in deciding whether to continue vaccinating low risk groups, 

like healthy children and adolescents,
 
while not compromising the routine vaccines that are so crucial for the health and well-being of this age group.” 

The high priority group

and frontline health workers. 

SAGE recommends an additional booster of either 6 or 12 months after the last dose, 

Medium priority group

healthy adults – usually under the age of 50-60 – without comorbidities

Although additional boosters are safe for this group, SAGE does not routinely recommend them, 

The low priority group

healthy children and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 years. 

Primary and booster doses are safe and effective in children and adolescents. 

The public health impact of vaccinating healthy children and adolescents is comparatively much lower than the established benefits of traditional essential vaccines for children

Vaccinating pregnant persons – including with an additional dose if more than 6 months have passed since the last dose – protects both them and the fetus

Other meeting highlights include: 

Polio, OPV

Regional reports on measles

With measles cases increasing in all WHO regions in 2022

In 2021, with 25 million children missing out. 

Status of new tuberculosis vaccines 

Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death and a vaccine that prevents disease in adolescents and adults is urgently needed. 

A substantial effort for vaccine development is underway, with several candidates in late-stage clinical trials

Malaria

Introducing the RTS,S malaria vaccine has resulted in a substantial reduction in severe malaria and all-cause mortality among age eligible children.",2023-04-01,333609,22548,5075,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg, well a warm welcome to this talk it's Saturday the 1st of April now I want to look at the World Health Organization guidelines for vaccination have changed in the past few days do we hear the sound of back pedaling from the World Health Organization in terms of covid vaccination not exactly but let's look at it and see what they're actually saying and um some of the things that they say here are actually quite uh incredible protects the World Health Organization so it must be right so let's let's look at the material that they're giving us now so here we see um Sage update this is there this is their scientific Advisory Group of experts I believe they call it on covid-19 vaccines now note these are experts so we can trust fully what they are saying we would certainly hope because their World Health Organization experts strategic Advisory Group of experts yeah that's what they call it experts Experts of course are people who are remarkably good at something and know lots about it so we just have to sit there and say thank you great experts for giving us the benefit of your expertise so let's get that benefit now um revised roadmap for prioritization of the use of covid-19 vaccines to reflect the impact of Omicron and high population level immunity due to infection and vaccination well quite seriously this is actually really good news here we see the World Health Organization at least admitting the existence of a natural immunity which is a step in the right direction now I know this sounds absurd but quite a few governments around the world you still don't really hear government officials in the UK talking about natural immunity unfortunately even though we know natural immunity is dead good and saves us from lots of other diseases so population level immunity due to infections and vaccinations I'm welcoming them in that welcome that as a positive admission of the obvious blatantly obvious from the World Health Organization you might say it's a little belated but hey you know we can only report what they're currently saying the roadmap newly considers the cost effectiveness of covid-19 vaccines for those at lower risk is this the back pedaling that we're hearing now could be could be a little bit let's go on uh now namely for children and adolescents which of course are but much much lower risk of severe disease very very low risk especially when you combine the high levels of immunity that are currently around revised roadmap reemphasize the importance of vaccination though still at risk of severe disease they say mostly adults and those with underlying conditions now this is the chair uh Dr Hannah no neck of the uh of the World Health Organization countries should consider their specific context in deciding whether to continue vaccinating low-risk groups could be a message here for countries like oh let me think the United States for example that are still advising children over the age of six months to be vaccinated um so maybe this might be of some benefit to the decision makers in the United States let's let's hope so like a healthy children in adolescents while not compromising the routine vaccines that are so crucial to health and well-being in this age group now this is serious dead serious now a really important point about this it points out that routine childhood vaccinations such as polio and measles have been lacking over recent years now these are wretched diseases polio is a terrible debilitating disease measles kills incredible amounts of children all around the world still mostly in the poor World context and to miss out these childhood vaccinations is a real threat to the life of these young people and the idea that a covered vaccine has somehow taken priority over a polio vaccine or a measles vaccine I would find strange but it it looks like it has done over the past couple of years unfortunately so we very much agree that these routine childhood vaccinations are absolutely uh essential to Community Health and individual health high priority group now of course in the high priority group they go through the usual suspects that we you know people would expect at the elderly the people with comorbidities diabetes obesity Etc which we could argue about but we're not going to at the moment but then they actually say that healthcare workers should be uh boost this healthcare workers should be a priority group here healthcare workers we're talking about young fit working age people obviously by definition um some not so young of course um but um but basically it's it's working age people they're very often young very often incredibly healthy and here we have the World Health Organization seeing these people these people should be boosted and well healthcare workers have been exposed to the virus so many times perhaps on a daily basis for years the natural immunity and the mucosal compartment immunity will be in place and yet we have the World Health Organization saying these people should be boosted um well there you go saying they should be boosted now of course I've talked to many colleagues who are healthcare workers and uh over the past years and we've debated this matter but here's the World Health Organization guidelines uh high priority group Frontline healthcare workers including young fit athletic healthcare workers they don't differentiate um now of course this is a family channel we don't use bad language no matter how much we are tempted to do so but that's the World Health Organization guideline that that Sage group recommends an additional booster either six months or 12 months after the last dose for young fit healthcare workers who've had multiple exposures this is the recommendation from the World Health Organization and you know what we're not allowed to disagree because it's the who let's hope there's no vested interest in their uh decisions medium priority group healthy adults unusual under the age of 50 60 without comorbidities and then they say this although additional boosters are safe for this group Sage does not routinely recommend them so this was published towards the end of March 2023 and here we have the World Health Organization saying boosters are safe boosters are safe now as I've already clarified we don't use bad language on this channel so we won't be using bad language on this channel no matter how much we are tempted to do so here we have the World Health Organization despite all saying additional boosters are safe and we can't disagree okay low priority group healthy children adolescence age six months to 17 years primary and boosted doses are safe and effective in Children and adolescents well it looks like even the CDC in the FDA and the uh the UK authorities got this wrong that there's not a risk of myocarditis because safe to me means safe so there doesn't seem to be we've all got it wrong there appears to be no risk at all from these vaccines in young healthy fit male adolescence there is no risk at all to give this vaccine to young men who are otherwise perfectly healthy it's safe to do so we know that's true because of the World Health Organization is saying so sorry primary and booster doses are safe and effective in Children and adolescents that's what the World Health Organization is telling us at the end of March 2023 sorry I'm calm again now well I'm not I'm hiding it that's what they're telling us now Public Health impacts of vaccination health health of children and Adolescence is comparatively much lower than the established benefits of traditional vaccines in children now again we agree these traditional vaccines are not adenovirus Vector vaccines these traditional vaccines are not messenger ribonucleic acid vaccines they are attenuated or dead antigen which of course is what we've been protecting our children with for Generations now let's hope there's no conflation of these two ideas because they are completely separate vaccinating pregnant persons including with an additional dose of dose of more than six months have passed since the last dose protects both them and the fetus now a vaccination of pregnant persons what the heck of the World Health Organization talking about here maybe they mean pregnant women but of course we don't know because they say pregnant persons but doesn't it show what a virtuous organization the World Health Organization is because it doesn't want to insult anyone personally I prefer Clarity of communication so I think it's talking about pregnant women but we'll never know for sure because it doesn't say that we only know what the World Health Organization actually says vaccinating pregnant persons an additional dose protects both them and the fetus so again despite any data you might have heard about it looks like you were completely wrong vaccinating pregnant um persons um isn't a isn't a problem in fact it is recommended by the World Health Organization other meeting highlights included and here here seriously over polio vaccine I mean you go into any Village in India for example and um there's these terrible children with polio form deformities it really is a tragic illness and should have been eradicated decades ago it's such an indictment on Humanity that along with smallpox polio is not confined to a historical curiosity so polio vaccine no I'm not saying this without risk or polio vaccine can have transmission risks of course but um basically the polio campaign should have been finished a couple of decades ago and it's tragic that it hasn't and um I'm I'm sorry I'm just thinking of particular children that I've come across and know with these polio form deformatives and um it's it's truly wretched two truly wretched disease let's get polio eradicated with good use of oral polio vaccines and indeed other other polio vaccines let's get going with this um let's get going with that as soon as we possibly can um Regional reports on measles with measles cases increasing in all who retro regions this is concerning measles still cures a lot of children especially in poorer countries it is a big risk and should be vaccinated against on a global scale it's not an mRNA vaccine in 2021 25 million children missed out so that there is this is a life-threatening condition no doubt in my mind that children will die as a result of these emissions unfortunately and will be more spread of the disease status of new tuberculosis vaccines now tuberculosis is a leading cause of death and a vaccine that prevents the disease in adolescence and adults is urgently needed a sustained effort to vaccinate to for vaccine development is underway now I'm a bit confused here because when I was a child I was vaccinated with the BCG vaccine and the World Health Organization here appeared to be implying we don't have a vaccine for tuberculosis they seem to be developing a new one now I'm slightly concerned about this because in South Africa there is research going on at the moment not mocking South African medicine is good but in South Africa there is research going on just picked a place I know of for a messenger ribonucleic acid vaccine for tuberculosis which I find pretty frightening so quite why they're not using BCG vaccines I don't know vaccinologists can certainly let me know about that but um it protected us for a long long time and the the idea that the waiting for new vaccines which probably will be in license probably more expensive hmm yeah anyway I don't I'm a bit concerned about new things I like trust tried and test it but that's just me I'm old-fashioned anyway so they're saying they need this malaria of course now this one I'm going to look into that this new malaria vaccine I have no knowledge about that at all so I will check that out but I do know that we've recently distributed mosquito Nets in Uganda for example as part of our collaboration with Uganda and that um we believe this is already preventing cases on malaria so um quite what's happening with the malaria vaccine we don't know so there we go that's the uh latest wisdom from the World Health Organization that uh we can be grateful for so for now thank you for watching

243,mlg-AFbqYbc,AstraZeneca Covid vaccine: What do we know about the risks? - BBC Newsnight,"A trial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine on children has stopped giving out jabs while the UK's medicines regulator investigates a possible link with rare blood clots in adults. Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog

Prof Andrew Pollard from the University of Oxford told the BBC there were no safety concerns with the trial itself, but its scientists were waiting for further information.

Around 300 volunteers signed up.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people should get their jab when invited.

More than 31.6 million people in the UK have had a first vaccine dose and a total of 5.4 million people have received a second dose.

Two vaccines - developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNtech - are being used in the UK, while a third - from Moderna - has been approved.

244,YuXUelJezeM,DeSantis calls for grand jury to investigate Covid vaccines. Hear Fauci&#39;s response,"Dr. Anthony Fauci joins CNN's Kate Bolduan after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis asked his state's Supreme Court to green-light an investigation of ""any and all wrongdoing in Florida with respect to Covid-19 vaccines,"" his latest move to cast doubt on the vaccines' effectiveness and amplify fears about side effects. #CNN #News",2022-12-14,498519,6049,7922,UCupvZG-5ko_eiXAupbDfxWw," All across the country, hospitalizations are rising due to COVID, the flu and RSV. And those numbers are expected to continue to increase even more as people are gathering together for the h of course. So what is driving at all? Well, just before air, I talked  Anthony Fauci about this, as well as his imminent retireme as director of the National Inst of Allergy and Infectious Diseas What? And Dr. Fauci, we now have these three respiratory viruses just overwhelming hospitals. And I've heard many a doctor and hospital administrator, quite frankly, say that what we're looking at is really unprecedented times he If an immunity gap is some of what's driving this. When do you think we close this  or do you think this is the new  with this convergence of these v No, it doesn't have to be the new norma for the simple reason that we have good countermeasure for at least two out of those th and the three you're referring to is COVID influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. We've got to get people to get vaccinated further to protect them. Their family and society We have a vaccine for flu and we're having a pretty bad and early flu season. If you look at the trajectory of the flu, it's almost a vertical line upward. But we have a flu vaccine that is matched well to the circulating strain. So there's no reason at all not to get a flu vaccine in the same holds. True for the COVID booster, that is the updated B, a four or five bivalent that's available, but unfortunately only about 13% of the eligible people in this country have received th Now, RSV is a different story. We don't yet have a vaccine for RSV, but with regard to respiratory h and wearing a mask appropriately in an indoor setti I'm not talking about mandating  I'm talking about the common sen of when you go into a congregate setting, particular when you have a lot of infection like that, that you think about the possibi of wearing a mask and one of the somewhat encouraging things is that RSV i It is. It is particularly for young chi and for the elderly. We have peaked there. It looks like it is starting to come down. So let's hope it continues to have a trajectory downward so we don't have a challenge wit as much as we had over the past few weeks. It's good to see that that there may be some hope there on that one, at least in the interim, that they can be taking down, at least on one of these viruses One thing I wanted to ask you about, because I've been long intereste is I know the NIH is studying the phenomenon of long COVID, and the CDC just put out a report saying that long COVID has played a part in the deaths of more than 3500  so far as they've been studying in the pandemic. It's really the first kind of official attempt to quantify the number of long COVID deaths What is your biggest question about what still remains quite a with long COVID? Yeah, it is. It is a post acute viral syndrome that i It can be mild in the sense of having people have a lingering fatigue for a period of weeks to months. But it also in some individuals can be rather incapacitating. In fact, even as you said, rarely, but leading to a series disease and sometimes death, but rather than then, then the mortality of it. The thing that we're concerned a if you look at the fraction of people and the fraction varies depending upon what you look at regarding criteria can be anywhere from 5% to up to 15 or more per  giving the sheer volume and the quantitative nature of the number of people who are infected, even if a small, small percentag get long COVID That's a lot of people whose lives actually will be imp in a negative way by the persistence of these symp It's estimated that about a million people in this country cannot work, go back to their former employme because of the post COVID long COVID syndrome. So it's something that you're ri it's a bit mysterious. We don't know the precise pathogenic mechanism. There's a lot of work going into trying to figure that out because if you want to do something about it, either to or to treat it, you've got to understand what the underlying mechanisms a We're making some progress there but we still don't fully underst Yeah, and really, no other virus in recent history has become so politicized, as is COVID 19. I mean, you have found yourself we've talked about this many tim at the center of some of that angry debate. Elon Musk just came at you and attacked yo But the latest now, Dr. Fauci, is Florida Governor Ron D He's now asking the Florida Supreme Court to greenlight an investigation into in the way he put it. Is any any and all wrongdoing in with respect to COVID 19 vaccine What's your reaction to that? I don't have a clue, Kate. What he's asking for. I mean, we have a vaccine that unequivoc is highly effective and safe and has saved literally millions of lives. The commonwealth's fund has come out with a report just this past week that vaccinations that have been administered over this period of time, this last year and a half to two has saved 3.2 million lives. 18 million hospitalizations and approximately $1 trillion in So what's the problem with vacci I mean, vaccines are lifesaving. So, quite frankly, Kate, I'm not sure what what they're trying to do down there. It kind of gets at a bigger issu I've been wanting to ask you, as in one of our final interviews in in your role in public health is just the one result of the pandemic has s that science has become a divisi topic, politicized and weaponized by some people Have you thought about how do you pull that back? How do you turn that around? You know, Kate, if I had an easy answer, I give it to you. But it's a very difficult situat You're absolutely correct. It has been politicized and it has been politicized in a that has actually caused lives, because if people don't get vacc which unequivocally is lifesavin because of political ideology or because of misinformation and disinformation, that causes  And we've just got to get the American public, regardless of whether you lean left, you le It doesn't matter at all. We're all in this together. We're all human beings and we're all susceptible to dis that can kill us. So if ever there was a time in s when we need to pull together and recognize that the common enemy is the vir not each other, we've got to get people to appreciate that. You know, like I said, I don't have an eas how we're going to do that. But when people's lives are being lost about this, maybe that'll shake people up en to realize that we've got to start pulling toget and not against each other. I'm sure you have started kind of reflecting I know you wrote a very interest long piece, kind of a farewell piece in The New York Times, a message to the next generation of scient but it has been a wild ride at the tail end of your very lon in public health. I mean, as you head off, would you say you're more optimi or pessimistic when it comes to public health and the role that it will continue to play in our lives? Well, I am. And generally quite a cautious optimist about  And I hear as another example is I really am cautiously optimi because I believe that the better angels in societ will prevail. We're a good people in this coun And although there's divisivenes I believe we're going to pull ou because if you look at what science has done and with science applied to public health has don it has saved millions of lives in our country. And throughout the world. So I do hope we pull together and realize, as you say, although it's been a rocky road over the last three years, we know what happens when you all pull together, lives get saved, and that's what we're all about. And that is the necessary collaborative work between scien and public health. It's great to have you. Thank you, Dr. Fauci. Thank you for having me. Good to be with you."

Biden Announces New Covid Vaccine Incentives, Mandates For Federal Workers",2021-07-29,626926,3759,11659,UCeY0bbntWzzVIaj2z3QigXg," TODAY. I’M LAYING OUT ADDITIONAL STEPS. WE SHOULD BE TAKING DELIVERIES. LIFESAVING VACCINES TO MORE AMERICANS AND FIRST. WE’RE GOING TO PROVIDE MORE INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE UNVACCINATED AMERICANS TO GET VACCINATED. THAT STARTS WITH PAID LEAVE TO GET THE SHOT. WE’RE STILL HEARING THAT PEOPLE ARE UNABLE TO GET TIME OFF FROM THEIR EMPLOYER TO GET VACCINATED. WELL, THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. FOR SOME TIME NOW. I’VE SAID SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THE SHOT AND STILL GET PAID THANKS TO THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS FULLY REIMBURSED SEEN ANY SMALL OR MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESS THAT PROVIDES WORKERS AND PAID TIME OFF TO GET VACCINATED. EMPLOYERS. THIS COSTS YOU NOTHING. TO HAVE AND GIVE EMPLOYEES PAID TIME OFF, DO IT NOW. PLEASE. TODAY. I’M ANNOUNCING WE’RE TAKING THIS A STEP FURTHER. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE THOSE EMPLOYERS. TO GIVE THEIR STAFF TO GIVE STAFF TIME OFF. NOT ONLY GET THEMSELVES VACCINATED ALSO TO GET THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS VACCINATED. THAT MEANS EMPLOYERS CAN GET REIMBURSED IF THEY GIVE PARENTS TIME OFF WITH PAID TIME PAID LEAVE TO TAKE THEIR KIDS OR THEIR OWN PARENTS TO GET VACCINATED. SOME CALLING ALL EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO GIVE PAID TIME OFF TO GET THE SHOT. AND HELP A FAMILY MEMBER DO SO. I PROMISE YOU WILL COST YOU THE EMPLOYER. NOTHING. TO BE REIMBURSED. I’M ANNOUNCING THAT WILL CONTINUE THE WORK WAS WORK WITH STATES TO ENCOURAGE UNVACCINATED PEOPLE TO GET VACCINATED. IN FEBRUARY. THE GROCERY STORE CHAIN KROGER’S. OFFERED $100. TO THEIR ASSOCIATES IF THEY TO THEIR ASSOCIATES IF THEY GET VACCINATED. AND IT VACCINATION RATES MOVE UP FROM 50% TO 50% TO 75%. MUNGER EMPLOYEES. STATES LIKE NEW MEXICO. OHIO AND COLORADO ARE OFFERING SIMILAR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND HELP INCREASE VACCINATION RATES. SO TODAY I’M CALLING ON ALL STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO USE FUNDING THEY HAVE RECEIVED, INCLUDING FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN TO GIVE $100 TO ANYONE WHO GETS FULLY VACCINATE. I KNOW THE PAIN PEOPLE GET VACCINATED MIGHT SOUND UNFAIR TO FOLKS WHO HAVE GOTTEN VACCINATED ALREADY. HERE’S THE DEAL. IF INCENTIVES HELP US BEAT THIS VIRUS. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD USE THEM. WE ALL BENEFIT. GET MORE PEOPLE VACCINATED. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE VACCINATION. IT IS TIME TO IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS AND KEY GROUPS TO MAKE SURE THEY’RE VACCINATED. JUST THIS WEEK WE TOOK AN IMPORTANT STEP TO PROTECT OUR VETERANS. LIKE MANY CIVILIAN HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ARE DOING THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. WELL, NOW REQUIRE COVID-19 VACCINES FOR DOCTORS AND NURSES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE WORKERS WHO PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE FOR WE MUST DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO PROTECT OUR VETERANS FROM GETTING COVID AND THEY COME TO GET MEDICAL CARE. THEY SO RICHLY EARNED SERVING THEIR COUNTRY. WE OWN THEM. NEXT. SINCE MANY VACCINATIONS REQUIRED FOR ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY TODAY. I’M ASKING IS FRESH DEPARTMENT TO LOOK INTO HOW AND WHEN THEY WILL ADD COVID-19 TO THE LIST OF VACCINATIONS, ARMED FORCES MUST GET. OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM. WHO PROTECT THIS COUNTRY GREAT THREATS SHOULD BE PROTECTED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FROM GETTING COVID-19. I THINK THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OUR TROOPS ARE IN PLACE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. MANY WHERE VACCINATION RATES ARE LOW AND DISEASE IS PREVALENT. EVERY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE WILL BE ASKED TO TEST TO THEIR VACCINATION STATUS. ANYONE WHO DOES NOT A TEST. OR IS NOT VACCINATED WILL REQUIRE. MASK NO MATTER WHERE THEY WORK. TEST ONE OR 2 TIMES A WEEK TO SEE IF THEY’VE OF COURSE, ACQUIRED COVID. SOCIALLY DISTANCE. AND GENERALLY WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL FOR WORK. LIKEWISE TODAY. RECKON MY ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE STEPS TO APPLY SIMILAR STANDARDS TO ALL FEDERAL CONTRACTORS. IF YOU WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HERE WORKERS VACCINATED. BECAUSE THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. REPRESENTING 10’S OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN BUSINESS, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION MANUFACTURERS. THE BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE WHICH COMPRISES OF THE LARGEST THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS AND AMERICA. FOR ALL OF SAUDI THE ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TAKING AN URGE YOU TO THEM TO FOLLOW SUIT. I ALSO COMMEND THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE AS AN IF THERE ARE OUTBREAKS AMONG UNVACCINATED PLAYERS AND PERSONNEL. THEN THE TEAM RISK FORFEITING GAMES. ARCIA SPORT AT EVERY LEVEL. TO TAKE EVERY STEP THEY CAN. EVERY DAY MORE BUSINESS START IMPLEMENTING THEIR OWN VACCINE MANDATES. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS MADE IT CLEAR. THAT IS LEGAL TO REQUIRE COVID-19 VACCINES. WELL, ON OUR LIVE TO GET BACK TO NORMAL. AND FULLY VACCINATE WORKPLACES WILL WE’LL MAKE THAT HAPPEN MORE QUICKLY AND"

250,YFlc2q4775E,Argentina health minister resigns over COVID vaccine scandal,"Argentine President Alberto Fernandez has sworn in a new health minister, Carla Vizzotti, as he grapples with a scandal over COVID-19 vaccines.
The now-disgraced former minister, Gines Gonzalez Garcia is accused of allowing people with connections to jump the queue and receive vaccinations out of turn.
A similar scandal erupted in Peru a few days earlier, and both governments are scrambling to regain their people’s trust.

#GMB #PiersMorgan #SusannaReid #AskGMB #AskDrH",2020-12-02,73120,481,2,UCq18eeL7D9Vd8DhjMcLh9QQ, in a covid19 vaccine from pfizer bioentech has been approved by the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency for use in the uk which paves the way for mass vaccinations or huge news this vaccine news is going to make everyone feel better jonathan swain is at the nightingale hospital in east london um well it sounds like we're the first to approve it jonathan it does this has just come through in the last few minutes uh susana hasn't it and it's a fantastic news for us the uk regulator has now approved use for the pfizer vaccination as we speak we understand within eight hours or so the vaccination some 40 million doses of it are now going to be transported to various sites around the country including here the nhs nightingale hospital it may not have been used to treat many patients but from now on we understand it could be used to vaccinate thousands of people so they have granted uh the use for the fisa vaccination they have said that it has after months of trials and tests that it has met strict safety standards that's important and there's a lot of sort of concern out there and it will be transported to around 10 sites around the country we understand from sports stadia to sports centers to race courses in leicestershire for example the military are also working behind the scenes to create these vaccination hubs and that means from as early as next week next week we could see nhs staff being vaccinated care home workers and the residents also receiving this vaccination along with the over 80s so breaking news this morning and i think it is the news that after months of lockdowns and worry and concern that we've all been waiting for uh let's just go to dr hillary for a reaction hillary this is huge it is absolutely vast it's the first approval to we've seen in europe so this could be rolled out as early as next week with the military and the nhs and voluntary vaccinators starting to give this jab this job is effective it's safe it's been well trialled and to get approval for emergency use this quickly has been a magnificent effort and hillary to those who say well how can it be safe given how fast it's come to the to the marketplace what do you say sorry say that again to those who doubt whether it could be safe what do you say because it's so it's so swift well it's swift because they they have done things at the same time usually what they do is phase one two three trials and then they then they they look at the data then the approval takes a while uh and then production but they've done it all at the same time which is good they haven't cut corners in doing this they've just moved swiftly and when you think of some of the incompetence that we've seen this year it is really good to see that some things can be done if you give it to the the researchers and scientists who know what they're doing and who i trust at least then i think uh we should give them a huge pat on the back i'll take you we're the first in europe i'll take it as soon as you know what i would take this live on air suzanna and i talked about this but earlier we would take it live on air on monday morning if we're allowed to honestly yep i would just encourage other people to do it this this is the vaccine that has to be stored at minus 17 minus 80 degrees so there are logistical problems which is why you need the military that's why you need the big sites to get a lot of people to those sites all in one go because you can't waste any of this vaccine once you've opened the canister at that temperature you have to use it so there will be logistical problems but we can overcome those if we can do this we can overcome those dr hillary this is the vaccine which is 95 effective isn't it i mean i mean and that's more effective than many other common vaccines for other conditions absolutely it's it's more effective than the flu vaccination it's more effective than than many other vaccinations that we use in the routine schedule so it's really good news what we don't know is how long the immunity is conferred for so we need to look at that and it doesn't mean there's there can now be a free-for-all now that we've got a vaccine we need to carefully vaccinate as many people as possible going forward high priority groups first and then everybody else and then see how long it lasts because you know we could we're still going to be living with covert 19 for some time no room for complacency and dr hillary does this vaccine i don't know if you if you know if you have this detail to hand but does this vaccine stop you getting covered does it stop you transmitting covid or does it stop you getting it badly if you get it what we do know is it stops you getting it severely if you should get it what we don't know is whether it stops you getting it at all the likelihood is that it does because it will hopefully confer immunity through both killer t cells which is cellular immunity and antibodies which circulate in the blood so if it's doing both of those things it should stop you even if you're exposed to it developing the disease passing it on to others but it also should stop you from getting severe well a huge moment also healthy care workers around the world actually who've been seeing their colleagues lose their lives in the battle for this they will be some of the first people to have the vaccine you

The Daily Show with Trevor Noah airs weeknights at 11/10c on Comedy Central.",2021-04-27,1763691,48169,5623,UCwWhs_6x42TyRM4Wstoq8HA, the coronavirus pandemic you know the reason we're all saying this feels so amazing when we have lunch with two friends so let's check in on the latest developments in another episode of keeping up with corona as of now 95 million americans are fully vaccinated against covert which i don't care what anybody says is amazing americans are getting their shots almost as fast as americans are getting shots but the bad news is america might be running out of people who are interested in saving their own life there are growing signs that the nation's vaccination program is losing some steam nationwide the average rate of vaccinations is down roughly 20 percent in the last two weeks some states are starting to actually turn down shipments of the vaccine because they have more supply than demand in arkansas 17 counties are cutting back a number of mass vaccination sites in texas are closing and more than half of the counties in kansas have turned down vaccine shipments because they'll go unused all of this comes amid new reports that more than 5 million americans or about eight percent who got the first shot of either pfizer or moderna vaccine missed getting the second shot okay i i mean this is just weird to me people you're seriously gonna wait this long for a vaccine take half the doses and then just bail getting half the vaccine isn't good enough i mean it's the same reason that trojan discontinued their crop top line of condoms it just doesn't work as well and please don't get me wrong i don't like the framing where it's like oh this is doom and gloom eight percent no 92 percent of the people getting their second dose on time that's still really impressive but the bigger problem is that demand for the vaccine in america overall is falling i mean just a few weeks ago we were all scrambling for appointments refresh refresh refresh now you can pick up moderna shots in the two-for-one bin at walmart and i don't know maybe the problem is that people like things that are new and now the vaccine doesn't feel new anymore maybe what we need is a rebrand start calling it the vaccine pro s change the color then people will be lining up around the block so america finds itself now having so much vaccine supply that it doesn't know what to do with it and this is a really unique situation when you look at the rest of the world because many countries have barely any vaccines at all and for them the pandemic is worse than ever before and no place is in worse shape right now than india tonight what officials in india call a tsunami of coronavirus cases is fast becoming a global catastrophe for the third day in a row the country's shattering world records more than 345 000 cases reported in the last 24 hours nearly one million in the last three days alone an aggressive mutant variant no match for the country's underfunded medical system hospitals are turning patients away for lack of oxygen medicine and beds while india's official death toll at under 200 000 is still only one-third that of the u.s indian funeral workers say the true number of casualties is far higher the black market is now thriving to give you some idea a tank of oxygen was about eighty dollars before the pandemic they're now going for more than a thousand dollars yeah people things are really dire in india right now countless people are dying the hospital system is collapsing and oxygen is going for a thousand dollars on the black markets that is so much money like i'm surprised people aren't out there mugging scuba divers and the really sad part about this crisis is that it could have been avoided if india's government hadn't taken their eye off the ball only two months ago it looked like india had avoided the worst the government-relaxed rules even allowed a huge hindu festival just a few weeks ago in recent months even as cases rose prime minister narendra modi hosted huge political rallies flouted social distancing and allowed mass gatherings thousands of people have been taking to twitter with trending like resign modi super spreader modi and the reason is because prime minister modi's ruling political party has been holding rallies the government of narendra modi has contacted twitter to censor some of the tweets that have been highly critical of his government's mishandling of this second wave and interestingly twitter complied uh removing some of these tweets okay you know things are getting bad when a leader's response to criticism of his failures is to try and shut down the criticism not the failures we've got to stop the spread of these mean tweets about me honestly you know who must be so jealous of modi right now donald trump yeah cause modi's got it on luck he got twitter to censor his enemies he's out here holding huge rallies in the middle of a pandemic and he's even got the skin tone that trump has been trying to get for years and look maybe modi thought there were good reasons to let crowds gather indoors but i'll say it again the virus does not care why you're gathering it's still coming to get you but look regardless of how it got there india is in a really really bad place right now and it needs help from the rest of the world before things get even worse thankfully the united states has stepped up to grudgingly answer the call tonight a global response to the covid crisis ravaging india as the u.s pledges immediate medical aid including drug treatments rapid diagnostic cova-19 testing kits ventilators ppe oxygen supplies and ingredients for producing vaccines the united states is partially lifting a ban on exports of the materials needed to make coronavirus vaccines in india the move is an abrupt policy change for the biden administration which had previously denied the request to allow the ex-sports claiming their focus was on vaccinating americans the united states first answer when this was discussed last week was well america comes first that's what we heard from the state department the united states first and foremost uh is engaged in an ambitious and effective and so far successful effort uh to vaccinate uh the american people okay yeah this is good look i'm glad to see america sending something to the rest of the world that doesn't have the name of the wrong super bowl winner printed on it but i still feel like america could be doing a lot more i mean just today just today america announced that it would start sharing its massive stockpile of millions of doses of the astrazeneca vaccine which by the way america has been sitting on for months even though it doesn't need it doesn't need it but just has it so america is basically treating these vaccines like it was the old can of pumpkin puree in the back of the cabinets i mean you knew you were never going to use it but you still held onto it way longer than you should because maybe just maybe one day someone would be like i'm dying i need pumpkin puree got some in the back of my cabinets and and don't get me wrong i know that a country's priority has to be looking after its own people but don't forget that it makes america safer when corona is under control in the rest of the world because the more corona has time to run wild we've seen the more opportunity it has to mutate and become more deadly and trust me if a bad mutation emerges it's gonna come to america corona spreads through respiratory droplets and when have you ever met someone who took a trip to india and didn't shut up about it so look we need to remember that until everyone is immune the job is always going to be only half done you know it's kind of like only getting your first shot it helps but the job's not complete so america really needs to start helping the rest of the world now or it can start saving up for those thousand dollar tanks of oxygen you

had hit a low point. A biochemist at the
University of Pennsylvania, she'd devoted her entire
career to turning mRNA, one of the most important
building blocks of life, into a whole new field of medicine. But it just wasn't happening. Everybody argued that RNA is so transient and degrades and it will never be medicine. I knew that it can be used for everything and, you know, kind of a Cassandra feeling that I can see the future and nobody believes me. Karikó's grant applications were rejected. She was demoted, endured a cancer scare, but she stuck with it. She spent weekends and holidays doing research and experiments. And in 2005, Karikó and
her colleague Drew Weissman published a breakthrough study confirming the therapeutic use of mRNA, research which would underpin the success of mRNA Covid vaccines today. When the first Covid-19
vaccine was approved, I was extremely excited. I thought it was a
changed moment for mRNA. What we've been seeing
in animals was real, and it works in people. And that's the most important thing. mRNA has gone from a rejected idea to a powerful weapon
helping to end the pandemic. And applications of this technology could provide a cure for
diseases beyond Covid. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is a genetic material that copies instructions from our DNA. Our cells use these
instructions to make proteins, which carry out different functions in the human body. mRNAs are responsible for
everything our body does, from breathing air to eating food, to walking, to sleeping, to thinking. Covid vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are based
on this mRNA mechanism. Unlike traditional vaccines using dead or weakened viruses, mRNA vaccines use the genetic information of the virus. Scientists make an mRNA that
codes for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus
that caused Covid-19. Then the mRNA is put
inside a lipid coating and injected into the human body. The cell reads the mRNA and starts to make harmless
spike proteins of its own, which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies against the virus. The way that mRNA vaccines work is similar to really all vaccines. What they're doing is they're presenting a protein or proteins from a pathogen, and they're causing our bodies to make an immune response against those proteins or protein. When you make an
inactivated virus vaccine, you have to isolate the virus. You have to grow it up in eggs. You have to figure out
how to grow it in eggs. You have to purify it and activate it, and formulate it. With mRNA, you only need the sequence. You don't need the virus. So it's a very simple vaccine to make. This means that making mRNA vaccines is faster than making traditional ones. But the journey for mRNA to
break into mainstream medicine has been long and challenging. mRNA was first discovered in 1961. But it wasn't until 1984
that scientists were able to recreate it in the lab. In the 1990s, as scientists knew more about the make-up of human DNA, gene therapy became popular, inserting a gene into a patient's cells to treat or prevent disease. But most researchers gave little thought to using mRNA as a vaccine or a drug, despite its close relationship with DNA. I argued that the messenger RNA is more like a conventional drug. You can apply, and then if you see a beneficial effect, you can reapply, and
then the healing is done, rather than a gene therapy where you are delivering the gene and you cannot control. But many rejected Karikó's idea, arguing mRNA therapies
didn't look feasible. The immune system is hypervigilant against foreign RNA entering the body, and so the injected lab-made
RNA caused inflammation which destroyed it before it could start to trigger an immune response. And even worse, that inflammation could be life-threatening. In 1997, Karikó met Drew Weissman, a respected immunologist and they started to collaborate. The big discovery was we figured out by modifying the nucleoside. So RNA has four letters that code for a protein. Each letter is a nucleoside or a base. We modified those bases and that reduced and got
rid of the inflammation. When we altered uridine
and we had a pseudouridine, we found that not only we have
an RNA which is non-immunogenic, but we had a very high
level of protein production. The amount of protein made from the RNA increases about a thousand fold. You get rid of inflammation and you increase potency in the same step. So it was like a dream come true. They published the key research and filed a patent,
which was later licensed to Moderna and BioNTech, the companies making mRNA
Covid vaccines today. Karikó also started to
work for BioNTech in 2013. But there was another hurdle- how to deliver mRNA to targeted cells. mRNA is notoriously fragile, and enzymes in the human
body can break it down. So you really need to have it protected from the enzymes and other
kinds of things in the body. You could call them the
bad guy, so to speak. And if you don't, then the
therapy won't work at all, it would be non-existent. As early as the 1970s, chemical engineer Robert Langer and his colleague Judah Folkman proved that it's possible to deliver molecules like RNA inside tiny particles
without destroying them. The nanoparticles Langer
used were made of polymers, not lipids as used in
today's mRNA Covid vaccines. So we were trying to put DNA and RNA into tiny particles and deliver them. I failed the first 200
times when I did it. And by the way, that was
also widely criticized. So I got my first nine grants turned down. I couldn't get a job,
you know, a faculty job at the chemical engineering department, which was my area. But today Langer is a renowned scientist with over 900 issued patents. In 2010, he co-founded Moderna and still sits on its board. After decades of development, the main biological
roadblocks were cleared, but mRNA technology had never been used outside of clinical trials until recently. In the last few minutes we've heard the first coronavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the UK. This is being manufactured by the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer and its partner BioNTech. And here is the first person in line to get it. In the following months, mRNA vaccines from both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were cleared in multiple countries. Taking less than a year from
the lab into people's arms, these are the fastest vaccines that have ever been developed, both with a 95% efficacy rate. But some people are concerned that these vaccines are hastily made. The speed of making the vaccine, the 10 months that it took. There's very good reasons that people need to
understand why that happened. It was an emergency. It was a pandemic. All of the clinical trials
were done at the same time. All of the testing was done together. No corners were cut. There were no safety
issues that were ignored. Everything was done exactly the same as every other vaccine. In December 2020, Karikó and Weissman were
given the Covid vaccines they had contributed to. People were waiting for
the healthcare workers in line there to get their vaccines. And, you know, they clapped. And then I cried. About 3.2 billion doses
of mRNA Covid vaccines are expected to be given in 2021. And now mRNA may also
be used to help fight future pandemics and diseases that current medicines struggle to treat. The mRNA is just an instruction for the cell to make the protein. We can target the messenger
RNA to certain organs, certain cell types, bone marrow, and then can perform
different kind of treatment. There are many different applications for messenger RNA. I mean, you know, at Moderna, they're working on heart disease, they're working on
personalized cancer vaccines. They're working on rare diseases. I think the next big act for RNA are probably gonna be more vaccines. Last summer, we started working on a pan-coronavirus vaccine. So there've been three
coronavirus epidemics and pandemics in the past 20 years. You have to assume there's gonna be more. Can we make a vaccine that prevents against all of those bat coronaviruses that have the potential to infect people and start another epidemic or pandemic? I think that the pan-influenza
and pan-coronavirus are gonna be the most
exciting RNA vaccines to come out in the future. mRNA has been proven now
as a really impressive and powerful new technology, and the application of
mRNA goes, of course, very straight approaches
to develop mRNA vaccines against other infectious diseases. And we are already doing that. We have started that early on for developing
influenza-based mRNA vaccines. We are developing mRNA vaccines against tuberculosis, against HIV. BioNTech has also been studying the technology in cancer for two decades and has a cancer vaccine in
Phase II clinical trials. They are hoping the cancer field might see its first messenger RNA drug approvals in two or three years. There's no guarantee that
other mRNA vaccines and drugs will succeed like they have with COVID-19, but Karikó remains
undaunted by the challenge. That's the most important thing, to accomplish something and, meanwhile, to be happy. As long as I was in the lab, I had fun. It is just such a joy. Even if things didn't work out how I expected."
259,emuTXyu_ei8,Meet the Black female scientist on the forefront of COVID-19 vaccine development,"Along with manufacturing and distribution issues, public health officials are concerned about millions of Americans who are resistant to taking the coronavirus vaccine. To address this, some of those officials are shining a light not just on the science behind the shots, but on the scientists who helped bring the vaccines to fruition. Michelle Miller has the story.",2021-01-09,87610,1137,947,UC-SJ6nODDmufqBzPBwCvYvQ, [Music] according to the centers for disease control and prevention more than six and a half million americans have now received their first dose of the vaccine against the coronavirus it's a number that will be growing every day though it's well behind what public health experts had been hoping to see along with manufacturing and distribution issues public health officials are concerned about millions of americans who are resistant to taking the vaccine to address that some of those officials are shining a light not just on the science behind the shots but on the scientists who help bring the vaccines to fruition when the president paid a visit to the national institutes of health last march the leads at the vaccine research center explain their life-saving mission why shake proteins that will bind the key to it a 34 year old doctor named kismikia corbett i was just there telling the task force about the work that we've been doing two weeks later dr corbett's team began the first stage of clinical trials we have taken a lot of the knowledge that we have gained over the last six years and applied it to a fairly revolutionary vaccine platform in collaboration with moderna that vaccine rolled out within 10 months the vaccine teaches the body how to fend off a virus because it teaches the body how to look for the virus by basically just showing the body the spike protein of the virus the body then says oh we've seen this protein before let's go fight against it that's how it works for a lot of people seeing you as the person who is part of this process there's there's a trust factor to be honest i didn't realize the level of impact that my visibility might have i do my work because i love my work dr corbett's interest in science began at an early age but one opportunity made a key difference she attended the university of maryland baltimore county as a meyerhoff scholar an aggressive program that mentors minorities and women in science graduates include surgeon general jerome adams was she someone who's going to make it all along she was definitely going to make it in life dr freeman rabowski has been president there for nearly 30 years she had strong science background but she also was very comfortable with people we need more scientists who can connect to people she could do that when she was 17 easily what we do at umbc is to support students of color black but also students in general to make sure they make it in science only 18 percent of all students graduate with a stem degree according to the national center for education statistics around 2 percent are black it's important for those people to see people looking like them like themselves who can be involved if it's about women or it's about blacks because it shows that you've got people who understand what you've gone through dr corbett and i have worked together for maybe 15 or 16 years since she was in high school dr barney grahams not only corbett's mentor he's her boss when you recognize somebody has special qualities you need to do things that can keep those other things out of the way and and avoid some of the dismissiveness that often happens not only to minority people but to women and historically that bias strikes not just professionals in the field but those that they serve let's talk about the impediments to the trust i grew up in birmingham all of my life i was hearing about the tuskegee study the federally sanctioned tuskegee experiment sought to examine the long-term effects of civilis by letting infected black men go untreated with no regard to the suffering it caused how do you feel about being used as a guinea pig well i thought once it was pretty rough another example the special cells of baltimore cancer patient henrietta lacks were taken without her explicit permission and were subsequently used in billions of dollars worth of medical research without compensation there are many other examples of supposedly objective scientists who were caring about everyone who valued people of color less it's a painful truth and this is what's significant when i say cozmica corbett is from a small town in north carolina a young woman of faith who understands the socio-cultural issues that we face who knows what racism means she gets all of that what's your message to people who are hesitant to take this vaccine number one is that i get it number two is that to really take advantage of the level of transparency that we are attempting even i haven't even seen before such as fda hearings and briefings being broadcast online and data coming out almost instantly and to try and address them and in one of those webinars fully dr anthony fauci gave her a ton of credit the vaccine that you're going to be taking was developed by an african-american woman and that is just a fact i mean that is a fact a fact offering illumination to those often left in the dark she cannot be a hidden figure she cannot be a hidden figure she needs to be in textbooks little girls need to see her of all races this is what's possible she's not a hidden figure now yeah no she's not and it's just it is a testament to the work of dr rabowski and others like dr graham her boss who pushed and also moved out barriers in her way so she could have that opportunity yeah yeah and look at all of us benefiting now from it i was gonna say the only way you can undo all those years of damage is to start right now and start moving those to the side put her in the forefront and try to change minds and there are others out there just like her of all races great you want to give them all a big round of applause okay good stuff michelle

264,PgLmrprP9KI,Why should my child get the COVID vaccine? | American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP),The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that everyone get the COVID vaccine as soon as they are eligible. That goes for children ages 5 and older too!,2021-11-02,73398,21,65,UClR8YIQX5Fb8J2wmsUKLhvQ, hands down the covid19 vaccine is the best way to protect children and teens from covid19 including the delta variant the american academy of pediatrics recommends everyone get the vaccine as soon as they are eligible and that goes for children age five and older too while most children with covid19 don't get seriously ill many kids have become very very sick from cobit 19. low risk is not no risk the vaccine is very effective and can help kids get back to doing all of the things they enjoy

the covid19 pandemic more than 20 vaccines are in development globally but as scientists move closer to success possible breakthrough in the development of a coronavirus vaccine there's a problem a growing number of people say they won't take a vaccine i don't want to inject anything like this into my body this is linked to declining trust in scientific experts and political leaders [Music] problems brought into even sharper focus by the pandemic and fueled by a spiraling emphademic anybody who has trusted the president has been lied to and many people like my dad have paid with their life this crisis of trust could have catastrophic consequences so what can be done to rebuild trust in vaccines and to protect the world from future disasters all vaccine advocates need to be more tech savvy we have science and evidence and right and fact on our side [Music] [Music] [Applause] this is the front line in the race to find a covid19 vaccine professor jonathan heaney is one of those leading the charge it has very much been a race against time and sometimes i wish time could stand still the professor has been developing vaccines for over 25 years now we have representatives of those viruses that are closely related to sars1 or sars2 but finding one to fight a virus which has brought the world to its knees feels different i do know people who've had kovid and it's a terrible terrible death it is an agonizing disease this project in cambridge is about to begin clinical human trials and the stakes could not be higher if we don't have a vaccine we'll be stuck in this lifestyle of isolation social distancing masks for a long long time [Music] for a vaccine to immunize populations effectively against covid19 around 70 percent of people need to be willing to take it trust is absolutely critical if only part of the population is on board we're never going to bring this virus to its knees and control this epidemic [Music] but in the rich world especially polls suggest that persuading people to take vaccines may be as difficult as producing them in the first place [Applause] many of these protesters belong to a growing minority who believe a covert 19 vaccine would actually be harmful to their health do i worry about vaccinations this one in particular yes definitely it's been rushed and imposed on us and i you know i want to have my choice and i don't want to inject anything like this into my body and into my children's body some here see a vaccine as part of a wider government conspiracy to exaggerate the dangers of covid19 many of these people have lost trust in their government and we will not give up until we get the truth we are not going to stand for being lied to by our governments by people that we should trust they want us to trust us but we can't trust them the views being expressed here are extreme and belong to a minority the proportion of the global population opposed to vaccines generally is estimated to be well under 10 percent but anti-vaxxers as they're often called are a vocal minority and their views are increasingly influencing broader society distrust can be infectious a poll carried out in america in september found that only 36 of adults said they would take a vaccine when one becomes available with 64 saying they wouldn't take one or weren't sure [Music] in another survey under four-fifths of people in 16 countries responded positively to the idea of taking a covid19 vaccine if proven safe and effective in the context of covid i think empathy is absolutely crucial professor heidi larson is an anthropologist and a leading expert on why significant sections of the global population feel hesitant about vaccines she says a failure to confront the root causes of vaccine hesitancy as she calls it is driving more of these people towards anti-vaccination views the majority of the public that is questioning their hesitant they're anxious these are people who have genuine questions who are open to vaccination but are feeling they're not getting their answers and then migrate more to the more anti-end that seem more acknowledging their concerns endorsing their concerns professor larson argues that one of the historic problems has been a failure by the medical establishment to listen to the concerns of parents who have doubts about inoculating their children a lot of parents feel like they're being judged called names for even asking questions and that's not at all been helpful in trying to support people in their decision making and positive sentiments towards a vaccine it's really fundamentally about trust relational trust breaking news testing has been paused for one of the leading candidates developed by oxford university in september a volunteer from a leading covid19 vaccine trial was admitted to hospital and the project was temporarily halted professor larson says an opportunity was missed to build trust with the public i wish in the news instead of just this is normal process safety events happen we're taking care of it that the voice of a participant said i appreciate the care and the attention that the clinical team gave to me during this uncertain time the message is sent that there is a caring team that they're not just putting vaccines in people to count numbers and get to the perfect vaccine that there is human empathy in this the medical and pharmaceutical professions have been far from immune to missteps during the history of vaccines and this has helped fuel today's climate of vaccine hesitancy and opposition not least the legacy of a british doctor named andrew wakefield in 1998 he published research in a highly respected medical journal claiming there was a link between a measles vaccine and autism wakefield and colleagues altered facts about patients in their studies but his research turned out to be highly compromised studies have shown no connection between the mmr vaccination and autism the journal eventually retracted the research and wakefield was struck off the medical register in the uk in 2010 but many members of the public continue to see wakefield as a credible expert this guy has been set up it's nothing but lies and millions across the world still have reservations about taking the measles vaccine it's symptomatic of a wider decline in trust in traditional experts and governments in rich world countries [Music] [Music] dr jonathan kennedy is an expert in global public health and has investigated the link between trust and government and authorities and hesitancy about vaccines in this class we're going to talk about the question of how to think critically about global health dr kennedy analyzed voting data and surveys on public confidence in vaccines across 14 countries he found a broad pattern where levels of electoral support for populist parties were higher levels of mistrust in vaccines also tended to be higher populist sentiment this distrust of elites and experts isn't just isn't just isolated in politics the forces driving scientific populism are all very similar to those that drive political populism [Applause] dr kennedy argues there's a strong relationship between vaccine hesitancy and political social and economic crisis at a time when trust between people and politicians has been breaking down a number of countries have seen a resurgence of measles how dare you yes you racist it certainly wasn't a coincidence that the uk last summer lost its measles-free status how about that at a time where there was massive conflict over brexit during the covid19 pandemic the response of governments has further decreased trust in public health experts and politicians not least in some countries with populist leaders the test and trace isn't improved significantly it could be a second wave in britain under prime minister boris johnson's leadership public health guidance has changed constantly and confusingly we're constantly working to improve that delivery system buying ppe from around the world creating a sense that the government is failing and incompetent in a huge policy reversal affecting hundreds of thousands of pupils what's more senior political figures have failed to follow their own health guidelines trust in the british government is a reliable source of information about coronavirus fell from 67 in april to 44 in august don't let it dominate you don't be afraid of it in america false information about the virus has flowed from a president whose contempt for truth has done more than anything else to sow distrust in politicians and experts one month ago today president trump said that the coronavirus was quote dying out i've read a lot about hydroxy i happen to think that it has an impact and then i see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute researchers at cornell university analyzed 38 million english language articles about the pandemic they found president trump was the single largest driver of misinformation around kovid 19. this is me and my mom and my dad in new york after i graduated from college for some this has had lethal consequences in june christine urquisa lost her father mark to covet 19. 65 year old mark was a lifelong republican voter and trump supporter from arizona he died after arizona's governor reopened the state encouraged by the president when the governor and the president went um around pushing a reopening strategy and saying to the public it was safe if you didn't have an underlying health condition it was safe to go out resume normal activities my dad listened and thought it was safe mark contracted kovid 19 after visiting a karaoke bar his daughter says placing trust in his political leaders proved a fatal mistake both the president and the governor of arizona are on record through that time downplaying the virus anybody who has trusted the president has been lied to has been misled and many people like my dad have paid with their life as a result while the actions of populist politicians have undermined trust in public health advice and institutions there is another factor which has driven this trend the unprecedented speed at which misinformation can spread in february the world health organization warned of twin dangers a global pandemic but also an infodemic a crisis in accurate public health information these insufferable globalist elitists like bill gates he tells us we need a nationwide shutdown for months this foundation is leading the charge to lower the world's population much of this infidemic is concentrated online social media users who may not hold strong views about particular issues can rapidly be exposed to misleading and extremist content folks i think they're trying to force a vaccine on all of us [Music] neil johnson is a professor of physics at george washington university his research shows how fake news can gain the upper hand in the online battle for hearts and minds what we expected to find was that there'd be a core of communities maybe public health agencies that we're promoting vaccines and establishment health thinking and that around this central strong core there'd be other opinions sort of extremes but that's not what we found we found that that was actually sort of inside out professor johnson's team mapped conversations on facebook about vaccines between 100 million people all over the world they discovered that misinformation was exerting more influence than accurate information in some sense it's almost like a network of trust and if they flipped either way of course they could become red they could become blue and that completely changes the battlefield on this battlefield map red represents facebook pages and members with anti-vaccination views and their spread over time blue represents pages and members with pro-vaccination views while green signifies the all-important groups of people who are undecided the undecided greens are more engaged with the red anti-vaccination clusters than the pro-vaccination blues the reds they are completely entangled with the greens they're not shores the communities of pet lovers parents groups organic blueberry lovers the ones that can tip the balance one way or the other the worry is as we see the greens and the reds entangle what we're really seeing is a beginning of an entanglement of trust away from establishment science trust is the glue because in the end when we trust the community if they happen to start talking about vaccines which is something that i don't ordinarily think about i will follow them in their thinking this entanglement matters research has found that online exposure to recent misinformation about a covid19 vaccine may significantly affect intent to take one and professor johnson believes this kind of content will continue to spread online with the result that anti-vaccination sentiment could become the majority view within a few years red with the concerned greens will rise to essentially dominate that space and it'll be very hard to reverse that so something different needs to be done now social media platforms have increased their efforts to stop the spread of untruths about vaccines and kovid 19. in april facebook put warning labels on about 50 million pieces of content related to the virus the platform partnered with reliable sources like the who and the nhs and in october facebook banned anti-vaccine ads yet campaigners argue the platform isn't going far enough and is failing to take down the majority of harmful content about vaccinations more broadly facebook's own algorithm undermines efforts to stem the tide of the infidemic says fadi kuran from the online political campaign group avaz facebook's algorithm is sabotaging the efforts of the platform to fix the misinformation problem it cares about keeping individuals engaged interested and online sensationalist outrageous content not the cdc guidelines but q anon for example gets more engagement and hence the algorithm pushes it up in your news feed one solution might be to detoxify the algorithm what facebook isn't doing is redesigning its algorithm redesigning its business model to ensure that it's not continuing to amplify this content and this does not mean that the algorithm should be designed to censor content it just means that the algorithm would downgrade instead of putting this malicious content at the top of one's news feed the platform would make sure that it is at the bottom of the news feed social media platforms could save lives they have the power this is a problem that mark zuckerberg and jack dorsey could literally say we're going to solve this right now yet redesigning algorithms and tightening regulations on tech companies is unlikely to get to the root causes of mistrust in vaccines to do that health bodies and experts will need to be proactive about building relationships with the public in person and especially online according to doctors at this pediatric practice in pittsburgh the key to tackling distrust and misinformation is to fight fire with fire hello this is a yucky doctor coming in how are you guys doing today i'm doing okay while it might look like any other children's surgery the kids plus practice has its own in-house video production suite getting messages out to patients constantly and quickly vaccine advocates are online using our voices not the same way we are in the office we're saving lives we're protecting them against myth truths and disinformation that can literally kill people i think all vaccine advocates need to be more tech savvy kids plus routinely post evidence-based videos and information about vaccines on all major social media platforms i'll start things off until we see our questions start rolling in again hello to tick-tock hello to facebook live and this presence allows them to respond to questions from parents and families who feel uninformed and concerned our parents our families are living their entire lives right here on their phones on their tablets on their laptops their desktops if people hear good evidence-based information before they hear the miss and disinformation that miss and disinformation is much less likely to affect them what you are essentially doing is inoculating them against that before it can take root in them these doctors also argue that it's vital to take on the stream of highly organized and targeted viral attacks from anti-vaccine forces the reality of online vaccine advocacy right now is if you post it they will come the anti-vaxxers will find you and they will attack you they want to terrorize providers into silence it's a challenge the practice knows all about together we can prevent cancer in your children in 2017 kids plus released a video promoting an hpv vaccine that prevents cancer and faced a barrage of hostility they attacked our post they attacked our facebook page they attacked the private pages of our families and our patients who defended us on our post they came right after our reputation kidsplus has since created a toolkit for health professionals and built a digital cavalry of global vaccine advocates who can quickly come to the aid of those under fire from anti-vaccine forces now as a vaccine for kovid-19 grows closer kids plus and it's self-styled keyboard crusaders are stealing themselves for a bitter but all-important new fight there's no vaccine yet there's no hurt immunity for covid and look this is what life is like without herd immunity this is what life is like without vaccines past evidence suggests some people could end up taking vaccines after saying they might not but herd immunity to covid19 may require around 70 take-up of a vaccine and just a six percentage point decline in acceptance could endanger this goal and for many alarm bells are ringing we're losing in large part because the anti-vaccine forces are much more passionate and organized than we are there are far fewer of them than there are of us we have science and evidence and right and fact on our side that's how we win hello i'm slovaya chankova

266,k_YrHglsKho,Woman accused of selling 250 fake COVID vaccine cards over Instagram,"Fifteen people were charged Tuesday in what the Manhattan District Attorney's office called a fake vaccine card conspiracy.

Among those charged is a woman who allegedly sold 250 fake cards on Instagram, believed to be among the first alleged seller of phony vaccine cards charged in the country.

Officials say 31-year-old Jasmine Clifford sold the forged cards over social media and worked with 27-year-old Nadayza Barkley to fraudulently enter at least 10 people into the New York State Immunization Information System database.

Thirteen people who purchased the cards -- all of whom are believed to work in frontline and essential-employee settings, including hospitals and nursing homes - were also charged.

Moderna enrolled over 30,000 volunteers age 18 and older in its double-blind placebo-controlled study.  11,000 were from communities of color, 7,000 were 65 and older, and 5000 were under 65 with conditions that increased their risk for severe COVID.  Half received the vaccine, and half received a placebo, 15,000 in the placebo group, 15,000 who got the vaccine. Symptomatic COVID was confirmed in 185 people in the placebo and 11 vaccinated groups, making the vaccine 94.1 percent effective. Researchers actively monitored the vaccine recipients for local and systemic side effects for seven days after vaccination, recorded unsolicited side-effects for 28 days, and more severe side effects and medically-attended adverse events from day 1 through 759. 

Summary of The Safety Profile
Like Pfizer, those under 65 experienced more frequent mild to moderate side effects than those over 65. However, the safety profile was similar across age groups, genders, ethnic and racial groups, participants with or without comorbid conditions, and participants with or without evidence of prior COVID infection. These systemic side-effects are unpleasant and are at a higher rate than seen in most vaccines. They are more likely related to the lipid nanoparticles with super tiny amounts of polyethylene glycol in most cases.

Moderna reported no anaphylactic or severe allergic reactions to the vaccine, but a hypersensitivity reaction was reported in 1.5% of vaccine recipients and 1.1% of placebo recipients. The FDA's website has the list of ingredients found in all vaccines and advises that people with a history of severe allergic reactions check the list and discuss the risk of vaccination with their doctor. For example, a Boston doctor had a severe allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine. 

However, he did have a history of having an allergic reaction to shellfish in the past. He was rushed to an emergency room, treated, and released. It was also initially recommended that pregnant women or those who intend to become pregnant in three months should not get the vaccine due to their inclusion in the studies. But the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has recently released a statement supporting vaccination for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers.

Other Reactions
Bell's palsy was observed in three people in the vaccinated group and one in the placebo group. Bell's palsy is a condition that causes temporary weakness or paralysis in the muscles on one side of the face. It is frequently a reaction to a viral infection. A recent study in Italy reported that out of 38 people presenting to a local emergency room for symptoms consistent with Bell's Palsy, 21 percent had COVID. In 2019, at the same emergency room, 22 people were treated for Bell's palsy. Bell's palsy usually resolves on its own within six months. Bell's palsy incidence as a side effect from the vaccine will be tracked compared to Bell's palsy incidence in the unvaccinated population.

Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a neurological disorder that can cause muscle weakness or even paralysis, has not been reported during covid vaccine clinical trials. Therefore, in Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) does not list Guillain-Barré Syndrome's history as a general vaccination precaution.

With the latest guideline, the only people who should not get the vaccine are those known to be allergic to any of its ingredients, which is a cutoff that holds true for every medical product. Ingredients include lipid nanoparticles and polyethylene glycol. Anaphylactic reactions can occur with any vaccine but are usually extremely rare—about one per 1 million doses. As of 19 December, the United States had seen six cases of anaphylaxis among 272,001 people who received the COVID vaccine and 2 recorded cases in the UK. As with everything we do, from driving a car to eating food that may be potentially allergenic, we weigh the risks and benefits that need to be weighed against each other. In this case, the risks and potential consequences of COVID far outweigh the risks from the vaccine.

#modernavaccine #covidvaccine #vaccine",2021-01-05,641392,10263,2211,UCMSsLqxqvZsNXi0Z-VjN89A," is the moderna vaccine safe what are the side 
effects allergic reactions guillain-barre syndrome   bell's palsy let's break it down in this video 
so the moderna they took the genetic code from   the sars coronavirus 2 virus they identify 
the section that codes for the spike protein   the protein that binds to human ace2 receptor 
and they use this mrna sequence for its vaccine   short additional genetic sequences were 
added to both ends to help stabilize   this mrna the mrna strands are encapsulated in 
a lipid nanoparticle what is especially nice   about messenger rna vaccines is that there are 
no weakened killed or gutted viral particles in   the vaccine making it much safer for those who are 
immunocompromised and this vaccine is 95 effective   so like the pfizer bio and tech vaccine 
there are two doses with the moderna vaccine  they're administered on days 1 and day 29 so 
it's a little bit different from pfizer pfizer's   first one and then you get the second one three 
weeks later so very similar once the messenger   rna vaccine is injected human cells that used the 
mrna code to produce a viral spike protein but   not the other 28 proteins required to make a sars 
cov2 virus without the complete genetic code the   sars-kov2 virus can't be manufactured in a human 
being once the viral spike protein is produced the   human immune system recognizes it as foreign then 
there's a series of complicated immune processes   including the production of antibodies that 
are triggered and that's what allows your body   to fight off that virus in the future so in the 
new england journal medicine moderna enrolled   over 30 000 volunteers age 18 and older and 
it's a double-blinded placebo-controlled study   eleven thousand were from communities of 
color seven thousand were 65 and older   and there were 5 000 that were under the age of 
65 but they had conditions that were considered   risk factors for severe covid half the people 
received the vaccine half the people received   placebo so 15 000 and placebo group 15 000 who got 
the vaccine symptomatic covid 19 was confirmed in   185 people in the placebo group and only 11 in 
the vaccinated group so that's a 94.1 percent   efficacy now researchers actively monitored 
the vaccine recipients for local and systemic   side effects for seven days after vaccination and 
they recorded unsolicited side effects for 28 days   and more severe side effects and medically 
attended adverse events from day one all the way   through day 759 which means it's continuing to be 
monitored let's first start off by talking about   the local side effects so injection site reactions 
in the seven days after the first vaccination dose   that occurred in 84 of the vaccinated group and 
that's compared to 20 percent in the placebo after   the second dose 89 of the vaccinated group and 
19 of the unvaccinated group recorded injection   side effects overall the vaccine side effects 
were rated as mild to moderate in severity   and lasted an average of 2.6 and 3.2 days after 
the first and second vaccine doses respectively   the most common local side effect was injection 
site pain that was reported 84 percentage and 88 percentage in the   vaccinated group after the first and second 
vaccine dose respectively injection site pain   was reported by 20 percent and 17 of the placebo 
group after the first and second dose the average   duration of pain was two days after the first 
dose and three days after the second swollen   axillary lymph nodes meaning lymph nodes 
and your armpits they were swollen and 21   of people under the age of 65 and 12 percent of 
people over the age of 65 in the vaccine group   and then it was about five percent in four 
percent of individuals in the placebo group the   median duration of swelling was one day after 
the first dose in two days after the second   other local side effects were uncommon such 
as redness and swelling at the injection site   so what about systemic side effects just like with 
the pfizer vaccine systemic side effects were more   common after the second vaccine with 55 percentage reporting 
a systemic side effect after the first dose   and 79 after the second dose in the vaccine 
group in the placebo group 42 percentage had side effects   that were systemic after the first dose and 37 
after the second dose the most commonly reported   systemic adverse event was fatigue that was at 69 
percent of the vaccine group and 36 of the placebo   and that fatigue lasted for about a couple 
days headache was reported in 63 in the   vaccine group and then 37 at the placebo group 
muscle pain was reported 60 in the vaccine   20 in the placebo group now in the vaccine group 
45 reported joint pain compared to 17 and placebo   then there was other things that occurred less 
frequently but more commonly in the vaccine group   such as chills and fever about half of those 
in the vaccinated group reported systemic side   effects starting at 15 hours after vaccination 
with no long-term side effects systemic reactions   lasting longer than seven days were about 12 
percent in the vaccine that's compared to 10   percent in the placebo so about the same in both 
groups severe adverse reactions defined as those   that prevent normal daily activities that was 
0.2 to 7.7 percent of participants overall   fewer than one percent of vaccine recipients 
reported fever over 102 degrees fahrenheit   severe fatigue was reported in 7.7 of vaccine 
recipients muscle pain and 6.1 joint pain in 3.7   and headache in 4.4 severe adverse reactions 
were more frequently reported after the second   vaccine dose and less commonly in the groups that 
were over 65 years old systemic side effects are   expected as the immune system responds to foreign 
viral proteins so a decrease in reactorgenicity is   expected in older adults as aging brings about 
a gradual deterioration in the immune response   however the immune response or reactogenicity 
of the immune system to the moderna vaccine   it may be more than most people have previously 
experienced with other vaccines so in summary   just like with pfizer those who were younger less 
than the age of 65 they had more frequent mild to   moderate side effects compared to the older groups 
the safety profile was similar across age groups   genders ethnic and racial groups participants with 
or without comorbid conditions and participants   with or without evidence of prior covid infection 
these systemic side effects are unpleasant and   are at a higher rate than seen in most vaccines 
and in most cases they're more likely related   to the lipid nanoparticles that have super tiny 
amounts of polyethylene glycol moderna reported no   anaphylactic or severe allergic reactions to 
the vaccine but a hypersensitivity reaction   was reported in 1.5 percent of vaccine 
recipients and that's compared to 1.1   percent of placebo recipients the fda's website 
has the list of ingredients found in all vaccines   and advises that people with a history of severe 
allergic reactions check the list and discuss the   risk of vaccination with their own doctor so there 
was a boston physician who had a severe allergic   reaction to the moderna vaccine he did have a 
history of having allergic reaction to shellfish   and he was rushed to the emergency 
room he was treated and released   also it was initially recommended that pregnant 
women or those who intend to become pregnant in   three months should not get the vaccine due 
to the lack of their inclusion in the studies   but the american college of obstetricians and 
gynecologists has recently released a statement   supporting vaccination for both 
pregnant and breastfeeding mothers   bell's palsy was observed in three people in the 
vaccinated group and one in the placebo group   bell's palsy is a condition that causes temporary 
weakness or paralysis in the muscles on one side   of the face it's frequently a reaction to a viral 
infection a recent study in italy reported that   out of 38 people presenting to a local er for 
symptoms that were consistent with bell's palsy 21   had covid 19 in 2019 at that same er 22 people 
were treated for bell's palsy bell's palsy usually   resolves on its own within 6 months the incidence 
of bell's palsy as a side effect from the vaccine   will be tracked and compared to the incidence of 
bell's palsy in the unvaccinated population   Guillain beret syndrome which is a neurological disorder 
that can cause muscle weakness or even paralysis   has not been reported during coronavirus vaccine 
clinical trials and in general the advisory   committee on immunization practices does not list 
a history of guillain-barre syndrome as a general   vaccination precaution with the latest guideline 
the only people who should not get the vaccine are   those who are known to be allergic to any of his 
ingredients which is a cut off that holds true for   every single medical product ingredients include 
lipid nanoparticles and polyethylene glycol   anaphylactic reactions can occur with any vaccine 
but are usually extremely rare about one per one   million doses as of december 19th the united 
states has seen six cases of anaphylaxis among   272 000 people who received the covid 19 vaccine 
and there were two recorded cases in the uk as   with everything we do whether it's driving a 
car to eating a food that could potentially be   allergenic we have to weigh the risks versus 
the benefits and when it comes to covid 19   the risks of getting covid 19 and the 
potential consequences that come with that   far outweigh the risks that 
come from the vaccine itself  "

Patrick Bet-David is the founder and CEO of Valuetainment Media. He is the author of the #1 Wall Street Journal Bestseller Your Next Five Moves",2024-01-03,657569,12429,2552,UCIHdDJ0tjn_3j-FS7s_X1kQ, Rob did you see the Seth McFarland debate with Bill Maher on the vaccine did you see that what you think about I I I loved it because well two things a I got to see like I I I I've I've been around Seth M McFarland at at a nightclub drinking Jack Daniels really really really cool guy really really generous but to see that you know they're both obviously liberals for him to to have that point of view and for them to actually Pat have the conversation and it not become no no you're wrong you're wrong and then the conversation stopped at least I got to how long how long is the longest one Rob can you see what do you have right there 641 what's the one above it they're all 641 except for this 30 second clip play the 32nd one see what it is let's see what the 32nd one is uh go ahead play this clip here and but tell me what we disagree on when you do real time and we'll try to make that that the topic because I'd love to uh as I I think I mean look I I think we disagree on the fact that I think that the public health infrastructure despite being being absolutely inadequate prior to co did as good a job as they could have done no during Co and it pisses me the [ __ ] off when I see people [ __ ] on them when I see I see it must because you like like steered it all the way back to that again like but tell me what that is pretty wild to say that they did a good job during Co even though it was inadequate pre-co do you think he's getting P does he have to say that you think or he genuinely in his heart feels that cuz this is said McFarland guy is this is a professional actor he's in that Community he is he's in that space what do you think Tom you look you had to look like I not not I'm not say why don't you do this but Rob why don't you go play the six minute clip but just don't play the whole six minutes and just play the first like minut go and play this clip and maybe fast forward a little bit go ahead but then why are doctors wrong about so much about a lot too and yes and but very often people who aren't doctors have been writer about things um like like like what would be an example of that I would think uh this country did not allow for um uh natural immunity to be considered and I know this is a subject dear to your heart even if you had the disease you still had to get a vaccine that's powerful stupid they don't do that in Europe I think they do that here there's mandatory vaccination in grade in school right but if you already but if you already had the disease you have natural immunity we didn't see didn't to believe in that that was debunked though I mean that was that don't you know people who' had Co four or five times I do that's not natural immunity there's no immunity there you've had Co five times watch what he says probably because you had too many vaccines I didn't have Co did you did the vaccine gave you co uh well that's certainly there nothing unscientific about the fact that the vaccine which does weaken you in order to strengthen you says do all vaccines exactly yeah but while you're in a weakened State yes that's why why so many people like me got it did not have it I I thought it was a great exchange but but the point is here's a point okay Vinnie two years ago that conversation is not being had absolutely I'm telling you right now two three years ago that conversation is not that would have been Tak taken down off the internet right but but the fact that this conversation is being had gradually we are being forced to go this way you know why here's how this works think about the longest time you held a grudge with somebody how long was it okay I don't we're not give a names might still be going okay but but think think about the longest and by the way let me kind of bring you close I'm talking family I'm talking blood I'm not talking like a friend a friend okay I'm talk maybe even best friend what is the longest grudge you ever had like years give me a timeline 10 years go honestly Rob two years and it was my best friend from seventh grade up until three or four years ago where we started arguing about the covid vaccine I didn't take it my my employer mandated it I said no I lost my job employ Tim and maor take no not this employ freaking let me talk to these guys my previous employer I worked in radio they they mandated it I said no my best friend worked for Live Nation at the time he took it we had several arguments I tried to explain to him why I didn't think it was necessary for me to take it we didn't talk for two and a half years until he finally came back and said hey I'm sorry about that you were right and I was wrong best friend can he said that to you yes again best friend for 20 years holy [ __ ] you guys better now yeah best friends shout out to your best friend for acknowledging that he should have been better the longest you've gone with a grudge family or a best friend not friend couple okay what's yours Tom it's probably family about five years uh Vinnie Vinnie still holding on but when it comes to friends and stuff and this past 20123 I called the two people that I was not even talking to and I initiated that hey whatever it was I'm sorry I forgot about it one never got back to me the other one just two days ago hit me now let's categorize grudges okay let's categorize grudges one Grudge is what hardcore betrayal that's permanent forever set that aside right let's set that aside we're not we're not going to talk about well why don't you go and apologize to them no bro that's betrayal okay that is gone all right let's put the other Grudge as what you're offended cool all right let's put that over here let's put the one in Middle disrespected and did something that was a real stupid thing that one or the other person did and they apologize right how long can we go with a grudge two years two and a half years three I don't know it ain't 50 years okay so what's the point here dude America's so sick and tired of holding grudges against the other side they want to sit down and say dude I don't hate you as much as you think I do yeah you and I had different things with vaccine why do we let the mainstream media make me think you're a horrible person why do we think the mainstream media make me think that you're an idiot for not taking a vaccine you know what bro I effed up yeah effed up too all right cool you want to have a drink here let's smoke a joint and that's what bill marah is doing here right I don't know if America can go for too long holding a grudge I don't think it's a natural thing that we have in our bodies some of us again what's betrayal you can't like you know a snake uh I saw something the other day a snake betrays you and then they shed and then they may look a little bit better but they're still a snake they're still going to betray you if you keep you know forgiving a snake in your life you're the [ __ ] okay that guy's DNA is to betray you consistently over and over and over again but for everybody else you know in this community that guy's a Democrat so guess where Seth lives in he lives in Hollywood what does Hollywood look like a Hollywood is him they're invited to the same parties they're on the Tablo they're on all the magazines they're being talked about you're in that space the managers the ca the WME the all that stuff he is in that Community what do you expect him what do you think the people around him believe the same exact thing he believes in what is Bill [ __ ] he's sitting there debating conversations challenging all this other stuff the fact that we're having these conversations as crazy as this sounds we are getting closer to each other this doesn't mean we're going to be 100% over it it just means we're making progress this is a very good sign when you see these two guys talking to one another I know I agree but but when it comes to the like the powers that be though the one that he's talking about that's the the science the fouches the president saying it's a winter of death it's a war and unvaccinated that's a grudge p i don't give up not your friend though remember I said family or friend that's not a friend that is a divider I have a list of people whom I watched how well they divide oh my God I got a list of I can you know in who who's one of the top ones I'm talking in my personal life business there's a few guys and I I studied their playbook I'm like wow you are so good and I called them out one time and I said to his face I said hey you know this is what you do you know that right you do I watch you to divide people said you do and it's like you know no no you think no man I've seen you do it to this guy to that guy to this guy to that guy to You're So Proud with you you're so good at what you do so with that guy that's not a friend that's not a grudge

272,tN88uI2e9Tw,Which Covid vaccine is the best? | Vaccine Effectiveness and Variants Explained,"Which Covid vaccine is the best? Which Covid vaccine is the most effective? How do we measure vaccine effectiveness? Do Covid vaccines work against new variants? Is it possible that Covid vaccines may make things worse in the future?

I answer all of these questions in this video. First, we compare the seven vaccines that have published phase 3 trial data as of June 2021. Those include Pfizer, Moderna, Sputnik, Johnson & Johnson, Sinopharm, and AstraZeneca. I look at the phase 3 trial data published in peer-reviewed journals.

I compare the vaccine effectiveness between each vaccine. I also look at the differences in the phase III studies and see that the SARS-CoV-2 variants probably explain the differences in the vaccines. Each vaccine becomes less effective against variants that have more mutations, especially mutations on the spike protein, such as the E484K mutation, which can cause immune escape. Important mutations discussed include the South African variant, B.1.351, the Brazil variant, P.1, the UK variant, B.1.1.7, and the Indian variant, B.1.167.

Finally, I explain why this matters. Countries, such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia, that have not yet had widespread Covid outbreaks may not be able to effectively use vaccines to prevent future outbreaks, as the current vaccines have substantially reduced effectiveness against the variants in those countries. I also explore the possibility that vaccines may initiate antibody-dependent enhancement, or ADE, which may make future infections worse for some people.

vaccines in use around the world everyone wants to know which covid vaccine works the best today i'm going to take a hard look at the scientific evidence and give you an answer broadly i will address three questions how do we measure the effectiveness of a vaccine how much do virus mutations reduce vaccine effectiveness and what can go wrong in the future in the end you'll have the information you need to make an informed decision and you'll find the secret behind why some vaccines are more effective than others if you're new to this channel this is all things public health where we take an evidence-based approach to answer important public health questions by reviewing the scientific literature let me know in the comments below what topics you want to know more about so let's get started [Music] vaccine effectiveness rates are commonly quoted in the media but where do these numbers come from vaccine effectiveness is measured in what's called a phase 3 trial in a phase 3 trial participants enroll in the study and are given either a placebo or the vaccine the participants don't know which one they got and they go about their regular lives normally a phase three vaccine trial has tens of thousands of participants over time some of these people will get sick with covet 19. if more people in the placebo group got sick than the vaccinated group the vaccine is considered effective how big the ratio is between the groups determines the effectiveness of the vaccine what's really important though is that these studies need to be published in peer-reviewed journals once published everyone can look at the details of the study such as the number of participants their age sex where the study was performed and what time period was covered this information is really critical to interpreting the results and putting the findings into context and importantly this nuanced information cannot be communicated by a pharmaceutical company's press release we've seen several cases where a pharmaceutical company notably astrazeneca has announced effectiveness numbers and later had to walk back those comments as of june 1st 2021 only seven vaccines have published phase three trial data in a period viewed journal those are pfizer moderna sputnik johnson and johnson and two from cynopharm astrazeneca is the seventh but that study is really an outlier the astrazeneca study included a lot of irregularities where they deviated from the protocol mixed and matched several dosing strategies and used a sample size that is substantially smaller than the other phase 3 studies so i'm including astrazeneca in this list but there is a lot of uncertainty there the other thing we have to do is define what we mean when we say effective effective against what most commonly effectiveness is defined as a vaccine's ability to prevent symptomatic and laboratory confirmed infection each study might measure this in a slightly different way depending on what they define as symptoms whether or not they actively test and how long after the full vaccination they wait also there are other measures of effectiveness such as preventing hospitalizations and this is why having the published study data is so important it allows you to see all of this for this video i'll be defining effectiveness as how well a vaccine can prevent symptomatic covet 19 any time after 7 to 14 days following the completion of full vaccination [Music] here's the really interesting part i pulled together all the phase 3 trial studies and when you do that you start to see an interesting trend but before i get to that if you're enjoying what you see be sure to hit that like button according to the results published in phase 3 studies the most effective vaccine at preventing symptomatic covet infections was pfizer which was 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic illness the bars here show the confidence interval meaning the true measure of effectiveness likely fell somewhere between 90 and 97 for pfizer a close second was moderna at 94 percent then there's sputnik at 91 the two cyano farm vaccines come in at fourth and fifth at 78 and 72 percent effectiveness and sixth is johnson and johnson at 66.5 percent and in last is astrazeneca with an effectiveness in its december 8th publication of 62 with a wide range of uncertainty which was due to their small sample size let's put this in tabular form you can see astrazeneca's small sample size here the sample in their phase three trial paper was less than nine thousand while all other vaccines used data from twenty thousand to forty thousand participants another really interesting thing to note is the differences between the study sites each of these studies took place in different countries and at different times using different populations meaning different age groups or occupations one of the things that stands out to me is that the johnson and johnson vaccine which had the lowest effectiveness also included many countries notably brazil and south africa that have seen a widespread outbreak of variants that include key mutations such as e-484-k which has been shown to allow the virus to escape existing immunity on the other hand moderna and pfizer studies were carried out mostly or entirely in the u.s where these variants were not prevalent when we dig deeper we see that the circumstances of the studies may better explain the effectiveness results rather than any real differences in how well the vaccines work when we compare the vaccine studies there are two key factors that are different time and place why is this important well the types of virus variants that were circulating in the population at that time were different depending on the time and place remember that each vaccine was designed and built based on the original wuhan variant in the more than one year of time since the work on these vaccines began several key mutations have proliferated some of these mutations such as the e484k mutation have demonstrated the ability to help the virus escape existing immunity this e484k mutation is found in the so-called south african variant or b1351 as well as the so-called brazilian variant or p1 recent studies have confirmed that vaccines are less effective against these variants these studies were able to do this by directly comparing the effectiveness of vaccines against specific variants one of the most studied vaccines is the one from pfizer we'll look at two of these studies this study from england found that pfizer's vaccine was 93 effective against the uk variant or b117 but was only 88 effective against the indian variant or b1 167 a second study from qatar compared the uk variant to the south african variant or b1 351 again they found a similar trend pfizer was 89 effective against the uk variant but only 75 effective against the south african variant compare that to the 94 effectiveness reported in the phase 3 trials so we have to ask what form of the virus was present in the us during the time of that phase 3 trial if we look at genetic sequencing data from that time in the u.s we see that the clades were 20 a b c and g all of these variants are very similar and can be classified as the d614g variety with pretty meaningless differences between them what we see is a clear trend of reduced vaccine effectiveness the more the virus has mutated from the original wuhan form we also know that individuals have been reinfected and gotten sick with covid19 a second time after recovering from a natural infection as a result of being exposed to a new variant all of this together points to the natural conclusion that as the virus changes the immune system has more difficulty in identifying and neutralizing it so if this is true we would expect that the later the vaccine studies occurred the less effective a vaccine was and in fact when we look at the timing of each study we see this trend here's the time period during which each vaccine was studied plotted next to each other the earlier the study was completed the higher the efficacy also the more that the study population included locations where variants of concern were circulating early in places like brazil and south africa again we see lower vaccine effectiveness remember that these variants were only becoming widespread in late 2020 this graph shows the global prevalence of the e484k mutation the proportion of cases with this mutation grew to 10 or 15 percent globally by december 2020 and january 2021 only the johnson and johnson study covers that time period this mutation was also primarily in south america and southern africa at that time locations where j j was collecting data all the other studies used data from times and locations where variants with key mutations were not circulating what this means is that the differences in the reported effectiveness between vaccines is probably more a reflection in the differences in the form of the virus it's protecting against rather than real differences in how well the vaccine works [Music] so we see that vaccines are becoming less and less effective as the virus has opportunities to mutate why does this matter there are three key conclusions first not all effectiveness data is directly comparable just because pfizer and moderna had the highest reported effectiveness in their phase 3 trials doesn't mean they're the best vaccines the high effectiveness of these two vaccines is probably more a reflection of their fortunate situation that they were studied in the u.s prior to the introduction of any variants that contained immune escape mutations what we see is that over time vaccine effectiveness has declined as a result of the virus changing in fact many pharmaceutical companies have abandoned phase 3 trials in countries like south africa or decided to not include data from certain countries in their analyses because the results were not good second until updated vaccines are developed vaccines are becoming an increasingly less effective tool especially for countries where widespread outbreaks have yet to occur southeast asian countries like thailand vietnam and malaysia are a good example currently these countries are hoping that if they can administer enough vaccines they will not go through the same situation that europe and countries in the americas experienced but because such a small proportion of the population in these countries have actually been exposed to the sars cove2 virus and developed natural immunity and because the vaccines are less effective against the strains currently spreading it means that if you want to build up herd immunity and slow down virus transmission with vaccines you need to immunize a huge proportion of the population for an example of how this strategy can fail look no further than the seychelles the seychelles kept itself isolated from the virus for most of 2020 and then began rapidly vaccinating its population early in 2021 by may this island archipelago was the most vaccinated country on the planet with around 70 percent of the population fully vaccinated yet despite that it saw such a large outbreak of covid it had to shut down schools and restaurants epidemiological modeling results explain why they showed that if vaccine effectiveness drops from 90 percent to even 60 or 70 percent it would require nearly 100 of the population to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity in short these countries that are last in line to receive vaccines are now stuck using a vaccine that is built for a form of the virus that no longer exists third there is the possibility that continuing to vaccinate against the original form of the virus may cause increased harm to some individuals the reason is called antibody dependent enhancement or ade when a pathogen enters the body the immune system will develop antibodies against that pathogen within a few days an antibody that can prevent entry to a cell is called a neutralizing antibody vaccines usually induce the creation of these neutralizing antibodies however if an antibody is similar enough to the invading virus to bind to it but not able to neutralize it these antibodies actually help the virus infiltrate cells and replicate faster historically some vaccines have been abandoned because they caused ade including the recent dengue vaccine disaster ade is the same reason why getting infected with a second strain of dengue virus greatly increases your chances of severe hemorrhagic fever the possibility that coveted vaccines could cause ade was raised already in september 2020. the mechanisms of ade have been observed in prior coronaviruses sars and mers going forward as sars cove2 continues to mutate it may eventually reach the point of becoming a new strain if that occurs and existing vaccines can only induce non-neutralizing antibodies it is possible that ade will occur resulting in more severe illnesses rather than less putting it all together we see that virus mutations may soon be outrunning the ability of vaccines to protect the population with that in mind many countries may have to rethink their strategy for vaccination and covet in general thanks for watching and be sure to check out some of these other videos

#Vaccine #Coronavirus #NBCNews",2021-05-24,90880,396,1592,UCeY0bbntWzzVIaj2z3QigXg, a 100 savings bond in west virginia a 10 000 scholarship in lancaster california free beer in new jersey donuts from krispy kreme shake shack fries in new york city just think of this when you think of vaccination and a drink in connecticut in a push to encourage americans to get their vaccine governments and businesses across the country are thinking outside the box recently ohio governor mike dewine capturing much national attention for ohio residents who get their shots the state is offering something in return a shot at winning one million dollars and the winner each wednesday will receive one million dollars and so far state officials say the lottery has been a huge success this has been very successful this past friday was our highest vaccine administration day in three weeks we were experiencing a 24 decrease week over week for those prior to fridays last friday that age group saw a six percent increase since dewine's announcement several governors following suit to encourage residents to get the vaccine maryland governor larry hogan also announcing a lottery with one grand winner to take home 40 thousand dollars you guys weren't expecting that one were you and new york governor andrew cuomo announcing a 5 million grand prize as well these types of incentives might just be the extra boost necessary for a country that rests on the brink of returning to a new normal according to dr david ash a professor of medicine at the university of pennsylvania some rewards might work better than others what i like about the system in ohio is that it it trades on emotion it's very exciting and i think harnessing that kind of excitement towards this important social purpose is a really good idea he says a transactional incentive like giving a direct monetary payment for getting the vaccine might potentially backfire in creating a payment for something you're saying well why do i need to get paid maybe this could this could elevate concerns that people already have i'm not sure that's true for some of the other kinds of incentives like ohio's sweepstakes based incentive but just largely focused on you know getting a big prize perks are of course only one of many reasons why people hesitant of getting a vaccine may ultimately decide to do so a study conducted by the de beaumont foundation interviewing a group of people on the fence shows a desire to return to normal with their family and loved ones often marks the tipping point honestly rather than there being a moment that i learned something it was more like as time went on the balance of you know things that i wanted and that i wanted for my daughter and i want to travel and i want to get back to normalcy those things sort of started to tip the scale and while vaccine hesitancy is certainly one huge challenge equitable access to vaccines remains a stark barrier for many for example 37 of potentially undocumented hispanic adults report they want a vaccine as soon as possible but have yet to receive one many cited concerns such as the risk of having to miss work from side effects or the distance to the nearest vaccine site as to why they were unable to access the vaccine with about 40 percent of american adults still yet to get their first dose expanding access to vaccines and convincing those on the edges of getting one will be a critical task over the months to come [Music] hey nbc news viewers thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down here and click on any of the videos over here to watch the latest interviews show highlights and digital exclusives thanks for watching

THE REQUIREMENT GOES INTO  EFFECT DECEMBER 8 FOR ALL  FEDERAL WORKERS.  HOWEVER, MANY STATES LIKE TEXAS  AND FLORIDA CLAIMANT IS A MAJOR  OVERREACH.  GREG ABBOTT EXPANDED AN  EXECUTIVE ORDER LOCKING THE  REQUIREMENT FOR ANY ENTITY  INCLUDING HEALTHCARE FACILITIES  AND PRIVATE BUSINESSES.  MEANWHILE, RON DESANTIS HAS  CALLED FOR A SPECIAL  LEGISLATIVE SESSION TO ADDRESS  THE CONTROVERSY.   JOINED ME TO BREAK IT ALL DOWN  IS OUR CBS NEWS LEGAL  CONTRIBUTOR.  TEXAS AND FLORIDA ARE AMONG THE  HANDFUL OF STATES SUING THE  BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OVER THE  MANDATE.  CAN YOU DESCRIBE A LITTLE MORE  ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY THESE LOSSES  ARE ALLEGING?  >> ABSOLUTELY.   THE LAWSUITS ARE ALLENG THE  VACCINE MANDATE VIOLATES THE  CONSTITUTION IN SEVERAL  DIFFERENT PROVISIONS, AND ALSO  A NUMBER OF LAWS.   ESSENTIALLY, WHAT THE LAWSUITS  SAY IS LOW, THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT IS NOT LIKE THE  STATE GOVERNMENT.  IT IS A GOVERNMENT OF LIMITED  CAPACITY.  IT HAS CERTAIN SPECIFIC JOBS.  EVERYTHING ELSE UNDER THE 10th  AMENDMENT IS RESERVED FOR THE  STATE.   IT DOESN'T HAVE THE STATE POWER  THAT HE CAN DO WHATEVER IT  WANTS.  WHAT THESE LAWSUITS ALLEGE IN  LARGE PART IS THE GOVERNMENT IS  AN ACTING ACCORDING TO ONE OF  THOSE SPECIFIED RESPONSIBILITIES AND IS ACTING OUTSIDE OF THEM.   CONGRESS HAS NOT GIVEN THE  PRESIDENT'S AUTHORITY.   THAT IS THE ALLEGATION IN A  NUTSHELL.  THERE ARE LIMITED PROVISIONS  THAT THE STATES ARE SAYING THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS VIOLATED  BY ISSUING THESE MANDATES.  >> TO THE LAST POINT ABOUT  NEEDING CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL,  IS THAT TRUE?  IS THAT NOT WITHIN THE  BOUNDARIES OF THE EXECUTIVE  OFFICE?  >> AS OFTEN HAPPENS THEIR  ARGUMENTS ON ALL SIDES.  IT'S NOT LIKE THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION ACTED WITHOUT  JUSTIFICATION.  IT HAS ITS OWN ARGUMENTS FOR  WHY THIS IS LEGAL.  IT IS ACTING UNDER SOMETHING  CALLED A PROCUREMENT ACT, THIS  LAW THAT SAYS THE GOVERNMENT  HAS TO ENGAGE IN PROCUREMENT.  IT HAS TO GET THINGS, GIVE  THINGS, SELL AND BUY THINGS AND  IT NEEDS THESE CONTRACTORS TO  DO IT.  THE PRESIDENT AND DIFFERENT  AGENCIES CAN DO THINGS  NECESSARY TO MAKE THAT PROCESS  EFFICIENT.   UNDER THE LAW THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID WE NEED  TO HAVE OUR CONTRACTORS  VACCINATED.  OTHERWISE, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE  PEOPLE CALLING OUT SICK, THINGS  SHUTTING DN, QUARANTINE, AND  ALL OF THOSE THINGS WILL LEAD  TO THIS MASSIVE INEFFICIENCY.  THEREFORE WE ARE GOING TO ISSUE  THESE MANDATES.   THAT IS THE RATIONALE.  THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT  YOU BUY IT.  THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER OR  NOT THE COURTS BY IT.  THAT IS THE ARGUMENT THAT THE  LAWSUITS ARE MAKING THAT THESE  MANDATES ARE ILLEGAL UNDER THE  LAW.  THEY ARE SAYING IT IS JUST NOT  WHAT THE LAW SAID OR MEANT.   IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY UP A LOT  IT IS NOT WHAT IT ALLOWS.  I DO THINK THAT THEIR ARGUMENTS  ON BOTH SIDES.  THUS FAR THESE CHALLENGES TO  VACCINE MANDATES HAVE LARGELY  FAILED. THERE HAVE BEEN A  NUMBER OF CHALLENGES  SPECIFICALLY FOR INSTANCE TO  COLLEGES REQUIRING STUDENTS TO  BE VACCINATED BEFORE THEY COME  BACK.  THOSE HAVE MOSTLY NOT SUCCEEDED  IN THE COURTS.  THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH THESE  CHALLENGES ARE DIFFERENT AND  ONE IS THIS IS THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT AND NOT THE STATE  GOVERNMENT.  SECOND IS THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT IS A GOVERNMENT OF  LIMITED CAPACITY.  THERE ARE ONLY SPECIFIC THINGS  THAT THE CONSTITUTION ALLOWS  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO.  THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT  CHALLENGS AND WE WILL SEE WHAT  THE COURTS AND UP SAYING.  >> IN TERMS OF THE FLORIDA  LAWSUIT, AND YOU MAY HAVE COVER  THIS IN YOUR RESPONSE, THE  TEXANS LAWSUIT HAS A DEAL WITH  CONGRESS NOT GIVING THE  EXECUTIVE OFFICE THE AUTHORITY  TO DO THIS, FLORIDA'S LAWSUIT  ARGUES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO  INSTITUTE SWEEPING VACCINE  MANDATES IN GENERAL.  THERE ARE ARGUMENTS ON BOTH  SIDES.  WHAT ARE THARGUMENTS ON BOTH  SIDES?  >> AGAIN, I THINK THE PERSON  YOU'RE POINTING OUT IS POINTING  TO THE FACT THAT WHEN WE TALK  ABOUT STATE POLICE POWER, WHICH  IS ESSENTIALLY THE POWER THAT  THE STATE HAS INTERFERE WITH  LIBERTY IN ORDER TO PROTECT  SAFETY, THAT IS LARGELY  SOMETHING THAT THE STATES HAVE  AND NOT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.  THAT IS AN OVERGENERALIZATION  BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN WAYS  IN WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  CAN DO THINGS THAT OVERLAP WITH  THE STATE POWER.  IN SOME WAYS IT MAY LOOK LIKE  STATE POLICE POWER.   BASICALLY THAT IS SOMETHING  THAT IS THE JOB OF THE STATE.  WHAT THESE LAWSUITS ARE SAYING  IS YOU ARE TRYING TO HIDE THIS  UNDER THE GUISE OF CERTAIN  THINGS LIKE YOUR SPENDING POWER  AND THE COMMERCE CLAUSE.  YOU ARE TRYING TO PRETEND THIS  THING IN THE PROCUREMENT ACT.   REALLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS  ESSENTIALLY SOMETHING THAT IS  THE RESPONSIBILITY OF  INDIVIDUAL STATES.   YOU ARE STEPPING ON OUR TOES.  AGAIN, I THINK THAT FOR THE  MOST PART THE WAY IN WHICH IT  WAS CRAFTED IT MAY SURVIVE  JUDICIAL REVIEW.  THESE ARE SPECIFIC ARGUMENTS  THAT HAVE NOT BEEN MADE AND ARE  A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THESE  OTHER CHALLENGES.  TO ME THERE IS NO SWEEPING  VACCINE MANDATES ARE OR ARE NOT  ALLOWED.  IT IS ALL VERY CONTEXTUAL.  THAT IS WHY THE SPECIFICS ARE  REALLY IMPORTANT AND WILL  DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE  COURSE WILL BUY IT OR NOT.  THAT IS WHY THESE LAWSUITS ARE  CRAFTED THE WAY THAT THEY ARE.  THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE CONTEXT  AND EXACTLY WHAT THESE MANDATES  ARE REQUIRED AND JUSTIFIED.  >> IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THIS IS  AN ARGUMENT AND FIND THAT  REALLY HAS TO HAPPEN IN EACH  INDIVIDUAL STATE AND THAT IT  REALLY HAS TO DO WITH THE  RESIDENTS OF THAT STATE AND  THEIR FEELING ABOUT THEIR OWN  GOVERNMENT.  THE RESIDENTS IN FLORIDA WILL  HAVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR  NOT AC RON DESANTIS AND HIS  ADMINISTRATION HAS THEIR HEALTH  IN ITS BEST INTEREST OR NOT.  IT KIND OF SOUNDS TO ME LIKE  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ON  SHAKY GROUND.  >> YES AND NO.  THERE ARE THESE TECHNICAL AND  LEGAL QUESTIONS.   IF THE FEDERAL MANDATE IS  LAWFUL AND IF THE COURT  DETERMINES IT WE HAVE THIS  THING CALLED THE SUPREMACY  CLAUSE.  THE FEDERAL LAW IS LAW OF TH LAND.  IF IT CONFLICTS THE FEDERAL LAW  WILL TRUMP.  I MEAN, YOU'RE RIGHT IN CERTAIN  WAYS.  IS THE COURTS ARE TO LOOK AT  THIS AND SAY THIS IS WRAPPED UP  AS A FEDERAL ISSUE, IT IS MADE  TO LOOK LIKE IT FITS UNDER THE  FEDERAL POWER, IT REALLY DOESN'T . IF THE COURSE BY THE ARGUMENT  IT GETS KICKED BACK TO THE  STATE AND THE STATE RESIDENTS  TO CHOOSE HOW THEY WANT TO  TREAT THE PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, IF THE COURTS SAY THIS  IS WITHIN THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT'S POWER, THEN STATES  ARE OUT OF LUCK.  WE SAW THIS BATTLE BETWEEN THE  STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN  VARIOUS WAYS IN THE LAST  ADMINISTRATION.  THE MORE POLARIZED OUR COUNTRY  GETS THE MORE RED STATES ARE  GOING TO EJECT TO A DEMOCRATIC  PRESIDENT AND HIS AGENDA AND  VICE VERSA.   YOU SEE THESE THINGS PLAYING  OUT IN COURT AND THE COURTS ARE  NOT LOOKING AT THE POLITICAL  ISSUE, THEY ARE LOOKING AT  THESE VERY SPECIFIC LEGAL  ISSUES TO DETERMINE IF THIS IS  SOMETHING THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT GETS TO DECIDE.  OR HAS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  OVERSTEPPED ITS BOUNDS UNDER  THE CONSTITUTION IN WHICH CASE  IT IS KICKED BACK TO THE STATES  FOR STATE CITIZENS TO DECIDE  HOW THEY WANT TO TREAT THE  PROBLEM.  >> IT IS REALLY INTERESTING.  THANK YOU VERY MUC"
277,GE8XM0TXAJI,Moderna: Covid vaccine shows nearly 95% protection - BBC News,"A new vaccine that protects against Covid-19 is nearly 95% effective, early data from US company Moderna shows.

The results come hot on the heels of similar results from Pfizer, and add to growing confidence that vaccines can help end the pandemic.

Both companies used a highly innovative and experimental approach to designing their vaccines.

Moderna says it is a ""great day"" and they plan to apply for approval to use the vaccine in the next few weeks.

However, this is still early data and key questions remain unanswered.

effective at preventing covid19 and doesn't need to be stored at such low temperatures the trial is ongoing and the u.s firm modena plans to apply to regulators in the coming weeks to get approval for emergency use of the jab the results come after similar results from pfizer and add to growing confidence that vaccines can help end this pandemic so let's take a closer look because interim results for this phase 3 trial show that the vaccine is 94.5 percent effective at stopping symptomatic infections it can be transported at a standard freezer temperature of around minus 20 degrees celsius which could be a significant benefit over pfizer's vaccine which needs to be stored at minus 70. the vaccine requires two doses four weeks apart the united states has pre-ordered stocks of this vaccine and modena expects to have 20 million doses available for the us by the end of the year and it plans to make 500 million to 1 billion doses available for use around the world in 2021. while the company's president dr stephen hodge spoke to our medical editor fergus walsh obviously we're thrilled it's been a long year for many of us and at our company it's been a long hard slog to get to the point where we now have clear evidence of efficacy of the vaccine to prevent 19 disease there was a moment of of pretty intense relief it's been a long hard stride as i said but that quickly passed after about a minute it became a realization that now that we know the vaccine works we have to get busy uh to work manufacturing and distributing it but um clearly an important milestone and a great milestone for us as a company and hopefully for us more generally as we fight this pandemic well let's talk now to dr maria sundaram who's an infectious disease expert for the institute for clinical evaluation sciences in toronto and joins me live here on the program how excited are you by this development extraordinarily so this is really great news just in terms of what we've discovered a week after the pfizer results were were revealed is that a coincidence or or is there some form of data sharing how is it that we're getting these results in quick succession it's possible that uh the sort of timeline at which we're getting these results is uh purely coincidental i think uh you know we're getting them as soon as they can come out and uh it happened that pfizer and moderna both were able to sort of report those results on similar timelines but great news for us a great couple of weeks i think and which bit makes you most optimistic is it that statistics of 94.5 effectiveness is it the fact that storage temperature is only -20 what is it that most excites you the mo the thing that most excites me is a combination of the 95 94.5 effectiveness uh estimate and the fact that they were able to observe so many coca-19 cases uh normally when we do a trial we want to see a certain number of people having the outcome that we're trying to prevent just so that we know that the treatment is truly effective and not just uh you know due to random chance so the number of cases that uh were seen in the modern trial that are being reported in these interim results are promising that this 94.5 effectiveness estimate is really very much a true representation of what we can expect to see in a broader group of people so i find that very hard being very reassuring both both last week and this week we're still waiting for the safety analysis what do you think is the likely time frame on that i hope it's quite soon um i know that a lot of people myself included are really very very interested in the safety results i think the preliminary results uh from moderna are very promising um they're they're similar safety profile to other vaccines that we might be familiar with like flu vaccine so you might experience some pain at the injection site you might feel junky for maybe a day but uh not something uh quite so severe uh it's like a prolonged fever anything like that so also very very good news increasingly is the focus now do you think uh turning to manufacturing to distribution to fairness all those sorts of absolutely fundamental questions yes absolutely um what i like to say and i hope this will be relevant for your viewers as well as an american i like to say this is just one inning in the baseball game so uh you know we needed a vaccine and uh once we have a vaccine we're going to need to be able to deliver that vaccine so every vaccine that remains in the vial and not in people's arms is zero percent effective uh so now absolutely you're right we need to focus on exactly how we're going to manufacture all the other components that come with vaccines the needles the syringes the boxes that they're packaged in and they need to be delivered fairly and equitably as well as quickly well doctor thank you so much for joining us just as a quick post script to what we were talking about there interesting because the company have been obviously giving that to information about distribution and temperatures and just a line from the head of vaccines for the u.s operation warp speed program saying mordona's vaccine will be easy to distribute particularly to rural areas because it can be stored for one month at standard refrigerator temperatures so they too at the head of the vaccines at the u.s operation warp speed program encouraged by what they've heard from the company there in america we'll have plenty more on that story throughout the course of our program
278,z3QI_0461_4,UK approves Pfizer Covid vaccine: Your questions answered - BBC News,"The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for mass vaccination.

The first doses of the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, are already on their way to the UK.

So why is the UK the first to approve it, and how will the vaccine be rolled out? We answer your questions.

Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog",2020-12-02,37861,396,735,UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA, we've had lots of questions about what today's approval of the fisa biotech vaccine actually means our health correspondent anna collinson is here to answer some of them straight off with raymond why is the uk the first to approve the vaccine yeah well russia and china have approved a vaccine of their own but the uk is the first to approve the pfizer and bayern tech vaccine and it's down to the speed of the uk's regulator the mhra which started its work in january has been working around the clock since then pouring through thousands of pages of data trying to see if the jab meets the efficacy and safety standards now the ema the body which regulates uh the vaccine for the eu has questioned the speed that this has happened but the head of the mhra said this morning that no corners have been cut okay david asks why are those who are classes extremely vulnerable and over 65 so low on the list yeah so this refers to the vaccine priority list which has been drawn up by the joint committee on vaccinations and immunizations and they see age as the biggest risk factor so what they want is the older age groups to be right at the front of the queue when it comes to getting the vaccine due to logistical issues however the vaccine needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees it's likely the very first people to actually get the vaccine will be those in hospital patients workers care home staff and those classified in the extremely vulnerable and over 65 group they are still in phase one so they are likely they're going to be some of the first people to get the vaccine probably early 2021 but if they are concerned you can also get the flu jab if you haven't already okay bill asks if you've had covered 19 already will you be getting the vaccine yeah so the eventual aim is for everyone to get the covert 19 vaccine regardless if you've had the virus before or not the reason is we don't yet know if the vaccine stops you catching and spreading the virus or does it just stop you from getting ill so more work needs to be done on that and this morning the health secretary matt hancock who previously had covert said he would be signing up for the vaccine when it was his turn okay now terry asks is the vaccine going to be compulsory and what are the potential side effects it's a really good question no vaccines in the uk are compulsory and it's the same for covert 19. the reason being experts say making it compulsory can really damage confidence but the prime minister boris johnson is urging people to take up the vaccine particularly those in the most at risk groups as for side effects data from the fisa trials say they're mostly very mild of course no medication is a hundred percent risk free if millions are immunized we're going to see potential side effects appearing but the hope is that they're going to be monitored very closely and patients will report any problems they have along the way anna thank you very much anna constance
279,NcyGWMP7z3c,EMT COVID-19 Vaccination MIEMSS Training,,2021-02-08,195533,1006,130,UCYBFrepuFH0ontCCYzVx5zA, hello and welcome to the emt covid19 vaccination training module i'm dr tim chismar state ems medical director at mems we have developed this training module to provide a pathway for maryland dmts to administer the covid19 vaccine under certain conditions in this training module we will cover the following objectives to help prepare you for success we'll discuss requirements for emts to administer the covet-19 vaccine we'll review the intramuscular medication procedure at the deltoid site we will review signs and symptoms of acute allergic reaction and anaphylaxis and finally we'll discuss common side effects of the covid19 vaccines in order to administer the covin-19 vaccine an emt must meet all the following requirements the emt must have completed the mems didactic vaccination training emt must have physically demonstrated intramuscular injection skill competency with approval from the msop and medical director and finally a physician nurse practitioner physician assistant nurse or paramedic must directly supervise the emt in administering the vaccine there's a maximum of three emts to one supervisor the vaccines will be prepared and drawn into a syringe for administration the emt will be provided with a syringe that has already been attached to a needle which is capped the emt will then verify the seven rights of vaccine administration use aseptic technique when administering the vaccine safely administer the vaccine into the deltoid muscle by the intramuscular route and ensure that the patient receives information on common side effects and signs of allergic reaction each patient should receive a fact sheet or vaccine information sheet that discusses this in detail we will briefly discuss the currently available vaccines new vaccines may be approved in the near future both the pfizer and modern vaccines have been approved under emergency use authorization both vaccines work by engaging the body's immune system in a similar way thus giving the body an ability to create antibodies against a protein on the outside of the virus both require thawing and preparation prior to administration this will be done by the health department or hospital staff we will not discuss the details of this process importantly neither vaccine contains live virus although the vaccines both work through similar mechanism there are some subtle differences it is good to be aware of these differences but not required to commit this information to memory as you can see the pfizer vaccine is approved for ages 16 and older it is given as two doses three weeks apart and the injection is 0.3 mls per injection modern vaccine is approved for patients 18 years of age or older again given us two doses however four weeks apart and each injection is slightly larger at 0.5 mls again additional vaccines may be approved over time let's briefly discuss the contraindications or who should not receive the vaccine anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of this vaccine should not receive a second dose and anyone who has a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in the vaccine should not receive it each person should receive a vaccine fact sheet ahead of time listing the details of the ingredients contained within the vaccine screening should occur ahead of time but not by the emt prior to administering a vaccination it is important to check the seven rights of vaccine administration as the vaccine will be pre-drawn for you by a supervisor this will consist of a verification process with the supervisor and patient these include ensuring the right patient right medication in this case the vaccine right dose route and equipment right site time and importantly write documentation of your procedure it is important to prepare your equipment ahead of time these are the items you will need to have at hand when administering the vaccine to each new patient gloves should be changed in between patients all equipment is single use single patient nothing should be reused between patients a 22 to 25 gauge needle should be used to give the vaccine the optimal needle length varies based on the patient's gender and weight as shown in the chart in most cases a one inch to one and a half inch needle will be appropriate we want to give the vaccine sufficiently deep at a 90 degree angle to the skin to ensure that we reach the deltoid muscle during this brief video presentation we will go over the steps to administer a vaccine by the intramuscular root in the deltoid muscle you will notice the patient is seated for comfort and all of our equipment is available the first step is to locate the landmarks to give the deltoid injection the deltoid muscle is a large muscle that starts at the shoulder and extends to the mid upper arm we will first locate the bony corner of the shoulder called the acromion process and find its outermost edge which is here we're going to go two finger breaths down and then we are going to bring the fingers from our other hand up to meet creating an inverted triangle of safety zone for injection we will aim to give the injection just below the index finger of my left hand it is important to stay within this triangle to lessen the risk of hitting nerves or blood vessels now that we have identified our landmarks we will take out the alcohol prep pad open that up again we confirm our landmarks we will use our alcohol prep pad to clean the site starting at our ejection site and moving outward in circles we have checked the seven rights and prepared our vaccine as noted earlier and we are now ready to give the intramuscular injection i have pulled the skin taut with my non-dominant hand i'm gently moving the skin back and forth just prior to administering the injection to help distract the patient and lessen pain the needle containing the vaccine is inserted at a 90 degree angle with respect to the skin into the deltoid muscle site using the landmarks that we previously identified remember the triangle of safety the plunger of the syringe is depressed which pushes the vaccine into the muscle then the needle and syringe are removed directly backwards at the same 90 degree angle used for insertion of note for intramuscular vaccine administration at this site aspiration or pulling back on the plunger prior to injecting is not necessary place the needle and syringe immediately into the sharps container do not attempt to recap the needle prior to placing it in the sharp spin as this can increase the risk of needle stick injury a bandage is applied over the area all people who receive a coven 19 vaccine under emergency use authorization must be observed and monitored for adverse or allergic reactions for a person with a history of a severe allergic reaction please monitor on site for at least 30 minutes for all others receiving the vaccine they should be monitored on site for at least 15 minutes each vaccination site should have equipment and medications such as epinephrine and diphenhydramine onsite to treat patients with potential allergic reactions the following signs and symptoms raise concern for an allergic reaction if a patient indicates any of the following signs or symptoms during their observation period please notify your supervisor as soon as possible keep in mind that the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction may involve the respiratory gastrointestinal or cardiovascular system or symptoms involving the skin the following is a list of common expected side effects associated with the vaccines importantly these are usually delayed by a few hours an immediate onset of symptoms within the 15 to 30 minute observation period after the vaccine is given would be more concerning for an adverse or allergic reaction allergic and severe adverse events such as the sudden onset of symptoms or need for medical care after a vaccine is given require reporting to the vaccine adverse event reporting system or vares please notify your supervisor if a patient reports any adverse event to you while they are on site the vares report should be filed by a supervisor or leadership of the vaccination clinic now that you've completed the didactic training you should take the following next steps to be credentialed as an emt vaccinator demonstrate proficiency with the injection skill with your jurisdictional or commercial service apply to be an emt vaccinator in the licensure system at www.mimslicence.com receive approval from your jurisdictional or commercial service and medical director in the licensure system and then perform vaccines under direct supervision thank you for taking your time to complete this emt covet 19 vaccination training i'm grateful for your dedication to the maryland ems system and our patients don't forget to wear your mask

AMA Update video and podcast. Today, we'll hear the latest
from ACIP, the CDC'S Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices, and also talk more about the
CDC's new isolation guidelines for COVID. Back with us today to
share all the details is the AMA's in-house
vaccine expert, ACIP liaison and immediate past board chair,
Dr. Sandra Fryhofer in Atlanta. I'm Todd Unger, AMA's chief
experience officer in Chicago. Dr. Fryhofer, it's
great to have you back. Dr. Fryhofer: Hi. Thanks for having me back. Unger: Well, ACIP had a two-day
meeting at the end of February, and it looked like
a packed agenda with lots of presentations
about many vaccines, including flu,
pneumococcal, polio, RSV and a word I never thought
I would say-- chikungunya. And hopefully, I got that right. Dr. Fryhofer, tell us about
some of the highlights from the meeting. Dr. Fryhofer: Yes, it
was a packed agenda, but ACIP's new recommendation
for COVID vaccines was the major
headline of the week. ACIP voted in favor of an
additional dose of the updated COVID vaccine for all
adults 65 and older. CDC director Dr. Mandy Cohen
agreed and quickly endorsed the new recommendation. Also last week, CDC also
relaxed its isolation guidelines for those testing
positive for COVID. You no longer have to
isolate for five days. CDC issued a new
25-page guidance for COVID and other respiratory
viruses, including flu and RSV. The new guidance says, stay
home while you're sick, but you can return
to work when you're feeling better and
fever-free for 24 hours without taking fever
lowering medications. But do wear a mask and
try to physically distance from others for the
five days that follow. This is especially important
if you're going to be around someone at high
risk for severe ... and those 65 and older and those
with weakened immune systems. And to repeat, CDC now
says everyone 65 and older should get an additional dose
of the updated COVID vaccine this spring if and
when they're eligible. Unger: So why don't you
tell us just specifically about that word ""eligible""? What exactly does that mean? Dr. Fryhofer: The additional
dose for those 65 and older should be given at least four
months after the first updated dose. So getting an
additional dose implies you've already received a first
dose, and many people have not. Uptake of the updated vaccine
has been disappointing. Unger: Dr. Fryhofer,
in terms of uptake, what are the numbers
looking like right now? Dr. Fryhofer: Only
13% of children have received a dose
of the updated vaccine, and overall, only 22%
of adults 18 and older have received the updated shot. This new recommendation only
applies to those 65 and older. And nearly 42% of
them have already received an updated dose. But that means 58% have not
and that's far from ideal. Unger: Dr. Fryhofer, I think
it would be helpful then if you could review the
timeline of when the updated vaccine first became available
and how this new recommendation fits in. Dr. Fryhofer: The updated
2023-2024 COVID vaccine is an XBB.1.5 monovalent version. It first became
available last fall at the end of September 2023. That's when the
updated COVID vaccine received a universal
recommendation for everyone six months and older. Those six months
through four years old need multiple doses,
including at least one dose of the updated vaccine, to
prime their immune system to protect them. For those aged five and
older, a single dose was all you needed
to be up to date and to protect against
serious illness. Back in September,
additional doses were allowed for patients with
immunocompromising conditions. They could receive an additional
dose at least two months after their last
updated dose as well as more doses if recommended
by their physician. The additional
dose recommendation for those with
immunocompromising conditions still applies. This new ACIP recommendation
expands access to additional vaccine doses
to all adults 65 and older. But the interval is four
months after the first dose. Some of this older
age group are now four months out from
their first updated dose, so they can get an
additional dose now. But others still have not
received their first updated vaccine dose, and that's
where physicians can really make a difference. Adults who are vaccinated
or definitely plan to get vaccinated were
more likely to report a health care
provider recommended they get a COVID vaccine. This highlights the importance
of physician recommendation. Unger: Absolutely. Question for you, Dr. Fryhofer-- Why are additional
doses only recommended for adults in the
older age group? Dr. Fryhofer: Well, simply
put, this extra vaccine dose will provide additional
protection for those at highest risk. Most COVID deaths
and hospitalizations are in those aged 65 and older. Risk increases with age. People aged 75 and older have
the highest COVID mortality rates. We're in a much different
place than we were in 2020. More than 98% of people have
at least some type of immunity from vaccination, from
prior infection, or both. Hybrid immunity from
both vaccination and previous infection
is the most protective, and older patients have
tended to isolate more during the pandemic. So there's a higher prevalence
of vaccine-only immunity in older adults as
compared to younger adults. We know vaccine-induced immunity
tends to fade with time. Additional vaccine doses
provide incremental benefit in boosting protection. Another reality is
immunosenescence. Our immune systems don't
work as well as we get older. And immunity wanes more
quickly in older age groups. This means more
frequent vaccine doses are needed to
maintain protection in this older population. Unger: All right. Also a question
for you, because it might surprise some
people, about having this done in the spring-- what about the
timing, the spring? Dr. Fryhofer: Well,
this is actually the third year in a row a
spring COVID vaccine dose has been recommended. Flu and RSV outbreaks surge
in the fall and winter. COVID does, too. We've seen increases in COVID
during the respiratory virus season. COVID hospitalizations peaked
in late December, early January. We've also seen COVID surges
in the spring and summer. So COVID seems to have
year-round transmission. Hospitalizations and
deaths due to COVID continue throughout
the year, and rates are highest in those 65 and older. Each week, there are still about
20,000 new hospital admissions and 2,000 deaths due to COVID. And 95% of those hospitalized
this past winter with COVID had not received a dose
of the updated vaccine. The updated vaccine provides
protection against JN.1 and other circulating variants. Vaccine effectiveness
is expected to wane. Additional doses are needed
to restore protection. This additional spring
vaccine dose can do just that. Unger: All right. Thank you. Dr. Fryhofer, I understand
there was quite a discussion about the precise
language that was used in the new recommendation. Can you give us a little
background about that? Dr. Fryhofer: Well,
you got that right. Words matter, and
there was much debate about whether the
recommendations should say older adults
""may"" or ""should"" get an additional dose. Now, for full disclosure, I'm
a member of the COVID Vaccine Workgroup, and our workgroup had
suggested the softer language, that those 65 and older
""may"" get an additional dose. This is also called shared
clinical decision-making, meaning you and your patient
have to discuss and decide. At the meeting, ACIP voting
members went back and forth about ""may"" versus ""should,""
but after reviewing the most recent data for those 65 and
older presented at the meeting, ACIP voting members decided
on the stronger wording. Everyone 65 and older
""should"" get another dose. Unger: That's clear. Dr. Fryhofer, many
older adults have multiple medical conditions. Did that factor come into play
in terms of making the stronger recommendation? Dr. Fryhofer: Yes. Older patients and those with
multiple underlying medical conditions are at highest risk
of bad outcomes from COVID-- heart disease, lung
disease, diabetes, neurological
conditions and obesity are some of the most common
underlying medical conditions in those hospitalized
with COVID. And as we know,
many older patients have multiple
medical conditions. COVID continues to circulate. And although COVID
hospitalizations are down 75% and COVID deaths are down
90% since January 2022, there's still more than 20,000
hospitalizations and 2,000 deaths each week due to COVID. Most are in the
65-and-older age group. The ultimate decision
by ACIP voting members was, everyone 65 and
older should get a dose. This stronger language
is crystal clear and demonstrates
ACIP's confidence in the importance of an
additional dose of the vaccine in keeping our most vulnerable
Americans protected. And I think it was
the right call. Unger: Thank you. What about the idea
of booster fatigue? What role does that
play in getting people to agree to vaccination? Dr. Fryhofer: Well,
we're trying not to call them boosters anymore. It's now called the
updated vaccine. But sure, we all
have vaccine fatigue. People are tired of masks. They're tired of testing. CDC surveys say less than
50% of people who get sick are testing
themselves for COVID. We're all sick and
tired of COVID, but the virus is still here. It's still circulating. Some people are still
refusing to get the vaccine. Many have not received a
dose of the updated vaccine, but others really want
to stay protected. And with this new
recommendation, they can. Some people who have
not been vaccinated may not like the
strong language. But understand this language is
meant to inform, not to offend. COVID is here. It has not gone away. People are still
being hospitalized. People are still
dying from COVID. ACIP's strong recommendation
for an additional dose is a wakeup call to get a
dose now to restore protection for those 65 and older. This new recommendation
allows the most vulnerable to restore their protection. Another silver lining of
this strong recommendation-- if ACIP recommends it, insurance
companies have to cover it. The vaccine is
already in pharmacies. All you have to do is sign up
and show up, and of course, roll up your sleeve. And there's no shortage
of the updated vaccine. Unger: Well, that's good news. And although it seems
like a long way away, the fall will
eventually be here. And I'm curious
what the plans are for getting ready for next
year and thinking about what we might expect this fall season. Dr. Fryhofer: The
virus keeps changing. Last September, when the updated
vaccine first became available, the rollout was rushed. It was sort of a mess. No one was ready. Pharmacies didn't
have the codes. Insurance coverage
wasn't initially updated on a lot of the
pharmacy software. Some who wanted it
got turned away. Many became frustrated. We need to do better,
and that's why ACIP's review process for
the next COVID vaccine, if there is one,
will happen sooner. FDA's VRBPAC will likely meet
mid-May to discuss any needed vaccine strain changes. And just like for flu
vaccines, updated COVID vaccine strain changes do not
require any new human data. ACIP will then meet in
June to review and finetune any recommendations. That's the plan,
at least for now. Many of the patients I
talked to still don't seem to realize
they're supposed to get a dose of the updated vaccine. So having more lead
time to develop clearer messaging and
communication will be helpful. Public health officials
sort of know what to expect. We now have four years
of epidemiological data to predict a likely COVID peak
in the winter of 2024-2025. And we need to be ready. Unger: Absolutely. This has been an amazing
amount of information. Dr. Fryhofer, any
final thoughts? Dr. Fryhofer: The
updated COVID vaccine continues to be effective
against JN.1, which became dominant in January. But the virus keeps changing. For those 65 and
older, remember, there's a four-month
interval before you can get an additional dose. Try to get your second dose
before June, if you can. That way, if the vaccine
is updated again for fall, you won't have to delay getting
the most up-to-date COVID shot. This timing issue was actually
pointed out by FDA's Dr. David Kaslow at the ACIP meeting. And finally, don't
underestimate the power of physician recommendation. Physician
recommendation matters. Our patients listen to us. They trust us. Physician recommendation is
vital for vaccination success. Unger: Absolutely. And thank you, Dr.
Fryhofer, for that update. And one of these days,
we'll have you come back to talk about how the
new ACIP recommendations for the chikungunya
vaccine will work. Dr. Fryhofer: I'd love
to come back, Todd. Unger: And I'll look forward
to saying that word again. Dr. Fryhofer, that wraps
up today's episode. Thanks again for joining

283,VNIBK5KXS_k,Top Reasons to Not Get the COVID Vaccine: A Fertility Doctor Reviews the Science and Latest Updates,"**Learn more about my new fertility course to enhance your natural fertility and optimize your lifestyle**
https://www.nataliecrawfordmd.com/enhance-natural-fertility

Fertility doctor, Natalie Crawford. MD, reviews the top reasons not to get the COVID vaccine. This is the video to watch to educate yourself on why some people are not getting the vaccine, and to listen to the education and science to learn more. Share this episode with anyone in your life who needs data and science about the safety and efficacy of the COVID vaccine.

Top reasons not to get the COVID vaccine:
1. The COVID vaccine was developed too fast.
2. I don’t want to get the COVID vaccine because it will cause DNA changes.
3. The COVID vaccine is experimental.
4. The COVID vaccine vaccine has not been shown to be safe. There are too many side effects from the COVID vaccine.
5. There is no long term data on the COVID vaccine. 
6. The COVID vaccine will hurt my fertility. I want to have kids in the future so I don't want the vaccine. The COVID vaccine causes sterilization, miscarriage, placental problems, and reproductive issues. You can’t get pregnant after the COVID vaccine.
7. Pregnant people were not included in the vaccine studies. There is no data on the vaccine’s safety in pregnancy.

**COVID can causes severe life threatening disease, especially in pregnant people. All medical organizations who care for pregnant people (over 22) or those trying to conceive all uniformly recommend the vaccine. The CDC recommends the vaccine for all who are trying to get pregnant or who are pregnant. Getting a COVID vaccine is safe and effective at preventing severe disease from COVID. Pregnant people are dying. Death is a preventable outcome at this point.

This is not medical advice but education. Please ask your doctor questions so that you can have personalized medical care.

Sharing fertility facts to educate women about trying to conceive, getting pregnant, ovulation, fertility treatments, IUI, IVF, becoming a doctor, life as a woman in medicine, and more.",2021-09-02,63304,1563,163,UCRZamIB-DWuVPJuc0bKhwzg, not wanting to get the coveted vaccine I'm breaking down what you need to know [Music] hey friends I'm Dr Natalie Crawford I am a board certified OB GYN and fertility doctor in Austin Texas and I have been talking a lot about the covet vaccine and I know so many of us are sick of covid and we're still going to talk about the vaccine but today this video is for anybody who's questioning getting the vaccine who wants more information who doesn't want to do something that's going to hurt them and has been hearing a lot of different things out there this video is also if you want to share it with friends who've not gotten the vaccine educate yourself or understand some of the top things you can say that are based in fact and not fear Please Subscribe and share that's how we spread our message of fertility education because you deserve to know what goes on with your body I'm a fertility doctor I do not want you to do anything that would ever ever hurt your chances of getting pregnant in the future that is my life's Mission I work so hard I have started to practice I do everything on my social channels to educate people so they have higher chances of getting pregnant and they're making better decisions the last thing I would do would sit here and talk about something that would hurt your fertility and in fact I restrict behaviors all the time I have no problem telling my patients eat less Meat Stop processed food you can't smoke pot and all of the things and so yet I am sitting here and telling my patients that I am recommending and encouraging the covet vaccine whether they are pregnant undergoing fertility treatments or trying to conceive and so I think you need to understand why the other thing is I appreciate that there's some resistance or fear because of the early rumors if somebody's telling you that a choice you make may impact your ability to get pregnant in the future you should stop pause and think about it that is good and healthy we don't want to just blindly follow something without thinking through it that's part of what science is it's thinking about something understanding the hypothesis evaluating the data and making conclusions you know in the past Society distrusted scientists and doctors to do this for for them but the current world people are allowed to have equally love voices on social media platforms and this has led to the spread of misinformation and confusion and so we're going to try to stop some of the confusion and go through these top factors reasons why people aren't getting vaccinated and what you need to know about them number one the vaccine was developed too fast I understand this reason because mRNA vaccine technology is new and so do you really want to sign up for something new the important thing to realize is that the technology is not new at all we have been in the development of studying this and trying to discover a vaccine for other viruses that could be based on mRNA technology because it's really pretty and straightforward so let's understand what it is we have over 15 years of experience studying this and HIV vaccine has been in the works for a really really long time and the coveted vaccine was able to be rushed and fast because of a global pandemic worldwide attention towards getting a vaccine out there and in science usually vaccines and diseases that are impacting people at very high prevalency rates are not funded well enough to get a lot of good science and the support behind them so this was really a global effort to get science moving forward mRNA affecting technology is where your body is inducted with a very small amount of mRNA mRNA is messenger RNA messenger RNA is not let's go over the knots changing your DNA incorporating into your DNA so when we learned about biology and we learned about cell biology messenger RNA is providing a coding sequence so what it is doing is it is telling your body to make proteins your DNA is absolutely unaffected by this but it is something that's saying Hey I want you ribosomes specifically to make this protein sequence and I have given you the code for it and what it is doing is Translating that mRNA into a protein sequence so this happens in our body all the time this process is very normal DNA gets transcripted into RNA RNA mRNA then is the sequence that can tell the ribosomes to make a protein DNA can't make proteins it needs mRNA to talk to the other cells in the body so DNA is still just normal you're getting a messenger signal that's like a code the ribosomes are then able to interpret said code and make proteins important to know is mRNA is really degraded really rapidly in the body the body always degrades it it's like hey why is there mRNA hanging out going and degrading it mRNA cannot live longer the reason why antibodies are helpful is that that's your body's immune system when your body even encounters covet out in the wild it's going to be able to mount a proper immune response faster it's going to be able to get rid of the virus that will be invading your body and the antibodies are a normal thing we have antibodies against all types of things in our bodies this is how our bodies Our Design This is Our natural immune system and so these antibodies are super helpful and that is what's really beautiful about this process these antibodies can be passed on the antibodies can go through the Plus Center or in the breast milk and that's able to provide protection to a baby and that's wonderful and beautiful and not harmful it's an antibody just like other types of antibodies can go through the placenta or breast milk as well and this is why breastfeeding for example decreases the risk of ear infections and other illnesses because Mom can pass on some of her immunity so number one it was developed too fast no it wasn't number two I don't want my DNA modified not how mRNA work number three it's still experimental well kind of so it was originally approved under an emergency use authorization which is what has to happen when you're in times of emergency use you probably also use lots of experimental things every single day because vitamins aren't FDA approved neither is the white claw that you drink or a lot of the food that you eat but that reason could make you have pause if you're concerned that it wasn't actually approved or it's too experimental the FDA has approved it the CDC has recommended the vaccine all organizations that take care of people in their reproductive years over 22 of them have recommended the vaccine for people who are wanting to become pregnant it trying to get pregnant undergoing fertility treatments are actively pregnant 22 plus organizations in agreement plus the CTC are now an FDA approval for the Pfizer vaccine for Reproductive age adults to get vaccinated including times of pregnancy reason number four I don't believe that the vaccine is safe for me there's conclusive evidence that getting covet is an extremely risky State as compared to the vaccine so getting a vaccine taking a medication taking any drug might carry some small risk the risk of all of these things happening from the virus are magnitudes higher and generally when we look at these we don't want to keep doing a vaccine that is not safe but the risk of getting coveted is significantly higher than the risk of any of these complications from the vaccine and we have millions and billions almost 200 million people in the United States have received at least one vaccine over 2 billion people worldwide have been vaccinated and so to say that we don't have data that the vaccine is safe is a false statement safe does does not mean zero side effects safe means that in almost everybody's side effects are so exceedingly rare that it is worth getting the vaccine same thing for safety from antibiotic profiles and other medications and things that we do these risk is the same risk we see with other vaccines and so truly the group that should not be getting a vaccine is if you've had a prior severe complication an allergic reaction an anaphylaxis from a different type of vaccine in the past reason number five there's no long-term data on the vaccine I hear this one every single day and let's just think about it we have lots of long-term data on lots of different vaccines and vaccines can cause some short-term problems which we just mentioned but there is not a hypothesis or a basis of evidence that getting a vaccine can cause long-term problems because it's a short-term thing your body makes antibodies and then you have the antibodies they circulate in your body so thinking that you're going to get a vaccine and then develop some complication 20 years later really there's no basis for that the other thing I always say here is is that in science all the time and especially in Reproductive Medicine we make decisions with the data that we have we make the best decisions with the data we have and so things like IVF or in vitro fertilization we did not wait 20 years to see if there were long-term outcomes before we rolled it out to the general public the benefit life was significant enough to make it worth any risk especially when there was no theoretical risk or hypothetical or proven risk than any preliminary study and so the same thing as going for the vaccine now there's no reason why it should have a long-term side effect there's no data that there should be long-term side effects the vaccine was started to be given in July of 2020 so we have over a year and people aren't developing some weird thing all this time later and as far as reproductive consequences absolutely no there's no reason for it to be based in and so the data that we have shows safety efficacy and it does not show that there's going to be harm so reason number five why people are not getting the vaccine is that there's no long-term data is not a reason that stands up when we look at the science also for talking about long-term side effects people vaccinated a year ago are not having any any weird Nuance at symptoms but people who had covet a year ago are long covet is a real thing long covet can cause fatigue confusion memory problems depression breathing problems shortness of breath cough hair loss heart problems lung problems lung covert is a real thing we don't know how this will progress over time and so if we're going to use the argument that we're afraid of long-term risk we should be afraid of the long-term risk of covid over a long-term rest of the vaccine which we've not seen any of Reason number six I heard the vaccine will hurt my fertility and I want to have kids so I'm not going to get the vaccine because I want kids this one resonates with me because of what I do for a living and because I had infertility myself and I have videos upon videos talking about the vaccine and infertility this all started from misinformation saying that the vaccine caused antibodies against sensation or a placental protein therefore it would cause failed implantation pregnancy loss stillbirth miscarriage and it has not proven true there's even no basis it's not a direct amino acid sequence there's overlapping amino acid sequence throughout our entire bodies all the time but this was really just a made-up lie for somebody who it appears was disgruntled against divisor this lie has caused lots of lots of harm it has prevented people from getting the vaccine and is now leading to death of pregnant women so I want you to take this really to heart there's no evidence there's not even a hypothesis for why the vaccine would impact your fertility when we start thinking about the body I want you to understand that we are very careful looking at some of these outcomes and even though we might think it takes a really long time in the natural population we look at reproductive studies all the time on a cycle to cycle basis or in IVF outcomes and we have data looking at the covid vaccine showing that there's no difference in implantation after IVF Cycles there's no change in IBS Cycles so if you've got the vaccine and then you went through a cycle if did not take more medication your ovaries did not work worse you do not have a lower implantation rates you didn't have worse quality embryos you were not more likely to have a miscarriage those things have not held up and if this rumor was true we would have seen those things being the case we also have lots of data looking at cohort studies of pregnant people or people who got the vaccine right before or in very early pregnancy and there is no higher association with miscarriage and stillbirth great study published in the New England Journal medicine looking at thousands of patients this is important you guys because we do not want to make a choice based out of fear the Delta variant of covet is very different it is more infectious and we are seeing pregnant people die and I'm not saying that to be dramatic but I'm being very very honest this is now death is a preventable outcome severe coveted with intubation fetal death those things are preventable we have study after study showing that a coveted infection in a pregnant person's higher risks of ICU admission intubation ECMO death preterm birth C-section and Fetal death if you get a covet infection versus somebody who does not get a coping infection when you're pregnant and so preventing severe covet is really essential for Mom and for baby we see stories all over the news of young healthy pregnant with no comorbidities not surviving covid and so we're not trying to recommend anything just because we are trying to keep you alive the data supports getting the vaccine is the number one thing you can do to keep yourself safe if you do not get the vaccine you are putting yourself in your baby at risk that is what all of your OB gyns and your fertility doctors across the world want you to know we are invested in your future family you must be alive to have a future family and I mean that really clearly so number six the I want kids in the future I want you to have kids in the future too that's not a reason not to get the vaccine actually survival is the number one thing you need to be able to have kids in the future and you should feel confident the fact that we've actually looked at these reproductive outcome because of some of these rumors and we have confirmed what we suspected no change at all from an observational standpoint I've had tons of patients getting pregnant after getting the covert vaccine so almost all of my patients are vaccinated we've gone through IVF Cycles embryo transfers and I am seeing higher pregnancy rates than ever during this time period not lower so even from my own patients observing this I'm not seeing any change and I swear your reproductive endocrinologist across the country we look at our pregnancy rates and our embryo transfer outcomes like crazy like we obsess over them when anything is off we go to the lab because something new is something different what is going on this was lower we are always looking at how we can have the highest odds of pregnancy and if the vaccine was causing a lower chance of pregnancy we would know you would know we wouldn't have you get it okay and number seven the vaccines not studied in pregnant people well yes and no one it is hard to do do studies on pregnant people just across the board that is a rate limiting step but two we have over 150 000 pregnant people who have gotten the vaccine we have over 5 000 pregnant people enrolled in a study cohort study a really good study watching to see what the outcomes are and we have data showing that there is no increase in adverse reproductive outcomes the people who are quoting the New England Journal saying that there is a 86 chance higher chance of miscarriage do not understand the data they're not interpreting the statistics right I have an entire video on that that you can go watch about the coveted vaccine and pregnancy and talking about that study so the chance of miscarriage was lower than the standard chance just from being a person walking on Earth the chance of a stillbirth was lower than it was naturally so we are not seeing higher rates of stillbirth or miscarriage after vaccination in fact we are seeing lower slash the same chance that you would just have being a person because stillbirth of miscarriage do happen and so we don't compare things to zero We compare them to the rate of them happening friends if you yourself Elf or your best friend or somebody you care about has chosen not to get the vaccine I understand I have friends I know some people who've not gotten vaccinated it's hard and it's scary as somebody who feels like they understand all this data to not be able to get through to somebody with science and so I just want to give you some tools and some guidance so that you can try to help people if you're not going to get the vaccine and specifically if you're pregnant I'm really asking you to please act like it's April of 2020. stay in your house don't go to public please don't ever be indoors wear a mask everywhere we don't want you to die I don't want you to die I don't blame you I do not think care should be withheld from people who are choosing not to get the vaccine but I think you deserve education I'm not angry with you for not getting the vaccine I'm angry at the people who told the lies that maybe made you have enough fear that you just cannot feel comfortable I understand what a hard decision this is for some people but I also understand that we have nothing to gain by recommending this it burns me out every time I talk about the vaccine the hate the Dark Horse people who come out of everywhere and want to tell me I'm the worst person on Earth and that I'm killing people they hate emails and DMS and comments how I have to manage every social media site guys it almost feels not worth it but for the people who message and say hey that video made a difference to me that post made a difference I felt more confident in my decision you helped me make the choice to get the vaccine and now I feel safe now my baby feels safe I was able to share that with somebody that's what I'm holding on to in these moments and so trust me there's no ulterior motive here I purely want you to have the information you need to make the best choice for you I want you to be able to educate and Empower your friends and I really want us to all get through this pandemic together and I promise I do not want your pregnancy or your future fertility harmed in any way possible thank you guys for being here I appreciate if

284,mlg-AFbqYbc,AstraZeneca Covid vaccine: What do we know about the risks? - BBC Newsnight,"A trial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine on children has stopped giving out jabs while the UK's medicines regulator investigates a possible link with rare blood clots in adults. Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog

Prof Andrew Pollard from the University of Oxford told the BBC there were no safety concerns with the trial itself, but its scientists were waiting for further information.

Around 300 volunteers signed up.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people should get their jab when invited.

More than 31.6 million people in the UK have had a first vaccine dose and a total of 5.4 million people have received a second dose.

Two vaccines - developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNtech - are being used in the UK, while a third - from Moderna - has been approved.

WE SHOULD BE TAKING DELIVERIES. LIFESAVING VACCINES TO MORE AMERICANS AND FIRST. WE’RE GOING TO PROVIDE MORE INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE UNVACCINATED AMERICANS TO GET VACCINATED. THAT STARTS WITH PAID LEAVE TO GET THE SHOT. WE’RE STILL HEARING THAT PEOPLE ARE UNABLE TO GET TIME OFF FROM THEIR EMPLOYER TO GET VACCINATED. WELL, THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. FOR SOME TIME NOW. I’VE SAID SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THE SHOT AND STILL GET PAID THANKS TO THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS FULLY REIMBURSED SEEN ANY SMALL OR MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESS THAT PROVIDES WORKERS AND PAID TIME OFF TO GET VACCINATED. EMPLOYERS. THIS COSTS YOU NOTHING. TO HAVE AND GIVE EMPLOYEES PAID TIME OFF, DO IT NOW. PLEASE. TODAY. I’M ANNOUNCING WE’RE TAKING THIS A STEP FURTHER. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE THOSE EMPLOYERS. TO GIVE THEIR STAFF TO GIVE STAFF TIME OFF. NOT ONLY GET THEMSELVES VACCINATED ALSO TO GET THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS VACCINATED. THAT MEANS EMPLOYERS CAN GET REIMBURSED IF THEY GIVE PARENTS TIME OFF WITH PAID TIME PAID LEAVE TO TAKE THEIR KIDS OR THEIR OWN PARENTS TO GET VACCINATED. SOME CALLING ALL EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO GIVE PAID TIME OFF TO GET THE SHOT. AND HELP A FAMILY MEMBER DO SO. I PROMISE YOU WILL COST YOU THE EMPLOYER. NOTHING. TO BE REIMBURSED.

TO THEIR ASSOCIATES IF THEY TO THEIR ASSOCIATES IF THEY GET VACCINATED. AND IT VACCINATION RATES MOVE UP FROM 50% TO 50% TO 75%. MUNGER EMPLOYEES. STATES LIKE NEW MEXICO. OHIO AND COLORADO ARE OFFERING SIMILAR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND HELP INCREASE VACCINATION RATES. SO TODAY I’M CALLING ON ALL STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO USE FUNDING THEY HAVE RECEIVED, INCLUDING FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN TO GIVE $100 TO ANYONE WHO GETS FULLY VACCINATE. I KNOW THE PAIN PEOPLE GET VACCINATED MIGHT SOUND UNFAIR TO FOLKS WHO HAVE GOTTEN VACCINATED ALREADY. HERE’S THE DEAL. IF INCENTIVES HELP US BEAT THIS VIRUS. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD USE THEM. WE ALL BENEFIT. GET MORE PEOPLE VACCINATED. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE VACCINATION. IT IS TIME TO IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS AND KEY GROUPS TO MAKE SURE THEY’RE VACCINATED. JUST THIS WEEK WE TOOK AN IMPORTANT STEP TO PROTECT OUR VETERANS. LIKE MANY CIVILIAN HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ARE DOING THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. WELL, NOW REQUIRE COVID-19 VACCINES FOR DOCTORS AND NURSES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE WORKERS WHO PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE FOR WE MUST DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO PROTECT OUR VETERANS FROM GETTING COVID AND THEY COME TO GET MEDICAL CARE. THEY SO RICHLY EARNED SERVING THEIR COUNTRY. WE OWN THEM. NEXT. SINCE MANY VACCINATIONS REQUIRED FOR ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY TODAY. I’M ASKING IS FRESH DEPARTMENT TO LOOK INTO HOW AND WHEN THEY WILL ADD COVID-19 TO THE LIST OF VACCINATIONS, ARMED FORCES MUST GET. OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM. WHO PROTECT THIS COUNTRY GREAT THREATS SHOULD BE PROTECTED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FROM GETTING COVID-19. I THINK THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OUR TROOPS ARE IN PLACE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. MANY WHERE VACCINATION RATES ARE LOW AND DISEASE IS PREVALENT. EVERY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE WILL BE ASKED TO TEST TO THEIR VACCINATION STATUS. ANYONE WHO DOES NOT A TEST. OR IS NOT VACCINATED WILL REQUIRE. MASK NO MATTER WHERE THEY WORK. TEST ONE OR 2 TIMES A WEEK TO SEE IF THEY’VE OF COURSE, ACQUIRED COVID. SOCIALLY DISTANCE. AND GENERALLY WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL FOR WORK. LIKEWISE TODAY. RECKON MY ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE STEPS TO APPLY SIMILAR STANDARDS TO ALL FEDERAL CONTRACTORS. IF YOU WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HERE WORKERS VACCINATED. BECAUSE THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. REPRESENTING 10’S OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN BUSINESS, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION MANUFACTURERS. THE BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE WHICH COMPRISES OF THE LARGEST THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS AND AMERICA. FOR ALL OF SAUDI THE ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TAKING AN URGE YOU TO THEM TO FOLLOW SUIT.

287,hUJYWEpIwJg,President Biden announces new COVID-19 vaccine mandates,"As the delta variant plagues the nation, President Joe Biden outlined his plan to help combat the spread of COVID-19, calling it “a pandemic of the unvaccinated.”

#PresidentBiden #COVID19 #VaccineMandates",2021-09-10,1568341,11536,53906,UCBi2mrWuNuyYy4gbM6fU18Q, this is an abc news special report now reporting david muir good afternoon we're coming on the air at this hour because president biden is expected to unveil his strategy for this next chapter in this fight against the covet surge sweeping across the u.s the delta variant now killing more than a thousand americans every day the president will be revealing his six-point plan from the white house focusing we believe on increasing vaccinations a talk of boosters of course schools and the economy he's expected to sign an executive order requiring the majority of federal employees in this country and government contractors to be vaccinated now without that option of testing meaning vaccines they need the vaccination in order to work federal workers and companies with 100 or more employees it's believed will also have to ensure that workers are vaccinated or tested weekly all of this comes as the us now averages more than 140 000 new coveted cases a day and we've been reporting on this number here more than one in four new cases involves children just as millions now head back to school the surge in this country pushing hospitals to the brink more than one thousand patients hospitalized almost all of them authorities pointing out unvaccinated we have reported in the last 24 hours here some medical facilities at the brink in idaho now rationing health care here's the president good evening my fellow americans i want to talk to you about where we are in the battle against covert 19 the progress we've made and the work we have left to do and it starts with understanding this even as the delta variant 19 has covered 19 has been hitting this country hard we have the tools to combat the virus if we can come together as a country and use those tools if we raise our vaccination rate protect ourselves and others with masking expanded testing and identify people who are infected we can and we will turn the tide on covet 19. it'll take a lot of hard work it's going to take some time many of us are frustrated with the nearly 80 million americans who are still not vaccinated even though the vaccine is safe effective and free you might be confused about what is true and what is false about covet 19. so before i outline the new steps to fight covet 19 that i'm going to be announcing tonight let me give you some clear information about where we stand first we have concern we've made considerable progress in battling cover 19. when i became president about 2 million americans were fully vaccinated today over 175 million americans have that protection before i took office we hadn't ordered enough vaccine for every american just weeks in office we did the week before i took office on january 20th of this year over 25 000 americans died that week covet 19. last week that grim weekly toll was down 70 and then three months before i took office our economy was faltering creating just 50 000 jobs a month we're now averaging 700 000 new jobs a month in the past three months this progress is real but while america is much better shape than it was seven months ago when i took office i need to tell you a second fact we're in the tough stretch and it could last for a while highly contagious delta variant that i began to warn america about back in july spread late summer like it did in other countries before us while the vaccines provide strong protection for the vaccinated we read about and hear about and we see the stories of hospitalized people people on their deathbeds among the unvaccinated over the past few weeks this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated and it's caused by the fact that despite america having unprecedented and successful vaccination program despite the fact that for almost five months free vaccines have been available in 80 000 different locations we still have nearly 80 million americans who have failed to get the shot and to make matters worse there are elected officials actively working to undermine the fight against covet 19. instead of encouraging people to get vaccinated in a mask up they're ordering mobile morgues for the unvaccinated dying from coven in their communities this is totally unacceptable third if you wonder how all this adds up here's the math the vast majority of americans are doing the right thing nearly three-quarters of the eligible have gotten at least one shot but one quarter has not gotten any that's nearly 80 million americans not vaccinated and a country as large as ours that's 25 percent minority that 25 percent can cause a lot of damage and they are the unvaccinated overcrowd our hospitals or over running emergency rooms and intensive care units leaving no room for someone with a heart attack or pancreatis or cancer and fourth i want to emphasize that the vaccines provide very strong protection from severe illness from covet 19. i know there's a lot of confusion and misinformation but the world's leading scientists confirm that if you are fully vaccinated your risk of severe illness from covet 19 is very low in fact based on available data from the summer only one out of every 160 000 fully vaccinated americans was hospitalized for covet per day these are the facts so here's we stand the path ahead even with the delta variant is not nearly as bad as last winter but what makes it incredibly more frustrating is we have the tools to combat kova 19 and a distinct minority of americans supported by a stink minority of elected officials are keeping us from turning the corner these pandemic politics as i refer to are meg are making people sick causing unvaccinated people to die we cannot allow these actions to stand in the way of protecting the large majority of americans who have done their part i want to get back to life as normal as your president i'm announcing tonight a new plan to require more americans to be vaccinated to combat those blocking public health my plan also increases testing protects our economy and will make our kids safer in schools it consists of six broad areas of action and many specific measures in each that each those actions you can read more about in whitehouse.gov whitehouse.gov the measures these are going to take time to have full impact but if we implement them i believe and the scientists indicate that the months ahead we can reduce the number of unvaccinated americans decrease hospitalizations and deaths and allow our children to go to school safely and keep our economy strong by keeping businesses open first we must increase vaccinations among the unvaccinated with new vaccination requirements of the nearly 80 million eligible americans who have not gotten vaccinated many said they were waiting for approval from the food and drug administration the fda well last month the fda granted that approval so the time for waiting is over this summer we made progress through the combination of vaccine requirements and incentives as well as the fda approval four million more people got their first shot in august than they did in july but we need to do more this is not about freedom or personal choice it's about protecting yourself and those around you the people you work with the people you care about the people you love my job as president is to protect all americans so tonight i'm announcing that the department of labor is developing an emergency rule to require all employers with 100 or more employees that together employ over 80 million workers to ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated or show a negative test at least once a week some of the biggest companies are already requiring this united airlines disney tyson's food and even fox news the bottom line we're going to protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated co-workers we're going to reduce the spread of covet 19 by increasing the share of the workforce that is vaccinated in businesses all across america my plan will extend the vaccination requirements that i previously issued in the healthcare field already i've announced we'll be requiring vaccinations that all nursing home workers who treat patients on medicare and medicaid because i have that federal authority tonight i'm using that same authority to expand that to cover those who work in hospitals home health care facilities or other medical facilities a total of 17 million health care workers if you're seeking care at a health facility you should be able to know that the people treating you are vaccinated simple straightforward period next i will sign an executive order that will now require all executive branch federal employees to be vaccinated all i've signed another executive order that will require federal contractors to do the same if you want to work with the federal government and do business with us get vaccinated if you want to do business with the federal government vaccinate your workforce and tonight i'm removing one of the last remaining obstacles that make it difficult for you to get vaccinated the department of labor will require employers with 100 or more workers to give those workers paid time off to get vaccinated no one should lose pay in order to get vaccinated or take a loved one to get vaccinated today in total the vaccine requirements in my plan will affect about 100 million americans two-thirds of all workers and for other sectors i issue this appeal to those of you running large entertainment venues from sports arenas to concert venues to movie theaters please require folks to get vaccinated or show a negative test as a condition of entry and to the nation's family physicians pediatricians gps general practitioners you're the most trusted medical voice to your patients you may be the one person who can get someone to change their mind about being vaccinated tonight i'm asking each of you to reach out to your unvaccinated patients over the next two weeks and make a personal appeal to them to get the shot america needs your personal involvement in this critical effort my message to unvaccinated americans is this what more is there to wait for what more do you need to see we've made vaccinations free safe and convenient the vaccine is fda approval over 200 million americans have gotten at least one shot we've been patient but our patience is wearing thin and your refusal has cost all of us so please do the right thing but just don't take it from me me listen to the voices of unvaccinated americans who were lying in hospital beds taking their final breath saying if only i'd gotten vaccinated if only it's a tragedy please don't let it become yours the second piece of my plan is continuing to protect the vaccinated for the vast majority of you who have gotten vaccinated i understand your anger at those who haven't gotten vaccinated i understand the anxiety about getting a breakthrough case but as the science makes clear if you're fully vaccinated you're highly protected from severe illness even if you get covet 19. in fact recent data indicates there is only one confirmed positive case per 5 000 fully vaccinated americans per day you're as safe as possible and we're doing everything we can to keep it that way keep it that way keep you safe that's where boosters come in the shots that give you even more protection than after your second shot now i know there's been some confusion about boosters so let me be clear last month our top government doctors announced an initial plan for booster shots for vaccinated americans they believe that the booster is likely to provide the highest level of protection yet of course the decision of which booster shots to give when to start them and who will give them will be left completely to the scientists at the fda in the centers for disease control but while we wait we've done our part we bought enough boosters enough booster shots and the distribution system is ready to administer them as soon as they are authorized those eligible will be able to get a booster right away in tens of thousands of sites across the sites across the country for most americans at your nearby drugstore and for free the third piece of my plan is keeping and maybe most important is keeping our children safe and our schools open for any parent it doesn't matter how low the risk of any illness or accident is when it comes to your child or grandchild trust me i know so let me speak to you directly let me speak to you directly to help ease some of your worries it comes down to two separate categories children ages 12 and older who are eligible for a vaccine now and children ages 11 and under who are not yet eligible the safest thing for your child 12 and older is to get them vaccinated they get vaccinated for a lot of things that's it get them vaccinated as of adults almost all the serious cova 19 cases we're seeing among adolescents are an unvaccinated 12 to 17 year olds an age group that lags behind in vaccination rates so parents please get your teenager vaccinated what about children under the age of 12 who can't get vaccinated yet well the best way for a parent to protect their child under the age of 12 starts at home every parent every teen sibling every caregiver around them should be vaccinated children have four times higher chance of getting hospitalized if they live in a state with low vaccination rates rather than states with high vaccination rates now if you're a parent of a young child you're wondering when will it be when will it be the vaccine available for them i strongly support independent scientific review for vaccine uses for children under 12. we can't take shortcuts for that scientific word but i've made it clear i will do everything within my power to support the fda with any resource it needs to continue to do this as safely and as quickly as possible and our nation's top doctors are committed to keeping the public at large updated on the process so parents can plan now to the schools we know that if schools follow the science and implement the safety measures like testing masking adequate ventilation systems which we provided the money for social distancing and vaccinations then children can be safe from covet 19 in schools today about 90 percent of school staff and teachers are vaccinated we should get that to 100 my administration has already acquired teachers at the schools run by the defense department because i have the authority as president of the federal system the defense department and the interior department to get vaccinated that's the authority i possess tonight i'm announcing that will require all of nearly three hundred thousand educators in the federal head paid program head start programs must be vaccinated as well to protect your youngest our youngest most precious americans and give parents to comfort and tonight i'm calling on all governors to require vaccination for all teachers and staff some already have done so we need more to step up vaccination requirements in schools are nothing new they work they're overwhelmingly supported by educators and their unions and all school officials trying to do the right thing by our children i'll always be on your side let me be blunt my plan also takes on elected officials in states that are undermining you in these life-saving actions right now local school officials are trying to keep children safe in a pandemic while their governor picks a fight with them and even threatens their salaries or their jobs talk about bullying in schools if they'll not help if these governors won't help us beat the pandemic i'll use my power as president to get them out of the way the department of education has already begun to take legal action against states undermining protection that local school officials have ordered any teacher or school official whose pays with hell for doing the right thing we will have that pay restored by the federal government 100 i promise you i will have your back the fourth piece of my plan is increasing testing and masking from the start america has failed to do enough cover 19 testing in order to better detect and control the double variant i'm taking steps tonight to make testing more available more affordable and more convenient i'll use the defense production act to increase production of rapid tests including those that you can use at home while that production is ramping up my administration has worked with top retailers like walmart amazon and krogers and tonight we're announcing that no later than next week each of these outlets will start to sell at home rapid test kits at cost for the next three months this immediate price reduction for at home test kits for up to 35 percent reduction we'll also expand expand free testing at 10 000 pharmacies around the country and we'll commit we're committing 2 billion to purchase nearly 300 million rapid tests for distribution to community health centers food banks schools so that every american no matter their income can access free and convenient tests this is important to everyone particularly for a parent or a child with a child not old enough to be vaccinated you'll be able to test them at home and test those around them in addition to testing we know masking helps stop the spread of covet 19. that's why when i came into office i required masks for all federal buildings on on federal lands on airlines and other modes of transportation today tonight i'm announcing that the transportation safety administration the tsa will double the fines on travelers that refuse to mask if you break the rules be prepared to pay and by the way show some respect the anger you see on television toward flight attendants and others doing their job is wrong it's ugly the fifth piece of my plan is protecting our economic recovery because of our vaccination program and the american rescue plan which we passed thoroughly in my administration we've had record job creation for a new administration economic growth unmatched in 40 years we cannot let unvaccinated do this progress undo it turn it back so tonight i'm announcing additional steps to strengthen our economic recovery we'll be expanding covet 19 economic injury disaster loan programs that's a program that's going to allow small businesses to borrow up to 2 million dollars from the current 500 000 to keep going if covet 19 impacts on their sales these low-interest long-term loans require no repayment for two years and be can use to hire and retain workers purchase inventory or even pay down higher cost debt racked up since the pandemic began i'll also be taking additional steps to help small businesses stay afloat during the pandemic sixth we're going to continue to improve the care of those who do get covet 19. in early july i announced the deployment of surge response teams these are teams comprised of experts from the department of health and human services the cdc the defense department and the federal emergency management agency fema to areas in the country that need help to stem the spread of covet 19. since then the federal government has deployed nearly 1 000 staff including doctors nurses paramedics into 18 states today i'm announcing that the defense department will double the number of military health teams that they'll deploy to help their fellow americans and hospitals around the country additionally we're increasing the availability of new medicines recommended by real doctors not conspiracy conspiracy theorists the monoclonal on antibody treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization up to 70 percent for unvaccinated people at risk of developing severe severe disease we've already distributed 1.4 million courses of these treatments to save lives and reduce the strain on hospitals tonight i'm announcing we will increase the average pace of shipment across the country of free monoclonal antibody treatments by another fifty percent before i close let me say this communities of color are disproportionately impacted by this virus and as we continue to battle covet 19 we will ensure that equity continues to be at the center of our response will ensure that everyone is reached my first responsibility as president is to protect the american people and make sure we have enough vaccine for every american including enough boosters for every american who's approved to get one we also know this virus transcends borders that's why even as we execute this plan at home we need to continue fighting the virus overseas continue to be the arsenal of vaccines we're proud to have donated nearly 140 million vaccines over 90 countries more than all other countries combined including europe china and russia combined that's american leadership on a global stage and that's just the beginning we've also now started to ship another 500 million coveted vaccines pfizer vaccines purchased to donate to 100 lower-income countries in need of vaccines and i'll be announcing additional steps to help the rest of the world later this month as i recently released the key parts of my pandemic preparedness plan so that america isn't caught flat footed with a new pandemic comes look at as it will next month i'm also going to release the plan in greater detail so let me close with this we have so we've made so much progress during the past seven months of this pandemic the recent increases in vaccinations in august already are having an impact in some states where case counts are dropping in recent days even so we remain at a critical moment a critical time we have the tools now we just have to finish the job with truth with science with confidence and together as one nation look we're the united states america there's nothing not a single thing we're unable to do if we do it together so let's stay together god bless you all and all those who continue to serve on the front lines of this pandemic and may god protect our troops get vaccinated [Music] [Applause] president biden in the state dining room there at the white house unveiling the newest chapter in the fight against the virus in this country we'll unpack this very quickly here for you he said all employers with a hundred employees or more have to make sure their employees get fully vaccinated or get weekly testing proving that they're negative he's extending the vaccination requirement already nursing home workers had been required now this is extended to hospitals and home health care workers an executive order coming from the president that will affect all executive branch federal workers and contractors to get vaccinated now the department of labor 100 more workers employers that have 100 or more have to give paid time off give you the time to go get that shot he also brought up boosters there's been a lot of confusion in the country over boosters the potential of that third shot to give you added immunity he said he leaves this in the hands of the fda and the cdc but as soon as they make their decision which is expected in short order in the coming weeks he said we've ordered the boosters they are ready to go in this country he talked about pandemic politics he said if governors and local leaders continue to stand in the way in some parts of this country i'll get them out of the way those were the words from president biden he also talked about doctors across this country the front line workers and so let's bring in dr jen ashton our chief medical editor he said many times you are the front line you are the last voice for many families to encourage them to actually get the shotgen and that's what he's trying to do here and you could hear the frustration from the president saying this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated that nearly 80 million remain unvaccinated in this country and that they are the ones putting their loved ones and communities at risk he did say that david he also said we're in a quote tough stretch here i think that's an understatement and actually went so far as to blame really the unvaccinated saying they're quote blocking public health again that strong emphasis to get people vaccinated but we do have to remember that those vaccines are doing their job largely saving lives there will still be those quote unquote breakthrough cases and i would have liked to hear him mention that a little more okay dr jen ashton following this all with us dr jen thank you and as jen mentioned he said we are in a difficult stretch ahead and in fact these numbers we've been reporting just as millions of school children head back to school across this country at least one in four new cases of covid now involve children and the delta variant now killing more than a thousand americans a day in this country our coverage will continue on abc news live abcnews.com and of course i'll be back with the entire team

https://drsuneeldhand.locals.com",2021-12-28,224124,12879,2449,UCU-Jctu4JTEGFtVnsuqdd5Q, hi everybody dr sunil dand internal medicine physician i hope you all had a fantastic relaxing christmas i certainly did and i spent a decent amount of boxing day actually listening to the radio test match special and hearing england get absolutely hammered by australia unfortunately the great jonathan agnew was commenting for much of the time and i'm well aware that most people watching right now especially in the united states have no clue what i'm talking about from boxing day to jonathan agnew so let me move on to something that you do hopefully understand better and i will explain novovax the traditional covet vaccine seems to be imminently being released in many different parts of the world and back in august i made a video on novavax and i talked about how it is synthesized what type of vaccine it is and the promising study results that we had seen so far the link is down below please watch that if you haven't already the study that i went over from the new england journal of medicine was indeed extremely promising showing equal if not superior efficacy then research results from many of the other mrna vaccine those study results were released months earlier and what i particularly liked and i went over in that video was that the studies of novovacks included many more people who are from vulnerable groups novavax also has certain other advantages as well according to the data we've seen so far including fewer reported side effects and also the fact that novavax doesn't need to be stored at very cold temperatures it is also cheaper and that is very promising for poorer countries that's been something that i've been big on for the last few months we have to self-reflect in the west in richer countries that as many of our vulnerable groups are being offered their third or even fourth vaccine in some instances many other vulnerable groups across the world elderly those with co-morbidities haven't even had the chance to be offered a single vaccine dose yet but hopefully vaccines like novovax will get to them soon i also in my last video went over an article in the atlantic that talked about novavax in detail and it was actually titled mrna vaccines are extraordinary but novavax is even better and in this article they actually said that novovac so far had shown substantially fewer side effects than other vaccines which is a good thing within the last couple of months nature.com also published a piece about how novavax and other protein vaccines could be game changes across the world to recap again briefly on novovax it is a vaccine that actually contains the spike protein from the virus which has been synthesized and it's added to an adjuvant i went over this in my last video it induces an immune response to give you antibodies how is this different from mrna vaccines well mrna vaccines use mrna to instruct the body to genetically produce the spike protein which then elicits the immune response that is the key difference so in that respect novovax is much more similar to traditional vaccines in directly inducing an immune response and in fact it's the same technology that is used in hepatitis b and pertussis that is whooping cough vaccines currently and a quick recap again on how vaccines work because there's been a lot of confusion over the last couple of years and i've said this before vaccines don't magically give you antibodies vaccines that make your body produce an immune response that gives you antibodies and that's why i've always kind of smiled over the last couple of years when there's a certain segment of people out there who continuously almost seem to deny natural immunity well how do vaccines work vaccines work by taking advantage of your natural immunity therefore if you deny natural immunity you are also denying vaccinated immunity think about that logically for a second let's come back to novavax and particular developments then over the last several weeks because when i made my video in august it seemed like it was imminently going to be released but apparently the company has been beset with manufacturing issues which have delayed its production in november then indonesia became the first country to officially authorize the nova vaxx vaccine indonesia population 275 million and it's the fourth largest country in the world so a huge amount of people are about to have access to novavax within the last week the world health organization issued an emergency use authorization for novovax making it the 9th covid vaccine to be approved it is called kovavx and it's actually manufactured by an indian company under novovax's license and also within the last few days the european medicines agency has recommended granting authorization to novovax and the expected date of delivery is the first quarter of 2022. in addition i'd also like to add that i read some recent data showing that novovac shows a very promising immune response against the omicron variant of covid19 which is very pertinent for the situation we're dealing with now as for the united states what's going on well i did read that fda submission is looming so i do hope that novovax is going to be released in the united states soon i was recently watching cable tv for me i was flicking through the channels and i stumbled across a financial channel and they had this whole segment on vaccine market share and how different companies were battling for vaccine market share there was no talk about the science no talk about how covert 19 was affecting people they were simply focused on the financials and we have to be realistic here and i say this as someone who's lived in the united states for a few years and understanding how things work i really hope there's no strange behind-the-scenes lobbying going on here because let's be realistic these vaccines have generated billions of dollars for many companies all across the world so no company is going to want to quote unquote give up its market share now i am no socialist capitalism has many positives but it also has many drawbacks and if we are going to allow companies to make billions of dollars then we must also allow a fair amount of competition and there to be an even playing field so if novovax is approved in many other parts of the world there's absolutely no reason why we shouldn't see it in the united states very soon anything less would be unacceptable the general public deserves access to a wide range of vaccine choices let's all be watching very carefully over the next few weeks to see what happens with novavax thanks everyone for listening dr sunil dan medstroik lifestyle medicine join me as well on locals.com it

and in today's video we're talking about the covid vaccine and the side effects that i experienced after having covid then getting the vaccine about two and a half months later now i'm a physical therapist i'm not an immunologist or an infectious disease physician and i'm definitely not your physician or health care provider this is just my experience as someone who has had covet 19 then received the vaccine two and a half months later now i was hesitant at first about getting the vaccine because like a lot of people i contracted coveted back in december there were a ton of questions about how long you should wait until getting the vaccine after you'd been infected how long the antibodies would work to keep you protected against another coveted infection and so on because the last thing i wanted to do was to get covert again so i did some research and originally the cdc recommended waiting 90 days to get the coveted vaccine if you already had covid that suggestion changed so now as long as you are out of isolation you're no longer contagious and you're clinically recovered from coven 19 it's recommended that you're vaccinated now for some people that may be as little as one month after having contracted covet personally i had my vaccine just two a little over two months after recovering from covid and i know this is a big point of contention whether or not you even need the vaccine after contracting covid and i really want to hear what you think it's a good question let me know in the comments my goal here is not to convince you one way or the other but i do want to share my symptoms that i had after getting the covet vaccine now if you've never had covid your first dose of the vaccine may not produce any symptoms at all besides some soreness at the injection site and it's usually not until that second vaccine that you'll have some symptoms because your body recognizes the protein that should not be there and it recruits those newly built t lymphocytes and antibodies as a response to fight which is why you might feel some of those symptoms you might feel a slight fever or get a headache feel nauseous or just feel really tired and fatigued or have some muscle soreness in your arm or throughout your entire body but if you had kova 19 already like i did you'll likely feel these symptoms with your first shot and that's because your body has already had a natural response when you had covet initially so the virus fighting cells are already in place to combat that recognized protein in the vaccine which will help to prompt that type of typical response of a slight fever or headache or muscle aches and fatigue and that's exactly how i felt with both doses of the moderna vaccine and the symptoms they lasted for about two days each time personally i chose to get the vaccine on a friday because i thought it would cause me to feel fatigued with muscle aches and soreness and sure enough it did i did that for about two days but by monday i was back at work in the clinic and i didn't have any symptoms or side effects after that now the second shot that was absolutely identical for me in terms of symptoms and after looking into the research even more i think it would have been really nice to have that opportunity to get the single dose covered vaccine if that was available at the time because there is some research out there showing that if you already had covid19 one vaccine dose it may be good enough in terms of developing a strong number of antibodies to help fight against future infection now there is no formal statement by the cdc regarding a one-dose treatment for people who were previously infected with covid19 but if i had to have a choice today i would prefer to get the one dose vaccine so that i didn't have to experience an extra weekend of being fatigued with annoying muscle aches and so that the the two dose vaccine could reach those folks who needed it most but honestly after having the second dose of the vaccine uh the worst part was just some muscle soreness and feeling tired all weekend just for a couple of days and again i'm just sharing my experience here with the vaccine and the symptoms that i had as someone who's had covid and then also experienced the light side effects that you hear about in terms of the vaccine it's really not that bad for the muscle aches i took some advil and then i used a massage gun to work out the soreness i made sure to move around often and then to drink plenty of water and thankfully none of the side effects are loss of smell or taste like it is with the actual virus for many people i did recover my sense of smell and taste which you can learn more about in that video right here but i am curious let me know what your thoughts are do you plan on getting the vaccine let me know in the comments and if you found this video to be helpful let me know by hitting that like button and consider subscribing to the channel thanks for

293,QAeJ35FGSIw,POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS COVID VACCINE - COVID-19 Vaccine Adverse effects &amp; Allergy,"COVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19, without us having to get the illness. Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection, but with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes and antibodies that will remember how to fight that virus in the future.
It typically takes a few weeks for the body to produce T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes after vaccination.
Sometimes after vaccination, the process of building immunity can cause symptoms, such as fever, muscle pain, fatigue etc. These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building immunity. 
So, it’s very important that you understand the minor side-effects of Covid vaccine and also we will discuss some of the rare but serious complications that can occur.

Vaccines work by introducing a small number of bacteria, virus or toxin into the body. Because the bacteria, virus or toxin have been killed or weakened, there's no risk of contracting the disease in question. However, your body responds as if it were under attack, and mounts an immune response. If, in the future, you do encounter that disease, you'll have an army of cells and antibodies ready to fight it.

Most common side effects include : 
Injection site pain • tiredness • headache • muscle pain • chills, swollen lymph nodes • joint pain • fever • injection site swelling • injection site redness & nausea

295,i2wnAW0JMxo,Trying to get a Covid vaccine with needle phobia - BBC News,"Adam wants to get his Covid vaccine - but an extreme fear of needles is holding him back.

The 23-year-old says it's not the pain he's afraid of, but the thought of the injection itself - and the needle piercing his skin.

""It feels like you have no way out, you can't do anything, your heart rate's pushing 200, you can't focus on anything… it’s about a pathological fear of needles.""

A recent Oxford University survey of more than 15,000 adults in the UK suggests needle phobia accounts for about 10% of Covid vaccine hesitancy.

The survey also suggests reluctance to get the Covid jab is generally a bit higher in younger people and some ethnic minority groups.

proceed from here and who's next in line for the jab our science correspondent rebecca morrell reports from margaret keenan in december the first person to be vaccinated to less than 10 weeks later 15 million people have had their first dose so who will be vaccinated next and when the next stage starts with 65 to 69 year olds that's nearly 3 million people and those with underlying health conditions an estimated 7 million next up it's 2 million 60 to 64 year olds then the 5 million 50 to 59 year olds that's a total of more than 17 million people who'll be offered vaccines by the end of april then for phase 2 another 21 million people the rest of the adult population should be vaccinated by the autumn more than a million over 65s have already been sent letters this weekend and some areas have even started delivering jabs it's an indication of the different demographics of different parts of the country obviously certain populations will have much higher proportions of those people who are over 70 or who are housebound and that will take longer in my practice in north london we are vaccinating already those people over 60 and 65. people with some medical conditions are also being invited these include chronic lung disease down syndrome diabetes some cancers and morbid obesity so how will we know if vaccination is working the best place to look is israel which has inoculated more of its population than anywhere else in the world and hospitalizations of those who were vaccinated first the over 60s are falling much faster than other groups so when could we see an impact in the uk in about a week's time we may well see beginnings of an effect in hospitalizations particularly in older people relative to changes in younger people it'll be cases it's going to be a little bit less clear i think because vaccine doesn't necessarily stop mild cases in the coming weeks could there be any problems there will be some bumps in supply with pfizer overhauling its factory in belgium new variants could also pose a problem and booster shots might be needed to improve immunity levels in the uk are still high but vaccinations should soon make a difference helping us map a

BUT OF MONEY WATCH REPORTER  MEGAN CIRILLO!, GETTING  APPROVED FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTION  IS NO EASY PROCESS, ESPECIALLY  NOW THAT THE FDA HAS FULLY  APPROVED THE PFIZER SHOT.  MEGAN JOINS ME NOW TO DISCUSS.  CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW EXEMPTIONS  FROM A VACCINE MANDATE WORKS,  IS IT A MATTER OF GETTING A  DOCTORS NOTE?  >> THERE ARE TWO GROUPS OF  EXEMPTIONS FROM MANDATES.  WORKERS CAN REQUEST RELIGIOUS  EXEMPTIONS AND MEDICAL  EXEMPTIONS.  THERE ARE NO KNOWN MEDICAL  CONDITIONS THAT INTERFERE OUT  RIGHT WITH VACCINATION.  SO WORKERS HAVE TO VERY  SPECIFICALLY DOCUMENT WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES THEM INELIGIBLE FOR  VACCINATION AND THEY CAN THEN  REQUEST AN ACCOMMODATION FROM  THEIR EMPLOYER.  >> SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE  MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT MIGHT  MAKE SOMEONE INELIGIBLE FOR  VACCINATION AND WHAT CONDITIONS  DO NOT APPLY?  >> THERE ARE NO KNOWN MEDICAL  CONDITIONS AND NO  CONTRAINDICATIONS OTHER THAN  SEVERE ALLERGIES TO GIVEN  VACCINE COMPONENTS.  SO ANYONE WHO HAD A SEVERE  ALLERGIC REACTION TO A FIRST  DOSE WOULD BE INELIGIBLE OR  ANYONE WHO HAS A DOCUMENTED  ALLERGY TO A KNOWN VACCINE  COMPONENT.  WHAT IS INTERESTING, THOUGH, IS  THERE ARE THREE VACCINE  ALTERNATIVES  SO, IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT  SOMEONE WOULD BE ALLERGIC TO  ALL THREE VACCINES, AND THE  REACTION HAS TO BE SEVERE.  A LOT OF US HAD A SORE ARM  AFTER RECEIVING YOUR VACCINES.  A WORKER WOULD HAVE TO DOCUMENT  -- WOULD HAVE TO SHOW THAT THEY  HAD TROUBLE BREATHING, FOR  EXAMPLE, THAT WOULD QUALIFY AS  A SEVERE REACTION.  >> THE OTHER PART OF THAT, WE  HAVE HEARD PEOPLE SAY THEY DO  NOT WANT TO GET IT BECAUSE THEY  ARE PREGNANT OR THEY WOULD LIKE  TO GET PREGNANT OR THEY HAVE A  PEANUT ALLERGY AND WE KNOW FROM  THE DOCTORS WE HAVE SPOKEN TO  THAT THEY BELIEVE PEOPLE IN ALL  OF THOSE CATEGORIES SHOULD IN  FACT GET VACCINATED.  ARE THERE ANY OTHER EXCUSES  PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO PUT  FORWARD THAT SIMPLY DO NOT FLY?  >> YOU ASKED WHAT CONDITIONS  WOULD NOT QUALIFY AN INDIVIDUAL  FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTION.  SIMILAR TO THE RELIGIOUS BELIEF  EXEMPTION, SIMPLY SAYING I DO  NOT BELIEVE -- I BELIEVE IN GOD  IS NOT GOING TO GET YOU AN  EXEMPTION.  SAYING YOU HAVE A PEANUT  ALLERGY IS IRRELEVANT BECAUSE  THERE ARE NO PEANUTS IN THESE  VACCINES.  INDIVIDUALS WHO CLAIM THAT THEY  ARE WORRIED IT WILL HARM THEIR  EFFECT OF PREGNANCY OR  FERTILITY, THOSE ARE ALSO MYTHS  THAT HAVE BEEN DEBUNKED BY  LARGE STUDIES.  SO, THAT IS NOT GOING TO FLY.  >> IF YOU ARE IN THE VERY RARE  CASE WHERE YOU ACTUALLY DO  QUALIFY FOR A MEDICAL EXEMPTION  FROM THE VACCINE, CAN EMPLOYERS  STILL MANDATE TESTING, MASK  WEARING, IS THERE ANY  LIMITATION THEN WANTS YOU GET  AN EXEMPTION ON OTHER CONDITIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKPLACE  STAYS SAFE?  >> IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE HOW  RARE THESE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS  ARE.  HUNTER BIDEN'S ROLE FOR  EXAMPLE, AND COMPANIES THAT  EMPLOY MORE WORKERS, MUST  REQUIRE VACCINATIONS OR ELSE  REQUIRE WORKERS TO TEST WEEKLY.  FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO DOES NOT  WANT TO TAKE THE VACCINE FOR  WHATEVER REASON, RELIGIOUS,  MEDICAL OR OTHERWISE, CAN  INSTEAD DECIDE THAT THEY WANT  TO TEST WEEKLY.  HOWEVER, COMPANIES HAVE THE  RIGHT TO SET THE TERMS AND  CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT AND IF  A COMPANY DOES HAVE A TRUE  VACCINE MANDATE WITH NO TESTING  OPTION, IF A WORKER DOES NOT  QUALIFY FOR A MEDICAL EXEMPTION  OR A RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION, THEY  CAN BE TERMINATED LEGALLY.  >> THAT IS WHAT I WAS GOING TO  ASK, IF PEOPLE REFUSE TO GET  VACCINATED, DO NOT HAVE A VALID  EXCEPTION, WHETHER RELIGIOUS OR  MEDICAL, DOES THE EMPLOYER NEED  TO DO ANYTHING ELSE OR CAN THEY  JUST SAY, OKAY, SORRY, THIS IS  THE END OF THE ROAD FOR US?  >> THEY CAN, IF THERE IS NO  GUILT IN ACCOMMODATION LIKE  TESTING AND IT DOES NOT MEET  THE THRESHOLD FOR RECEIVING A  MEDICAL OR RELIGIOUS  VACCINATION, THE COMPANY IS  WITHIN THEIR RIGHT TO FIRE THAT  EMPLOYEE"

301,QAeJ35FGSIw,POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS COVID VACCINE - COVID-19 Vaccine Adverse effects &amp; Allergy,"COVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19, without us having to get the illness. Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection, but with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes and antibodies that will remember how to fight that virus in the future.
It typically takes a few weeks for the body to produce T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes after vaccination.
Sometimes after vaccination, the process of building immunity can cause symptoms, such as fever, muscle pain, fatigue etc. These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building immunity. 
So, it’s very important that you understand the minor side-effects of Covid vaccine and also we will discuss some of the rare but serious complications that can occur.

Vaccines work by introducing a small number of bacteria, virus or toxin into the body. Because the bacteria, virus or toxin have been killed or weakened, there's no risk of contracting the disease in question. However, your body responds as if it were under attack, and mounts an immune response. If, in the future, you do encounter that disease, you'll have an army of cells and antibodies ready to fight it.

Most common side effects include : 
Injection site pain • tiredness • headache • muscle pain • chills, swollen lymph nodes • joint pain • fever • injection site swelling • injection site redness & nausea

minister acknowledged there was much more work to do the return to normal is still some way off jonathan blake bbc news so having reached the first major vaccination target how does the rollout proceed from here and who's next in line for the jab our science correspondent rebecca morrell reports from margaret keenan in december the first person to be vaccinated to less than 10 weeks later 15 million people have had their first dose so who will be vaccinated next and when the next stage starts with 65 to 69 year olds that's nearly 3 million people and those with underlying health conditions an estimated 7 million next up it's 2 million 60 to 64 year olds then the 5 million 50 to 59 year olds that's a total of more than 17 million people who'll be offered vaccines by the end of april then for phase 2 another 21 million people the rest of the adult population should be vaccinated by the autumn more than a million over 65s have already been sent letters this weekend and some areas have even started delivering jabs it's an indication of the different demographics of different parts of the country obviously certain populations will have much higher proportions of those people who are over 70 or who are housebound and that will take longer in my practice in north london we are vaccinating already those people over 60 and 65. people with some medical conditions are also being invited these include chronic lung disease down syndrome diabetes some cancers and morbid obesity so how will we know if vaccination is working the best place to look is israel which has inoculated more of its population than anywhere else in the world and hospitalizations of those who were vaccinated first the over 60s are falling much faster than other groups so when could we see an impact in the uk in about a week's time we may well see beginnings of an effect in hospitalizations particularly in older people relative to changes in younger people it'll be cases it's going to be a little bit less clear i think because vaccine doesn't necessarily stop mild cases in the coming weeks could there be any problems there will be some bumps in supply with pfizer overhauling its factory in belgium new variants could also pose a problem and booster shots might be needed to improve immunity levels in the uk are still high but vaccinations should soon make a difference helping us map a path out of lockdown rebecca morell bbc news

BUT OF MONEY WATCH REPORTER  MEGAN CIRILLO!, GETTING  APPROVED FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTION  IS NO EASY PROCESS, ESPECIALLY  NOW THAT THE FDA HAS FULLY  APPROVED THE PFIZER SHOT.  MEGAN JOINS ME NOW TO DISCUSS.  CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW EXEMPTIONS  FROM A VACCINE MANDATE WORKS,  IS IT A MATTER OF GETTING A  DOCTORS NOTE?  >> THERE ARE TWO GROUPS OF  EXEMPTIONS FROM MANDATES.  WORKERS CAN REQUEST RELIGIOUS  EXEMPTIONS AND MEDICAL  EXEMPTIONS.  THERE ARE NO KNOWN MEDICAL  CONDITIONS THAT INTERFERE OUT  RIGHT WITH VACCINATION.  SO WORKERS HAVE TO VERY  SPECIFICALLY DOCUMENT WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES THEM INELIGIBLE FOR  VACCINATION AND THEY CAN THEN  REQUEST AN ACCOMMODATION FROM  THEIR EMPLOYER.  >> SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE  MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT MIGHT  MAKE SOMEONE INELIGIBLE FOR  VACCINATION AND WHAT CONDITIONS  DO NOT APPLY?  >> THERE ARE NO KNOWN MEDICAL  CONDITIONS AND NO  CONTRAINDICATIONS OTHER THAN  SEVERE ALLERGIES TO GIVEN  VACCINE COMPONENTS.  SO ANYONE WHO HAD A SEVERE  ALLERGIC REACTION TO A FIRST  DOSE WOULD BE INELIGIBLE OR  ANYONE WHO HAS A DOCUMENTED  ALLERGY TO A KNOWN VACCINE  COMPONENT.  WHAT IS INTERESTING, THOUGH, IS  THERE ARE THREE VACCINE  ALTERNATIVES  SO, IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT  SOMEONE WOULD BE ALLERGIC TO  ALL THREE VACCINES, AND THE  REACTION HAS TO BE SEVERE.  A LOT OF US HAD A SORE ARM  AFTER RECEIVING YOUR VACCINES.  A WORKER WOULD HAVE TO DOCUMENT  -- WOULD HAVE TO SHOW THAT THEY  HAD TROUBLE BREATHING, FOR  EXAMPLE, THAT WOULD QUALIFY AS  A SEVERE REACTION.  >> THE OTHER PART OF THAT, WE  HAVE HEARD PEOPLE SAY THEY DO  NOT WANT TO GET IT BECAUSE THEY  ARE PREGNANT OR THEY WOULD LIKE  TO GET PREGNANT OR THEY HAVE A  PEANUT ALLERGY AND WE KNOW FROM  THE DOCTORS WE HAVE SPOKEN TO  THAT THEY BELIEVE PEOPLE IN ALL  OF THOSE CATEGORIES SHOULD IN  FACT GET VACCINATED.  ARE THERE ANY OTHER EXCUSES  PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO PUT  FORWARD THAT SIMPLY DO NOT FLY?  >> YOU ASKED WHAT CONDITIONS  WOULD NOT QUALIFY AN INDIVIDUAL  FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTION.  SIMILAR TO THE RELIGIOUS BELIEF  EXEMPTION, SIMPLY SAYING I DO  NOT BELIEVE -- I BELIEVE IN GOD  IS NOT GOING TO GET YOU AN  EXEMPTION.  SAYING YOU HAVE A PEANUT  ALLERGY IS IRRELEVANT BECAUSE  THERE ARE NO PEANUTS IN THESE  VACCINES.  INDIVIDUALS WHO CLAIM THAT THEY  ARE WORRIED IT WILL HARM THEIR  EFFECT OF PREGNANCY OR  FERTILITY, THOSE ARE ALSO MYTHS  THAT HAVE BEEN DEBUNKED BY  LARGE STUDIES.  SO, THAT IS NOT GOING TO FLY.  >> IF YOU ARE IN THE VERY RARE  CASE WHERE YOU ACTUALLY DO  QUALIFY FOR A MEDICAL EXEMPTION  FROM THE VACCINE, CAN EMPLOYERS  STILL MANDATE TESTING, MASK  WEARING, IS THERE ANY  LIMITATION THEN WANTS YOU GET  AN EXEMPTION ON OTHER CONDITIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKPLACE  STAYS SAFE?  >> IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE HOW  RARE THESE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS  ARE.  HUNTER BIDEN'S ROLE FOR  EXAMPLE, AND COMPANIES THAT  EMPLOY MORE WORKERS, MUST  REQUIRE VACCINATIONS OR ELSE  REQUIRE WORKERS TO TEST WEEKLY.  FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO DOES NOT  WANT TO TAKE THE VACCINE FOR  WHATEVER REASON, RELIGIOUS,  MEDICAL OR OTHERWISE, CAN  INSTEAD DECIDE THAT THEY WANT  TO TEST WEEKLY.  HOWEVER, COMPANIES HAVE THE  RIGHT TO SET THE TERMS AND  CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT AND IF  A COMPANY DOES HAVE A TRUE  VACCINE MANDATE WITH NO TESTING  OPTION, IF A WORKER DOES NOT  QUALIFY FOR A MEDICAL EXEMPTION  OR A RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION, THEY  CAN BE TERMINATED LEGALLY.  >> THAT IS WHAT I WAS GOING TO  ASK, IF PEOPLE REFUSE TO GET  VACCINATED, DO NOT HAVE A VALID  EXCEPTION, WHETHER RELIGIOUS OR  MEDICAL, DOES THE EMPLOYER NEED  TO DO ANYTHING ELSE OR CAN THEY  JUST SAY, OKAY, SORRY, THIS IS  THE END OF THE ROAD FOR US?  >> THEY CAN, IF THERE IS NO  GUILT IN ACCOMMODATION LIKE  TESTING AND IT DOES NOT MEET  THE THRESHOLD FOR RECEIVING A  MEDICAL OR RELIGIOUS  VACCINATION, THE COMPANY IS  WITHIN THEIR RIGHT TO FIRE THAT  EMPLOYEE"

tremendous morning here and uh what an occasion yeah bill shakespeare from warwickshire himself this first person uh in the uk to get the vaccine of course william shakespeare uh born lived just 22 or so miles down here and back in the day in what 15 hundreds or so he was writing about the plague wasn't here now bill shakespeare uh from warwickshire himself some 456 years later or so uh is now the first man to have the vaccine well the first lady to administer the vaccine was mae parsons let me just introduce this you're talking about her earlier on pierce we've found for you here she's not on ifb she's an amazing job for us gives a sense of what you're feeling this morning well it was all positive for me i think it's a tremendous historical event and for the plans i make that we know everyone knows what the cost of it in human lives and things and i think the fact that we were able to offer the first vaccine today to everyone i think it's a positive historical event and i'm so proud to be able to kind of contribute to that to that positive step towards stopping this pandemic and how are you feeling at 6 30 won't be administered to vaccines because it's a big job because you've got all the cameras here the world's media watching you you're an experienced nurse been here for what 24 years working yeah so yeah 24 years i've started my nursing career i've been hearing this trust for 17 years ever since i came to the um country so um yes but i have had a lot of experience in terms of injections and ims and flu jabs i've given a couple of hundred a few months ago so i've had lots of practice in the 20 years career i have so yeah so it's just going back and stepping back and making sure that i follow the policy do all the right things for the patient make sure that she's safe and comfortable and then um and that's it really i think it's the afterwards that's kind of a bit overwhelming well margaret's now she's perhaps she's safe well yes she's hoping to go

you the philippines they'll be going crazy in the philippines about the fact it's a filipino nurse who has actually administered the first covert 19 vaccine job so a huge moment for the nhs huge moment for the uk but also a huge moment for the philippines you send so many fantastic people here to work in our health system yeah just wonderful to speak to mae there and there's so many nurses just around the corner that's where all the vaccines have been taken place since 6 31 this morning they're just beginning to there's majors wandering off now i hope she has found a cup of tea she's she's such a lovely lady he really is uh the first care home worker is now being administered the vaccine as we've said uh william shakespeare as well let's just hear from margaret show she was the very first person margaret keenan 91 years old next week it's her birthday she was the very first person to receive the vaccine you're part of a moment of history the first to receive this vaccine how does that feel it hasn't sunk in yet i can't really answer that question yet it's just really i don't know what to say it's just it was at first really yeah what do you say to those who might be having second thoughts about having this well i would say go for it go for it because it's it's free and it's the best thing that's ever happened at the moment so do please go for it that's all i say you know if i can do it well so can you absolutely brilliant and what can she say she she's a remarkable lady she's 91 next week i think she retired as a jeweller shop assistant four years ago she was 87 and still working she's from ennis skillin originally i think in northern ireland it's a great lived in coventry for over 60 years let's hear a little bit more from our pioneer margaret keenan oh my word as i've just said before at the moment on the high field it's just just so strange and so wonderful really yeah so anyway you see this is for a good cause so i'm so pleased i had it done yeah did you ever think in your whole 90 years you would ever be sitting here the first person to have a covet vaccination no never ever does anything come close in your lifetime to this moment no i i can't think of anything no not true it's so so different than you know i this is a terrible terrible disease so we do we do want rid of it you know so anything that helps it's a bonus isn't it really i don't know what else to say really what do your family make of you being here today being well they don't find it tall they're all for us it's liberating isn't it um jonathan swain for people like uh margaret keenan this it unlocks the year for her she has this uh first dose of the vaccine today in 21 days she gets the second dose you know like like many people in that age group many many more people out of that age group as well self isolating for most of the year unable to enjoy life you know sort of an almost permanent lockdown and now she can feel much more confident about living her life again and and that's what we all want for everybody it's a giant leap forward isn't it what's happening just around the corner from here in terms of a giant leap forward for us all getting back to some kind of normality if not now or before christmas but certainly in the spring certainly by the summer that's what all the nhs staff are telling us this morning and in terms of margaret herself well she is hoping now after the second dose in 21 days time that's by the 29th she'll have some form of protection i know that that's sort of quite limited because she's still exposed to the virus but then she is then hoping to spend new year with her family she has grandchildren and she has a son and a daughter so after spending so much time as you say in self-isolation uh for her there's a great sense of normality and what a great start to the new year not just for margaret but for bill and for all the other people that have been vaccinated around 100 or so here today in coventry there'll be thousands more around the country today 800 or so thousand doses are here in this country millions more doses will come into the country before christmas and into the new year i mean just tremendous and then if you can just feel the sort of atmosphere here it's just so nice seeing nhs staff and the nurses just they've got smiles on their faces for the first time and you genuinely do get the sense that this is a huge huge day and a massive step forward for not just coventry i'm a local lad so i'm really proud that this hospital is the first uh in the country to be doing it but so we normally um people to coventry as a punishment today we sent the pfizer covert 19 vaccine to save the world so coventry has really bounced back [Music] he absolutely has piers and it's just so great on the map for all the right reasons i mean my dad you know in his eighties himself and as he lived through the blitz uh during the war coventry was was hammered then and uh it's got a football team who i support who are are doing okay they don't have a stadium at the moment so and coventry has been through it it's a bit of a ghost town at the moment people have been telling me family members with kovid they are in tier three so not a huge amount to celebrate at the moment but the people are wonderful here and you can see from may who has spoken to just the effort and what it meant to her to administer the first vaccination here it's a great moment for coventry and uh yeah i'm really proud of the place this morning yeah jonathan it's fantastic news so the phased vaccination program will see patients aged 80 and above already attended some brilliant footage just watch this this is margaret the first person margaret keenan this is her being clapped out after having the vaccine give it a bit of volume [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] absolutely brilliant brilliant so we've seen these scenes didn't we throughout the first wave of the pandemic when people survived kovid after weeks or months in some cases getting clapped out by unbelievably exhausted but relieved staff and now they've got a moment yeah of just total jubilation yeah this is not somebody who's had to survive or beat the virus it's somebody who's now been protected from it against getting the virus totally different dynamic that is margaret keenan 19 years 91 next week says it's the best birthday present she's ever had so as i'm saying the phased vaccination program sees patients aged 80 and above who are already attending hospital as an outpatient and those who are being discharged home after a hospital stay they will be first in line there care home providers going to begin booking staff in of course because we want our care workers to get this vaccine gps are expected to be able to begin vaccinating care home residents because my goodness we need to be back in contact with our friends and family who are currently in lockdown in care homes um so it's an absolute i mean margaret keenan 90 years old is a total pioneer you

Twitter: @HillTVLive",2023-04-26,160091,4028,2874,UCPWXiRWZ29zrxPFIQT7eHSA, [Music] prime minister Justin Trudeau earned blowback online after he claimed during a recent interview that he didn't force anyone to get vaccinated let's watch since the Spanish flew my responsibility was to keep as many Canadians alive as possible and all of the scientists and the medical experts and the researchers not just in Canada but around the world understood that vaccination was going to be the way through this and therefore while not forcing anyone to get vaccinated I chose to make sure that all the incentives and all the protections were there to encourage Canadians to get vaccinated and that's exactly what they did we got vaccinated to a higher level than just about any other of our peer countries and that's why we had a less deadly pandemic so I think he's being rightly blasted because he did say something there that is not true he said well not forcing anyone to get vaccinated that is simply not true the truckers were forced to be vaccinated they later reversed that policy but but you were going to be required if you're going to be a truck driver coming to Canada you're going to have to be vaccinated and so that's like that that claim is false which is which gets so frustrating about people like in Trudeau's position who are railing and earlier in the in the that clip he's railing against misinformation and disinformation and how harmful it is and how dangerous speech is because people are just saying things that are wildly untrue wouldn't be better if you had czars of Truth to guard against anybody saying anything that was wrong but the people that would appoint themselves to be the czars ritualistically say things that are not true about the pandemic and every other subject because we are fallible and we are all prone to error and that's why you're supposed to generally support a climate of free speech and letting people speak because there's no way to just put the person who's right about everything in charge of deciding what you're allowed to say so I I it's it's shameful that he would say that so I think that his argument would be and you heard him make it a little bit there that you know he was creating incentives uh the carrots rather than sticks to encourage people to get vaccinated and that technically I think there was a mandate for public sector employees there was obviously the whole uh Michigan with the the truckers boycott but technically if you were willing to not do that job to quit a job could not enter a certain kind of public space no employment if you wanted to be sure if he means it was voluntary because he was not sending Jack booted thugs to lock up people for refusing to be vaccinated sure but he was not giving the freedom to be employed in several professions and and I I think that in other kinds of mandates were promulgated by the territories but not by the federal government so you can read that as kind of judging the truth which I think is completely fair but I do think that opens up a broader conversation about what the Civil civil liberties line should actually be I really do wish that earlier in covid and now there had been a conversation about what it means when there is a public health interest in a certain kind of compliance and how far due to that interest states are ethically able to go to encourage a certain kind of behavior I've been very consistent throughout saying I wish the government had offered a lot more in the way of carrots rather than sticks in other countries people were sent food to their homes to encourage them to be able to stay home you're given a social safety net and support that allow you to not be at your job and there was obviously some of that during covid but to say I'm not gonna you're not gonna risk eviction and be homeless or unemployed or not be able to pay your bills because you're staying home the government acknowledges that you're taking this hit for a public good and there therefore we're going to compensate you and make sure that you're made whole I think that kind of a posture is very different from one you're suddenly asking people to internalize all of these downsides of restricting their behavior so who knows what have happened in that instance who would have known if there had been more free sending out of tests and high quality masks and food and other kinds of Provisions but you know are we are we also in agreement that there perhaps are instances where the public threat is so significant that something akin to a mandate does need to happen for example the way that we mandate various vaccines be taken for children who enter Public Schools well right that has an actual and you know there are some people who think those are not proper anyway in fact some Republican state legislators are I think seeking to undo them so I'm not going to pretend there wasn't a debate about that prior there was but at least the argument is for a public health benefit that's the argument they tried to deploy for the covet vaccine but it just turned out it did not at all meet that standard of of significantly protecting a third party if you're vaccinated and of course there was always good reason to suspect whether people like truckers who are you know driving who aren't trucks by themselves were at risk of exposing tons of people right to covid if they were vaccinated I largely agree with that but I don't want us to memory whole the extent to which one of the arguments was that the hospitals our Public Health infrastructure were being overwhelmed because so many people were being hospitalized with covet so some of the third party risk isn't that you're going to transmit the disease which the vaccine never really significantly prevented but that even if it's not just a you issue it's not just a personal issue it's my choice not to take the vaccine causes there to be such an overflow with a hospital that people who need a liver transplant or cancer treatment or whatever can't access that because the public health infrastructure is overburdened and look and vaccinating at-risk people older people significantly reduce the risk of hospital overcrowding because those are the people that were wildly disproportionately likely there was a David Wallace Wells who interviewed foucher yesterday you know put it in his article he's written about this previously we still it is difficult to convey with words just how egregious the age skew of severe covet is so and and many and because of the increased risk many many elderly people in this country did get vaccinated in fact the overwhelming majority of them and and that was good and and couldn't the vaccine pitch be a little bit more individually tailored but what they went with at the time what was so you got to get this so that the risk of anyone else catching it goes down for you know do that to protect the people around you yeah to protect your grandma that just wasn't yeah if it comes out that they knew that the vaccines weren't effective in limiting transition transmission and they still push that narrative I would be very upset about it if they hoped it had had that effect and they pushed that narrative kind of optimistically I will still be upset about it but it doesn't seem quite as nefarious and I do think there's there's some extent to which they were waiting waiting and seeing it and rolling out vaccines very quickly and didn't entirely know the effects given that ambiguity I would have liked to have thought thought that they wouldn't go so hard on the public shaming narrative that said if you don't get the vaccine it's because you're selfish just because you don't care about your neighbor you don't care about your family Etc that that seems to me to be a real messaging and there were a lot of people who were skeptical that it was going to stop cases at the time which was contrary to what the health officials were saying so the fact that where those people just accidentally write or was there a good you know good basis based on the fact that other you know the flu vaccine actually doesn't even stop you maybe it lowers your the efficacy of the first strain and the first vaccine dose did seem to play out a little bit differently and a little bit more in favor of what was predicted than the later stream it held up for a while but and as fauci conceded in that article yesterday he said he expected the production to be a a essentially Decades of protection rather than as it turned out probably a yeah months of uh I got my breakthrough case what four-ish months after my my original shots so yeah you know yeah well uh he's getting getting a lot of heat for this and I hope there's some reflection on the words that we use and whether or not making these kind of broad claims um is going to be perceived as any kind of accurate versus this information of its own we're Rising after this [Music]

#ABCNewsIndepth #ABCNewsAustralia",2021-09-07,233841,2093,1149,UCxcrzzhQDj5zKJbXfIscCtg, [Music] this is the mrna vaccine by moderna it's the third to be approved by the australian regulator it's been used extensively in the u.s and accounts for 140 million vaccinations there that's about 40 percent of all doses but it's just gaining ground here so what do we actually know about it [Music] like pfizer's vaccine medunas works with mrna it goes into our cells it helps our cells make the protein and then it disappears mrna or messenger rna is a temporary carrier of genetic instructions that tells our cells to make a particular protein in this case it's the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus it doesn't become part of our genome and it is indeed just you know a transient instruction [Music] the mrna is wrapped in a fatty coating that helps it enter our cells and once the instruction in the mrna is inside the cells use it to make the protein and display it on the surface immune cells then recognize that those spike proteins don't belong there and lock onto them they learn to create antibodies against them and then we retain a memory of that which is enhanced when we go for our second dose of vaccine the mrna then gets broken down quickly after its contents are delivered and used [Music] mrna vaccines are something australia doesn't have the capacity to produce just yet that's why we're getting our supply from the us where moderna is based we would receive a million doses during the course of september and then three million in each of october november and december that adds up to 10 million doses being delivered by the end of the year the fisa bio intake and the moderna mrna vaccines are actually remarkably similar and it is quite amazing that these two independent companies on different continents over the similar period of time managed to develop vaccines that are so remarkably similar the same spike protein is produced but the sequences differ in the exact wording of the genetic code for the spike protein even if the underlying mrna sequence is different the spike protein it produces is essentially identical because each amino acid in the protein can be coded by a variety of different sequences you could think about it this way one plus four equals five but three plus two also equals five the two vaccines use different oily coatings that doesn't matter so much because the oily coating dissolves once it's inside the cell anyway the meduta formula also has a hundred micrograms of mrna material while pfizer has 30. they tested different amounts and then they stuck with the amount that worked best for them if you get the modern vaccine the two doses will be spaced four weeks apart compared to three weeks for pfizer and up to 12 for astrazeneca but despite the differences their effectiveness is pretty similar the latest studies show the modena vaccine stays 93 effective up to six months after both doses are injected that goes up to 98 for protection against severe disease that's slightly better than the pfizer alternative which according to the company's own data drops to 84 effectiveness six months after the second dose and about 95 against severe disease modernist says more study is needed to see how well the vaccine works against different variants both companies already have the booster vaccine targeting the newer variants of concern 60 million booster doses of pfizer's vaccine and 15 million of modernists are set to arrive in australia next year [Music] you

of Africa right here, where the modern day Democratic
Republic of the Congo is. What Belgium did in the Congo is shocking, and hard to get your head around. It's terrible, in fact. But, Belgium's horrendous
actions in the Congo would lead to this. - I would definitely take the
Johnson & Johnson vaccine. - The FDA has just
approved a third vaccine. - Let's talk about the J&J. - The Johnson & Johnson,
coronavirus vaccine. (speaking in foreign language) - Johnson & Johnson's. - Johnson & Johnson's. - Vaccine. - The new Johnson & Johnson
vaccine is a game changer, for the fight against COVID-19. It is cheaper. It can be shipped without
having to be frozen, so it's way more durable. It's made of really advanced
sophisticated technology that allows you to just get one shot of it instead of the two doses
from the previous ones. - [Reporter] J&J's version
requires just one dose. - That's a big deal when
you're trying to vaccinate literally billions of people. And so to understand how this vaccine that is being rolled out
by Johnson & Johnson, a New Jersey based company, how that is connected to Belgium in the late 1800s in the Congo basin. You have to understand the story of how the sophisticated
technology was developed, and by whom. - [Narrator] One man at
the conference of Berlin, walked away with his own private colony, and showed what colonialism
looked like at its very worst. - [Reporter] This date
marked the beginning of white penetration into
the black heart of Africa. - [Narrator] African sleeping sickness is caused by the protozoan parasite. - [Announcer] Johnson &
Johnson the most trusted name in surgical dressings. ♪ In the language of love ♪ - Let me tell you a story
of one of the most insane and horrendous versions of
European colonialism in Africa. [Female Narrator] The 1880s and 90s, were years of terrifying
upheaval in Africa. - It starts with this
guy, King Leopold II, he was the King of Belgium. And by the way, this
wasn't like 300 years ago. This is like the mid to late 1800s. Belgium, wasn't a big player
in the colonizing game, not like France and Britain, but Leopold sort of wanted to be. He wanted to be a big
boy in peerless nation. So he actually went to Spain and Portugal whose empires were sort
of declining at the time, and offered to buy some of
their colonial possessions. They didn't agree. So, Leopold decided to take
things into his own hands. Like literally on his own. He himself, privately, would
create a colony for Belgium. Okay. So quick pause. I just got an email from Morning Brew. Which is a thing that gets
sent to my inbox every morning, and is a digest of all of
the news that is happening. But it's not just like
the sad, depressing news. It's like actually interesting stuff. I don't like going down

for sponsoring this video. Let's get back to the story and talk about what is going on
in the Belgian Congo. So Leopold decided to take
things into his own hands. With his own money and his own army. He knew he would need
some support for this in terms of just like approval. So he created an organization, that he called the
International African Society. Leopold builds this organization, and says that it's meant to be a research and philanthropy organization. With a mission to explore
the world for good and for science. But soon, Leopold would use this organization to get his wish of being a big boy colonizer. It was 1884 when a bunch
of the European and Ottoman and American powers who
were colonizing Africa got together and they decided that they needed some
sort of a unifying policy of how they were going to go into Africa, how trade was going to work. But they wanted to work together as they carved up the continent of Africa. Leopold gets up at this conference, it was in Berlin, and he says, listen, I've
got this organization. I would love to take this
organization of mine and go and take over a huge
swath of central Africa. And everyone's like, you
mean like Belgium is going to go take over the Congo? And he's like, no, no,
no, not Belgium, me. I'll do it with my own money. And the European powers
are sort of like, okay. Like how much harm can one
guy and his NGO do going into Congo? So Leopold gets his dream. He gets international approval
to go take over a swath of Africa that is 76
times larger than Belgium. He would call his new private
colony, the Congo Free State. Well, you know what happens next. He doesn't improve the lives of people. That was never his intention. Instead, his army quickly gains control over the local population and starts to use the locals to forcibly extract raw
materials from the land of Congo. Mainly in rubber, whose price was going up during the Industrial Revolution. And in ivory. He would put these quotas
on the local people that they had to get a
certain amount of rubber. And he would instruct his
army that if they didn't bring back their quota, that they were to go remove
their hands or limbs. This is everyone. Men, women and children who are being forced to
work for King Leopold and getting their limbs removed if they don't meet the quota. So, Leopold starts extracting huge amounts of wealth from the Congo. And he uses this new money to build big shiny things back in Belgium. Including this big,
beautiful park and archways that I used to bike past all the time when I lived in Belgium. Or this beautiful train
station in central Antwerp. Wait a minute. That train station looks kind of familiar. (uplifted whistling music) Yeah, that's me showing
Henry the clock tower in this train station. I had literally no idea that
this train station was built on the blood of people in the Congo. Okay, so I know you're wondering what is this terrible story have anything to do with vaccines and Johnson
& Johnson and the pandemic? Here it goes. Buckle up. So while Leopold is doing
all this terrible stuff in the late 1800s, almost the 1900s, something happens in neighboring Uganda. An epidemic breaks out of this mysterious disease
called sleeping sickness. This is what they called it. They didn't really know what it was. But Leopold catches wind of the fact that there's a disease spreading into the Congo where he
has all these people, and this giant operation
for wealth extraction. And he sort of freaks out. He's like my whole wealth
operation might get wiped out by this random epidemic. So, he decides to put out a cash prize for anyone who can go down and devise a solution or a remedy to the sleeping sickness. And then he starts to
invest in actual researchers and scientists, to go down to the Congo and start studying tropical diseases. To make sure that nothing catches him by surprise and wipes out his operation. Okay, well eventually
the world catches wind of all the terrible things
that King Leopold II is doing in the Congo. And they start to mount
pressure against Belgium the country, and the actual
government of Belgium to put an end to this. It's 1908, and finally
the Belgian government is like, dude, stop, like you're done. And they officially take
Leopold out of the driver's seat and they annex the Congo for themselves. And the Congo becomes an
official Belgian colony for the first time. But these scientists and researchers who Leopold set up to start looking into tropical diseases, they didn't leave. They stayed. They kept doing this work
and they actually started to make some really
important breakthroughs. They establish an official
state run organization called the Prince Leopold
Institute for Tropical Medicines. An institution that was leading the world in understanding tropical medicines and teaching research and
study about this topic. This organization was based
permanently in the Congo, as well as, in Belgium. Fast forward a few years,
and the Congo officially declares independence from Belgium. - With political independence from Belgium control of the entire
Congo was turned over to what is called the
Central Congo Government, with headquarters in Leopoldville. - By this time, all of the holdovers from the King Leopold
days are sort of gone. And now the Institute
for Tropical Medicine is actually like a legitimate institute that is doing groundbreaking,
cutting edge research and study on all sorts of pathologies, and viruses, and parasites
and diseases in this region. They're basically leading the world in tropical diseases
and understanding them. They moved their headquarters
from Leopold's house in Brussels to the city of Antwerp where that beautiful but
terrible train station is. And they sort of turn into like a school, like an institution where they're training researchers to then go out
and work in the real world. Okay. So here's where it starts to really
connect with modern day. You have the Institute
of Tropical Medicine, which was effectively built from King Leopold's
operation in the Congo. A lot of the researchers and students from the Institute of Tropical Medicine were graduating and moving on and joining particularly
one pharmaceutical company, that was a Belgian pharmaceutical company, that was down the road from the Institute of Tropical Medicine. This pharmaceutical
company was called Janssen. And as researchers from the Institute of Tropical Medicine joined Janssen Pharmaceuticals
they continue to do that groundbreaking work around the world. Developing many of the medicines that the WHO considers
essential medicines. - [Reporter] Vaccines,
serums, medicines, and drugs. - They continue to do work
in the Congo, for example. Where, just recently,
they developed the vaccine for Ebola in the Congo. - [Female Reporter] A
Belgian doctor was part of an international team
that was called to Yambuku in the heart of the
Democratic Republic of Congo. - This is their old stomping grounds where so much of this
understanding of different viruses, and parasites, and diseases was founded during the King Leopold days. But instead of the colonizing efforts of the early 1900s, now
these institutions are actually doing really good work, and actually saving lots of lives. In 1960 Janssen Pharmaceutical, which is full of all these Institute of Tropical
Medicine researchers, gets purchased by a New Jersey company
called Johnson & Johnson. - [Announcer] Made only
by Johnson & Johnson, the most trusted name
in surgical dressings. ♪ In the language of love ♪ - And yes, this pharmaceutical
company Janssen, which is now a division
of Johnson & Johnson was the actual company
that developed the miracle COVID-19 vaccine that is
saving the world today. - [Reporter] Today,
Janssen Pharmaceutical, as part of healthcare
giant Johnson & Johnson announced this. - The chairman of Janssen, by the way, is a graduate of the Institute
of Tropical Medicine. Their long legacy in the Congo, and their focus on scientific research around tropical diseases is what gave them the capability to be able
to step up to the task and create a vaccine for COVID-19. In other words this, led
to this, led to this, led to this, led to this. - [Reporter] The first J&J doses expected to go into American's arms
within 24 to 48 hours. - Again, we think it's really important for our country and the world. - Okay. So I know this
sounds like I'm doing some sort of like exposé
on Johnson & Johnson and Janssen, and they're like dark past. I'm not. The work that they're
doing today is amazing. It is saving so many lives. The Institute of Tropical Medicine is an amazing public health institution that does really really useful work for saving many lives around the world. And yet, when you trace back the roots of why this institution exists and the original motives for it, they're pretty (beep) up. - [Female Reporter] His 23
year reign was so brutal that the population halved, while Leopold and his men
amassed huge personal fortune. - What this story teaches
me is just how impossible it is to find an institution
that wasn't founded on some bloody dark past. The country I live in, and the
democracy that I am proud of is founded on blood of stolen
people from another continent. How do I evaluate something
that I think is good when I really understand
that the backstory behind it is terrible,
and bloody, and horrific? The fact that this lifesaving
game-changer vaccine has a legacy that is based
on a greedy horrific King massacring a bunch of people in the Congo is a really uncomfortable tension. But if you look close enough, it's one that exists in
nearly everything around us."

#MedicinewithDrMoran",2021-09-17,488206,14193,3718,UCretxef46N9r-v0FOlHWIVA," Hello, Welcome to my channel Medicine with Dr. 
Moran. If you've not been here before I'm Dr.   Keith Moran. Today I want to talk about two 
specific side effects of the Covid-19 vaccine   Myocarditis and Pericarditis. I want to report on 
a study that was done in the province of Ontario   in Canada. This province includes the cities 
of Toronto and Canada's capital city Ottawa.   This looked at the incidence of Myocarditis which 
is inflammation of the heart muscle as well as   Pericarditis. Pericarditis is inflammation of the 
sac that surrounds the heart. Now there's a long   list of causes for Myocarditis. The main causes 
include viruses, fungi, bacteria, parasites,   as well as toxins, medications, radiation 
chemotherapy, trauma, and autoimmune diseases.   The list for possibilities of causes for 
pericarditis is actually very very similar.   The study in question looked at the frequency 
of these two conditions between December 13,   2020 to August 7, 2021. This was done because 
there were significant signals from the United   States as well as Israel about Myocarditis 
and Pericarditis secondary to the vaccine.   I recently mentioned this side effect was more 
frequent in the vaccinated versus control and   vaccinated group on a recent video. This video 
looked at short-term side effects to the Pfizer   vaccine over a six-week period. There's a 
link to that video below in the description.   Now on to the Ontario study. Since the start 
of the immunization program they found 204   cases in Ontario of either Myocarditis or 
Pericarditis which met the Brighton collaboration   case definition for those two diagnoses. 
So we know that there are definite cases.   Now of these 204 cases 79.9% occurred in 
males and 69.6% occurred following the   second dose. The average time from vaccine 
administration to symptom onset was two days   and 79% of cases occurred within seven days of 
vaccine administration. There were 72 cases of   Myocarditis, 58 cases of Pericarditis, and 74 
cases of a mixture which we call Myopericarditis.   99% of the cases attended the emergency department 
with 72% of the cases getting admitted to the   hospital and 1.5% of the cases ended up in the 
intensive care unit. Now fortunately there were   no deaths. I was very disappointed to not see any 
data on the patients that were admitted in terms   of their length of stay, whether there was cardiac 
dysfunction, the levels of their cardiac injury,   blood test markers, and whether there were things 
like heart failure, or rhythm abnormalities.   As you can see on this graph the majority 
of the cases occurred after the end of May   when vaccination programs started to involve 
younger adults. Many second doses were also   around that time being administered. There was 
also an increased vaccine supply particularly   of Moderna as well as release of an enhanced 
surveillance directive to follow Myocarditis   and Pericarditis. So at this point doctors as 
well as people who were vaccinated were more in   tune to look for symptoms that might indicate 
Myocarditis or Pericarditis. These symptoms   of this would be chest discomfort, palpitations, 
shortness of breath which typically would occur as   I've mentioned one to seven days post-vaccination. 
This is the reporting rate of Myocarditis and   Pericarditis per million doses administered 
by age by Pfizer in green and Moderna in blue.   You can see that the majority of cases are 
occurring in people under the age of 40 with   a much higher incidence in the younger age 
group. As Pfizer in Ontario has been given to   people below the age of 18 there's an increased 
rate in the green line of Pfizer at those ages.   Moderna has not been approved in Ontario and so 
its statistics only go down to the age of 18.   When you look at the Moderna statistics which 
is the blue line the risk of Myocarditis or   Pericarditis is much higher in the 18 to 24 
age group. On this slide the overall reporting   rate in all age groups of Myocarditis or 
Pericarditis following the Pfizer vaccine   was 8.7 per million following the second dose 
compared to 6.4 per million following the first   dose. For the Moderna vaccine it was higher it 
was 28.2 per million following the second dose   and 6.6 per million following the first dose. 
What they found though was that the frequency   was highest for individuals between 18 and 24 
and it was much higher following the second dose.   So here Moderna was 263.2 versus 37.4 per million 
doses for the Pfizer vaccine in this age group.   Now this difference in the reporting 
rates persisted when the analysis was   just restricted to the June 1st to August 7th 
period which was the surveillance directive time.   To put it in better perspective Moderna at 
263 per million is a risk of 1 in 3,800.   For the Pfizer second dose their risk was 1 in 
26,000. These numbers are in line with what has   been seen in previous observational reports 
from the USA as well as Israel. These are a   definite increase from the baseline incidence of 
cases that we would expect to see in the general   unvaccinated population. Meaning the vaccine is 
definitely causal here meaning it's causing what   we're seeing. It's possible but not proven that 
the higher frequency with Moderna over Pfizer may   be simply due to the dose of the Moderna vaccine. 
The Moderna dose is a hundred micrograms in each   vaccination whereas the Pfizer MRNA vaccine 
is only 30 micrograms. So there's a threefold   difference there. I would also point out that the 
dose given to people in the 12 to 17 age group are   exactly the same as the adult dose which may not 
be optimal. Many 12 year olds are not fully grown.   I would point out that there have been numerous 
case reports in children between 12 and 18 in a   number of medical journals and Myocarditis reports 
early in the pandemic from Covid-19 infections   they mostly stemmed from an abnormal MRI scan 
without symptoms without ECG abnormalities and   without significant troponin elevations. 
Troponin is a marker for cardiac injury.   There were a handful of flawed medical studies 
which nearly stopped the U.S. college sports   scene last year due to this. Now the pediatric 
cases that I'm talking about post-vaccination   are in contrast to Myocarditis from the 
virus because they had significant troponin   elevations which is a marker of injury. 
They had abnormal MRI scans, abnormal ECGs,   and significantly elevated inflammatory 
markers. Heart ultrasounds also demonstrated   reduced cardiac function in some people with this 
diagnosis. So when it comes to the vaccine these   cases of Myocarditis are definite cases with not 
just a mild abnormality on an MRI but many other   abnormalities seen on their tests. Over the years 
I've managed numerous people with Myocarditis   and Pericarditis in my practice and I point out 
that we would recommend avoiding high intensity   exercise for six months after the diagnosis has 
been made. So it isn't always a benign diagnosis.   It appears rare in the literature thus far 
that vaccine-induced Myocarditis causes   any long-term cardiac dysfunction but there's 
always a small chance of that from the vaccine.   Myocarditis itself can be a serious condition but 
it's been downplayed in the media. So there are   some things to consider moving forward should 
we give a lower dose vaccine in this age group   or simply a single dose. These are important 
considerations. People can feel risk differently.   Some patients fear the illness more than the risk 
of the prevention or treatment. Understanding   concerns of the patient is important to try to put 
the risks and the benefits in context for them.   Parents or the individual may feel 
more risk from the virus than from   the vaccine or even vice versa 
despite whatever data you provide.   There are many factors that come into play such 
as whether the young adult has comorbidities   or whether their parents or grandparents 
that might live with them are at risk also   and if so in this situation it would make sense 
to consider vaccination. This kind of discussion   with your physician is important and of course it 
should be up to the kids and parents to decide.   This is a nuanced decision. This is why in the 
UK they've not been vaccinating people under   the 18 as of September 2021. They're looking for 
more evidence-based data. The data of course can   change with new variants and we do need to be 
ready to change our course if the data changes.   I appreciate you watching till the end today. 
Thanks for joining me on Medicine with Dr. Moran.   I'm Dr. Keith Moran. Get healthy and stay healthy."

A number of countries, including Thailand, Bulgaria and Norway, have all paused rollouts in recent days over safety fears. The suspensions followed reports that a small number of people had developed clots after receiving the vaccine.

But the WHO has encouraged countries to keep their vaccination programmes in place.

media mogul tyler ferry that's what he is is raising awareness about the coronavirus vaccine and a new special for bet which is owned by the way by viacom cbs this is video of the filmmaker getting the first dose grady health system in atlanta approached tyler perry to get the shot to help get the word out black americans if you've heard are disproportionately affected by the virus and one in three think about that or hesitant about getting this vaccine perry's new special aims to provide the facts about it and in this clip he talks with grady health system dr kimberly manning i'm hearing people say they either don't want it or that they're going to wait to get it if you want to wait to be able to you know come into community to go to your family reunion to be able to do the things that get us back to living um i think those are things to consider and i've been saying you know my loved ones this about us yeah you know this is about us the folks that are really taking the hardest hit are the people that are in your contacts in your cell phone if you look like us boy tyler perry joins us first on cbs this morning to discuss good to see you mr perry let's get started so much to talk to you about were you reluctant to take the vaccine yourself before the doctors at grady health system approached you well when doctor del rio and kim believed dr manning when they called up and asked if i would take it to encourage the community i thought i i i would do that but you've got to answer all my questions and i thought well while you answer my question why don't we record it so you can answer questions for a lot of people in the community so yeah i was skeptical because if you look at our history in this country with the tuskegee experiment henrietta lacks and things like that it it it raises flags for us as african-american people so i understand why there's a healthy skepticism about the vaccine i understand why they reached out to you i know you're certainly younger than 65 but they thought if tyler perry gets it it'll send a strong message what questions did you have for the doctors i'm curious give me your top two what did you want to know from them well i wanted to understand the technology i mean we talked about everything from the spanish lieu of 1918 to what is happening now to where it came from but i think my top question was understanding mrna technology and dr kimberly manning and dr del rio did an amazing job at explaining that and how this new technology has helped to come up with the vaccine so quickly because when you when i heard things like warp speed i was really concerned because this last administration and all the pressure they were putting on the cdc and fda i don't know i didn't really feel like i could trust it but once i got all the information found out the researchers i was very very happy tyler it's anthony mason uh one kaiser health has done a study uh in the early days of the vaccine rollout and i mean it it bearing out what we've been talking about the fact that there's a distrust here black americans are being vaccinated at a dramatically lower rate which is really alarming so what do you what do you think needs to be done here to to to build confidence exactly what we're doing especially that i'm doing for bet and asking having an opportunity to ask experts questions the first ebola patient in uh in america was at emory hospital so i got the top uh experts here in town dr del rio is an epidemiologist who was brilliant and to be able to ask those questions and not only for myself but share them with the community you know i've got a people who love what i do and kind of follow me so i think once they get the information that it'll help them and what i told them is that i'm not taking this vaccine because i want you to take it i want i want to give you the information so you can make your own choices so i think that's what it's about education and information you know they always talk about the reaction that's another thing people are afraid of i've heard number one which vaccine did you get tyler i took the visor i took my first one on the january 4th and i took the second one yesterday and uh i had no reaction the first the first shot this shot that i just took yesterday i woke up with some aches and pains but i took some advil a few about an hour ago and i still find them yeah but they said it's very common that you know you don't have a reaction to the first one but you can have a sometimes dramatic reaction to the second one but it it doesn't deter you you just still don't regret taking it right not at all because here's the alternative here's what you don't understand the problem with this cover 19 virus is that you never know how it's going to affect you and we have i've had people who have died that i know i've had people who have had long-term health issues that i know so i the va so it you're making the choice of getting a vaccine and and even though it's 95 96 efficacy what happens is you you are reducing your chances of ending up in the icu by 100 yeah so i think that's just important that people know that that that you don't if you take your chances with covert you never know how it's going to affect you and it could affect your long-term tyler you're absolutely right we can talk about side effects but we shouldn't forget the main effect which is that protection against kobe 19. uh and when we're talking about reactions i'm actually interested in the reaction to you as you engage with people online and as you talk with people in the community where you are have you succeeded with convincing anyone in particular that's been important to you and what was that experience like that conversion of going okay they're skeptical but listen to me this is good for you and then they make a change well i tell you this is why the special that we're doing on bt on thursday night is so important because i have a crew that works for me and and they're largely african-american people who are all skeptical about the vaccine when they sat in the room as they were working the cameras and doing hair and makeup and all that stuff they listened to all the information by the time we got to the end of it they all wanted to take it so i think again it just goes back to getting the correct information and getting it from people that you trust and you understand i think this last administration did a lot of damage in in eroding trust when they came when it comes to this vaccine but the information that i found has been very helpful listen i'm just saying i know medea's retired but if there ever was a time for media to weigh in on this subject seems like she would have something to say i'm getting that damn vaccine i'm getting that damn dancing that's the thing people believe medea because medea always speaks the truth but let's let's talk about tyler perry because the oscars are coming up you were getting the humanitarian award whoa congratulations bravo what did that mean to you tyler when you heard you were you were going to get that you see the list of people have received that and now your name is added to the list i love this i was completely shocked by that because you know the thing about a gayle is this where there is a need and i have the ability i just want to show up so to see uh being me being honored with the green hershey humanitarian award that's that's beyond moving and i'm so thankful to the academy for it so i can't wait it's gonna be a lot of fun it doesn't get any bigger than that tyler you made a point of of of uh announcing that you were flying back to your home state to vote in the georgia runoff election uh that you're glad you did now huh yeah for sure listen i still don't have the absentee ballot you're still going to get it on december 4th we are still waiting for it still waiting for it i'm glad i came back yeah you because you the reason the reason you went back was you you applied for an absentee ballot but you said as you said you never came but stacey abrams gave you some advice yeah and it was really simple she said just show up and can't tell him you want to cancel your your uh your absentee i walked in i had to sign after david and i voted in person there wasn't a line and it all worked out but yeah i'll let you know when that absentee ballot shows up well let me tell you tyler very curious as somebody who's done a little reporting on vote by mail it probably is never coming that thing is gone but your vote counted so that's all that matters uh you know talk about other votes there's a vote coming up in the senate uh in a couple weeks uh or probably more than that actually when the trial starts in the impeachment of president trump former president trump i'm just curious the more we learn about the siege on the capitol on january 6 the worse it seems i'm interested in your journey both your reaction on the day of that riot and then how your thinking has changed as we've learned more in the days have gone on you listen it's beyond heartbreaking to watch to see so many people seize the capital one capital that slaves built right that that you got you've got these confederate flags walking through where slaves actually built this this capital and for me my my it was heartbreaking on so many levels because i believe in america that it's

322,7PRScVeHt7k,Is Side Effect of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine Behind Rising Cases of Myocarditis in Israel?,"Israel has reported a small number of heart inflammation cases, mainly in young men who received Pfizer’s vaccine shots. Consequently, there is speculation in Israel of a probable link between Pfizer vaccine and myocarditis cases. However, Pfizer has ruled out any causal link between myocarditis and its vaccine.

At least 275 cases of myocarditis have been reported in Israel between December 2020 and May 2021. Nearly 5 million people or 53.5% of the population have received the second jab in Israel so far.

323,Xk6FULr9llw,Kids and their parents prepare for Covid vaccine rollout,"CNBC's Meg Tirrell reports on how families and doctors offices are preparing to get the Covid vaccine into childrens' arms. She also reports on another potential new treatment for Covid. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

A key Food and Drug Administration advisory committee on Tuesday recommended a lower dose of Pfizer and BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11, a critical step in getting some 28 million more kids in the U.S. protected against the virus as the delta variant spreads.

The endorsement by the agency’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will now be considered by the FDA, which could issue a final decision within days. The vote was nearly unanimous, with 17 members backing it and one abstention.

The agency doesn’t always follow the advice of its independent committee, but it often does. Next week, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory group is expected to make its own recommendation. If it issues an endorsement and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signs off, shots for young kids could begin immediately.

The Biden administration said it plans to distribute the doses as soon as it’s authorized by the FDA and CDC, which is expected to come early next month. The administration said it’s procured enough vaccine to inoculate all 28 million 5- to 11-year-olds in the U.S., and will distribute it in smaller dosing and with smaller needles to make it easier for pediatricians and pharmacists to administer to kids.

Many parents say they are anxiously awaiting the vaccine’s authorization with schools now open across the U.S. and the delta variant driving a surge in children’s cases.

Children ages 5 to 11 account for roughly 9% of all reported Covid cases in the U.S., according to data presented to the committee by the FDA on Tuesday. The number of new Covid cases in kids remains exceptionally high, with more than 1.1 million child cases added over the past six weeks, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Still, some parents and advocacy groups argue Covid vaccinations for children are unnecessary as studies show kids are less likely to experience symptoms from the disease even though they get infected at similar rates as adults.

Some committee members said Tuesday that vaccinating younger groups would help the U.S. move toward Covid’s “endemic” phase, where the virus is still circulating but at lower levels than it is now. Others noted there are unknowns, such as the rate of myocarditis in young kids, but still emphasized that the benefits of the shots outweighed the risks. One member wondered whether they should issue a recommendation only for at-risk children.

“We don’t want children to be dying from Covid, even if it is far fewer children than adults, and we don’t want them in the ICU,” member Dr. Amanda Cohn said before the vote.

Prior to the vote, Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA’s top vaccine regulator, asked committee members to keep today’s debate “civil,” saying there were strong feelings on both sides.

“To be clear, today’s discussion is going to be about the scientific data that are presented, and it’s not about vaccine mandates, which are left to other entities outside of FDA,” Marks said at the top of the meeting. “I ask that we keep our discourse today civil and focus on the science related to this issue so that we can get through a productive discussion.”

Pfizer asked the FDA to authorize its vaccine for kids ages 5 to 11 on Oct. 7. The company published data that showed a two-dose regimen of 10 micrograms — a third of the dosage used for teens and adults — is safe and generated a strong immune response in a clinical trial of young children. It said the shots were well tolerated and produced an immune response and side effects comparable with those seen in a study of people ages 16 to 25.

324,ddu_ZxDkddM,Can an employer require #COVID vaccine? | BlackBeltBarrister,"My legal views on whether your employer can require you to have the COVID vaccine.

There are various laws engaged when thinking about COVID vaccines and your employer, but the broad position is simple: Your employer cannot, either physically or legally, require you to have a vaccine. However ... If you are a new starter, the current view is that an employer *can* require that you have a vaccine, but there may still be implications such as age discrimination, depending on the rollout of the covid vaccine. 

Also, if your employer dismisses you because you refuse to have the covid vaccine, there is usually (though, not always) nothing you can do to prevent yourself from actually being dismissed - though you may still be able to bring a claim in an Employment Tribunal in certain circumstances - I discuss the two broad heads in this video:

Discrimination:
Your employer cannot treat you differently for any reason linked to any protected characteristic listed in the Equality Act 2010 (or anything that could be linked to those characteristics). There are certain potential arguments under this head, though they are likely to be rare.

Unfair Dismissal
Broadly, a dismissal based solely upon your refusal to take a vaccine is not likely to be fair, although it may be a year or two before inevitable cases find their way to Tribunal and perhaps appeal before an authoritative position is established.

Enjoy the video but please seek formal advice if this relates to you - as this video is not, and cannot, be formal legal advice!

about whether or not your employer can force you to have the COVID 19 vaccine but first
of all if you're just joining a legal community don't forget to like this video to find it
useful subscribe so you don't miss out on future videos and make sure you hit that bow
icon that gives you notifications when I release a new video the real tipping point right now
with the COVID vaccine because 38.6 million people had their first dose add 24 million
people had their second dose given a total of 62 million as 658,639 vaccines given at
the time of recording but according to Peninsula studies show that 30% of adults could refuse
to take a vaccine to before long we going to get close to that position and it's important
for you to know whether your employer can force you to have a vaccine or not as usual
I'm going to start with the bottom-line summary and that is twofold first of all of course
your employer cannot physically hold you down and inject you with a vaccine against your
will this would be a serious assault with criminal liability and I hope it goes without
saying that they simply cannot secondly there is also no law provides that your employer
can force you to have a vaccine but that doesn't mean that there aren't any consequences so
the basic position is that your employer cannot possibly give you a vaccine and they cannot
order you to have a vaccine legally although there might be consequences which were going
to come onto now that because the position we are in is fairly unprecedented and employment
tribunal take around a year or so or more to actually get to tribunal to make a decision
even longer if those decisions are appealed so that there is an authoritative appeal decision
on any given point all we can really do at the moment to say what sort of things the
tribunal are going to look at if and no doubt when they look at unfair dismissal claims
for example because someone's review to take a covert vaccine so let's run through some
of those now no danger to stress this is not legal advice I'm just running through a couple
of scenarios for you to think about when you do go and seek formal advice if you need to
select the scenario that your employer has said that you must take the vaccine else you
will be dismissed but you simply don't want to take the vaccine any of a number of reasons
which I will come back to later in the video so let's say you refuse to take the vaccine
and your employer dismisses you now in all but the rarest of occasions there isn't anything
you can do to actually prevent yourself from being dismissed your employer can dismiss
you it will be effective but then it may be open to you to explore potential claims either
for discrimination all for unfair dismissal to looking at the fairly broad heading of
discrimination first of all under the equality act your employer cannot treat you any differently
for any reason that is linked to or based on any of the protected characteristics and
the protected characteristics are set out in section 4 of the equality act 2010 and
they are as follows age disability gender reassignment marriage and civil partnership
pregnancy and maternity race religion or belief sex and sexual orientation and I would add
that this will be anything that would be linked to any of these characteristics heading and
by way of example if you are a disabled person and you have a genuine medical concern that
the vaccine is going to affect you or your disability or any of the medications you are
on for example then this could be something that you could seek legal advice on the other
hand there were religious grounds to refuse the vaccine this would also come under a protected
characteristic as well but it's worth mentioning at this point that there is broad support
for the current vaccine from various different faith groups and there are independent statements
published that you can see online I will link to some of them below there is also very useful
fact sheet produced by the NHS addressing various different faiths and I will link that
in the description as well so you can take a look at that if you are all work in the
age group that hasn't yet had the rollout of the vaccine and your employer has dismissed
you because you haven't had the vaccine this may well come under the head of age under
a protected characteristic because in that scenario it's possible that you've been treated
differently because of your age in other words if somebody older than you has had the vaccine
because they're in the age group that has been in the rollout whereas you haven't and
you've been dismissed then there is an arguable case that you been treated differently because
of your age this would come under the protected characteristic of age that is honestly not
an exhaustive discussion for every eventuality under the heading of discrimination or protected
characteristics just to give you an idea of how those things might be engaged in the coming
months and years if you've been dismissed for refusing or being unable to take the vaccine
at a specific time but it is very important to say that unless there are specific circumstances
that link to any one of those protected characteristics then simple refusal or delay or unwillingness
or not wanting to take the vaccine in an itself is not going to amount to a discrimination
claim because it won't be linked to any protected characteristic so unwillingness not wanting
to or delaying to take the vaccine those are not going to come under this head of claim
unless as I said they are linked to a protected characteristic under specific circumstances
this is why you must seek formal legal advice if you think any of these might apply moving
onto a different type of employment claim you may have heard of called unfair dismissal
this will kick in if you had continuous employment with your employer for a period of two years
or more unfortunately if there are no heads under a discrimination claim and you only
work for your employer for a period of less than two years you are not going to have a
claim for unfair dismissal you may be able to claim against your employer for unpaid
notice if they have paid you notice within your contract for that period of time but
that would be a separate claim and again you need to seek legal advice on that to see what
your contract says about notice hey how much pain you are entitled to what pain you're
entitled to and sold to broadly speaking an unfair dismissal claim is where the dismissal
is considered to be unfair in all the circumstances so obviously in unprecedented times there
are lots of different circumstances going on all at the same time there may well be
scenarios where employers are changing their contract of employment with their employees
inserting a term that requires them to have this particular or any particular vaccine
this is probably a risky strategy and I would firmly urge any employer who is watching this
video considering doing that to seek formal and robust legal advice before doing so on
the other hand it may well be less of a risk to insert this term for new contracts for
new starters but again I would suggest going to an employment specialist to sit down to
go through the exact wording of any such terms that you think of including in those contracts
or if you are the employee you are entitled as well to seek legal advice on an employment
contract that you are asked to sign as with any other contract I would never advise anybody
to sign a contract without reading of course but most people don't realise that you can
get legal advice on practically anything you desire even on behalf of someone else so if
you are presented with an employment contract and there is a term in there that requires
you to have the vaccine or a particular vaccine and you are against it for any particular
reason again you can seek legal advice on that and refer to any of the things that I've
said in this video but taking it as formal legal advice from your lawyer there is some
reassurance in this particular aspect in that the justice secretary has made an announcement
that it could be possible to insert these terms for new starters but again just refer
back to discrimination elements if you were to insert this term as an absolute mandatory
requirement in your new contract of employment and certain age groups are not yet eligible
for a vaccine this may amount to age discrimination again so be mindful of it and take formal
advice on the exact wording to think about all of the circumstances consideration of
which will determine whether or not a dismissal was fair following the refusal to take a vaccine
for example obviously the working environment is the nature of the work the number of people
the way the work is conducted where the work is conducted all of these sorts of things
are going to have an impact for example care homes considerably any type of medical facility
even children's nurseries each of these places are going to have a unique set of circumstances
and all of those circumstances will be considered in the event that an employee refuses to have
a vaccine is dismissed and then brings an unfair dismissal claim I think it's also important
to mention that employers should be implementing reasonable steps and alternative protections
particularly if any of the staff have medical disabilities or vulnerabilities and perhaps
cannot take a vaccine but remain extremely vulnerable to the spread of disease and the
employer really should be taking steps and measures to limit all of the risks to each
employee to what the law doesn't require you to take a vaccine I have another video discussing
that point our link below Andrew employer cannot legally or physically force you to
have a vaccine invoice should be open about their vaccination policy with you encourage
you to take the vaccine where it safe and appropriate to do so and I shall be taking
all steps possible to protect those that cannot or do not take vaccination to others at the
outset I think were approaching this tipping point now notwithstanding the new variants
flying around where 42% of people are yet to have a vaccine but apparently studies show
that 30% of adults are going to refuse to take a vaccine and will need to see how that
pans out at that time but as always if you are in any doubt about anything please read
the official sources of information not what you reading comments or from a neighbour friend
or anyone else take it from official sources and if you need legal advice you don't rely
on this video or any other video or what anyone else says in the comments you go and sit down
with a lawyer who can discuss your particular scenario and tailor their advice to your individual
set of circumstances in the meantime could subscribe if you found this useful given a
big thumbs up John B over a black belt secret if you got other types of questions you'd
like me to address for you thanks for watching and see you next time"

the vaccine for five to 11 year olds and your wife did take place in this trial for AstraZeneca and she was living a healthy robust life prior to this she wasn't somebody somebody who had some sort of chronic illness or a psychological issues that continue to make her feel ill at every turn she was fine yeah she was absolutely fine healthy hiking mountains you know taking care of the kids rock climbing skiing all of the things that we love to do so she decides to take place in the in the trial of the Astra zeneca vaccine which is widely used in Europe why why did she decide to do that so uh me being a scientist we're a science-loving family we were concerned about covid we wanted to you know protect our family we wanted to further the science we wanted to help end the pandemic and so she was presented with the opportunity to to partake in the trial and chose to to sign up you know she was so confident and you know the vaccines being developed that you know she would be able to get a vaccine potentially and then not have to experience covid herself and help protect her family and her community when further the science and so when did she take place in the first in the trial so she had her first dose November 4th of 2020 so just over a year ago okay and what happened so right after she got the shot uh we were driving home and she said something doesn't feel right she had tingling down her arm where she got the shot she started to notice that her vision was changing her ears became very very sensitive to sound her eyes were so sensitive to light she had to put on the darkest sunglasses later that night she had the typical vaccine response that they tell you to expect you know the fever and all of those things but that had resolved by morning however she experienced new symptoms that next morning she couldn't really walk properly her left foot was sort of slumping she calls it she was walking into doorways the sound and light sensitivity were severe she was still experiencing the numbness and tingling and the symptoms just kept progressing and getting worse we called the test Clinic they didn't respond for a couple of days finally they responded brought her in did an exam said you know what there were a couple of instances of transverse myelitis and Ms in the previous trials you might have MS and you should go see a neurologist so we ended up in the ER three days later they did all of the tests that they could ruled out any of those you know pre-existing type conditions and essentially said we don't know what's going on but uh best of luck to you and send her home to continue to decline we went to the ER two more times and then a fourth time and she was finally hospitalized at this point she couldn't walk she was incontinent she was peeing her pants she still had to wear earmuffs to be anywhere that wasn't a dark room she had extreme sensitivity to sound you couldn't touch her she couldn't brush her teeth I mean it was just a hellacious experience how old is she at this point uh she's 39 years old at this point oh my goodness now she's 40. so you see who do you go to specifically the people running the clinic like who do you call to say you need to know this happened right so each of the clinical trials you know they're they're essentially performed by all these trial sites and all of the different states and cities and so we we call the test Clinic that's what they call these so they're the ones who administer the shots and you know collect the data and then send it on to uh in this case AstraZeneca and so that that's what we called was the the doctors at the test Clinic to say you know what something's not right here something's going on they didn't offer any help to you you were on your own in dealing with the Fallout from it and then right it's it seems like you know the other shoe to drop was when you saw her negative outcome was not included in the results of the clinical trial right so the clinical trial report wasn't released until last month but I was a little bit suspicious given that the test Clinic sort of didn't seem super interested the feedback we were getting from AstraZeneca um was essentially we need a diagnosis we need a diagnosis anything that would essentially absolve them of any responsibility right so I was concerned um in January so this happened in November in January I reached out to the NIH to um you know see if they have any thoughts on this and to my surprise they actually responded really quickly we had a Telehealth visit with doctors at the NIH they wanted to bring her out for testing and possible treatment however this was January and you know the NIH is located in Maryland and around this time we had a lot of civil unrest and other things going on they weren't sure with the inauguration if they could uh safely bring her out and so um they weren't able to bring her out at this time they offered to talk to her doctors locally to try and get them to perform the proper tests to come to a proper diagnosis but even with their involvement our local doctors were still incredulous and because none of the test results would come back you know abnormal they just said well this might be all in your head it's probably just anxiety you can't walk because you have anxiety um my gosh so I mean was any did anything show up on any test because one of the things I read was um that she started to suffer severe brain damage and was obviously advised by those running the trial not to get the second dose was that something that manifested in a CT scan or something no so all of the the adverse reactions were essentially symptomatic until we actually were able to go to the NIH and get proper testing done um and so all of these symptoms you know the the neurological Decline and everything else was very very concerning but nobody really knew what to do with it because when you do the you know the CT or the MRI everything looks normal all of her testing essentially was coming back normal um so did you ever make it to the NIH we did we went to the NIH in June where they did a whole battery of testing and she was eventually diagnosed with a bunch of vaccine caused injuries so the NIH acknowledged that yes so how does it wind up that as recently as last month her negative vaccine caused injuries are not in the report exactly so in a clinical trial essentially the participants are given an app on their smartphones where they report any of the the side effects however the only side effects you're allowed to report is a bulleted list of selected Adverse Events the things like fever muscle aches injection site pain headache you know tiredness things like that there is no free form where you can write you know I can't walk anymore or I can't be in bright light or my ears are so sensitive or any of the other things that she experienced you have to call the test Clinic explain to them what's going on and then it's up to them to report up the chain right with potential reporting and clinician bias you know the Adverse Events and they didn't it would appear not [Music]

Health Secretary urged to release data that ‘may link Covid vaccine to excess deaths’
MPs and peers criticise ‘wall of silence’

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/03/02/health-secretary-release-data-covid-vaccine-excess-deaths/

MPs and peers have accused the Health Secretary of withholding data that could link the Covid vaccine to excess deaths 

A cross-party group

“growing public and professional concerns” UK’s rates of excess deaths since 2020

Demand to be shown the underlying data for to support the Government’s assertion, “no evidence” linking excess deaths to the vaccines for Covid-19.

21 MPs and peers

“If those data do indeed exist, please share them; if thorough investigations have already ruled out such a link, please share the relevant reports,” 

“There is no place here for blind faith.”

Written to

Health Secretary

Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC)

Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)

UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)

Potentially critical data, which maps the date of people’s Covid vaccine doses to the date of their deaths,

have been released to pharmaceutical companies but not put into the public domain.

Data should be released “on the same anonymised basis that it was shared with the pharmaceutical groups, and there seems to be no credible reason why that should not be done immediately”.

“Questions about these trends, however, have to date been met by a relative wall of silence from your organisations and other public health officials.”

A DHSC spokesman

“We are committed to data transparency and publish a wide range of data on excess mortality. The datasets published are kept under constant review.”",2024-03-03,244506,24507,4770,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg, hello War welcome to today's talk Sunday the 3rd of March now today we're going to be looking at a letter written by British parliamentarians to the data holding agencies in the United Kingdom asking for very fine week by week year bye of age data relating covid vaccinations to Deaths and excess deaths and I'll be looking at this letter in some detail it's really time that this debate was put to bed there been there been rum on for such a long time now and if this data is released we can say you know what all our fears were misguided that there is no relationship here unless of course there is a relationship which is what we want to know of course now uh this is the tweet from Andrew bridgin uh dealing with this letter which has only recently been released into the public domain and we can see here it's been validated by Professor Norman Fenton and Professor Carl henigan two of the lead um authorities in the country and I think I haven't been able to contact Norman Fenton today but I think basically what they saying is this data can be released without compromising a patient individual confidentiality I think it's basically what it's saying now let's just look at the letter very briefly before we dive into some of the detail uh this is the letter here um three pages and I'm going to unpack it a bit but what's also really reassuring or comforting really is this is being covered by The Daily Telegraph now the United States you won't know about it but it's one of the major UK uh newspapers so this is getting into mainstream media certain parts of mainstream media didn't see it covered on the BBC but uh let's look at what the telegraph says first and then we'll look at the letter in some in some uh detail now Daily Telegraph as we've said Health secretary urged to release data that may may link covid vaccines to excess deaths so it may and we're looking for this link covid vaccines and excess deaths we really need to know about this MPS and peers me that's members of the houses of L House of Lords criticized a wall of Silence why the heck have we got this wall of Silence MPS and peers have accused the health Secretary of withholding data that could link covid vaccines to excess deaths it's a cross-party group and the cross party group say there's growing public and professional concerns UK rates of excess death since 2020 there's been excess death since 2020 and there persists to be excess deaths we need to know what is going on here we really do um so the demand to be shown the underlying data the underlying data the fine granular level data that we can give to our statisticians uh for the support of the government's assertion so the government's assertion is currently there's no evidence linking excess deaths to vaccines for covid-19 fine give us the evidence and we'll have our own statisticians review it that's what we need it's a very simple request now there's 21 MPS and peers in the Daily Telegraph article supporting this there were seven have signed the letter um in those if those data do indeed exist please share them uh if thorough investigations have already ruled out such a link please share the relevant yes so if the government's data is ruled out then all we're asking is for the transparency to see that data what is unreasonable about this request absolutely nothing that I can see now they've written to the health secretary Department of Health and Social care medicine's Healthcare products regulatory agency UK Health Security Agency so that pretty well covers the data holders so all of these have been approached um potentially critical data which Maps the data of people's covid vaccine doses to the date of their deaths is what we want so we can eliminate this possibility and validate the government's claim the government's claim that um no evidence linking excess death to the vaccines that's all we want to do we simply want to validate the government's statement that's all now this data apparently has been released to pharmaceutical companies now this is deeply concerning if this is true from The Daily Telegraph that the data has been released for to pharmaceutical companies that are basically there to make money but not released to um the public and uh for our public spirited statisticians to analyze then why would they release it to Big farmer and not to the public I mean can you think of any reason why they might release it to Big farmer but not to the Hoy pooy like you and me not to the pitaria the plean class um maybe we simply don't need to know we just have to be grateful and take their word for anything that dribbles down from their table so why would they do that why would they release it to pharmaceutical companies but not the public I mean obviously there there independent politicians with no vested interest in this why should they possibly do that data should be released on the same anonymized basis as it would shared with the pharmaceutical groups so the pharmaceutical groups believe have this data on anonymized basis and there seems to be no credible reason why that should not be done immediately immediately today is Sunday so let's hope for a response tomorrow on on Monday morning Monday afternoon let's let's not be too over enthusiastic this this could be released very very very soon realistically within days to be quite honest I would have thought uh questions about these Trends however have today been met by a relative wall of Silence from your organizations and other public health officials in the view of these parliamentarians and peers now uh Department of Health and Social care spokesman says we are committed to data transparency and publish a wide range of data on excess mortality the data sets published are kept under constant review now given that the Department of Health and Social care are committed to data transparency I expect we can get this data in the next few days let's wait and see now all um uh intimations aside realistically I don't think this is going to happen this side of the general election now the general election in my country could be as early as May or it could be later in the year here I really don't think we're going to get this data until the general election time because because um because you fill in the gaps in the comments I couldn't possibly say why this data wouldn't be released until the general election but that's my fear and suspicion we are going to know this this is going to come out I firmly believe that it's just a case of when it's going to come out and I'd like it sooner rather than later we need to know what is going on so future decisions can be based on this uh on this information now um this is probably a bit hard to uh to see but I'll read out the main points these are direct copies from the uh from the letters that we have um so basically here they're saying that um the UK stati statistics regulator agrees so basically the UK statistics regulator has agreed the currently the data that's current released does not provide information on vaccine Effectiveness or vaccine safety and should not be used in this way so here we have the people that hold the data um agreeing that the data in the public domain is so far insufficient to make firm adjudications the letter goes on we are we are requesting that the authorities redo the analysis with the following parameters and basically that is looking at the data on a week-by-week basis giving the accurate number of vaccines whether it's one through to seven imagine having seven vaccines incredible um and the the timing related to that what time did people have the vaccines at what time did the death occur so we can eliminate this lurking suspicion that the vaccines were a significant eological causative Factor in these deaths now the letter says these parameters have been used in the records in New Zealand and the results were made public and no person has claimed it revealed any personal information because it simply Aggregates statistics this excuse has been used so many times we couldn't do that we we'll release individual data no it can be done without that there are many ways to do it without that we've talked about this with various authorities including members of parliament that this can be done uh now your staff was asked to produce a detailed report and they declined to do so this is why we are bringing the matter to your attention and they are bringing it to the main cheese this guy he's he's the boss Professor sir Ian Diamond National statistician and chief executive UK statistics Authority in the government buildings in Wales now the letter does go on it gives some detail I'm not going to go through it in detail it is now in the public public domain but basically they are asking for information of the timing from doses 1 to 7 they want it registered for from week to 0 to 156 because it's 2021 to 2023 and they want fine grain details they want male Fe male female data separately they want the ages accurate up to age of 100 after 100 it can be aggregated because there's not that many people over the age of 100 and they could potentially be identified so that just eliminates that possibility granular granular level data is what we want currently uh 10 to 20 years of age ranging starting at 18 so there's big gaps at the moment we want we want individual ages of individual years of age precise time of vaccine doses precise times of deaths uh deaths on a week by week basis and then the statisticians will be able to give us definitive reassurance that the government statements are in fact correct and uh they they give a few more details here they want precise this is about the precise numbers of deaths people that are alive and how that is going to be counted so there we have it there is the details of the letter here so you can obvious viously check this out for yourself it's now fully in the public domain and perfectly reasonable it appears to me and thanks to these uh seven parliamentarians and the other 21 members of parliament and the House of Lords who have asked for this data simple request reassure us all shut us the heck up and let's go on with the next job because there are plenty obviously as soon as these any of these departments release this data and its analyze we'll be talking about it as soon as we possibly can but I'm afraid it might not come this side of the general election which is disappointing that such political considerations may be employed when we're dealing with people's lives that's the letter it's a reasonable request and uh thank you for watching

#Germany #Vaccines #Coronavirus",2021-08-12,256248,2509,2445,UCeY0bbntWzzVIaj2z3QigXg, authorities in a district in northern germany are urging thousands of people who received a coped vaccination in the spring to come forward for another shot it's for a shocking reason they say some may have received saline solution instead of a vaccine multiple reports say a red cross nurse is suspected of being behind the switch nbc news correspondent megan fitzgerald joins us now from london with more on this story so megan people in the district of friesland are being warned about this how many people could have been affected and what are authorities now saying to them well joe good morning we're talking about some 8 600 people who may have been injected with saline solution at once maybe even twice as opposed to the coven 19 vaccine which is why authorities there are trying to get the word out trying to contact people posting on social media facebook trying to let folks know that they need to make an appointment to come back and to get another dose now during this time period in question uh vaccines were prioritized so we're talking about people who are 70 years and older who are eligible for the vaccine front-line health care workers along with teachers and educators so we're talking about some of the most vulnerable population here joe so police are reportedly investigating a red cross nurse what more can you tell us about that are they saying what the motive might be so here's what we know this investigation by police started in april because they tell us that this nurse in question here admitted to a co-worker that she dropped a vial of the pfizer vaccine she didn't want to report it so she replaced it with the saline solution this co-worker then reported that to the leadership leadership contacted police and that's when this investigation started so police have been doing their due diligence over the last several months and the reason why they believe that some 8 600 people could be susceptible to have gotten the wrong injection here is because they found uh some evidence uh that suggests this woman may be an anti-vaxxer as we say uh that because she sent messages to people and made posts on social media and so they are concerned that she started doing this replacing the vials with the saline solution when she started working there in march all the way up until she made that confession in april joe let's talk about the anti-vaxxer movement how big of a problem is it there in germany yeah you know it's a good question uh we know that within the last recent months we have seen people taken to the streets in germany uh protesting the vaccine and and the way in which the government handled the pandemic um but when you look at germany at a whole the people there are receptive to the vaccine uh we're looking about 56 percent of the population they're fully vaccinated 63 with one dose of course the government there wanting to see the vaccination rate accelerate a lot quicker because they do believe joe that they are anticipating a fourth wave coming as early as the fall all right megan fitzgerald reporting from london megan thank you so much

#Omicron #Variant #Covid",2021-12-07,30167,166,637,UCeY0bbntWzzVIaj2z3QigXg, we start this afternoon with the demand for covid vaccines as the omicron variant is spreading across the u.s msnbc anchor lindsey reiser is at a private pharmacy in trenton new jersey that's expanding its hours to accommodate all the people who want coveted shots so lindsay hit us with it with all that demand how difficult is it to get a covered shot there what are you hearing from pharmacists hey allison so we're seeing this nationally more people are wanting to get shots both boosters and first-time shots and we're also seeing that on a local level you mentioned that i'm in trent new jersey that's in mercer county we're going to put up a graphic right now showing you right now where everybody stands so right now about 71 of the u.s population all ages have at least one shot new jersey that is higher than the national average and then here in mercer county it's a little lower than the state average but again higher than that national average now for people who are looking to get those appointments it kind of depends today it's been pretty steady but they've actually been surprised that it isn't as busy as it has been for example friday they gave out about 300 doses that's twice what they normally do i spoke to another health clinic here in trenton and they also told me that last week they had an hour wait so let's go ahead and listen to the pharmacist here at medical home pharmacy about this uptick usually saturday we didn't give the vaccination uh because the pharmacy hours are limited and the artworks nature has to be rested but we saw so many kids especially for kids we decided to open because we also go to some government events and uh try to help them the kids doesn't want to get walks in without their parents to cool events so we decided to go to open the pharmacy saturday and sunday so the parents can come and the kids can get their practicing with parents yeah so you just heard they are now expanding staying open saturdays and sundays so they can accommodate all these people who want shots allison so lindsay are people coming in for their first shots is this a booster crowd do we have a sense of what it is that they need it's mostly boosters that are driving this demand allison anecdotally that health clinic i told you about henry j austin they're seeing about two-thirds of the shots boosters here the pharmacist told me it's about 80 percent but we also want to put up a graphic nationally that kind of shows what the trend is uh we know that the rolling seven day average is up 30 percent week to week we're also seeing on a national level it's boosters that are driving it let's go ahead and listen to the chief medical officer for the henry j austin health clinic we've been seeing a big mix a significant increase in boosters but also still some people coming in for first doses children both age 12 to 18 and also 5 to 11. that has significantly increased in the sense that about a month and a half ago we were seeing maybe 15 to 20 vaccines in the three hours that we'd be at a standing location and now we're seeing up to 100 or more at a time so the advice right now is be patient be persistent if you're looking for an appointment all these pharmacies that are beefing up security they are extending hours to try and accommodate everybody allison lindsey let's talk about this new omicron variant i understand you have a case there in new jersey what do you know about it yeah the first new jersey case just confirmed yesterday a woman from georgia traveling to the state she also had recently traveled to south africa she tested positive and this is one of the reasons one of the driving factors allison that we're seeing and why people want shots it's concerns over omicron it's employee mandates it's booster eligibility expansion it's some people are are saying that they're not as hesitant as they were before so it's it's a number of reasons multi-faceted what's driving this demand allison yeah more incentives than ever to go and get that shot lindsay thank you thanks for watching our youtube channel follow today's top stories and breaking news by downloading the nbc news app you

as much as we can here right yeah we got to do what we can to mitigate the risk but we've we've seen that mandates don't work there's two fundamental things that we know about the mandate say they don't work as intended and b they're they're unconstitutional and that's being proved out that with osha and the fifth circuit court of appeals now stopping biden's vaccine mandate so look what the federal government needs to be doing right now is figuring out how to enable businesses small businesses large businesses and taxpayers uh to get back to work and to continue to grow so they get confidence and reinvest in their companies if they can't figure out how to do that by doing things like shifting left on the laffer curve lowering taxes for taxpayers then they need to just get out of the way and let the system continue to flourish and hopefully get back on its feet through natural open capitalism the irony of my colleague's statement is that people are leaving california in droves right now because of policies like this and other policies that are frankly squashing businesses i'm glad his district is thriving on the back of silicon valley business but the rest of california especially the blue-collar workers are are suffering we're seeing five and a half dollar gas right now the federal government needs to do its job get out of the way of this market uh secure our southern borders hold china accountable start tackling our debt pass a budget that's a novel idea and actually actually start implementing some conservative fiscal conservative policies here that actually will get the country back online uh we were hitting on eight cylinders before the pandemic uh hit us uh we were cruising uh doing 40 knots through the water right and then all of a sudden the ship came to a screeching halt because of the pandemic and as just we're starting to accelerate again now there's folks calling for vaccine mandates mass mandates and these are massive anchors that are just going to businesses especially small businesses congressman congressman what i don't understand about this is if we want to get the economy back up and running and we've seen the the stock markets the extent you believe it's a barometer of anything has come off uh in part because now we have this new variant if we could get everybody vaccinated uh it's not i i don't want to say it's a panacea but it would be a lot better and there's nothing in the constitution that says that you have the right to give me covet or anything else and so i don't understand this this argument about freedoms and on the other side of it we're going to pay for it anyway more than 40 percent of americans are effectively insured by the government taxpayers are paying medicare medicaid paying for all of this so there's there's an actual health care costs and then there's an economic cost and so i'm not sure i don't understand why you wouldn't want to advocate well more people let's remember the constitution does still exist despite the headwinds that we've had in the last two years and the encroachments on the constitution it still does exist so that we do have rights it's the first amendment the tenth amendment uh protecting us against federal governments and the reality is kill my mother the rights are that you can they're right i'm not killing your mother and if she has the vaccine those risks are mitigated and we're seeing that in most likely cases your your mother will not die if she's vaccinated that's the point of the vaccine look if you mandate something there's going to be 10 to 20 percent of our population that will not get the vaccine because of that mandate i'm vaccinated i believe the vaccine works as mr khan pointed out but the reality is is that there's a big chunk of our population that as soon as the federal government tells them to do something they will not do it and if we turn to blind eye and pretend like those unintended consequences don't exist we'll continue to see this problem get aggravated we need to allow people to have the choice we need to allow people to have access we need to make it affordable which we have we've made it uh as long as 20 of americans are deciding that they're not going to get vaccinated we're going to continue to have new variants that are going to emerge and we're going to be living with this in ways that i don't think people understand or understand the costs both the health costs and the economic ones the reality is we can have a hundred percent vaccination will still be in those scenarios this is why we have to hold china accountable this is what gain of function technology does in these viral and biological weapons we've got to hold them accountable we've got to figure out the source of this and not allow this to happen again but what we can't do is continue to allow this to  our entire nation our economy we've got to figure out how to mitigate the risk get as many people vaccinated as we can but not encroach on the constitution and we've got to stop weaponizing this virus as a weapon and a tool to erode and encroach upon our constitutional rights this is still the united states of america and while this president is mandating vaccines for people traveling into the country via commercial air i'm wondering if he's applying that same rationale to 185 000 illegal immigrants who are coming across our southern border on a monthly basis i don't think he is and that's where the real risk is one question are you going back to congressman connor congressman connor do you think the government has the right to to mandate a jab for someone that is opposed to it for whatever reason yes if they give an alternative which is testing and that's what nobody will need to realize that's not what we're talking about we're talking about a mandatory jab for everyone uh that i don't know for that that's not the president's policy why not though i i always call you like a member of the squad i think you're not the designer i like perspective but i look up a progressive capital they all are joe just on california i got to defend california california has had more economic growth than any state more job creation our economic growth actually has been only behind china in terms of the jobs that are we deserve we deserve to be twice as we deserve twice as much as we've experienced uh we we could be so much better if we just allowed the free market to work and and incentivize small businesses and taxpayers to stay in california it would be a glorious politician that's why president biden got elected nominations saying let's we're mass i mean congressman garcia

Dr. Peter Hotez: The Covid Vaccine Discovery Was Not A 4 Month Process, It Was A 17 Year Process",2020-12-09,74620,897,285,UCaXkIU1QidjPwiAYu6GcHjg," THE VACCINE DAY AND VICTORY DAY AND THE ENEMY THIS TIME IS COVID-19. >> KIER, STAY WITH US. DR. HOTEZ, CLEARLY THE LOGISTICS OF VACCINATING THE WORLD, BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE LESSONS AND THIS IS SOMETHING LORI GARRETT AND I TALKED ABOUT IN THE LAST HOUR. IF THE WHOLE WORLD IS NOT SAFE, THEN NONE OF US ARE SAFE. BUT TALK ABOUT BOTH ASPECTS OF KEIR’S REPORTING. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF VACCINE COMMENCING TODAY IN THE U.K. AND THE LONG, LONG ROAD AHEAD. >> YEAH, A FEW THINGS, NICOLLE. EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT WHAT A MIRACLE THE VACCINE ARE AND THEY ARE A MIRACLE IN ONE SENSE BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE THINK THAT THESE VACCINES JUST POPPED OUT OF NOWHERE OVER A PERIOD OF FOUR MONTHS AN ONE OF THE THINGS I’VE BEEN TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE IF THEY THINK VACCINES ARE RUSHED, THIS IS NOT A FOUR MONTH PROCESS. THAT IS 17 YEAR PROCESS. THE DISCOVERY OF VACCINE FOR CORONAVIRUS BEGAN 17 YEARS AGO AFTER SARS EMERGED IN 2003. CORONAVIRUS STARTED OUT OF SOUTH CHINA AND SHUT DOWN TORONTO, CANADA. AND THAT IS WHEN WE IDENTIFY THE THE SOFT PROTEIN AS THE SOFT UNDERBELLY OF THE VIRUS AND EXPERIMENTAL VACCINES FIRST DEVELOPED SO WHEN THE CHINESE PUT UP THE SEQUENCE OF COVID ON BIO ARCHIVE IN JANUARY, THE CORONAVIRUS COMMUNITY OF VACCINE RESEARCHERS LOOKED AT THIS AND SAID WE GOT THIS. WE KNOW HOW TO MAKE A COVID VACCINE. AND THEN IT WAS A MATTER OF WHICH TECHNOLOGY COULD GO THE FIRST, BE THE FASTEST AND WHICH IS THE MOST ENDURING. AND SO ALL OF THE VACCINES THAT YOU’RE HEARING ABOUT, WHETHER IT IS ASTRAZENECA OR PFIZER OR MODERNA OR J&amp;J AND R’S WHICH IS IN INDIA, ALL TARGET THAT SPIKE PROTEIN AND THAT IS IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE REALIZE THAT THIS IS NOT RUSHED. THIS IS WAY A DELIBERATE LONG-TERM PROGRAM. SO IT IS EXCITING TO SEE THIS VACCINE GO INTO MAGGIE’S ARM AND SO THRILLED FOR HER AND HER FAMILY. AND THIS IS SCALED UP IN ENGLAND AND NOW WE’RE MOVING TO THE U.S. I THINK IN A FEW DAYS. >> I THINK WHAT YOU SAID SOUNDS LIKE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN THE CATEGORY OF REASSURING PEOPLE OF THE SAFETY ESPECIALLY ON A DAY WHEN REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE HAD A VACCINE SKEPTIC TESTIFY. SOMETHING THAT I THINK ALARMED A LOT OF FOLKS. I WANT TO GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO PUT WHAT YOU SAID IN MORE CONTEXT. SO LET ME ASK IT WAY. SO YOUR SAYING THE KIND OF VIRUS THAT CARRIED COVID ALL OVER IN THE WORLD IN THE LAST TEN MONTHS IS FROM A FAMILY OF VIRUSS THAT SCIENTISTS LIKE YOURSELF HAVE BEEN STUDYING FOR A LONG TIME AND ONCE THEY GOT THE SPECIFICS THEY WERE ABLE TO FINE TUNE AND PUT THE FINISH TOUCHES ON THIS VACCINE. THAT IS WHAT YOU’RE EXPLAINING? >> THAT IS RIGHT. SO WE HAVE TO -- WE SAW SARS IN 2003 AND THEN MIDDLE EASTERN REPRESENT IN 2012 AND WE SAID HANG ON THERE IS A NEW CORONAVIRUS COMING EVERY DECADE. WE KNEW THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE COMING. AND THIS IS THE POWER OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF THE HEALTH AND ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES HEADED BY DR. FAUCI AND NIH, THEY LAUNCHED A MAJOR PROGRAM FOR CORONAVIRUS IN 2003. WE WERE THE BENEFICIARIES OF THAT. WE GOT FUNDED TO DEVELOP SOME OF THE FIRST PROTOTYPE VACCINE. SO THIS IS DELIBERATE BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE NIH TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. AGAIN, THIS IS WHY WE WERE VERY BLESSED TO HAVE THE NIH HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND FUNDING THAT RESEARCH. AND WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO. BECAUSE WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE HOW THIS VACCINE ROLLS OUT IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO SCALE IT UP. HOW ROBUST THE PRODUCTION PROCESS WILL BE. THIS IS A BRAND-NEW TECHNOLOGY. AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY WE’RE BRINGING OUT OTHER VACCINES ON TOP OF IT, THE ADENOVIRUS"

#davidpakmanshow #joerogan #covid",2022-01-13,494544,14312,5326,UCvixJtaXuNdMPUGdOPcY8Ag," Speaker 1: I want to look at a clip from I
believe it's yesterday's Joe Rogan program, Joe Rogan interviewed a friend of our show. Josh zaps very good guy. I've been on his show doesn't mean Josh and
I agree on everything, but I've always known him to be a good guy. Josh appeared with Joe Rogan and the topic
came up of myocarditis risk for young men from the COVID vaccines. Important topic. Joe Rogan was presented with the evidence
that the risk of myocarditis from having COVID is significantly higher than the risk of myocarditis
from the vaccine. In both cases, most everybody recovers. No problem, but the risk of myocarditis is
higher if you get COVID than if you get the vaccine in real time, you will see really
disappointing goal post moving and techniques from Joe Rogan that are really typical. Sadly, of the people that email me and are
clearly set in their ways and don't want to have their minds changed. So let's take a look at the conversation. This is this is interesting. It's also really sad
Speaker 2: pointing myocarditis more common after COVID 19 infection than vaccination. But is this what? Speaker 1: Oh, so first. Now here's a study. The study already says myocarditis is more
common from COVID than from the vaccine, so that already goes against what Joe Rogan has
been told. And I'll show you part of where he got it. Speaker 2: Children, uh, yeah. We're talking about young men. Speaker 1: So Rogan now says, Well, I'm really
I'm talking about it within young people. Speaker 2: Only boys aged under 30 after this,
this one says here. Speaker 1: So as you can see, the study as
as Jamie points out, includes up to age 30 and that includes younger and that includes
up to all the way up to 30 Speaker 2: with children is the issue. Speaker 1: Well, now Brogan says, I'm only
concerned about children here. Speaker 2: We're talking about 15 year olds. Well, we're talking about young children. So yes, all of the 17 12 to 17 more like the
myocarditis with three months of catching COVID at a rate of 450 cases per million infection,
this compares to 67 cases of myocarditis per million josh. Speaker 1: The same points out correctly. Look at the 12 to 17 age group. Is that young enough, Joe? Even among 12 to 17, your risk of getting
myocarditis from COVID is about eight times higher than from the vaccine
Speaker 2: time following her second dose of Pfizer. Yes, so you're about eight times likelier
to get myocarditis from getting COVID than from getting the vaccine. That's interesting. That is not what I've read before, but also
it's like, well, even when we're reading these things, it's like, What are we getting this
from? Well, this is
Speaker 1: a peer reviewed study, and there's numerous peer reviewed studies that have been
done on this. So. So notice the goalposts shifting. It's OK now there is a claim that the risk
is actually higher of myocarditis from COVID than from vaccines. But can we really trust what we're reading? Well, actually, we can
Speaker 2: promote Verizon forward, but even from the various reports, when they report
this stuff, it's like the amount of people that report them, like it's the underreporting. Speaker 1: So now there's a new thing, which
is Rogan says, even if you consider Veirs, which is not even verified, Rogan says stuff
is being underreported. So this study is based on under-reporting
to Veirs when we know the real issue with theirs is actually over reporting completely
unconfirmed reporting. Notice the goalposts shifting that takes place
Speaker 2: depending upon who you ask and what it is. It's either one percent under OK. Speaker 1: So this is unfortunately, this
is what happens a lot of times when you when you have these types of conversations with
people. Now, I had this conversation not long ago. I have a family member who works in pediatrics,
and I said before I got my third dose, you know, I'm kind of freaked out because now
when you sign up for your third, like I'm the most pro vaccine person. When I signed up for my third dose, it had
me. I understand it said, Do you understand that
there is a risk of myocarditis? And it just freaked me out and the person
I was talking to said, Yeah, but David, remember the risk to people. Your age from COVID of myocarditis is higher
than from the vaccine. And here studies that we've been looking at
and I looked at it and said, Oh, you're absolutely right. Right. That makes sense. And a lot of this goes back to that Peter
McCullough appearance with Joe Rogan, where McCullough was talking about vaccine induced
myocarditis and did not mention, by the way, the risk of COVID induced myocarditis is dramatically
higher than from the vaccine. So I wish that Joe Rogan had received this
information differently. Really nice job by Josh Zaps, and as I've
said before, I welcome any opportunity to go back on and talk to Rogen about exactly
this issue."

#WSJ #Vaccine #Logistics",2020-12-11,68378,948,244,UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ, [Music] the first covet 19 vaccine one made by pfizer is about to get authorized by the fda and the moderna vaccine and others should soon follow but those milestones are only small steps in getting the world back to normal the bigger hurdle getting the drugs out to hospitals across the country and then into the arms of patients vaccinating every american will not be quick or easy it will require an intricate set of physical and human logistics spanning the movement of millions of vaccine vials on trucks and airplanes ultracold storage and education campaigns to help people understand the risks and benefits so how exactly will the coven 19 vaccines be rolled out and when can you expect for a vaccine to be ready for you in the u.s the first step in delivering pfizer's vaccine will be to move millions of doses from the drug makers distribution hubs in michigan and wisconsin to designated locations throughout the country one of those places is the university of cincinnati medical center in ohio do you know how many you're getting in this in this first batch the way it's being distributed in the state of ohio is in lots of 975 doses the pre-positioning sites will probably be receiving one package each initially and then significantly larger amounts flowing after that any facility that needs a smaller amount than the 975 of the pfizer vaccine will be receiving it after it is reprocessed through the state of ohio into smaller lots of about 100 doses because of the short supply the first doses will be reserved for healthcare workers the people who work in healthcare are all essential so the individuals on that list include environmental services workers they include transporters they include the pharmacist they include the doctors they include the nurses and public safety but this first rollout will inform how the rest of us get vaccinated hospitals like the university of cincinnati medical center initially expected to get the vaccine in advance of the eua now they're expecting it around december 15th pfizer says it will not distribute doses before it gets fda authorization we still don't know exactly when the eua will be once that's issued hospitals can start vaccinating their employees to get doses each site had to prove that they had the right kind of equipment to store the vaccines properly pfizer's vaccine needs to be transported in special shipping containers and stored in freezers that can maintain ultra cold conditions not all healthcare facilities have that kind of storage capacity modernist vaccine requires less frigid temperatures but delivering that one also isn't quite as simple as distributing flu shots both the pfizer and moderna vaccines require two shots spread over the course of weeks where are you physically going to be distributing the vaccine at the medical center so that's a bit of a balance too right we want to be able to have as few sites as is functional in order to be able to maintain quality controls we talked about the refrigeration issues so our current plan we have three facilities that we will be managing through our initial shipment is to have one one location at each of our three facilities an important goal is to make them accessible to as many of the first recipients as possible that's because another big consideration is equity and some locations aren't accessible by public transit which could limit access figuring out the human logistics will be just as important as supply chain in the vaccine rollout which is being conducted by the cdc in three phases the first is about to start with priority given to nurses and doctors who have direct contact with infected patients or infectious materials as well as nursing home residents that amounts to about 24 million people which exceeds the current number of available doses hospitals don't just have to figure out which employees to prioritize but also who will be willing to take the vaccine at least initially most hospital systems likely won't make it mandatory everyone has to make their own decision this is an emergency use authorization vaccine that is brand new but we as a society need as many of the people who are essential to keeping things functioning that can take the vaccine to do so the hospital system sent out a survey to staff to assess what proportion would be willing to take the vaccine now or ever they fit quite well with the national averages you're looking at somewhere between a 50 and 70 and willingness to take the vaccine and that's exactly where our employees sat as well so if you're talking about from a herd immunity perspective um numbers for that vary quite a bit but most of the time you hear anywhere from 60 to 75 percent or so of the population being immune to truly get hurt immunity herd immunity is quite a ways down the road probably a year or more off administrators are also organizing education campaigns to inform staff about the potential side effects and the vaccine safety especially given how quickly it was developed typically it takes an average of 10 years to develop a vaccine for covid19 vaccines development has been measured in months so it would be very easy without a really strong understanding of that process to assume that the fact that it happened so quickly when you look back in history and see how long other vaccines have taken to produce and the fact that we have some things that we can't still produce a vaccine for to assume that there were corners cut that we did that things were done in a sloppy manner or an unsafe manner to produce a vaccine and that's just not the case one organization doing some of that outreach is the immunization action coalition where dr lj tan is the chief strategy officer we need to show firstly to the providers data as an evidence so that they feel confident getting the vaccines themselves and then we also need to make sure that they then feel confident giving a recommendation to their patients because the number one reason why a patient gets vaccinated is is a recommendation from a healthcare provider dr tan and others said that the experience of giving people flu shots during the pandemic was what they learned from the first rollout will help inform covert vaccinations for the general public so i think we'll learn a lot about that um how do you manage to schedule people um in a way that we don't produce a social distancing nightmare where we're trying to give out the vaccine you know that would be a little bit counterproductive because you don't have immunity the second you get the vaccination we've done flu campaigns for years but a lot of times that involves something that looks a lot like disneyland where you have these long lines of people packed in very closely waiting to their turn and you just can't do that with this particular situation because you would like i said you'd be spreading the virus within your lines of people getting the vaccine [Music] you

personally i've had every flu shot since at least the swine flu i'm current in all my other vaccines i was a huge supporter of operation war speed happy to acknowledge that over 300 million doses of the vaccine have been given the u.s and for most people the vast majority of people the vaccine has been administered with little or no side effects and i personally believe the vaccine has saved countless lives and certainly contributed to the end of this pandemic which is what everybody in the world wants and so i think i can speak for everybody we had a real nice uh session up in my office uh earlier i think that's the general attitude again i'll let the group speak for itself but again just because the vaccine is generally safe doesn't mean that it's 100 percent safe last week the wall street journal carried a column by two uh doctors dr joseph ladapo he's associate professor of medicine at ucla's school of medicine and dr harvey rich he's a senior professor of epidemiology at yale school of public health the op-ed was titled quote are covered vaccines riskier than advertised in that column the doctors report that quote the large clustering of certain adverse events immediately after vaccinating is concerning i would agree and then they list four that follow that pattern of clustering uh immediately following vaccination and they're listing low platelets non-infectious myocarditis that's what you're hearing about the the inflammation of the heart do with generally younger men uh deep vein thrombosis the clotting and death so today we're here because ken ruckers i think you probably all recognize ken a lot more famous than i am uh reached out to me and i'll let 10 or i'll let ken tell his story but the story of him reaching out to me is is one that i think everybody will sympathize with what's been happening over the last year and a half is people that are trying to tell the truth people are trying to get answers are having a hard time getting their truths communicated without being vilified without being ridiculed without being censored and i think that's the general experience of the people in this group that are going to be talking to you today and so ken had heard of my advocacy for things like early treatment but also the fact that i've been raising the issues in the cdc's own warning system the vayer system and taking a fair amount of flak fort and being attacked for it but i'm not sure i'll let ken tell a story but it seemed like he didn't have any place else to turn so he called me up or contacted my office i called him back and we got on a zoom call with members of their group and it was about almost two hours a good solid hour and a half i know i know it went on i'd go take another phone call a lot of tears um what i came away from that phone call was this is a group of people that have a very simple request they just want to be seen they want their stories heard they would like to be believed from my standpoint i thought i could least help on the first two i could work with ken and we could create an event so they could be seen that could be heard it'll be up to the audience to see whether they give them the believe part at a minimum at a minimum i hope they are taken seriously they need to be taken seriously so with that without further ado ken records i think you all know who ken is thank you senator johnson and i want to thank the media as well for being here appreciate you guys taking time out of your day to be here get the microphone a little bit closer you can i became um acquainted with this group and i'll tell you a little bit about the group in a second when my wife cheryl took the first dose of moderna and started to have some adverse reactions and she'll she'll talk about that in in greater detail and we went through um going to see doctors neurologists tests mris and again she'll talk about that but her doctors were stumped as you as you all know this is new stuff right this is this we're in a lot of new territory um and after lots of tests and scans um she started looking doing some of her own research because she wanted answers and that's when she found a physician who had also had similar neurological reactions and it was on a neurology today uh website and the physician had posted on it and they found dr hertz and that's how this this group started and they found each other they started a private social media group and as more people you know and this was in january and then february and the group grew and as more people took the vaccine the group continued to grow and as they grew they reached out to doctors for help all and you'll hear all kinds of of nutritionists and acupuncturists neurologists um all kinds of doctors and uh with still without any answers they wrote a letter and signed the letter and they sent it out to the cdc the fda in the white house they reached out they reached out to media local media national media they reached out to their local politicians they tried contacting the drug companies uh and without response i mean they often use the term god would feel ghosted so with without a voice without daily growing uh with the daily growing population um that were experiencing these reactions um and their frustration with not being heard or seen or recognized or believed i mean they they didn't even have to have a chance to be believed because nobody responded my brother and i and cheryl and brie um started a website c as in covet c19vaxvaxreactions.com and they and and it was a place that they could find each other travelers in a desert that that that provided an idea that hey maybe we're not alone as we think and people started sharing their stories and there's over 30 stories that people have written and posted on this website and another 545 that are waiting to be edited and put on that's well over 80 people that are reaching out because they want their stories to be heard i started i started to do interviews like video interviews like zoom interviews with them to help them tell their stories as i got to know the group as it grew and then another group also came into the fold within you know that website there's now over two thousand people that represent two three different groups that are and we've got contacted recently with with more groups that say yeah we're in on this too they're kind of out there and we don't even know about them because they're not being heard um but let me just tell you a little bit about the group mostly they're mostly women mostly women and there's probably a couple reasons and i won't get into that but there's probably at least two or three different reasons why that is but um well i'll we can talk about that later they are they are pro vaccine as senator johnson said right we're pro-vaccine and they think we can be pro-vaccine attack attack this pandemic get through this pandemic and be taken care of and being heard they think they can they think we can't do both that sounds reasonable to me many in the group especially the first few weeks are doctors physicians nurses mental health professionals because they were taking they were in the first rollout so you had a lot of a lot of people that were pro science pro and they're pro science right we have a electrical engineer a dental hygienist my wife's working on her master's in counseling bree and her husband who's a phd in chemistry right uh candace who's a phd i mean these are people that are very pro-education pro-act pro-science and the crazy thing and i think senator johnson mentioned that and when we got on the zoom on sunday part of what i saw was i saw as you probably see to some degree they look normal and they'll talk about vibrations and tingling and numbness and and i mean imagine it's hard even for me to get to get my mind around when my wife says yeah my face feels like you've been to the dentist you get a novocaine shot and it starts to come back from numbness like a tingling and then after about 20 or 30 minutes it goes away but this is this is her life this is their life 24 7. can you imagine having that that tingly funky like drooly look but all over your face or all over your body um and they're searching for medical solutions without any answers and the other thing i've noticed too with this group is i've interviewed them and gotten to know and listen to them talk is they are desperately vulnerable to medical hucksters without the research and without the science and without studying this they are vulnerable people because they're desperate for their health so with that desperation i continued to edit and i saw these voices that weren't being heard and so i i i just uploaded on the website maddie and stephanie's stories uh story and i thought to myself my goodness this seems like a no-brainer to me right you have you have people that are fellow americans that are being hurt no fault of their own they they were moving forward to help us all move beyond the pandemic and get vaccinated now you know a small percentage right and i thought man that's a no-brainer i and senator i don't know why i mean i'm living out in oregon but senator johnson came to mind he seemed like to me is the the the the sound bites i'd heard over the last few years seemed like a decent man he seemed like a good man and i was at my wit's end not because i needed help but because i'd heard i heard their heart their stories and so i called up senator johnson he called me back later that day i was overwhelmed and when i told them the rest of the group the news they were overwhelmed because they felt like wow we're finally being heard and so um we're going to show a video yeah we're going to show a video and then they're going to take a turn sharing their stories so if you want to run that turn off the light there speaking of people to see it thank you so thank you again for being here and for um for for seeing them and believing them and hearing them so i've never been an anti-vaccer i have received every vaccination possible i am pro-vaccine and pro-science my children have all been vaccinated i was part of the phase 3 clinical trial for astrazeneca here in the united states this is my daughter maddie who was in the pfizer vaccine trial for 12 to 15 year olds i received moderna one dose of moderna i received my pfizer vaccination i was ready to do it for my family for my community and for me to get back to my career i lined up to get this vaccine in the clinical trial so obviously i was pro-vaccine going into this i still am pro-vaccine we didn't we weren't worried she just said she didn't think anything would happen started not feeling well in the middle of the night she came into her room her heart felt like it was being pulled out of her body and went up through her neck i started to feel dizzy i had heart palpitations felt like i couldn't breathe and my leg bubbled i literally looked down to see that i had legs but they were not there they were not functioning i couldn't feel my feet i couldn't feel anything from the waist down my face has paresthesia and so it's tingles and burns all the time you couldn't touch her anywhere on her body or she would scream i was having these shaky fits and i would explain it is my body just violently shaking i set her down and and gave her my will and i actually recorded it so that my son wouldn't have to go through if i didn't make it i feel like i'm according that my body is gonna snap and hold up place me in a little box the one doctor that was in charge of my case told me to get used to being handicapped which excuse i feel debilitated i am debilitated i wish i could show my daughter but she was like before all this so they could see there was nothing wrong with it she was perfectly happy i was fine one day and then i wasn't i didn't develop ms overnight you can tell me all the things that i haven't had but you can't tell me what i have had and i can tell you that i've had the fascination which i myself i know for a fact that this was a reaction to the vaccine i think they thought i was crazy i really do think that they that i was crazy until until i found others like me and was able to tell them look i'm not the only one suffering this guy's like there are more people that are that this is happening to know that there is a bigger risk with kids and admit it amid all the symptoms that maddie had in the report because they're not all in there we're not seen we're not we're not people we're we're invisible i want to be seen i want to be heard and i want to be believed because i think from those three things will be the answers and very much pro science i think that science will be able to get us out of this i guess that's how i'm going to end it i'm not going to stop i'm not going to give up and i'm not going to shut up hi thank you for being here today and thank you again senator johnson for giving us a platform to be able to share our stories my name is cheryl rutgers i live in oregon i'm a wife i'm a mother and a grandmother i'm also a graduate student completing my degree in clinical mental health i'm also completing a professional internship at a group home for adjudicated females as a step down from formal corrections and it was that um that afforded me the opportunity to be in phase one of oregon's rollout of the vaccine on january 14th i received the modernity vaccine the next morning i woke up with severely swollen lymph nodes in my neck could barely move my neck three days later i woke up in the middle of the night with stroke-like symptoms i went to the emergency room my face and scalp were tingling numb and burning with pain and my left arm and legs were weak and also numb since then i have been seen by multiple neurologists one of whom diagnosed me with vaccine induced autoimmune neuropathy although he did tell me that he was flying blind because he had never seen reaction like this to a vaccine and hence doesn't know how to treat me i also had one neurologist who diagnosed me with multiple sclerosis despite stating that my brain scan showed absolutely no evidence of disease i do not have ms my scans are clean over the course of five months my neurological symptoms have intensified to include neuropathy in both feet involuntary muscle twitching and weakness internal tremors intermittent essential tremors in my hands i have sort of parkinsonian symptoms i have debilitating brain fog i have facial paresthesia and nerve pain and that happens all day long for the last five months i said in the video that i feel debilitated and this has been debilitating for me before my vaccine i was very healthy and active i enjoyed fly fishing and mountain biking hiking and chasing after our grandkids i also enjoyed my graduate studies and i also just went to the doctor once a year for annual checkups i was very grateful for good health because i have friends who do not have good health since my vaccine i have debilitating brain fog and an inability to sustain my focus on my studies and my demanding internship to the point that i had to drastically reduce my counseling client load by 75 percent my neurological symptoms have left me barely able to function some days and the internal tremors create a type of fatigue that i have never experienced before i'm unable to fully participate in the activities that i enjoyed before being vaccinated my life has been negatively altered as a result of my vaccine will i get better will i develop parkinson's or ms or als or another neurodegenerative disease i don't know and my doctors can't tell me if they know so what do i want i want our neurological injuries to be recognized and acknowledged by the cdc and the fda this will allow the medical community to research with freedom and openness that's necessary to help us and the many people that are coming behind us as it's been stated i'm pro-vaccine i'm definitely pro-science but i'm also pro-informed consent and these vaccine injuries are real but people don't know people need to understand that these reactions exist and they need to be researched thank you thank you senator johnson good morning my name is candace hayden and i'm from michigan i received the moderna vaccine on march 2nd and the second dose on march 30th on april 18th i had a typical day swimming running and gardening i was beginning the training for my next triathlon at 7 pm i turned to my left and felt an odd pain under my shoulder braid i took a step and my right leg buckled slightly but i didn't think any of anything of it i continued with my day and then around midnight i went to stand and both my legs buckled i was suffering from severe paresthesia and was paralyzed partially paralyzed from my chest down during the 26 day hospital stay i had six mris two cts a tee a spinal tap and several blood tests they ruled out ms transverse myelitis spinal cord stroke and autoimmune disease medically there was absolutely nothing wrong with my body after seven days the medical team prescribed an aggressive dose of steroids that resulted in no change i started inpatient therapy after 17 days and i was released from the hospital on may 14th with no concrete diagnosis the head of my medical team told me that i should get used to being handicapped i started and in and still in outpatient therapy and on may 21st i visited my primary care doctor as i was instructed who told me that she couldn't offer me anything but if i needed her to give her a call my medical team at the hospital refused to associate my condition with the vaccine and i continually asked them to report to veers but i don't think that they did it defies my imagination that we can find each other but the medical community refuses to draw the lines and recognize that people are suffering similar adverse side effects case in point i was able to locate another patient in the hospital that i was in with similar symptoms brought it to the attention of my medical team and they refused to even speak to that patient's doctor i don't have a spouse nor do i have young children in one respect i'm truly blessed from my family not having to have to suffer but it leaves me isolated and lonely as my interactions with others is limited this is far worse than coved lockdown before this i was healthy i was active and self-sufficient i fear my diminished quality of life is my new normal will i ever run again will i ever ride my bike i would give anything to get in my car and just drive it my greatest fear is for others like maddie the children those that are younger that don't have a voice they can't tell you how they're feeling that don't understand why their legs are no longer working i am pro-vaccine i am pro-science and i understand the vaccine is for the greater good however i also understand that we represent a small portion experiencing negative side effects we trusted science and we did our part as a result we are now synonymous to wounded soldiers who should not be left behind we are asking to be seen we are asking to be heard and we're asking to be believed thank you hi i'm christy dobbs i do really appreciate you all being here today it means a lot to us and senator johnson oh i'm sorry senator johnson thank you so much for your willingness to have us here so that my voice can be heard but not just mine but thousands behind me as i said my name is christy dobbs i'm from missouri i am a wife and a mother of four children and i have practiced as a dental hygienist for the last 17 years and since being in such a career i have always been pro-science and pro-vaccination before my vaccination i was a healthy and active 39 year old i enjoyed activities outside traveling and crafting with my family i also cherished my work in a very busy pediatric dental office i was not taking any medications prior to the vaccine and i have never had a covet infection and i have been tested for proof in january my life changed drastically immediately after the injection i felt an odd tingling type dripping sensation in my arm i had immediate heart palpitations and a feeling is if i was going to pass out i'm so sick and my blood pressure reading was so high that i don't know how i didn't have a stroke i cannot quote what it was but as a hygienist i take blood pressure readings on my patients before i treat them my adult patients and it was so high that i was scared in that moment that something was happening to me i did eventually stabilize they monitored me for the 15 minutes and then an extra 30 minutes after and i did stabilize so they went on ahead and sent me home um when i got home i felt a little you know woozy a little dizzy um the next couple of days i just had a headache and just kind of that feeling of unwell all of the things that i had signed up for to get the vaccine but it was three days later that my symptoms increased and accelerated i had a sharp stabbing pain in my scapula area that was just this intermittent like a knife stabbing pain i had tingling and numbness throughout my body it ran down both my arms i also still had the heart palpitations i had these internal vibrations and the only way i can explain the internal vibrations is it feels like you have this little electric shock running through your body like you're stuck in a vibrating chair like glued into it and it never stops which has made me leery if i'll ever be able to practice as a hygienist again and like cheryl i am so fearful that i may have some sort of neurological issue after this with parkinson's they have ruled out ms but again they have not told me that i have anything they can tell me what i don't have i have swollen lymph nodes brain fog i had brain fog so extreme that i would be having a conversation with someone and i would black out try to come back to that conversation and nothing was there swollen lymph nodes muscle weakness unexplained skin rashes i had convulsions and nighttime seizures i had to have my six-year-old daughter wake me up from a fit in the middle of the night no six-year-old should have to do that for their parents i have also experienced thick clotting heavy menstrual cycles i was so afraid that i literally and i have it with me i prepared my will and my obituary for my family because i didn't think that i would wake up to the next day i have reported my symptoms to vsafe bears cdc fda pfizer i have also sent information to two very well known research institutes and i have also reached out to prestigious universities i've been dealing with this for five months these past five months my severe neurological reactions continue to plague me every day feels like i'm trapped in the movie groundhog day i go to sleep praying thinking i'm gonna wake up the next morning and be better and i'm not i've had multiple tests more than any person should have to go through this time in their life i have had x-rays blood work mris ct scans ultrasounds eegs and more today the medical community has still remained baffled and unable to restore my health i'm scared and frightened for my future so i do have hope and this is why i'm here today speaking out this is not an easy thing to do guys but i hope that our conditions will be researched and studied i hope that we can find a solution and a pathway to health that's all we want i would give anything i would give my whole life savings if i could go back to january 17th and never to have had to experience this in my life and three that those that are suffering and that those that will come behind us because the vaccine is still rolling out that they will benefit from us coming forward and speaking today we have suffered long enough i think that we do deserve this time that you've given us today and we are so gracious that you've taken your time to be here today but we do deceive to be deserve to be seen what you are seeing us today and heard you're listening but we need to be believed that is the biggest issue we just want you guys to believe that this is real we are real americans we are real people experiencing these side effects so i thank you for doing just that today all right um so first thank you um senator johnson for the opportunity to share matty's story and to all of you for your willingness to listen this isn't easy for me and it's this has been very clearly emotional so i'm gonna read what i've written so i don't lose track my name is stephanie and this is my daughter maddie and we live in ohio on january 20th maddie received her second dose of the pfizer cova vaccine as a participant in the clinical trial for 12 to 15 year olds all three of our kids volunteered and we're excited to participate in the trial as a way to help us all return to normal life my husband works in the medical field and i have a degree in electrical engineering we are pro-vaccine and pro-science which is why we agreed to let maddie and her two older brothers volunteer for the trial before maddie got her final dose of the vaccine she was a healthy 12 year old who got straight a's um and had lots of friends she had a life she was energetic she was not like this although she does still have lots of friends upon receiving the second shot maddie immediately felt pain at the ejection site and over the next 24 hours she developed severe abdominal and chest pain and the way she described the chest pain and i quote it feels like my heart is being ripped out through my neck she had painful electrical shocks down her neck and spine that forced her to walk hunched over she had extreme pain in her fingers and toes and they actually made them turn white and they were cold whenever you touched them she had edema um so my husband immediately took her to the er as instructed by the vaccine child nurse administrator which is what we were instructed to do her blood was taken for arena profile and tested she was checked for appendicitis which she did not have and given an iv was medicine then send her however in the discharge papers from the children's hospital er that she went to the diagnosis stated adverse effect of vaccine initial encounter this would be the only time that that was written in her medical charts but it's in there over the next two and a half months her abdominal muscle and nerve pain became unbearable she developed additional symptoms that included gastroparesis nausea and vomiting erratic blood pressure and heart rate memory loss she mixes up words brain fog headaches dizziness fainting she finally hit her head and then um seizures she had verbal do you develop verbal and motor tics she had loss of feeling from the waist down and muscle weakness drastic changes in her vision urinary retention and loss of bladder control severely irregular and heavy menstrual cycles and eventually she had to have an energy tube put in to get nutrition all these symptoms are still here today some days are worse than others our greatest challenge came when her doctors began to consider an alternative diagnosis well she really didn't have one before so it was the first one so like everybody else she had lots of tests but not nearly as many tests as everybody else when she's a child why didn't they do this all those tests on her sorry so because they couldn't figure it out one physician labored labeled her as having functional neurologic disorder saying it was due to anxiety this concerned us and we didn't agree with it because she doesn't have the anxiety look at her i mean what 13 year old can sit here calmly okay if they have anxiety or mental issues at one point they even tried to admit her to a mental hospital so we did seek additional medical opinions some of which came from this group in june we connected her neurologist with another doctor that's doing research on adverse reactions like maddie's she was finally provided but they finally gave her an mri did an mri of her brain an rv and a bunch of additional blood tests it took five months to get that done over the past five months maddie has been to the er nine times and has been hospitalized three times for a total of two months in the hospital what i want to ask matty volunteered for the pfizer child why why aren't they researching her to figure out why this happened so other people don't have to go through this instead they're just saying it's mental anybody's mental is me so today our journey is parents to help our daughter maddie continues all we want is for maddie to be seen heard and believed because she has not been and we want her to get the care she desperately needs so that she can go back to normal why is she not back to normal she was totally fine before this she did the right thing trying to help everybody else and they're not helping her thanks nice and close closer i just wanted to say thank you all for being here to hear these stories and as you can see now i have to see your faces we are like family we have suffered together for so long in a way that no one understands but us so we really do appreciate you taking your time to give us a voice to give us this opportunity to plead our case a huge thank you to senator johnson he's been very kind and very generous with this time i also want to say thanks to senator lee my home senator and his staff for their compassion and for taking our concerns seriously and they're actively working on with us to help us find a solution my name is brianne dressen i am a preschool teacher in utah and i'm a mother of two small kids like everyone else here i'm a strong supporter of science and i've always believed in the importance of vaccines i was so confident in this that i enrolled in the phase three clinical trial here in the united states for astrazeneca within minutes of my first shot i felt tingling down my arm and by that evening my vision had become blurry and sound became distorted and i developed hyperacusis which is a sensitivity to sound within 48 hours i landed into the er the first of many visits my sensitivity to light and sound became so severe that i had to be confined to my bedroom alone in darkness and silence even brushing my teeth was painful i then began experiencing erratic heart rate and body temperature extreme nausea to the point that i lost over 20 pounds just before thanksgiving i lost control of my legs and my bladder along with my dignity at the hospital i was treated for a severe migraine and when that didn't resolve anything they told me it was anxiety next came the vibrations and they were internal vibrations in my brain and all through my body i couldn't think i couldn't eat i could barely breathe this persisted 24 7 for months i was trapped in isolation and in silence completely overwhelmed by the sensations attacking my body my children went days without seeing me i missed out on months of their lives i did not buy a single christmas present for my kids i thought i was dying and after months i wanted to die after months of suffering alone i found dr hertz in her group i was initially relieved to hear others like me however my relief turned to alarm as our numbers grew and then it started impacting kids all of our experiences were similar healthy people who became ill after receiving the vaccine whose doctors instead that insisted that these reactions were not really happening that the cdc would have told them they blamed ms they blamed anxiety they blamed my grains anything but the vaccines a new friend of mine had long haulers then she received the vaccine in hopes that her symptoms would improve however rather than bringing relief the vaccine took what little progress she had made leaving her severely debilitated we talked often many days just trying to hold on then i hadn't heard from her for a few days and i get a phone call from her husband and she'd become a victim of suicide the human toll is real this is not some benign reaction this thing overtakes your body and you have no choice but to hold on and hope that you survive we have been robbed of our cognitive abilities our physical abilities we cannot work we cannot care for our families or our children or ourselves we are struggling to make it through each day abandoned by our healthcare teams we are the collateral damage of the pandemic as you can see i am recovering i can walk the touch of my little son's hand no longer feels like it's setting me on fire the sweet sound of my daughter's voice no longer feels like it's attacking my brain but i have a long way to go i still am unable to work or care for my children we had to refinance our home to hire a nanny before this i took one medication a thyroid pill every day and now i am on nine and that's just to turn down the dial just enough to make the symptoms bearable we all volunteered to receive the vaccine to try to help to end the pandemic but now we are suffering covet has impact all of it it covet has impacted all of us for some it has resulted in loss of life for others they are now long haulers debilitated and suffering there are long haulers who have got the vaccine and their condition improved there are long haulers who got the vaccine and they stayed the same and there are long haulers that got the vaccine and now they are worse and there are some who never had coveted and are now severely dil debilitated and sick this is us we are part of the full picture please do not erase us please do not make us invisible to the media we need your help to start the conversation to help us end the stigma surrounding the term covid vaccine reaction to the cdc and fda we desperately need you to communicate with the medical community what is happening to our elected officials we need help getting momentum for research for early intervention strategies so that when these patients do arrive in the ers and hospitals physicians will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to help us to the medical community and to research institutions please help us please hear us please believe us thank you so i hope you can see i hope you can hear i think it's pretty obvious why i felt so overwhelmed as i did the interviews this is what they were saying this is their story these are the these are their stories and that's why i reached out to senator johnson even as a spouse my wife wakes up and she's she looks normal she she is that you know she's a they're all fighters right and you know into so i have to fight myself you know the difference between major surgery and minor surgery minor surgery is when you're on the operating table major surgery is when i'm on the operating table right minor face numbness and tingling is when it's yours major is when it's mine and that's so hearing their stories you can see why i made the call to senator johnson thank you so much for for giving this group a voice and they speak for thousands so thank you for giving thousands of people a voice again can't thank ken thank you for reaching out again i want to thank the media for coming here and hearing the stories i'll just say i for one believe them i don't know how anybody can listen to these stories and at least not take them seriously i understand we all want this pandemic to be over we're all hoping that there was that silver bullet to end it and so i completely understand now that we have a vaccine and it has been effective in we have 300 million doses and most people receive it and they don't suffer symptoms why there's such a desire to just overlook to downplay what's happening to our fellow human beings that that small minority that are suffering severe symptoms we want to deny that reality but the first step in solving any problem i view this as a problem is admitting you have one and i think unfortunately because that desire to end this pandemic i think too many people in the medical establishment and in our federal health agencies are if not completely ignoring certainly downplaying what is happening so what i would like to do is quick put up three charts these are all supplied to you by the way this is what's gotten me attacked just showing what is publicly made publicly available information by the cdc this this is the cdc's early warning system on vaccines it's been up and operating for 31 years it's called the vaccine adverse event reporting system do we have this up yet go full screen so what the first chart shows you is just a bar chart showing the va what the vares has reported in covid deaths since the vaccine first can begin administered and as dr rish and dr ladapo pointed out there's there are these reactions that are clustering around the first few days of receiving the vaccine i think you heard that from the group here their symptoms started almost immediately but in terms of deaths on day zero the day you get the vaccine 609 19 people have died and it's been reported to the vayer system on the day after the the day one 764 on day two 353 people and then it tapers off now i presented this to dr collins the head of the nih a couple months ago i think this is when total vapor deaths were something like 3 [Music] 000. his reaction was more than disappointing it was just basically well you know center people die we've looked into these and except for back then i think there were six cases of of child bearing aged women dying from blood clots vascular that's the only thing that we've connected to these vaccines okay again none of us are medical doctors none of us are medical researchers we're not pretending to be but we can see the publicly available information we can look at the numbers we can take a look at this data and go this is concerning this ought to be taken seriously this ought to be looked at put up the next chart so here are the actual numbers and i've got two columns here the the first column is the there's reports for just covered 19. this is over the last six months basically the other column is the adverse effects for 31 years since the vader system was established on july first 1990 so you've got six months worth of data sitting right next to 31 years worth of data so total number of deaths under covet is 4812 for the 31 years before the covert vaccine all of the vaccines total deaths for thousand thirty nine were fast approaching 31 years worth of deaths with just the coven vaccine again talked about the deaths on day zero one and two seventeen hundred versus again thirty one years worth about nineteen hundred permanent disability is almost five thousand over thirty one years have been about twelve thousand total hospitalizations twenty one thousand four hundred and forty in six months versus thirty seven thousand six ninety four over thirty one years now there are many problems of theirs it is far from perfect it does not prove causation or necessarily even correlation but one of the problems with the vares is it dramatically generally under reports the adverse events there was a horror study said that the vague system only captures about one percent i would personally think because a covet everybody know you know more people are learning the various systems still the vast majority of people don't even know this exists but my guess is you probably have a higher percentage reporting of of covet adverse events than you have in the previous 30 31 years let's go to my next slide this chart shows adverse events in the first five rows again over that 31 year period for different drugs and we're just comparing adverse events for different drugs so again the first five lines ivermectin hydroxyl chlorine flu vaccines dexamethasone which is a steroid that's being used to treat covid and tylenol so you got three columns here the number of adverse events over 31 years in the first five rows then you have number of deaths and you have average deaths per years so you can see ivermectin let's just concentrate on death per year two fry vermectin 23 for hydrox chloroquine 38 for flu 150 for dexamethasone again you put something in somebody's body and people have adverse effects tylenol 730 on average per year that's one of the reasons i've said that you know you compare the safety record of ivermectin hydrox chloroquine to tylenol tylenol is probably the more dangerous drug then you take a look at rem desevere this is the drug that's been given emergency use authorization costs over three thousand dollars per dose per treatment we've got 4 699 adverse deaths no i mean adverse events related to uh rendezvous 1100 deaths 1200 deaths and i think the the the real number that you ought to concentrate on is again in just six months i mean rendezvous that's about a year and a half worth for covid vaccines it's six months 384 thousand adverse events 4812 deaths again i'm not a medical researcher i'm not a doctor but i'm an accountant i understand numbers just looking at the numbers this is something that would concern me and i do not understand why our health agencies have not paid attention to maddie and stephanie and christie and cheryl and candace and brie what's going on what's happening here so i was going to ask a couple questions but i think they've done such a good job presenting themselves i i don't have any further questions there are so many more stories to be told just in in the days that i announced this press event other than be attacked i've also been inundated with other stories everybody wanted me to put their story up on the screen we will put them up on our website once we validate them and verify them there will be a flood of new information i know in the press packet i think there's over a hundred links to other news stories there are there are journalists that are paying attention to this that are inquisitive that are doing investigations that are taking the stories of people in their local communities seriously and they're writing stories about it so we provide those links uh there will be a whole lot more because the courage of this group coming forward and subjecting themselves to the process possible ridicule possible vilification i hope that doesn't happen but uh with that i'm happy to throw it open to questions and we also offered once you have the general questions this group is being generous at the time they'll they'll sit and do one-on-one interviews as well if you want stories although i i think they did such a marvelous job of encapsulating in a short period of time what they've gone through and i i hope i hope there's some sympathy here and i hope people focus on the issue at hand and i hope at minimum they're taken seriously with that we'll throw it open to questions do we have a microphone for the okay so if you want to ask a question just grab the mic jason calvi with fox6 thanks for your time today i appreciate it very much uh critics say you're hurting chances of getting out of the pandemic they point out that 99 of the people that are dying now of covid19 are unvaccinated what's your response to that so again i am happy to answer your specific questions to me when we've you know gone through all the questions for for the group here so let's let's direct those questions out i'll come back i'll hold a full press conference you can ask me those types of questions afterwards right now i want to focus on on these individuals that have had the courage to come forward and tell their stories for maddie's mother um your two sons who took who got the vaccine did they have any difficulties and also what has been your contact with the vaccine maker and the study get it real close stephanie so um her one brother got the placebo he had obviously absolutely zero reaction actually told maddie that she was jokingly you know hey i don't know what you're talking about i'm fine my other son um he got one dose and he got coveted after like shortly after that so yeah so i had coveted not knowing it and um i had none of the typical symptoms mine were all gastro so i no clue that i had it i got tested only because we were out of town and that was what you at work in school so i got tested i was completely shocked so that was the day that they got their first vaccination so in the trial they did not vaccinate him for the second dose but they did continue to follow him he had coveted way worse than i did way worse he was sick he was out of school for almost a month we have been dealing directly because we trusted i would not have let my kids be in a trial if i didn't trust i trust science i trust i trusted the doctors we went to the hospital where the trial was at so that it would make it easier so that he had access they had access to everything we thought i trusted that if i knew there was a risk i trusted that if something happened she was going to take be taken care of and she was not so we have gone directly through the doctor and maybe that's bad on my part but it sounds like it doesn't matter if i would have contact advisor because nobody else is getting responses from them so i don't know if that answers your question going through this it's like especially and she looks way better now than she did before but you just don't have the energy to even do that i was fighting doctors trying to get them to listen to what was happening to her and not say she's crazy that's where all my time and energy was spent researching because nobody else was researching for her by the way i want to encourage anybody else wants to hop in and provide a response to a question to do so not just the individual that's been directed to if you've got something to say on the topic you're looking straight at me because i'm facing this way but um just to go along with what steph was saying i i'm disappointed in my experience with my test clinic and with my study sponsor initially we were they emphatically told us over and over we believe you please send us all of your medical records as this goes along and we were in constant dialogue and then when i was admitted uh and just before thanksgiving um i had to be unblinded and i'm not entirely sure what happened to my data after that um but the calls stopped and i think i heard from them one time after that even though we kept feeding them all of our records i honestly deep down in my core even though my life was falling apart and i had no idea what was going on i really really was hoping that there would have been some kind of pre-existing condition uh unearthed to explain this like sorry looking back on this it is so sad and i'm sure steph can agree we signed up for this i signed up for this and the reason i signed up for this is i didn't think this was going to happen obviously but if this were to happen to us we're supposed to take notice we take note we talk about it we try to figure it out so then when this happens to everybody else when it's rolled out to the public we can do something about it that we see it we can take action we can do early intervention whatever but instead what happened was we did not talk about it not one word so what happened to me has now happened to thousands the test clinic agreed to pay for my bills i have yet to see a single cent thank you your bills are told what i'm over 12 000 now and that's just for the medical part so i just want to add maddie was not unblinded and we purposely did that because i knew she got the vaccine um because if you aren't blinded your data is excluded so we did not look at pfizer's go see if you see all her symptoms on there it's functional abdominal pain still being investigated and they have not paid for any of our bills she has medicaid now on top she was approved for that on top of our insurance so our insurance has paid for it and medicaid are there any questions any other questions okay sir i asked the question to the senator but i'm wondering if what is your reaction when you hear those critics that say this is disinformation to shine a light on on your stories they say that most of the people have not had these negative side effects so what's your reaction to those because you're going to hear those critics and i want to hear from you on that if you could okay why don't you start yeah i'll start um yeah that's a great question i don't think anybody here but i'll speak for myself yeah i mean and i think the senator alluded to it right let's make the truth our friend let's make science and honesty our friend everyone here knows including you guys right that 99 or whatever that number is because we don't really know i hope that we want to know i think like senator said there's a lot of maybe fear and concern as you mentioned but i think we can do i think we do better when we're when we're being honest with ourselves and and we're being truthful in our society and so we know it's 99 or plus or minus are are doing great and that's why everybody's still very much pro-vaccine pro-science but what i think they're asking for what i hear them asking for what i would advocate for is that they be heard believe and then so that they can be taken care of i think bree mentioned collateral damage uh candace mentioned you know like in a sense like wounded warriors is it is that yeah i don't want to denigrate or diminish you know veterans that are out in the war but in a sense we've been kind of they've been we've been at battle against the pandemic and there's been damage seems like a and that's why i resized senator johnson seems reasonable reasonable to say let's help these people right i'll just add that we had the conversation this morning at breakfast and we asked would we have taken the vaccine if we knew that there would be neurological repercussions and i'm speaking for myself and i feel that this was what was said around the table we would have read the documentation but again there's no template that says that if you have a b or c this may be your um you may experience the adverse side effects so i for one would have still taken the vaccination because my job as an american citizen is to support us getting out of this pandemic i don't believe that we should be left to the side because this is still a trial which means that we're part of the trial and we should benefit from understanding what others coming behind us may or may not experience full disclosure of what the vaccination could cause thank you right over here thank you um ken you mentioned um let's take care of these people um is there some discussion among you all to file a lawsuit or take some kind of legal action to try to do this on a bigger scale you can't i'm just going to add to that really quick like i said in my speech there has not been any major discussion it may have been tossed about at some point in some private conversations but like i said none of us are up here for any agenda whatsoever except to get our story out i mean like i said i would give everything if i could just be the person that i was on january 17th even 8 a.m on january 18th before i took that vaccination if i could just go back to that one moment i've i have even told my friends you know it's it's their personal decision if they decide to accept the vaccination but for me knowing what i know now if i were to ever do it if there's one thing i'd ever go back in my life and change it would be that moment i think our common collective goal at this point is for the cdc and the fda to recognize the neurological reactions to the vaccine so that it can be studied it can be researched so that we know what's happening to our bodies and then the people who are still being vaccinated this these reactions will continue i think there's a lot of people out there suffering from different degrees from what we're experiencing so yeah i think to answer your question the motivation uh their motivation has been to be as you've heard to to get the word out and then to be studied so that we can find solutions for them and people from behind if there's been any uh mild conversations about lawsuits the motivation that i've heard and it's been hardly any but the motivation has been purely how can we get the word out these people are racking their brains trying to figure out you know it's like a rubik's cube like like a very high complex rubik's cube they want to be heard they want to be seen and they want to be believing it's like how can we do it that's what i hear it's not about money it's not of it's how they can help themselves and help others that are behind them does that answer your question thank you any other questions well if not again i'll reporters come up and and uh speak on an individual basis with the members of the group here and i will come back when that when you're done uh with those individual interviews i'll come back and i'll do a press conference to answer any questions you have of me directly okay thank you all yeah i'll come to you

343,dPwHmdWTupI,&#39;Yes! Yes! Yes!&#39; Susanna Reid Is *Very* Excited About a COVID Vaccine | Good Morning Britain,"On Monday, early results from the world's first effective coronavirus vaccine showed it could prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid. The vaccine - called an RNA vaccine - has been developed by pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and BioNTech and is one of 11 vaccines that are currently in the final stages of testing. The companies now plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November - and a limited number of people may get the vaccine this year. The UK has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate up to 20 million people as each person will need two doses for it to work effectively.

#GMB #PiersMorgan #SusannaReid",2020-11-10,98353,915,4,UCq18eeL7D9Vd8DhjMcLh9QQ, [Music] happy vaccine day yeah uh should we get a scrooge straight away and see what he can do to ruin it dr hillary screw dr hillary is the voice of reason of course let's just i was uh picking my daughter up in school yesterday elise and we were walking back about a mile long walk home and i got halfway but before i remembered to tell her the breaking news and i stopped her i said there's incredible news i said there's a vaccine and she went on a kind of war dance in the street she wasn't the only one and i thought i wonder all over the world how many people are reacting that way now obviously we know that it's not immediate we know there are still questions to be answered we're going to come to those in a moment but let's just start with the really good bit a vaccine appears to have been developed with a 90 percent efficacy rate now hillary that is good news it's terrific news it's absolutely wonderful it's the news that everyone's been waiting for the best christmas present that anybody could hope for really however it's not armistice day it's not all over and the worst thing that could happen is people start celebrating prematurely and carrying on as if we're not still in the middle of a second wave of a pandemic that would be a huge mistake and that would result in lots more hospitals so basically keep doing the things that we must do it's really hard for safe space washing your hands yeah wearing the mask yes i'll tell you why because this vaccine that is 90 effective in a relatively small trial of 44 000 people seems to be very well tolerated very minimal side effects 90 effective that's great news however it's very unstable as a vaccine it has to be stored at minus 70 to minus 80 degrees which itself creates logistical problems in getting it to the places where it will be given out as an immunization you would probably have because a novel vaccine you might have to wait for people to uh say 15 minutes or so in a surgery to make sure that they're okay before you let them go um you would probably have to because it comes in in um 500 vials at a time you would probably have to have say two gps working flat out all weekend to vaccinate 2 000 people we will need billions of doses to vaccinate the entire world it has to be given in two doses so that's going to take some considerable time and because of the storage at minus 70 to 80 it means that the countries that for example in africa where the temperature is much higher that creates a huge problem these aren't what we will need we will need other companies to produce other vaccines which are already being worked on don't need to be at miners to boost to which don't need that to boost the the the uh potential to give us explain in simple english hillary what it is that this vaccine the fires of vaccine what it is that it does right okay so so it's a vaccine which uses mrna which is messenger rna most people heard of dna that's the genetic material that produces that is a component of chromosomes in every human cell now mrna is a much smaller molecule and it gets what what happens with the vaccine is the mrna gets into the human cell where it gets it to produce proteins which are recognized by the immune system the immune system then kills the infected human cell so this works in a different way to vaccines which are a weaker form of the real thing or which produce antibodies it actually kills off the cells which are infected it's the first of its kind um so this in itself is exciting and it could lead to the development of similar vaccines not just for this disease but for other diseases as well so i think the scientists have created this in such a quick miraculous time really need a pass on them you know who it is it's a husband and wife team uh ooga sahin and his wife ozlem intelligence who created this company in germany uh bioentech and they're the ones who've worked with pfizer there there's this husband and wife team who go into work every day and just slave away on our behalf trying to find stuff like this including their wedding day when they got married they carried on doing their lab work they are totally dedicated to the cause it's absolutely fantastic news so john bell who is a member of sage the government scientific committee sits on the government's vaccine task force was talking to sarah montague on the world at one yesterday just after the news broke and you mentioned elise's reaction and how that might have been replicated around the world so here is sir john bell asking what appeared to be a very simple question and look at sarah montague's reaction do we now say with confidence that life should be returning to normal by spring yes yes yes probably the first guy to say that but i do i i will say that with some confidence and there we are yes yes yes the daily star i think got the front page of the day here yes yes yes because pfizer which is behind one of the companies behind the vaccine along with beyond tech uh also produces viagra said all right can we get the can we get the meg ryan clip guys from when harry met sally because that yeah oh live all right suzanna i'm very excited about the prospect of a vaccine dr hillary i know we have to be measured right now we haven't had the final results of the trial we haven't had the safety data we haven't have the approval from the authorities needs to be approved by the american authorities and also the medicines regulatory authority over here as well doesn't it before it is rolled out but my goodness in 2020 what we need more than anything else right now is hope and a light at the end of the tunnel no you and that's not right and it may encourage um what i'm hoping is that it may encourage people who might not be following the rules because they're like we're going to be doing lock down after lock down after lock down after lockdown you know what if we can just get through this second wave and stop as many people dying as we possibly can yeah if we can just do that it may be that by january february the vaccine's off and running and we never have to lock down again for this coronavirus and that would be an incredible thing so i just urge people who feel like they're at breaking point they feel like they can't do it anymore just think of the people we may be able to collectively save stop dying in the next two three months and let's all just do our best not a long time also they've drawn up a list dr hillary of who gets priority i i have to say i'm slightly disappointed that piers morgan will get a jab before me this is great so this is the age bracket so obviously you get the most elderly and most vulnerable in the care homes and at home and so on but i noticed that the over 55s are in fact two rungs ahead of susannah he's not even 50 yet um you know susanna you've always gone on to me about how age is a blessing and i've always said to you what a load of old nonsense yeah what do you bet uh finally i get what you mean yes age truly is a blessing yeah because i'm going to get the jab a long time before you um i thought the mail's a bit successful there'll be people queuing up together as well peers what was that there'll be people queuing up to give you the jab as well yeah yeah i thought the male i mean brave but you know one small jab for man don't think you can say that anymore sorry one small jab for people people people for people persons yeah i'm gonna have to revisit the man lanny on the moon won't we

345,MSjqi2Zw9JY,Covid vaccine: How does a vaccine get approved? - BBC News,"The NHS is carrying out the biggest mass vaccination campaign in its history with a jab that protects against Covid-19.

Some people have been surprised to learn how a process which usually takes at least ten years could have been done in less than one.

What safety checks have been made to get the Covid vaccine to this point?

BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains.

#davidpakmanshow #candaceowens #bobsaget",2022-01-13,192927,6419,3034,UCvixJtaXuNdMPUGdOPcY8Ag," Speaker 1: When comedian and actor Bob Saget
died and there was not immediately a cause of death announced, I told you guys there
are people who are going to say he died from the vaccine, from the COVID vaccine. There's no evidence of that. There's no reason to think that that's what
happened, but people are going to say that and of course, I was right and I'm not patting
myself on the back. It was obvious that people were going to say
that because any time there's an unexplained death now football player dies must have been
the COVID vaccine. Bob Saget dies, must have been the COVID vaccine. A prominent right winger, Candace Owens, is
now pushing exactly that conspiracy. Now there is no evidence for it. But she doesn't care. Let's take a look at what she had to say. Speaker 5: So am I a conspiracy theorist or
am I Nostradamus? The answer is neither. I'm just not on Big Pharma's payroll. Speaker 1: Now, remember a lot of the people
claiming that their position on vaccines is because they are not on Big Pharma's payroll
are the very same people promoting the Regeneron monoclonal antibody treatment, which is dramatically
more profitable than the vaccines. Just just remember that
Speaker 5: it's a pebble in their lives. And so to that end, today I'm going to point
out another truth, and it will likely be deemed a conspiracy theory until it's not. There are too many healthy individuals like
Bob Saget, who we know have received their vaccinations, who are dropping dead suddenly
and unexpectedly with no further explanation. Speaker 1: Now you have to remember a number
of different things. No further explanation. No immediate, known cause of death. Could it have been a stroke, heart attack,
et cetera? At some point, if the information is released
by the family, we will know. But understand that there is a fundamental
mathematical problem here. The closer you get to full vaccination in
a country, the more likely it is that everybody who dies will have been vaccinated in a 100
percent vaccinated country. Everybody who dies of a heart attack will
have been vaccinated. Whoa. Did the vaccines cause heart attacks? Because everybody who's dying from a heart
attack was vaccinated? Everybody who dies from stroke will have been
vaccinated. Wow. You're telling me every stroke death was in
vaccinated people in the United States, now we are in the low 60s vaccination. That means anybody who dies from anything. There is a two thirds chance that they were
vaccinated. Causation correlation. Candace Owens doesn't care, and this is very
irresponsible. Speaker 5: Healthy athletes, young students
in their physical prime. The majority of the males dropping suddenly
and unexpectedly in the middle of games from heart issues. What we know for a fact is that these people
are being mandated to take the vaccine, and we know for a fact that these vaccines come
with a warning that they bring about myocarditis. Speaker 1: Now remember, the risk of myocarditis
from COVID is higher, but they now have. This is really a situation of when all you
have is a hammer. Everything looks like a nail. I remember when I was a kid, the Celtics player,
Reggie Lewis, died and he was, I mean, let's say he was born in 65, died in 93. So he was 28 years old and there were no COVID
vaccines at the time. That is a death where if it happened today,
people like Candace Owens would be saying it's got to be related to that vaccine. And the truth is this happens and this happens
sadly more frequently than people want to believe. I mentioned on the bonus show on Monday that
my, my, my cousin, my second cousin, my mom's cousin Fabian Berlinski, pretty well-known
Argentinean film director. He died at age 47, was healthy as far as we
would normally say, a little bit overweight when he from a heart attack, when he was in
Brazil. And you can look that up on Wikipedia. And it was it was tragic and devastating and
sad. But these things do happen. And again, when all you have is a hammer which
is wanting to criticize vaccination, every death starts to look like a nail that you
can hammer in. There were no COVID vaccines for a long time,
and these things happen sadly all the time. There's almost eight billion people on the
planet. As more and more people get vaccinated, more
and more of the people to whom everything happens will be vaccinated. Traffic accidents mostly will take the lives
of vaccinated people, et cetera, et cetera. What Candace Owens is doing 
is  extraordinarily dangerous."
347,LJCHUXWEIYo,How do I know the Covid vaccine is safe? - BBC News,"The UK will begin its mass vaccination programme next week after the Pfizer/BioNTech jab was approved. Other countries are expected to follow.

So how do we know that the vaccine is safe? 

Prof Martin Hibbert, a professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, explains. 

Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog",2020-12-05,137429,1153,2080,UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA, much has been spoken about regarding the safety of the vaccine roll out here in the uk particularly on social media what would you like to say to our viewers firstly about the concerns that they may have regarding this process so this uh vaccine has been rolled out across more than 20 000 people and it's been through the regulatory uh process based on those 20 000 people and that included groups which are older so it was 65 to 85 it's included people with black and other ethnic minority groups and it's giving back the data looks just like any other vaccine that we've been through so with these kind of numbers and these type of analysis it looks safe and that's why it's been regulated it takes years in a situation of this kind to get a vaccine in a normal situation i should say to be approved this is taken a matter of months is speed an issue here so i think the actual time of the vaccination process has probably been pretty similar what's being compressed is the regulatory um delays so normally you'd have to go through various stages and you're in the queue of people that might be interested and this in this case we've given high priority and it's gone through much more quickly as a result of that that priority there not because there's anything being missed out is there the possibility of adverse effects side effects being recognized in the coming months so it's uh the approval is now goes into the next stage we haven't seen it in the first 20 000 but that doesn't say that there aren't some minor effects that might occur in some people and some groups so there will be constant monitoring over you know for the lifetime of well during the next year at least so uh i think we we should be aware of that but clearly these are going to be relatively minor there is a lot again about younger people who can typically become asymptomatic from covid19 with that in mind is it safer for them to get the virus rather than the vaccine itself so of course um you know there is less symptoms in the younger people but actually it's not they're not without symptoms and some of these people may go on to get more severe inflammatory process or even potentially long covered or other things so i personally i think it's much better to get the vaccine and of course we don't know yet how long your immunity lasts and uh it could be that the vaccine lasts longer than a natural infection yeah how much do we know about the immunity because we don't know how long but do we know how short so obviously these vaccines are new and we haven't really had the time to explore how long they're going to last it probably will mimic a natural infection so we're talking months to years

Patrick Bet-David is the founder and CEO of Valuetainment Media. He is the author of the #1 Wall Street Journal Bestseller Your Next Five Moves",2024-01-03,657570,12429,2552,UCIHdDJ0tjn_3j-FS7s_X1kQ, Rob did you see the Seth McFarland debate with Bill Maher on the vaccine did you see that what you think about I I I loved it because well two things a I got to see like I I I I've I've been around Seth M McFarland at at a nightclub drinking Jack Daniels really really really cool guy really really generous but to see that you know they're both obviously liberals for him to to have that point of view and for them to actually Pat have the conversation and it not become no no you're wrong you're wrong and then the conversation stopped at least I got to how long how long is the longest one Rob can you see what do you have right there 641 what's the one above it they're all 641 except for this 30 second clip play the 32nd one see what it is let's see what the 32nd one is uh go ahead play this clip here and but tell me what we disagree on when you do real time and we'll try to make that that the topic because I'd love to uh as I I think I mean look I I think we disagree on the fact that I think that the public health infrastructure despite being being absolutely inadequate prior to co did as good a job as they could have done no during Co and it pisses me the [ __ ] off when I see people [ __ ] on them when I see I see it must because you like like steered it all the way back to that again like but tell me what that is pretty wild to say that they did a good job during Co even though it was inadequate pre-co do you think he's getting P does he have to say that you think or he genuinely in his heart feels that cuz this is said McFarland guy is this is a professional actor he's in that Community he is he's in that space what do you think Tom you look you had to look like I not not I'm not say why don't you do this but Rob why don't you go play the six minute clip but just don't play the whole six minutes and just play the first like minut go and play this clip and maybe fast forward a little bit go ahead but then why are doctors wrong about so much about a lot too and yes and but very often people who aren't doctors have been writer about things um like like like what would be an example of that I would think uh this country did not allow for um uh natural immunity to be considered and I know this is a subject dear to your heart even if you had the disease you still had to get a vaccine that's powerful stupid they don't do that in Europe I think they do that here there's mandatory vaccination in grade in school right but if you already but if you already had the disease you have natural immunity we didn't see didn't to believe in that that was debunked though I mean that was that don't you know people who' had Co four or five times I do that's not natural immunity there's no immunity there you've had Co five times watch what he says probably because you had too many vaccines I didn't have Co did you did the vaccine gave you co uh well that's certainly there nothing unscientific about the fact that the vaccine which does weaken you in order to strengthen you says do all vaccines exactly yeah but while you're in a weakened State yes that's why why so many people like me got it did not have it I I thought it was a great exchange but but the point is here's a point okay Vinnie two years ago that conversation is not being had absolutely I'm telling you right now two three years ago that conversation is not that would have been Tak taken down off the internet right but but the fact that this conversation is being had gradually we are being forced to go this way you know why here's how this works think about the longest time you held a grudge with somebody how long was it okay I don't we're not give a names might still be going okay but but think think about the longest and by the way let me kind of bring you close I'm talking family I'm talking blood I'm not talking like a friend a friend okay I'm talk maybe even best friend what is the longest grudge you ever had like years give me a timeline 10 years go honestly Rob two years and it was my best friend from seventh grade up until three or four years ago where we started arguing about the covid vaccine I didn't take it my my employer mandated it I said no I lost my job employ Tim and maor take no not this employ freaking let me talk to these guys my previous employer I worked in radio they they mandated it I said no my best friend worked for Live Nation at the time he took it we had several arguments I tried to explain to him why I didn't think it was necessary for me to take it we didn't talk for two and a half years until he finally came back and said hey I'm sorry about that you were right and I was wrong best friend can he said that to you yes again best friend for 20 years holy [ __ ] you guys better now yeah best friends shout out to your best friend for acknowledging that he should have been better the longest you've gone with a grudge family or a best friend not friend couple okay what's yours Tom it's probably family about five years uh Vinnie Vinnie still holding on but when it comes to friends and stuff and this past 20123 I called the two people that I was not even talking to and I initiated that hey whatever it was I'm sorry I forgot about it one never got back to me the other one just two days ago hit me now let's categorize grudges okay let's categorize grudges one Grudge is what hardcore betrayal that's permanent forever set that aside right let's set that aside we're not we're not going to talk about well why don't you go and apologize to them no bro that's betrayal okay that is gone all right let's put the other Grudge as what you're offended cool all right let's put that over here let's put the one in Middle disrespected and did something that was a real stupid thing that one or the other person did and they apologize right how long can we go with a grudge two years two and a half years three I don't know it ain't 50 years okay so what's the point here dude America's so sick and tired of holding grudges against the other side they want to sit down and say dude I don't hate you as much as you think I do yeah you and I had different things with vaccine why do we let the mainstream media make me think you're a horrible person why do we think the mainstream media make me think that you're an idiot for not taking a vaccine you know what bro I effed up yeah effed up too all right cool you want to have a drink here let's smoke a joint and that's what bill marah is doing here right I don't know if America can go for too long holding a grudge I don't think it's a natural thing that we have in our bodies some of us again what's betrayal you can't like you know a snake uh I saw something the other day a snake betrays you and then they shed and then they may look a little bit better but they're still a snake they're still going to betray you if you keep you know forgiving a snake in your life you're the [ __ ] okay that guy's DNA is to betray you consistently over and over and over again but for everybody else you know in this community that guy's a Democrat so guess where Seth lives in he lives in Hollywood what does Hollywood look like a Hollywood is him they're invited to the same parties they're on the Tablo they're on all the magazines they're being talked about you're in that space the managers the ca the WME the all that stuff he is in that Community what do you expect him what do you think the people around him believe the same exact thing he believes in what is Bill [ __ ] he's sitting there debating conversations challenging all this other stuff the fact that we're having these conversations as crazy as this sounds we are getting closer to each other this doesn't mean we're going to be 100% over it it just means we're making progress this is a very good sign when you see these two guys talking to one another I know I agree but but when it comes to the like the powers that be though the one that he's talking about that's the the science the fouches the president saying it's a winter of death it's a war and unvaccinated that's a grudge p i don't give up not your friend though remember I said family or friend that's not a friend that is a divider I have a list of people whom I watched how well they divide oh my God I got a list of I can you know in who who's one of the top ones I'm talking in my personal life business there's a few guys and I I studied their playbook I'm like wow you are so good and I called them out one time and I said to his face I said hey you know this is what you do you know that right you do I watch you to divide people said you do and it's like you know no no you think no man I've seen you do it to this guy to that guy to this guy to that guy to You're So Proud with you you're so good at what you do so with that guy that's not a friend that's not a grudge that's a dark human being that I'm not trying to be friend I'm talking about somebody you love care friend family care about that now you're saying I hate you how the hell did we get here what happened did you truly betray me maybe you did okay then you're in this category don't worry about it we don't need a friendship ever again in America yesterday the the T and Dylan are saying so Dad what do you think about our country being called ESS I said what he said yeah America's essay I said what the hell is that essay what so I'm like okay here we go another FNAF book you read Five Nights at Freddy's that I have to sit here and learn about another character say no we're we're we're essay what the hell that I'm like what the guys up says no we're the States of America we're no longer United oh wow that might have been me Pat might have said that yeah t and Dylan they're like we're no longer USA we're the ESS we're the States of America wherever they picked it up maybe they bad influence me but but it's not bad influence it was it was true freaking he's already dividing America I'm holding a grudge right now I'm telling you publicly me and Vinnie have a grudge officially so

356,U9IZfFHQ7oY,"Woman, 90, first to receive Covid vaccine in UK rollout - BBC News","A 90-year-old woman has become the first person to be given a Covid jab as part of the mass vaccination programme being rolled out across the UK.

Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week, said it was the ""best early birthday present"".

She was given the injection at 06:31 GMT - the first of 800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine that will be given in the coming weeks.

Up to four million more are expected by the end of the month.

Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog",2020-12-08,159151,1962,2196,UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA, 90 year old margaret keenan well she'll go down in history she's become the first person in the world to receive the pfizer vaccine against covid19 outside trial conditions these pictures are coming into us live now i beg your pardon we're coming in to us now this is actually about uh 25 30 minutes ago as uh she took that first injection she's at the university hospital in coventry that's in the english midlands the british prime minister boris johnson's called this a huge step forward in the fight against covid19 it has led to the death of more than 60 000 people across the uk and the majority of those are the elderly which is why the priority is very much focused on uh those elder citizens in the united kingdom uh yeah quite a moment a round of applause margaret takes the jab and that is the first of two of course she will have to have a second vaccination in three weeks time our health correspondent catherine burns has the uk perspective she is outside university hospital in coventry the government's calling it v day and it is the biggest vaccine rollout in our history so here in coventry is one of 70 hospitals across the uk that are going to start injecting the first patients today now we've ordered about 40 million doses of this we don't have that yet though right now we're looking at about 800 000 and that's going to go up to about 4 million before christmas so not everyone that needs this injection is going to get it immediately they're going to start off in the hospitals for example with inpatients who are already in hospital and about to go home or people who are coming in for tests they'll also invite some care home staff in and maybe some other vulnerable over 80s and then if there's any leftover over at the end of each day they will give those to the most vulnerable frontline nhs staff the ones who would be at the most risk of getting sick if they got this yeah there we are well uh our reporter paul hawkins is with me now i mean this is an initial 800 000 batch isn't it it's the first batch so the elderly get it yeah 800 000 uh it initially goes to the elderly it goes to those with underlying health conditions and then it's gradually rolled out across the uk 40 million doses in total the uk government has ordered so when you do the math that's 20 million people roughly around a third of the uk population um as you as you mentioned everyone who gets this vaccine they get two doses three weeks apart the immunity begins after you've had the first dose and then it builds to maximum immunity seven days after the second jab so so that's kind of how it works side effects they're mild 95 percent effective it's not yet long known how long the immunity lasts that's quite key and we don't know whether it stops people from actually passing on the virus yeah because this is the first time in the world it's been rolled out yeah it's interesting seeing it actually happening after all this time as well isn't it um i suppose we've got to look at the the scale in which this can be opened up quickly because as a vaccine pool it's held at very low temperatures they have to administer it in hospitals rather than a doctor taking it off in his bag and carrying it around the town sort of thing yeah minus 70 so at the moment it's arrived in refrigerated uh well huge refrigerators effectively big containers shipped into the hospitals that's where it's going to be started 70 hospital hubs across the country and then as as they try to work out the logistics of transporting that virus at a really low temperature it'll get rolled out in gp surgeries in care homes we're talking about 30 000 people being recruited by the nhs uh over over the coming months sports stadiums conference centers as well being used as vaccination hubs so at the moment they're going to for targeting the over 50s and then well into next year we'll start seeing phase two which is under 50s paul that's really helpful thank you very much for that um i'm joined now by professor philip clark who is director of the health economics research center at the university of oxford and his teams have been working on a framework really on how to allocate the vaccine itself as i say joins me from oxford now philip thanks very much indeed for your time um we've just seen margaret keenan the very first uh to receive the vaccine um and not surprisingly it's targeted initially at the uh at the oldest and the ones we see is the most vulnerable yes yes uh david the idea i think of the vaccination strategy in the uk is to keep it simple and basically start off with age with the oldest because people's risk of getting covered and also perhaps dying of covert doubles about every five years so if you start with someone like margaret who's in the 90s you're likely to reduce the mortality from this disease in in the most rapid way yeah and it's an overwhelming increase isn't it as the as the years go by if you like nonetheless it might not be the only approach and i think would you perhaps see the idea of vaccinating all the maybe the health service staff as a more appropriate first step well different countries are trying different strategies certainly in the uk uh healthcare workers are getting a high priority they're in the next group and as well as social care workers that makes a lot of sense both to protect them but also potentially to protect patients if if it's able to reduce transmission i suppose the question is uh what potentially what are other countries doing there is a variety of strategies here so for example uh russia uh has started vaccinating with its sputnik vaccine and it's uh vaccinating healthcare workers and teachers so i do think perhaps there needs to be a discussion in all countries about where these occupations that have a lot of contact with the public will fit in alongside healthcare workers yeah i mean obviously it's voluntary and margaret was very ready to be vaccinated there um but we did hear earlier uh phillip from los angeles from a healthcare expert saying that actually more than half of healthcare workers there still feel uncomfortable about this vaccine and that's an issue of the speed again with which it's been processed well there's certainly been rigorous testing both of all of the vaccines in terms of both its efficacy and safety and of course it's now being approved by regulators i suppose also though these have been developed at speed but there is of course enormous benefit i mean to the individual but to the entire society from uh getting vaccinations rates up because it's the one sure way to actually bring about a you know reduction in covert cases and and going back to a sort of normal world that we were in this time last year and hopefully we'll return to by this time next year well you make a very good point don't you just watching one lady being vaccinated is a it's a symbol really of what an extraordinarily challenging nine months at least maybe a full year we've been through i mean this is a big day isn't it absolutely and i think it is a vaccination is something where by taking a vaccine one is benefiting everybody in the society so migrant by taking the bet her vaccine is actually benefiting me because uh with an infectious disease it reduces my chance of getting a vaccine so it is something i think as a society we need to make decisions about but and and it is the one way we can actually defeat this virus yeah

359,BxNpCIMd-PY,Austria&#39;s COVID-vaccine mandate: Can it be enforced? | DW News,"Austria has become the first European country to mandate coronavirus vaccination for all adults. It is also the first country that will now have to enforce a vaccination mandate.  Starting next month, Austrian police will carry out random spot-checks to see whether people can produce proof of vaccination. Those who can't face fines of 600 euros or more.
Vienna set up mobile vaccination buses to increase that number. The willingness to get a jab is stagnant, despite the new bill. 
Even before the controversial bill was passed, security was tight at vaccination centers. 
No other topic polarizes Austrians as much as mandatory vaccination. Those who administer the vaccines can do so only when security is nearby. There is concern about hostile outbursts by anti-vaxxers. 
Tens of thousands of them have been taking to the streets almost every weekend across the country to protest against COVID measures. They are a minority. 
But Werner Reisinger, who is researching radicalism, says, the protests should not be underestimated.
He says the Austrian government failed to reach this crowd, especially when its declaration last summer that the COVID crisis was over was followed by a political crisis of its own.
Austria expects an avalanche of lawsuits by those unwilling to pay possible fines starting at 600 euros and to be enforced from mid-March. 
Vienna is focusing on those whose opinion could still be swayed: The undecided. The city put up billboards in various foreign languages in their latest effort to counter misinformation.

#Austria #Pandemic #VaccineMandate",2022-02-05,113427,1267,1410,UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg, austria has become the first european country to mandate coronavirus vaccinations for all adults it is also the first country that will now have to enforce a vaccination mandate starting next month austrian police will carry out random spot checks to see whether people can produce proof of vaccination those who cannot face fines of 600 euros or more this patient is here for his third shot against covey but taking a jab is no longer a question of choice starting today it's compulsory in austria sad that it needs a mandatory vaccination because normally everyone should be wise enough to get the job automatically but only a few came for their first shot the city set up mobile vaccination buses to increase that number the willingness to get a job is stagnant despite the new bill igbo i'm against mandatory vaccinations because i believe this is a violation of human rights everyone has the right to freedom even before the controversial bill was passed security was tied at vaccination centers no other topic polarizes austrians as much as mandatory vaccinations those who administer the doses inside can only do so with security nearby there is concern about hostile outbursts by anti-vaxxers tens of thousands of them have been taken to the streets almost every weekend across the country to protest against coveted measures they are a minority but venerizing who is researching radicalism says the protest should not be underestimated which cannot be allocated to the organized right-wing crowd or to the hooligan milieu these are people from within the middle class which has radicalized since the past two years not only since the mandatory vaccination and this is very precarious he says the austrian government failed to reach this crowd especially when its declaration last summer that the covet crisis was over was followed by a political crisis of its own when he created if you make mistakes with regard to the management of the pandemic mistakes of communication and have a government crisis triggered by corruption then you face two crises politically austria expects an avalanche of lawsuits by those unwilling to pay possible fines starting at 600 euros and to be enforced from mid-march vienna is focusing on those whose opinion could still be swayed the undecided the city put up billboards in various foreign languages in their latest effort to counter misinformation my next guest tonight is arthur kaplan he's a professor of bioethics at new york university's grossman school of medicine he's the author of many books including vaccine ethics and policy mr kaplan it's good to see you again i'm glad you had the time to talk with us tonight let me start by asking you about what we're seeing here in europe we've got a lot of countries in northern europe who are getting rid of all of their coveted restrictions and then we've got austria that has introduced a vaccine mandate what do you make of this well i think europe the u.s north america are very very tired of covered they're tired of trying to battle it they're tired of promises that things are going to be over soon when they're not by the way not just due to government problems but because the virus has changed i still favor mandates i still believe that the right thing to do is to protect your neighbor to not clog the hospitals with uh the sick and the dying from uh people who are not vaccinated and i still think vaccination is a key tool however it's going to be very tough to collect those fines in a weird way ethically if the austrian public doesn't support looking out for one another and puts individual self-interest ahead of their neighbors i don't know that the policy is going to work let me take us a little bit from public health to public happiness here in the united states we've got a new gallup poll out that shows americans continue to struggle to find the positives in life and society back in 2020 i think 84 percent said that they were satisfied with life overall for the second year in a row now that number is around 67 percent is the pandemic to blame partly it is you remember right the pandemic ruined donald trump it basically cost him the election all the other issues decide the lockdowns the damage to the economy the fights are going back to school those are real quality of life impairments biden has not solved the pandemic either there have been mixed messages bad messaging that leads people to be upset the economy is suffering in the u.s from inflation that leads people to uh be upset i think another major issue is we are still struggling in american society with battles over race they deeply divide the country it's harsh to say it but whether it's attitudes about the police or attitudes appropriate punishment or who's going to get into university we have opened up some wounds in the society and they too are taking a toll on the popularity of this president and satisfaction with the quality of life social media it has fragmented society it's become a direct delivery channel for misinformation and we know that this polarizes society even more do you think americans are aware of this and are they aware that this may be one reason why they feel so bad about everything around them well you know there's not a lot of joy on social media it's full of griping complaining pointing yelling at your neighbor outbursts if you spend a lot of time there and many americans do particularly those who've been shut in for various reasons it doesn't boost your morale very much they haven't figured out what to do about social media we don't know who's supposed to edit it we don't know who's who is supposed to control it we don't know how to get the uh hate and the craziness out of it you know i think the dream was it would be a wonderful outlet to exchange information quickly it's turned into a cesspool that in many ways is driving down the quality of life not only for americans but people around the world you know you say there is a lot of hate out there and yet the only category in this poll where americans say that they see an improvement is in the acceptance of gays and lesbians why do you think that is well interesting enough that phenomena shifted before covet it uh was a movement that if you will was grassroots particularly younger people saying we just don't care older religious leaders may have issues there may have been entrenched policies about gays and gay behavior but the younger generation i think just said it's not relevant to us we're not paying attention to old dislikes to old biases to old prejudices i'm hoping actually that they can also lead us forward in matters of race i think uh you know it's tough to convert the older generation out of divisive attitudes but the young may be able to take us where we ought to go in terms of similar acceptance of differences professor arthur kaplan as always mr kaplan we appreciate your time and your valuable insights it's always good to end on something to feel good about thank you thank you

#GMB #PiersMorgan #SusannaReid",2020-12-08,433363,2570,21,UCq18eeL7D9Vd8DhjMcLh9QQ, it is a very good day matt hancock and you have every reason to smile i mean margaret keenan is a is a pioneer isn't she it's just wonderful isn't it watching that watching the the images of of margaret and and then i've seen a few others uh william shakespeare the second person uh and um and i i i it looks like such a small thing just having that jab in the arm but it means so much because this is the route out of this pandemic and by god we need one and i think margaret was absolutely brilliant and displayed you know everything stoicism everything that we should be uh should be proud of we haven't had we haven't had much to shout about this year to put it mildly um in the way we've handled this but to have the first jabs actually happening in the uk is quite something i'm so proud of the team who've made this happen i'm i'm so proud of them they've worked so hard and not just hard but really smart you know firstly the team who spotted that this was a really promising vaccine and we bought it early we were the first country to put in an order and then the regulator you know normally regulators get flack but the mhra have done a fantastic job because they've done all of the safety checks that they always do but they've done them all at the same time instead of one after the other which has meant that we've been the first country in the world you know and and after this year which has been so terrible for so many people and the sacrifices people have made and the losses that that we've all suffered to to to have this moment showing the way out is just absolutely fantastic it is um an international collaborative effort though isn't it because this is a u.s pharmacy uh pharmaceutical company uh the scientists behind it were turkish immigrants to germany it's manufactured in belgium and then our regulator is the first to approve it it is properly a multinational approach yes i i'm i mean i'm i'm really proud of the science you know i've always believed that we would get to this moment i i i it may have felt a long way off at times and uncertain but i've always believed that the science would come through and as you say it's global science essentially and working across borders and we've we've made it happen you know it's down to human ingenuity and i hope that it can restore some some belief that we can we can beat these things that are thrown at us yes it's difficult and there it's been a you know huge huge series of challenges and there's challenges still to come to vaccinate the all those who are vulnerable to covid so it's a it's a mammoth effort now for the nhs can i ask you about that the the challenges of of vaccinating everybody because you've made it very clear repeatedly that top of your priority list are care home residents but this vaccine needs to be stored at such low temperatures that it would be impossible for care home residents to travel to the hubs to be vaccinated is it the case that actually they have slipped down the priority list because it is hard to connect them with the vaccine or have you got gps going into care homes as a priority yes so we have absolutely top priority is care home residents and their carers of course their carers can travel and so we'll be vaccinated from today in the 70 odd hospital hubs that we have right across the uk but care home residents generally can't travel very easily or safely and so we've got to get the vaccine to them and that will take another couple of weeks to make sure that we can do that safely because of these minor 70 requirements and because of the specifics of the vaccine have only been known the full results of those trials have only been known for a couple of weeks so having approved the vaccine for use in hospitals and in principle the the the nhs are working with the regulator to ensure that we have a safe way of getting the vaccine out into the community through gps and pharmacists and in into care homes i just want to play a couple more weeks i want to play a little clip from william shakespeare who's just said his first words let's take a listen to this it could make the difference to our lives from now on [Music] and i guess i guess it's been tough for you being at home and being locked down yeah well we've been virtually locked down my wife has managed to get out occasionally i mean just simple words there reacting it you're quite emotional about that well it's just it's been you know it's been such a tough year for so many people and there's william shakespeare putting it so simply for everybody that you know we can get on with our lives and and you know there's still a few months ago i've still got this worry that we can't blow it now piers we've still got to get the vaccine to millions of people and so we've got to keep sticking by the rules but it's just you know there's so much work gone into this and i'm really really it makes you proud to be british it does and how odd that he's called william shakespeare or perhaps that wasn't a coincidence but he's got to be related isn't he's from warwickshire i mean there must he must be um let me just ask who gets called forward that's definitely one for the nhs but they've done a great job this morning and i'm sure there's a lot of people actually we've had a lot of viewers who've been feeling very emotional watching this because it is it's not just the light at the end of the tunnel it's us beginning to come out of the tunnel which is the crucial thing um one one potential issue here spanner in the world maybe of course brexit and if we were to crash out with no deal it might undo a lot of the good work that we've built up with this uh you know there are reports that if we do have no deal then medical supply lines may get affected in the worst case scenario and so on what kind of reassurances have you secured as health secretary that things like medical supply lines will not be adversely affected should we leave with no deal we're ready for any scenario in those in the talks uh i have five different contingencies for getting this vaccine into this country and um they're there for all eventualities for you know it's the it's december so eventualities of difficult weather uh and any problems that might arise so we've got we've got five contingencies we're currently on plan a and that's going smoothly and i hope it continues to but if on january the first we don't have a deal can you guarantee that this vaccine which is manufactured in belgium will not be held up either because there's a massive queue at the border uh or that there is enormous paperwork and red tape to fill in that's why we've got five different uh contingencies uh any way this vaccine goes uh goes through priority for obvious reasons uh but even if the priority channels didn't work then we can put it on different routes and ultimately we have the backup plan of bringing it in through the military so we we have five different routes uh because obviously i want to make sure this precious precious product can be brought in under any circumstances so we have a plan for all of that how confident are you we're going to get a deal because let's be brutally honest with everybody here nobody i think when they voted to leave imagined that we would do so from all the rhetoric they'd heard without a trading arrangement with the eu that wasn't why people voted to leave they assumed we would have one how confident you were going to get one well of course we already have the withdrawal agreement on which we left the eu that's not a trade agreement though is it that's not a trade deal that's right so we have we have the withdrawal agreement on which we left the eu and the prime minister is doing everything he can to secure a future trading arrangement as well that's why he's prepared to go to brussels he's he's training every sinew to to to get that deal but we're prepared for any eventuality and obviously a deal has to respect the fact that we've left the eu and are a sovereign nation uh and um uh you know so we all would it would be better for the uk it would be better for the eu if we secured a deal uh and uh but we're ready for any eventually okay final question the uh the nurse who administered the first vaccine jab may parsons is a filipino one of the nearly 20 000 filipinos who work in the nhs and gave a very moving response about how much it meant to her to be a part of history how much it would mean to everyone back in the philippines to be part of global history what would you like to say to to her and to all the immigrant staff in the nhs well i want to say thank you i i'm so proud of may and the role that she's played i i met uh last night some of the nurses who are going to be uh who are today this morning administering the vaccine i'm so proud of everybody who works in the nhs the nhs is a is a global employer people come from all the way around the world to work in the nhs not just the philippines but uh elsewhere to and and i'm really proud of the team that we've got and they do an amazing job and their vocation is all about helping people and caring for people and and protecting people which is exactly what may is is doing for margaret right there on the screen at this moment i'm really proud of the uh the whole nhs team okay well we've beaten you up for most of the year health secretary today is one of those days when we say good job good job to get this vaccine rolling out in this country so congratulations to you and the team on getting us to this stage now the pressure's on to get it out to millions and we wish you every success in doing that because if you're successful then it will save lives and we'll all benefit you
365,mz5ukxWpWSQ,The EU-UK Covid vaccine row explained: What now? - BBC Newsnight,"The UK and the European Union have said they are working together to improve their relationship, after weeks of tensions over Covid vaccine supplies. Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog

In a joint statement, they said they wanted to ""create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all"".

The European Commission earlier proposed tougher export controls on vaccines, amid tensions over supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that ""blockades"" were not ""sensible"".

The joint UK-EU statement said that ""openness and global co-operation"" would be key to tackling the pandemic.

""We are all facing the same pandemic and the third wave makes co-operation between the EU and UK even more important,"" it said. ""We will continue our discussions.""

But there was little harmony earlier on Wednesday when the Commission announced plans for all vaccine shipments to be assessed on the destination country's rate of vaccinations and exports. The proposals, which will be put before EU leaders on Thursday, are seen as focused on the UK and US in particular.

Newsnight’s Political Editor Nick Watt reports.

STORYLINE:
India gifted two million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine to neighbouring Bangladesh on Thursday. 
Doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford University vaccine, manufactured under licence by the Serum Institute of India, were taken from the airport to a government storage facility in Dhaka.
India, the world's largest vaccine producer, began supplying coronavirus vaccine to its neighbours this week as it attempts to strike a balance between maintaining enough doses to inoculate its own people and helping developing countries without the capacity to produce their own vaccine.  
India's foreign ministry said it sent one million doses to Nepal, 150-thousand doses to Bhutan and 100-thousand doses to the Maldives, and would send more to Myanmar and the Seychelles in coming weeks.
Bangladeshi Health Minister previously announced that the vaccination of health and frontline workers will begin on February 8.

367,i2wnAW0JMxo,Trying to get a Covid vaccine with needle phobia - BBC News,"Adam wants to get his Covid vaccine - but an extreme fear of needles is holding him back.

The 23-year-old says it's not the pain he's afraid of, but the thought of the injection itself - and the needle piercing his skin.

""It feels like you have no way out, you can't do anything, your heart rate's pushing 200, you can't focus on anything… it’s about a pathological fear of needles.""

A recent Oxford University survey of more than 15,000 adults in the UK suggests needle phobia accounts for about 10% of Covid vaccine hesitancy.

The survey also suggests reluctance to get the Covid jab is generally a bit higher in younger people and some ethnic minority groups.

through a US embassy or consulate abroad.   Part of that process involves a medical exam. K1 
visa applicants, unlike individuals who are going   through the spouse visa process to receive a green 
card, after the US embassy or consulate interview,   K1 visa applicants don't actually have to get 
the vaccines at that interview with that medical   exam abroad. The USCIS policy manual, the 
Department of State makes it very clear   K1 visa applicants do not have to get their 
vaccinations before they enter the United States.   They do highly encourage and we do as well 
encourage our clients to go ahead and get   the vaccinations abroad just to expedite the 
process, keep things moving and also oftentimes   the vaccines and the vaccinations abroad 
are cheaper than in the United States.   However, we know there are individuals who are 
not necessarily able to get the COVID vaccine   or maybe they aren't wanting to get the vaccine, 
I don't want to go into all of that about waivers   but I just want to address the truth about whether 
or not you actually have to get a COVID vaccine   before or any of your vaccinations rather 
before you enter the United States. There are a lot of US embassies and consulates who 
make it very clear on their website. Japan United   Kingdom, those are two that we see where they 
actually have written on their website: ""Please   note K1 visa applicants are not required to get 
their vaccinations before they enter the United   States and please note the COVID vaccine is not 
required for K1 applicants before they enter the   United States."" There are other embassies, this is 
actually really common immigration policies change   frequently, it's an ever-evolving landscape and a 
lot of times it's not uncommon for other embassies   and consulates to actually do things different or 
to be confused about what the policy is. I know   that's shocking but the US embassy and UAE and Abu 
Dhabi and Dubai, they have taken a position where   they are saying you have to get the COVID vaccine, 
you have to complete your vaccinations before we   issue you a visa. That's actually not accurate. 
Just so all of you know, it is possible that US   embassies and consulates can be confused and 
have contradicting policies. I want to show you   something from the CDC, from the Center for 
Disease Control where they have outlined an   immigrant who is listed in an immigrant visa 
category, that means that you're entering   the United States with an immigrant visa 
with the intent to come here and live,   it says that it does not include K1 non-immigrant 
visa holders. I know the other question was, with   a proclamation that was was released, 
do I have to have the COVID vaccine to   be able to be allowed to enter the United States? 
The Department of State has been very clear,   K1 visa applicants do not have to have the COVID 
vaccine before they enter the United States.   The last thing I will say on that 
point is you are still required, K1   visa applicant when you are going through
the adjustment of status phase of your case,   at that point, you would 
have to get the vaccinations before you could receive your green card. 
The vaccinations are required, just not   before entry. Hopefully, that gives you clarity 
and clarify some of the rumors and confusion that   is out there right now regarding the COVID 
vaccine as it relates to K1 visa applicants."

#GMB #PiersMorgan #SusannaReid",2020-12-02,231700,2353,9,UCq18eeL7D9Vd8DhjMcLh9QQ, i want to start though if i may uh with something a little bit more personal uh for you and your family that you revealed yesterday in the house of commons i want to display it to our viewers who may not have seen this yet we talk a lot of the outbreak in liverpool and how that great city has had a terrible outbreak and got it under control this means more to me than i can say because last month my step-grandfather derek caught covered there and on the 18th of november he died in my family as in so many others we've lost a loving husband a father a grandfather to this awful disease so from the bottom of my heart i want to say thank you to everyone in liverpool for getting this awful virus under control it's down by four-fifths in liverpool that's what we can do if we work together in a spirit of common humanity we've got to beat this madam deputy speaker we've got to beat it together i was very moved by that health secretary and i want to send on behalf of everyone here our deepest condolences to you and to your family um tell us about your step-grandfather derek well derek was my stepsister's stepfather and we have a i have a complicated messy and uh loving family and you know with one big extended family really and he sadly well you know he he caught coronavirus uh in november um and and then he passed away and it's just it's just awful you know he was in his 70s and um it just shows how important it is that we keep this thing under control and it shows to everybody how important it is that we can get through it um and you know the irony was that um liverpool thankfully has really got this under control but uh but in that period when the infection was going round um you know um he caught it and he died and it shows that it can it can affect all of us your emotion was very obvious there when you were speaking yesterday it looked like you were close to tears understandably it's obviously been a big blow to your family to have personal first-hand experience you will know this has been replicated tragically all over the country you know nearly 60 000 official deaths now recorded from this given what your family has now gone through has it given you a new perspective about this virus well it's made me really really determined piers and and you know i understand when people say that there are big consequences of the decisions that we've taken to to keep the virus under control and i know that and you know i also come from a small business background i understand the impact on businesses but you know we've got to do that and especially now with this vaccine news we can we can get through this together as a country if we do the things that we all know we need to do um and and it's just made me even more determined to to to get this thing beaten i mean i just really feel it here yeah and that was very clear from what you said and um and actually i love the fact that this morning you've described your family as complicated messy and loving because i think that that you know is a reflection of so many families across the uk and we're very sorry for for your loss obviously and i'm sure it it will affect you very deeply and and perhaps change your perspective on what has happened let's talk about the vaccine because it is um a good day in terms of progress um how come we have become the first to approve this vaccine because we're way ahead of europe and the united states yes well it's partly down to the uh the brilliant work of the team uh the business secretary alex sharma kate bingham and the vaccines task force in terms of uh buying and getting access to the to the vaccine and it's also down to the mhra being a brilliant regulator i mean we don't often praise regulators uh when we uh when we talk about these sorts of things um but what they've done is they're rigorous rigorous in the safety checks but instead of applying those safety checks one at a time one after the other they've done them in parallel and by doing that and working closely with the company so that they've seen the data coming in from this the clinical trial as it was going on they've been in a position to be able to make this uh to make this authorization you do it means that people can start having this life-saving vaccine next week from next week but you do have a job on your hands don't you from people who say uh well you on the one hand you've got the people who are anti-vaxxed let's just put those to one side you do have a significant group of people who think this has happened too quickly for my liking how are you going to persuade people to take this vaccine up because unless most of us have the vaccine it's not going to have the effect in terms of getting rid of other restrictions that you want it to that's right and you know the vaccine wouldn't be approved by the regulator if it wasn't clinically safe but also what i'd say is don't listen to uh to me listen to the clinicians listen to the uh the experts people like professor jonathan van tan at jvt as he's become known right he is an expert in these things and he's said that he's called his mom and said mom if you get the call from the nhs make sure you get there and get vaccinated because as i know only too well and so many families know this is a deadly disease and the vaccine protects you from it the other thing that i'd say is that what i'm really pleased about is that the num the proportion of people in this country who are uh happy to have the vaccine is actually increasing at the moment we track this really carefully and when you compare the uk to other countries around the world we're one of the top in the world in terms of the proportion of people who are uh who are willing to take the vaccine so we were talking about this vigilant and there are yeah we we would happily take this if it helped get the message over i take it live on air i don't care i mean i i i just feel like it's really important if we're going to get through this that enough people take it yeah yeah i'll take it with you peers you know what just doing this i'll come to where you are anytime next week if we if we can do this and let's do it together live on air it would be powerful it would send the right message if you take it i take it suzanna takes it yeah you know dr hillary takes it i think it will have an impact well we'd have to get that approved because of course the there is a prioritization according to clinical need and thankfully as a as a healthy middle-aged man you're you're not at the top of the prioritization uh but the um uh but we you know if we can get that approved and if that's uh if people think that's reasonable then i'm up for doing that because this once the mhra has approved a vaccine they only do that if it is safe and and uh so if that can help anybody else persuade anybody else that they should take the vaccine then i think it's worth it i would only take it for one reason not self-interest because i want to be protected although i'd love to when my time comes i would take it to show people that it is safe that's the point can i just sorry matt hancock you have already had kovis yeah exactly so so why would you then have the vaccine because we don't yet know uh the impact of having had covid on whether you're both uh immune or don't transmit it again and so the we'll be vaccinating people whether or not they've had covet so that's one of the things that the uh that has been looked into by the scientists and they think that we should just vaccinate people whether or not they've had the disease there is there's huge pressure on you now in the same way that the prime minister has had to yeah yeah there's huge pressure on you now it has been all year round and you and i have locked horns many times about the way you've done certain things but this is in in many ways the biggest test isn't it it's it's clear that if we can roll this out in enough numbers fast enough and get enough people vaccinated it you know it's not just as our correspondent earlier the light at the end of the tunnel it's coming out of the tunnel yeah it is yeah i've described it as it's the dawn that's on the horizon because it's not just you know it is it's lifting all of the all of the gloom once we can get it rolled out and i have great faith in the nhs across all four nations to deliver this this is a uk vaccine it's been a uk procurement it shows actually why we're a stronger country all united together and then it'll be delivered by the nhs the armed services are also helping and they're supporting on the logistics and doing a great job but primarily delivered by the nhs um so obviously we've been doing a huge amount of work and getting ready uh should this moment arise we're nearly there okay the other two vaccines quickly the modern vaccine is only being manufactured understand it for delivery in april and we have 70 million doses of that on order yeah astrazeneca vaccine the oxford one uh we're about to hear how quickly that may come to availability but we have a hundred million doses of that and it doesn't require the extremely low temperatures of the fisa one you know could there be even better news coming quite quickly that this oxford one in particular with the massive order that we have could come fast as well before christmas yeah well let's hope so i mean we we're in on the modern one we've only got seven million doses and as you say it's only being manufactured for delivery in april the other short the other um uh early one is the oxford astrazeneca one uh as you say it doesn't require the minor 70 which makes it much more uh much easier to roll out especially out into the community people who can't travel to a hospital or to a vaccination center um so it is logistically and operationally easier that's currently with the mhra and having done their work on the fisa one they're also working in parallel on the oxford astrazeneca

Up until that point, BioNTech was little-known internationally and primarily focused on developing novel cancer treatments.

The founders were confident in the potential of their mRNA technology, which they knew could trigger a powerful immune response. That confidence wasn’t necessarily shared by the broader medical community. No mRNA vaccine or treatment had ever been approved before.

How BioNTech Used Cancer Research To Create Its Covid Vaccine",2021-10-23,600452,6630,2304,UCvJJ_dzjViJCoLf5uKUTwoA," It was January 24 2020,
BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin knew that Covid-19 was likely to
become a global pandemic. I did some calculations and
calculated how many people were infected. How many weeks how
many people could have traveled, how many people could be as
symptomatic and every calculation that I made clearly
demonstrated. This is not any more original outbreak, but the
virus has already spread worldwide. Though it was over a month and a
half before the World Health Organization officially declared
a pandemic, Sahin met with his wife, BioNTech’s co-founder and
chief medical officer Özlem Türeci, and together they agreed
to redirect most of the company’s resources to
developing a vaccine. It was immediately clear to both
of us that the technology we had, which we had already
clinically developed, could help to ensure a rapid response. Up until that point, BioNTech
was primarily focused on developing novel cancer
treatments. The company was little known internationally and
had never brought a product to market. They were still a small, relatively unknown
biotech company really working on this cutting edge science. The founders were confident in
the potential of their mRNA technology, which they knew
could trigger a powerful immune response. That confidence wasn't
necessarily shared by the broader medical community. No
mRNA vaccine or treatment had ever been approved before. But
the couple's timely breakthrough was actually decades in the
making. We understood that we would need
to invest some time and it would need innovations on different
levels in order to make it really work for vaccines and
beyond. But the potential was already clear there. Sahin and Tureci, whose families
both immigrated to Germany from Turkey, met in the early 1990s,
when they were working in the cancer ward at a hospital in
southwest Germany. Neither envisioned a career in business. During my time at medical
faculties studying medicine, I also started to do my PhD, which
meant work in a laboratory. And that actually caused a clash in
my perception. Tureci and Sahin both realized
that while there was a little they could offer terminal cancer
patients in the ward, in the lab they saw lots of potential for
new treatments. I was doing my lab work and
understood that the immune system could be a powerful
weapon to fight cancer. And at a certain time point, I realized
that it's not only laboratory work, but you have really to
develop the therapies and you need funding for that. Out of desperation, I become
became an entrepreneur and founder companies because I
understood that if you want to use innovative research to
develop medicines, you have to do it yourself. The couple had been studying
messenger RNA or mRNA since the late 1990s. The function of mRNA
is essentially to teach ourselves how to make specific
proteins. But because mRNA is very unstable and quickly
degrades in the body, they knew there was still a long way to go
before it was ready for use in a vaccine. And at that time point, mRNA was
used by a very small community. So it was like a talent you see
a young talent, you know all the weaknesses and you know that you
have to invest a lot of years to make the technology mature. So in the meantime, they
co-founded their first company Ganymed Pharmaceuticals in 2001.
Ganymed used a more established technology, monoclonal
antibodies to treat stomach cancer, and the couple sold the
company for 1.4 billion in 2016. It was Germany's biggest biotech
deal ever. By that point, Sahin and Tureci were already eigh
 years into their second ventur  BioNTech. When they founded th
 company in 2008, the couple fel  that they had improved th
 stability of mRNA enough t  focus on developin
 individualized cancer vaccine So the biggest challenge in
cancer treatment is that every cancer is different,
personalized or individualized. Cancer vaccines are based on on
getting the tumor off of the patient and analyzing that
tumor, then making a vaccine which is tailored to the profile
to the genetic profile of the of the patient's tumor. Unlike traditional vaccines,
mRNA vaccines don't introduce a weakened version of the virus
into your body. Instead, the mRNA instructs the body to make
a specific virus protein that will trigger an immune response
and produce antibodies, which can be used to fight off a
cancer that's already growing, or to protect against future
COVID-19 infections. And while traditional vaccines require
scientists to collect and grow large quantities of a virus, a
process that can take months, mRNA vaccines are much faster to
produce. That's because they're made from a DNA template in the
lab, the sequence for which can be shared electronically in an
instant. It's the most ancient
information technology, which means that the organism is
prepared and has all the tools to understand what you want to
convey in terms of messages with mRNA. The vision and the scientific
know how we're in place, but by the beginning of 2020, BioNTech
had still not gotten any of its mRNA cancer vaccines approved
for use in humans. The company had never turned a profit. And
when it IPO in 2019, it raised about 100 million less than it
had hoped for. They were still a small,
relatively unknown biotech company, really working on this
cutting edge science. But the world was on the verge
of changing. On the day when Sahin realized that COVID-19 had
already spread around the world, few others were concerned.
Europe had just reported its first few Coronavirus cases, and
Germany had not reported any yet. But after Sahin and Tureci
talked that morning in late January, they immediately jumped
into action. On the weekend, we started to
decide the vaccine sequences. And on Monday, we met our teams
explained them, this could become a global outbreak and
that we have the obligation to do the best that we can do to
come up with vaccine candidates. And already on Tuesday, we had
the full commitment of the whole team to start the development of
a new vaccine. We are like in a military
operation. The teams were redirected. We never put our
cancer programs at hold. So they went on while those parts of our
company who could really help with COVID-19 project started
step by step to pick up pace and work on a project litespeed. BioNTech knew that to
successfully produce tests and manufacture a Covid vaccine on a
global scale, it would need a bigger partner. The company had
already partnered with Pfizer, having worked with him since
2018, to develop an mRNA based flu vaccine, which is currently
in clinical trials. And so naturally BioNTech turn to them. We approach Pfizer in early
February, which was very early because no one really believed
that there was a pandemic. And as everyone else, our Pfizer
colleagues did not really believe that a pandemic vaccine
would be needed. And the response to that point
from Pfizer was no. And I talked with Pfizer CEO about this. And
he was saying essentially at that point early on, he was
really focused on Pfizer's operations in China, Pfizer's
people in China, and he wasn't yet thinking about developing a
vaccine. Undeterred, BioNTech initially
went at it alone, developing not just one but for vaccine
candidates. The company started preparing for phase one clinical
trials in Germany, which would test the vaccine in humans. By
this time, others were starting to catch on. COVID-19 can be characterized as
a pandemic. Dow is now down more than 1100 points as moments ago,
the who has formally declared the Coronavirus, a global
pandemic. And now the extreme new measures
in the US. Large events banned in Washington State and San
Francisco. As U.S.  cases rise over 1000. Less than a week after the pandemic
was declared Pfizer agreed to work with BioNTech to help them
scale up their clinical trials production and distribution. We had our first patient in on
on April 23. It was the first volunteer and in July, we
started phase three clinical trial. This was already in
partnership with Pfizer, which allowed us to move fast from the
early stage of clinical development to the to the latest
stage of development. So as they were starting phase
one they were designing and figuring out phase two as they
were getting into phase two, they were figuring out these
massive phase three clinical trials that they managed to
start in the summer, and the FDA and regulators globally were
working on being incredibly flexible. Over 43,000 participants were
enrolled in the company's phase three trials, which measured how
many vaccinated participants contracted Covid compared to the
unvaccinated placebo group. Sahin and Tureci we're by no
means certain that the vaccine would work at all. We knew that vaccine is able to
activate the immune system, but it didn't know whether the
immune system is able to control the virus. So as a scientist, my
expectation was it would be great if we have 70% efficacy.
But I was also aware that if the immune system is not able to
control we might have just a negative result and getting the
call on Sunday evening and hearing that we have 95%
efficacy. This was extraordinary, of course high
much higher than than we had expected. And it brought this just amazing
hope that we would be able to start fighting back against this
virus. And I think everybody who got that news felt like their
lives changed. Over 1.75 billion doses of the
Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have been delivered worldwide. And
perhaps obviously BioNTech is finally making money. With a
market cap of nearly 60 billion, the company made over $4.5
billion in profit in the first two quarters of 2021. As the
United States and European Commission governments have
entered into massive contracts to buy hundreds of millions of
doses. And BioNTech's stock has seen a rise of over 500% since
January of 2020. In the second quarter alone,
they brought in more than 5 billion euros in revenue. That
compares to just about 40 million that they took it in the
second quarter of last year. So this has been a transformative
year for BioNTech. In August, the Pfizer-b vaccine
became the first to gain full FDA-approval, helping pave the
way for a return to normal life. But there's still a long way to
go. Over half of the world remains unvaccinated. And the
virus is mutating into new, more infectious variants like the
Delta strain, which is ripping through communities worldwide. Our work on Covid is still a
large part of our activities in the company, obviously, because
there is still a long path to go until we have manufactured
sufficient supply to ensure that all those who want to be
vaccinated and need to be vaccinated get the vaccine. In September, Pfizer submitted
data to the FDA demonstrating that a booster given six months
after the second shot restores immunity to 95%. Currently, the
FDA has authorized boosters of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for
certain vulnerable populations such as those over 65. My personal opinion is that we
can't control the pandemic. And we can't control this virus, if
we don't enable that, that the vast majority of the population
stays immune. And then there's the issue of
kids. Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the
only one authorized by the FDA for use in children 12 and over
though the two companies have requested emergency
authorization for ages five through 11, after clinical
trials showed positive results when kids were given 1/3 of the
normal dosage. But amidst their ongoing Covid efforts, biontech
has still found the time to advance its oncology work. Even during the pandemic, we
have been able to initiate multiple phase one clinical
trials which meant bringing new concepts, not only mRNA
vaccines, but also other immune therapies for the first time in
human testing in cancer patients. And we have also
initiated advanced trials with our cancer vaccines where we
compare against standard of care treatments. We are of course excited to get
the data and it could be as exciting as COVID-19 efficacy
data. Sahin and Tureci emphasize that
developing therapeutic cancer vaccines which are administered
after a patient has already been diagnosed, are bound to be a
much lengthier process and developing the Covid vaccine.
That's because of the time it takes to recruit cancer patients
for clinical trials and monitor their condition over a number of
years. Still, though they say there's much to be learned from
the rapid response to the coronavirus pandemic. Namely that it's important also
on the regulator side to have sufficient resources in order to
enable very efficient work on receivers for clinical trials
approvals of drug approvals processes, which could be much
leaner and much faster. The question is can be can we
use that model also for other severe diseases, and I believe
we have to consider how to use it. Because if you take for
example cancer in the in the time between 2020 beginning 2020
and now more patients die with this cancer patients died by by
COVID-19. So it is not a pandemic, but it's an endemic. Sahin and Tureci are modest
about their success. They ride their bikes to work and don't
own a car or TV. And while their company has grown from about
1300 employees at the beginning of 2020 to around 2500 today,
it's still minuscule compared to the likes of Pfizer, which
employs about 78,000 people worldwide. But what the influx
of money and attention will change is the level to which
BioNTech can invest in and accelerate its other endeavors. We have now the chance to invest
to accelerate our cancer immunotherapies. We have the
chance to make it bolder. We have the chance to go in other
fields. It's also very valuable to
acquire technologies or assets which we otherwise would need to
develop ourselves, which means saving time and being faster to
bring medicines to patients. In July, BioNTech acquired Kite
Pharma cell therapy platform as well as its Maryland based
manufacturing facility. Kite is also focused on developing
cancer immunotherapy products. And Sahin said in a statement
that the acquisition will accelerate BioNTech's
development of novel cell therapies in the US. And the
company is expanding beyond the oncology space too. In the next years, we will
certainly see that we will enter into clinical development for
infectious disease vaccines like malaria, tuberculosis, HIV
continue to work in the cancer field, start projects in the
autoimmune fear stat projects for treatment of inflammatory
diseases, and have also projects in the field of regenerative
medicine. Since the pandemic began,
companies developing mRNA technologies have raised
billions of dollars combined. And according to roots analysis,
and India base biopharma research firm, there are over
150 mRNA based vaccines and therapies in development. The Covid-19 pandemic provided
this incredible proof of concept for messenger RNA. It showed it
really works as a vaccine against this Coronavirus. Now
the question is, will this really work as a vaccine against
flu? Will this really work as a drug for cancer? Those questions
are not yet answered. For their part, Sahin and Tureci
say the Covid vaccine is just the beginning. I believe that mRNA as a
technology will be transformative for the biopharma
space mRNA can be used not only for vaccines for all sorts of
pharmaceuticals, and yet, biotech, we are actually already
doing it. I expect that in about 15 years,
about 30% of new products develop they'll be based on mRNA
therapies and that will not only include products which are
copying existing products or replacing them, but very
completely new type of medicines which are made possible only
because this technology is now available. And this is of course
exciting, to become part of this future and to drive the
development of new medicines this this this type of
technology."

myths that i see online but first of all let's just say a big thank you to our main sponsor today pfizer that's a joke don't take that seriously they did pay me blue pills thank you so the commonest one i see is the vaccine gives you covid and that's just not true if we are looking at this kind of vaccine it's an mrna vaccine so it doesn't have any covet virus in the vaccine i think the misconception comes from other types of vaccines in the past where people kind of get a bit confused about it so you've got inactivated vaccines where you've got inactive forms of a virus or bacteria or you've got live attenuated vaccines where you've got a weakened version of the virus in there and people think oh well that might give you the virus but that's not how it works normally these give your immune system an ability to fight it off the covered vaccine is none of these so it doesn't contain the covert virus sometimes people after they have a vaccine they may get a bit of a temperature or they may feel a little bit run down and they think well had a flu vaccine and it's given me the flu it's not the case it's actually your immune reaction which you're experiencing and that's something we want because we want your body to be ready for the actual virus when it comes into contact with it i want to indulge on this one i want you to come on a crazy rabbit hole journey with me it would have to be stable in liquid form it would have to be super super small probably thousands of times smaller than the smallest microchip we have and also some sort of transmission ability to be able to send it off to the lizard people yes the lizard people i'll come to that a bit later so then you you post this on facebook using your phone which also has a microchip wouldn't it just be easier if they put it on the phone i mean you wake up in the morning and the first thing you do is you pick up your phone and you use it throughout the day you carry it around with you you pay for everything you pay nowadays with your phone tracks everywhere you go kind of sounds like it's a lot simpler if they just used your phone it's a lot more cost effective as well i've got to tell you that and second of all why would they need to put the microchips in your body like do they need to know your bowel motions do they need to know how often you go for a dump probably not they probably don't give a  pun not intended me as your doctor i i don't care how often you go for a dump unless it's too much or too little if it's in this green zone then we just don't need to talk about it probably exhausted that haven't you if debunked it doesn't change your genetics in fact if it were to change your genetics it would need to go into the nucleus of the cell the central part of the cell that contains your genetic material your dna this works on the ribosomes a factory making part of the cell so it doesn't even go into the nucleus therefore it cannot change your genetics i've done another video about how this vaccine works and if you wanted to have a look at it i'll link the description i'll link the link below i'll put the link in the description for you to see the bottom line is it doesn't do anything with the genetics don't worry about it cool he said you're not going to turn into a lizard that's the end of that so some people argue that this vaccine was rushed therefore it cannot be safe in some ways i could understand their concerns um it is unprecedented that a vaccine gets the go ahead within eight nine months of it being launched but at the same time we're in a global pandemic that's been basically unheard of in modern times the world is in some ways in a standstill so scientists have been working round the clock to try and find answers and there's been a lot of collaboration as well across different countries uh different scientists and different organizations so i think it's incredible what they've done but the process has still been rigorous the process that is in terms of creating a vaccine they're different stages they've still gone through all of those stages successfully they've shown there are no concerning you know harmful side effects there are minor side effects that we get with any other type of vaccine so importantly i think they've proven that it is safe for those skeptical of how can they come up with something so quick well the mrna vaccine technology that's been the research behind it has been going on for decades and the recent sars and mers epidemics showed that we were looking more at spike proteins so all of this is kind of been in going on in the background anyway it's just that now we've been able to bring everything together the most vaccines we see the side effects within weeks to months in terms of what could go wrong and what we've seen with this vaccine is very minimal if anything people can get some aches a bit of lethargy a temperature all the kind of things we would see with other vaccines some people are really concerned about well what are the long-term side effects my question would be what are the long-term side effects of covid we know that people who get coveted are more prone to blood clots scarring on their lungs and multiple other comorbidities the risk is proven with covid so if we do nothing we already are doing some harm it's almost like a scale you look at the good and the bad and in this case when i look at the research in terms of this vaccine i see more good things than bad things yes we need to know whether people keep long-term immunity once they're immunized and yes we need to know if there are any significant long-term side effects with other vaccines this is very very rare so i wouldn't expect it why is there no vaccine for cancer the truth is cancer is a super complex disease it's not like a virus that gets in your body and you can identify what it looks like and find a way of defeating it cancer has got lots of different risk factors from obesity to alcohol smoking family history and all different types of cancers in your body have different risk factors so i think it's too simplistic to just throw out a concept that if you've made a vaccine for this why can't you do it for that they've all got their own different pathophysiology and different ways that they grow simply put it's not that easy you can't just make a vaccine for everything there are some cancers that a virus has been found to be a significant risk factor like cervical cancer where the hpv virus was found to be a risk factor we've now developed vaccines for that and we've significantly reduced people having cervical cancer after they've had the fact so if anything we've shown that we can do that when it is a cancer that is caused by a virus i see this a lot with a lot of young people who just say well i'm not bothered why do i need to get a vaccine if this virus only kills one percent of people we have to think about not just you as an individual but as us as a collective your community with the virus it's got the potential for exponential growth and as humans we sometimes we find that concept quite difficult to grasp so we have to think of the vulnerable in society and we have to be doing it for ourselves and others so when you have immunity it means you're less likely to transmit it still making sure you follow protection rules so making sure you wash your hands you wear a mask and you keep a distance but generally speaking if you're immune you are generally less likely to spread it so that's another important factor to hit on some people aren't happy that it's not 100 effective so they're like what's the point well if we look at the seasonal flu vaccine that we give every year to elderly patients and patients with comorbidities that vaccine is actually sometimes 50 60 may be effective if that but what it does is it still saves hundreds of thousands of lives and it is still protecting those people so i think the idea that you want something to be 100 protective before you take it is a little bit flawed let's do a little bit of just quick maths zero percent and ninety percent that's if you don't get the vaccine that's if you do this is another one that often comes up and it's about fertility the vaccine we know is an mrna vaccine we look at how the vaccine works we know it doesn't change your genetics which we talked about earlier theoretically it shouldn't affect your fertility we look at the science there was a study that came out in october that had a look at men who had recently had covet and they followed them up and they did sperm counts 50 of these people have something called oligospermia which basically means low sperm counts so if we're really worried about fertility we know that covid virus has significant health problems it can give to people but also there is some evidence that it could affect fertility the study obviously needs to be reproduced with a larger sample size and it needs to be done again in different countries to show the same effect so it's weighing up a post that karen does on a facebook group versus science and researchers it's a tough choice sometimes so that's been some myth debunking if you enjoyed that then it would be jolly good if you could hit the bell with a ding ding thing and if you want me to do some more debunking or if you have some questions about the vaccine drop them in the comments below i will see you on the next video peace out

of Africa right here, where the modern day Democratic
Republic of the Congo is. What Belgium did in the Congo is shocking, and hard to get your head around. It's terrible, in fact. But, Belgium's horrendous
actions in the Congo would lead to this. - I would definitely take the
Johnson & Johnson vaccine. - The FDA has just
approved a third vaccine. - Let's talk about the J&J. - The Johnson & Johnson,
coronavirus vaccine. (speaking in foreign language) - Johnson & Johnson's. - Johnson & Johnson's. - Vaccine. - The new Johnson & Johnson
vaccine is a game changer, for the fight against COVID-19. It is cheaper. It can be shipped without
having to be frozen, so it's way more durable. It's made of really advanced
sophisticated technology that allows you to just get one shot of it instead of the two doses
from the previous ones. - [Reporter] J&J's version
requires just one dose. - That's a big deal when
you're trying to vaccinate literally billions of people. And so to understand how this vaccine that is being rolled out
by Johnson & Johnson, a New Jersey based company, how that is connected to Belgium in the late 1800s in the Congo basin. You have to understand the story of how the sophisticated
technology was developed, and by whom. - [Narrator] One man at
the conference of Berlin, walked away with his own private colony, and showed what colonialism
looked like at its very worst. - [Reporter] This date
marked the beginning of white penetration into
the black heart of Africa. - [Narrator] African sleeping sickness is caused by the protozoan parasite. - [Announcer] Johnson &
Johnson the most trusted name in surgical dressings. ♪ In the language of love ♪ - Let me tell you a story
of one of the most insane and horrendous versions of
European colonialism in Africa. [Female Narrator] The 1880s and 90s, were years of terrifying
upheaval in Africa. - It starts with this
guy, King Leopold II, he was the King of Belgium. And by the way, this
wasn't like 300 years ago. This is like the mid to late 1800s. Belgium, wasn't a big player
in the colonizing game, not like France and Britain, but Leopold sort of wanted to be. He wanted to be a big
boy in peerless nation. So he actually went to Spain and Portugal whose empires were sort
of declining at the time, and offered to buy some of
their colonial possessions. They didn't agree. So, Leopold decided to take
things into his own hands. Like literally on his own. He himself, privately, would
create a colony for Belgium. Okay. So quick pause. I just got an email from Morning Brew. Which is a thing that gets
sent to my inbox every morning, and is a digest of all of
the news that is happening. But it's not just like
the sad, depressing news. It's like actually interesting stuff. I don't like going down

good quality newsletter. I love it. Thank you, Morning Brew
for sponsoring this video. Let's get back to the story and talk about what is going on
in the Belgian Congo. So Leopold decided to take
things into his own hands. With his own money and his own army. He knew he would need
some support for this in terms of just like approval. So he created an organization, that he called the
International African Society. Leopold builds this organization, and says that it's meant to be a research and philanthropy organization. With a mission to explore
the world for good and for science. But soon, Leopold would use this organization to get his wish of being a big boy colonizer. It was 1884 when a bunch
of the European and Ottoman and American powers who
were colonizing Africa got together and they decided that they needed some
sort of a unifying policy of how they were going to go into Africa, how trade was going to work. But they wanted to work together as they carved up the continent of Africa. Leopold gets up at this conference, it was in Berlin, and he says, listen, I've
got this organization. I would love to take this
organization of mine and go and take over a huge
swath of central Africa. And everyone's like, you
mean like Belgium is going to go take over the Congo? And he's like, no, no,
no, not Belgium, me. I'll do it with my own money. And the European powers
are sort of like, okay. Like how much harm can one
guy and his NGO do going into Congo? So Leopold gets his dream. He gets international approval
to go take over a swath of Africa that is 76
times larger than Belgium. He would call his new private
colony, the Congo Free State. Well, you know what happens next. He doesn't improve the lives of people. That was never his intention. Instead, his army quickly gains control over the local population and starts to use the locals to forcibly extract raw
materials from the land of Congo. Mainly in rubber, whose price was going up during the Industrial Revolution. And in ivory. He would put these quotas
on the local people that they had to get a
certain amount of rubber. And he would instruct his
army that if they didn't bring back their quota, that they were to go remove
their hands or limbs. This is everyone. Men, women and children who are being forced to
work for King Leopold and getting their limbs removed if they don't meet the quota. So, Leopold starts extracting huge amounts of wealth from the Congo. And he uses this new money to build big shiny things back in Belgium. Including this big,
beautiful park and archways that I used to bike past all the time when I lived in Belgium. Or this beautiful train
station in central Antwerp. Wait a minute. That train station looks kind of familiar. (uplifted whistling music) Yeah, that's me showing
Henry the clock tower in this train station. I had literally no idea that
this train station was built on the blood of people in the Congo. Okay, so I know you're wondering what is this terrible story have anything to do with vaccines and Johnson
& Johnson and the pandemic? Here it goes. Buckle up. So while Leopold is doing
all this terrible stuff in the late 1800s, almost the 1900s, something happens in neighboring Uganda. An epidemic breaks out of this mysterious disease
called sleeping sickness. This is what they called it. They didn't really know what it was. But Leopold catches wind of the fact that there's a disease spreading into the Congo where he
has all these people, and this giant operation
for wealth extraction. And he sort of freaks out. He's like my whole wealth
operation might get wiped out by this random epidemic. So, he decides to put out a cash prize for anyone who can go down and devise a solution or a remedy to the sleeping sickness. And then he starts to
invest in actual researchers and scientists, to go down to the Congo and start studying tropical diseases. To make sure that nothing catches him by surprise and wipes out his operation. Okay, well eventually
the world catches wind of all the terrible things
that King Leopold II is doing in the Congo. And they start to mount
pressure against Belgium the country, and the actual
government of Belgium to put an end to this. It's 1908, and finally
the Belgian government is like, dude, stop, like you're done. And they officially take
Leopold out of the driver's seat and they annex the Congo for themselves. And the Congo becomes an
official Belgian colony for the first time. But these scientists and researchers who Leopold set up to start looking into tropical diseases, they didn't leave. They stayed. They kept doing this work
and they actually started to make some really
important breakthroughs. They establish an official
state run organization called the Prince Leopold
Institute for Tropical Medicines. An institution that was leading the world in understanding tropical medicines and teaching research and
study about this topic. This organization was based
permanently in the Congo, as well as, in Belgium. Fast forward a few years,
and the Congo officially declares independence from Belgium. - With political independence from Belgium control of the entire
Congo was turned over to what is called the
Central Congo Government, with headquarters in Leopoldville. - By this time, all of the holdovers from the King Leopold
days are sort of gone. And now the Institute
for Tropical Medicine is actually like a legitimate institute that is doing groundbreaking,
cutting edge research and study on all sorts of pathologies, and viruses, and parasites
and diseases in this region. They're basically leading the world in tropical diseases
and understanding them. They moved their headquarters
from Leopold's house in Brussels to the city of Antwerp where that beautiful but
terrible train station is. And they sort of turn into like a school, like an institution where they're training researchers to then go out
and work in the real world. Okay. So here's where it starts to really
connect with modern day. You have the Institute
of Tropical Medicine, which was effectively built from King Leopold's
operation in the Congo. A lot of the researchers and students from the Institute of Tropical Medicine were graduating and moving on and joining particularly
one pharmaceutical company, that was a Belgian pharmaceutical company, that was down the road from the Institute of Tropical Medicine. This pharmaceutical
company was called Janssen. And as researchers from the Institute of Tropical Medicine joined Janssen Pharmaceuticals
they continue to do that groundbreaking work around the world. Developing many of the medicines that the WHO considers
essential medicines. - [Reporter] Vaccines,
serums, medicines, and drugs. - They continue to do work
in the Congo, for example. Where, just recently,
they developed the vaccine for Ebola in the Congo. - [Female Reporter] A
Belgian doctor was part of an international team
that was called to Yambuku in the heart of the
Democratic Republic of Congo. - This is their old stomping grounds where so much of this
understanding of different viruses, and parasites, and diseases was founded during the King Leopold days. But instead of the colonizing efforts of the early 1900s, now
these institutions are actually doing really good work, and actually saving lots of lives. In 1960 Janssen Pharmaceutical, which is full of all these Institute of Tropical
Medicine researchers, gets purchased by a New Jersey company
called Johnson & Johnson. - [Announcer] Made only
by Johnson & Johnson, the most trusted name
in surgical dressings. ♪ In the language of love ♪ - And yes, this pharmaceutical
company Janssen, which is now a division
of Johnson & Johnson was the actual company
that developed the miracle COVID-19 vaccine that is
saving the world today. - [Reporter] Today,
Janssen Pharmaceutical, as part of healthcare
giant Johnson & Johnson announced this. - The chairman of Janssen, by the way, is a graduate of the Institute
of Tropical Medicine. Their long legacy in the Congo, and their focus on scientific research around tropical diseases is what gave them the capability to be able
to step up to the task and create a vaccine for COVID-19. In other words this, led
to this, led to this, led to this, led to this. - [Reporter] The first J&J doses expected to go into American's arms
within 24 to 48 hours. - Again, we think it's really important for our country and the world. - Okay. So I know this
sounds like I'm doing some sort of like exposé
on Johnson & Johnson and Janssen, and they're like dark past. I'm not. The work that they're
doing today is amazing. It is saving so many lives. The Institute of Tropical Medicine is an amazing public health institution that does really really useful work for saving many lives around the world. And yet, when you trace back the roots of why this institution exists and the original motives for it, they're pretty (beep) up. - [Female Reporter] His 23
year reign was so brutal that the population halved, while Leopold and his men
amassed huge personal fortune. - What this story teaches
me is just how impossible it is to find an institution
that wasn't founded on some bloody dark past. The country I live in, and the
democracy that I am proud of is founded on blood of stolen
people from another continent. How do I evaluate something
that I think is good when I really understand
that the backstory behind it is terrible,
and bloody, and horrific? The fact that this lifesaving
game-changer vaccine has a legacy that is based
on a greedy horrific King massacring a bunch of people in the Congo is a really uncomfortable tension. But if you look close enough, it's one that exists in
nearly everything around us."

Pentagon To Mandate Covid Vaccine For Military",2021-08-09,152074,1335,6359,UCaXkIU1QidjPwiAYu6GcHjg, and Monica turning out to the White House's response Dr fauci made a little news with Chuck yesterday when he said that booster shots could be coming soon for some people and so too could full approval of the vaccine what else are we learning today building on that on the federal front in the fight against the virus yeah those are two really critical hurdles Garrett that Dr fauci talked about he does believe that once the FDA grants that full approval to the shots which could come anytime this month that there will be a flood of vaccine mandates in places like schools and businesses that will follow and that fits in to what this white house has been saying for some time now which is there won't be Federal vaccine or mask mandates at this point they want States and obviously local jurisdictions to make those decisions for themselves but we're just getting some breaking news in right now reports of another angle to all of this federally of course which is that according to the Associated Press the Pentagon is going to require vaccines for all service members by September 15th and that that came as a direct request from President Biden we knew there had been discussions between the White House and the Department of Defense and the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on this exact topic but they were trying to hedge into wait and see if that approval was going to come before then so this in terms of the T reading of the leaves there seems to indicate that approval really is coming soon but either way they would like for all service members to be vaccinated four to six weeks from now which is of course the time we know it takes for those to become fully effective in terms of immunity so that's another piece to all of this remember it was the White House just a couple of weeks ago that laid out these new rules for federal workers and these civilians more than 2 million of them who have to either get the vaccination or submit to rigorous testing this would be a different step it appears and we're waiting for confirmation from ourselves at NBC News and our Pentagon team on all of the details of how this would work this is something we believed was coming down the pike but notable because this white house is very concerned about the Delta variant we heard the president talk about it he's been monitoring the rising covid level cases all weekend long from his home here in Wilmington and he has been trying to separate it out as two different things the covid-19 pandemic which he argues we already beat and now the Delta variant which is presenting of course this major new challenge Garrett [Music] thank you
382,ZusjGkucX0E,The Americans hesitant about the Covid vaccine - BBC News,"Certain demographics in the US, such as African Americans, Evangelicals and Republicans, are more hesitant about the Covid vaccine than others.

These people will need to be convinced, if the US hopes to reach herd immunity, say experts.

#CovidVaccine #BBCNews",2021-05-04,94686,976,2055,UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA, at this point i have no desire to get the back vaccine i did not want to put anything foreign that you know so new in my body i would ask them have you been vaccinated are you interested in being vaccinated and they say no i asked them why we're trying to stop the reproduction of our race that's one i've been hearing every adult over the age of 18 18 or older will be eligible to be vaccinated [Music] where does this resistance really leave us are we in real trouble here in terms of achieving the kind of blanket of protective immunity that the country needs if we're really going to be able to go back to normal you know for a long time uh the early part of the pandemic i was getting intelligence from the barbershop these are places where conspiracy theories can grow or where we can bring evidence-based scientifically accurate information to the community a lot of my clients trust me more than they even trust their own physicians sometimes i'm a marriage counselor sometimes a fashion consultant mike sends me a message and says here's one of these flowers being circulated in the barber shop it said covet is a hoax don't take the test don't take the vaccine vaccine won't even develop yet you can take it mike but don't give it to your kids they're trying to stop your kids from reproducing uh i heard they're trying to put the chip in but we have this conversation every time my clients sit in my chair so when they sit in my chair after i um do their consultation on hair the next question i would ask them have you been vaccinated are you interested in being vaccinated and they say no i asked them why and what i realized a lot of my clients couldn't answer that question so what i did was i started doing research to be able to share more information with them [Music] the divide between hesitant and welcoming seems to map pretty closely to political party which again reflects how everything in the u.s has gotten polarized along political lines although it doesn't make a lot of sense scientifically when the vaccine first came out i had decided that i was not going to get the vaccine i have never gotten any kind of vaccine for the flu or anything like that and it just is one of those things that i just did not feel comfortable my husband and i talked about it he he was on the fence as well but he came around and he had been talking to me about getting the vaccine as well we signed up to get the johnson johnsons we were supposed to get it and of course they paused it so i was like is that a sign should i just back away from it i'd like to see a little bit more time pass with better results on the vaccine before i jump off we've had a lot of recalls in certain vaccines some have been pulled off some have had to be thrown away and so there's a lot of unanswered questions i'm of the philosophy of believing that when it's my time to go it's my time to go some of these chemicals that are put in our body that we don't know how they're going to react to us is a little bit of a problem i think in general um republicans may be skeptical of what academics uh and partic that includes scientists in academia are all about uh may be seen as sort of an elitist group and not some group that you could be confident has really got your best interests probably the most important thing we can do as far as addressing hesitancy is to listen unfortunately we still have clients out there that are still still skeptical about taking it and um the approach that i've taken from my platform is to try to convince them otherwise and uh just to try to not go toe-to-toe with them but explain to them you know the truth people think you're shaming them people think you're looking down on them but by watching mike he just listens so it's a conversation it's not like i'm coming in to message you or pitch you i think that's a lesson for us in the health professions compared to the hypothetical risk of a vaccine which is now in the united states have been injected into more than 100 million people and it's been going really well so if you're sort of waiting to see is this working i think the answer is yes it really is compare that risk to the possibility of actually getting this disease and ending up in the hospital or the icu or even dying seems like a pretty good balance you
383,fMMulCwYArk,Texas Scientists Develop A Patent-Free Covid Vaccine,"Medical experts continue to drill down the message that everyone needs to get vaccinated globally for Covid-19 but the issue of vaccine inequality in low and middle-income countries still persists. NBC News’ Morgan Chesky reports on a group of scientists in Texas who are developing a patent-free vaccine to bridge these equity gaps.

#Texas #Covid #Vaccine",2022-01-28,168358,2270,767,UCeY0bbntWzzVIaj2z3QigXg, at texas children's hospital in houston there is much more than meets the eye because past the exam rooms inside this lab lies what they believe to be the potential silver bullet for taking down covet 19. our lab is the united nations of science a team of doctors led by dr peter hotez and dr maria elena batasi has dedicated their careers to finding a solution to fill a critical vaccination gap luck delta arose out of an unvaccinated population in india at the beginning of last year and then omicron arose out of an unvaccinated population out of southern africa so mother nature is telling us what's going to happen as long as we refuse to vaccinate the world's low and middle income countries with 7 million dollars mostly provided by philanthropists the duo turned to an old answer to solve a new problem crafting a vaccine inside texas children's they're calling a game changer one they say they don't own the intellectual property for it's a similar technology that's used to make the recombinant hepatitis b vaccine it's known as microbial fermentation and yeast it's actually a vegan vaccine no human cells no human proteins no animal cells no animal proteins the technology important because it's existed for decades allowing multiple low-income countries to produce their own vaccine without intellectual property obstacles or waiting for donated shipments of pfizer or modernist vaccine that often arrive too late to make a serious difference so when a country receives your starter kit what essentially are they able to do with that we don't only give them the starter kit but we give them the recipe of how to brew the starter kit you know it's yeast so it's a little bit analogy of brewing beer right the comparison closer than you think this is where we cook it up yeast is actually fermented inside these medical grade bioreactors but instead of producing alcohol the texas children's team says they've engineered each kit to produce proteins which mimics the coven-19 virus the first step for each kit recipient to making their own vaccine they get a recipe they get a toolbox or tests to ensure the quality the yield the purity and then they get us plus our team that if you have a question you just pick up the phone what sets the vaccine created in this very texas children's lab apart isn't just how it's made but why there is no patent that means that a company anywhere in the world can scale it unlike anything we've seen in fact in india corby vax has secured emergency use authorization after completing two phase three clinical trials the great thing about it is there's no limit to the amount you can make it's got one of the best safety profiles of any vaccine out there for kovit 19. simple refrigeration storage you don't need any freezers to store the vaccine pristine safety profile and probably the lowest cost vaccine corby vax is being distributed outside of the u.s and currently isn't fda approved but perhaps the most important of all the accessibility the texas children's vaccine offers by not having a patent paving the way for partners worldwide what makes the patent-free vaccines unique is is that companies can produce the vaccine without worrying about legal challenges and huge financial losses now with the pandemic entering year three experts say the global health care gap especially with vaccines has become more exposed than ever this is the greatest moral failure of our lifetimes and we can't let this happen again we have to have a world that is much more effective against preventing and responding to pandemics and we have to have a world that's fair more equitable and just and that's a global imperative morgan is with us now to talk more about this it's such great reporting morgan thank you and we're glad you're bringing it to us i have to wonder about the scaling up piece of this right because this is a challenge really for any company right when you have something like india for example ordering 300 million doses into production can you talk a little bit about how the the production rollout is expected to happen and how that could work yeah hallie it's certainly ambitious right but the key thing here that dr hotez says that will make such a big difference is the fact that this is older proven technology that's already in the hands of some of these developing countries who may not be able to produce those pfizer or moderna vaccines that essentially require cutting-edge tech he says a country like brazil for example already has the tools in place those bio reactors available to where they can as they likened it to kind of brew up this vaccine and then rapidly reproduce it in order to scale up as much as they can in india for example that company it's already being used uh with an emergency use authorization uh we don't have an exact number on how many doses have already been administered there uh but their goal is to have as you mentioned millions of doses by the end of this year available however the key thing here to remember is that it's not one area or one country in particular that will hold the answer here hallie but africa for example just one region there if left unvaccinated could become the perfect ground for a new variant to come out and that is why they say they didn't have a patent on this that's why they're hoping that this can spread as quickly as possible to some of those worldwide partners because uh the sooner that an individual can even have one dose of the vaccine much less uh two or three as you and i have likely had with a booster uh the sooner those variants can start to diminish and cover 19 can uh stop being such a life-changing issue as it has been for the last three years it's you know morgan we talk so much about and we hear so much from from health experts in this country about getting people here vaccinated but this has to be as you point out in this piece it's got to be a global fight right because if not you're just going to continue to get these variants churning through morgan chesky it is great to see you live for us with tonight's original thank you so much i appreciate your time thanks for watching our youtube channel follow today's top stories and breaking news by downloading the nbc news app you

#MegynKellyShow #MegynKelly #News #Politics",2021-11-11,663963,26281,6438,UCzJXNzqz6VMHSNInQt_7q6w, foreign this is a nightmare you guys testified before the FDA panel um when they were considering the vaccine for five to 11 year olds and your wife did take place in this trial for AstraZeneca and she was living a healthy robust life prior to this she wasn't somebody somebody who had some sort of chronic illness or a psychological issues that continue to make her feel ill at every turn she was fine yeah she was absolutely fine healthy hiking mountains you know taking care of the kids rock climbing skiing all of the things that we love to do so she decides to take place in the in the trial of the Astra zeneca vaccine which is widely used in Europe why why did she decide to do that so uh me being a scientist we're a science-loving family we were concerned about covid we wanted to you know protect our family we wanted to further the science we wanted to help end the pandemic and so she was presented with the opportunity to to partake in the trial and chose to to sign up you know she was so confident and you know the vaccines being developed that you know she would be able to get a vaccine potentially and then not have to experience covid herself and help protect her family and her community when further the science and so when did she take place in the first in the trial so she had her first dose November 4th of 2020 so just over a year ago okay and what happened so right after she got the shot uh we were driving home and she said something doesn't feel right she had tingling down her arm where she got the shot she started to notice that her vision was changing her ears became very very sensitive to sound her eyes were so sensitive to light she had to put on the darkest sunglasses later that night she had the typical vaccine response that they tell you to expect you know the fever and all of those things but that had resolved by morning however she experienced new symptoms that next morning she couldn't really walk properly her left foot was sort of slumping she calls it she was walking into doorways the sound and light sensitivity were severe she was still experiencing the numbness and tingling and the symptoms just kept progressing and getting worse we called the test Clinic they didn't respond for a couple of days finally they responded brought her in did an exam said you know what there were a couple of instances of transverse myelitis and Ms in the previous trials you might have MS and you should go see a neurologist so we ended up in the ER three days later they did all of the tests that they could ruled out any of those you know pre-existing type conditions and essentially said we don't know what's going on but uh best of luck to you and send her home to continue to decline we went to the ER two more times and then a fourth time and she was finally hospitalized at this point she couldn't walk she was incontinent she was peeing her pants she still had to wear earmuffs to be anywhere that wasn't a dark room she had extreme sensitivity to sound you couldn't touch her she couldn't brush her teeth I mean it was just a hellacious experience how old is she at this point uh she's 39 years old at this point oh my goodness now she's 40. so you see who do you go to specifically the people running the clinic like who do you call to say you need to know this happened right so each of the clinical trials you know they're they're essentially performed by all these trial sites and all of the different states and cities and so we we call the test Clinic that's what they call these so they're the ones who administer the shots and you know collect the data and then send it on to uh in this case AstraZeneca and so that that's what we called was the the doctors at the test Clinic to say you know what something's not right here something's going on they didn't offer any help to you you were on your own in dealing with the Fallout from it and then right it's it seems like you know the other shoe to drop was when you saw her negative outcome was not included in the results of the clinical trial right so the clinical trial report wasn't released until last month but I was a little bit suspicious given that the test Clinic sort of didn't seem super interested the feedback we were getting from AstraZeneca um was essentially we need a diagnosis we need a diagnosis anything that would essentially absolve them of any responsibility right so I was concerned um in January so this happened in November in January I reached out to the NIH to um you know see if they have any thoughts on this and to my surprise they actually responded really quickly we had a Telehealth visit with doctors at the NIH they wanted to bring her out for testing and possible treatment however this was January and you know the NIH is located in Maryland and around this time we had a lot of civil unrest and other things going on they weren't sure with the inauguration if they could uh safely bring her out and so um they weren't able to bring her out at this time they offered to talk to her doctors locally to try and get them to perform the proper tests to come to a proper diagnosis but even with their involvement our local doctors were still incredulous and because none of the test results would come back you know abnormal they just said well this might be all in your head it's probably just anxiety you can't walk because you have anxiety um my gosh so I mean was any did anything show up on any test because one of the things I read was um that she started to suffer severe brain damage and was obviously advised by those running the trial not to get the second dose was that something that manifested in a CT scan or something no so all of the the adverse reactions were essentially symptomatic until we actually were able to go to the NIH and get proper testing done um and so all of these symptoms you know the the neurological Decline and everything else was very very concerning but nobody really knew what to do with it because when you do the you know the CT or the MRI everything looks normal all of her testing essentially was coming back normal um so did you ever make it to the NIH we did we went to the NIH in June where they did a whole battery of testing and she was eventually diagnosed with a bunch of vaccine caused injuries so the NIH acknowledged that yes so how does it wind up that as recently as last month her negative vaccine caused injuries are not in the report exactly so in a clinical trial essentially the participants are given an app on their smartphones where they report any of the the side effects however the only side effects you're allowed to report is a bulleted list of selected Adverse Events the things like fever muscle aches injection site pain headache you know tiredness things like that there is no free form where you can write you know I can't walk anymore or I can't be in bright light or my ears are so sensitive or any of the other things that she experienced you have to call the test Clinic explain to them what's going on and then it's up to them to report up the chain right with potential reporting and clinician bias you know the Adverse Events and they didn't it would appear not [Music]
385,VGm7Dfp0EXo,"COVID Vaccine Vlog.. I got *SICK* | Miki Rai, RN","As healthcare workers, Kevin and I have both had the opportunity to get vaccinated. Kevin got the Pfizer vaccine, and I got the Moderna vaccine based on what was distributed to our workplaces. Please remember that every body is different and what one person experiences may be different from what another person experiences. Most common side effects include: pain, swelling and tenderness at the injection site, fever, chills, fatigue, muscle aches, and headaches.

Get vaccinated not only protects yourself, but also protects the people around you. By now we have seen just how scary COVID-19 is-- the symptoms can be severe and lasting many months. COVID-19 can damage your heart, lung and brain leading to long term chronic issues. Getting vaccinated can reduce the severity of your symptoms and protect you from the virus.

get any sleep hey guys it's mickey today is december 23rd it is the day of the day it is the day before christmas eve and i just got scheduled for my code vaccine washington state is receiving shipments um of pfizer and moderna vaccines however the issue is that we're receiving 40 less doses for the first phase than we had anticipated and so it's a scary time because we don't know who is going to be able to get the vaccines who isn't going to be able to get the vaccines and right now the vaccines are so valuable everyone is kind of scrambling and really hoping that they can get them originally we were told that we would be getting the pfizer vaccines but instead i will actually be getting the maduro in a vaccine because that is the shipment that came in first so when i signed up for the vaccine it asked me a couple questions am i pregnant am i under 18 and did i test positive for cobit within the last month to which all of my answers are no but let me just show you as you can see here on the screen i am in fact scheduled for the moderna vaccine and it automatically enrolls you in the first appointment as well as a second appointment because the doses have to be 28 days apart i believe plus or minus two by the way if you're new to this channel my name is mickey i'm a registered nurse and my boyfriend kevin is a physician and so kevin is actually getting his first dose of a vaccine tomorrow he's actually getting the pfizer vaccine and so we are getting two different vaccines although they are very similar there actually are some differences but they are both mrna vaccines messenger rna is a small piece of code basically that teaches your bodies to build a harmless protein that your body can then identify as covid and once it identifies it as covid then it can mount an immune response to basically prepare for an infection so going over pfizer versus moderna so effectivity is pretty close pfizer is at 95 percent while moderna is at 94.5 so pretty much almost identical pfizer vaccine is 30 micrograms and it's given 21 days apart and so that's three weeks where opposed to the moderna vaccine is 100 micrograms and that's actually given 28 days apart which is four weeks there is a grace period most places are doing plus or minus two days the fisa one actually has to be stored between negative 112 to negative 76 degrees fahrenheit which is obviously very very cold and so right now refrigerators are in high high demand whereas the moderna one is actually very special because it only needs to be negative 13 to negative five pfizer is approved for use over the age of 16 where opposed to moderna is approved for over 18. so those numbers they could work for people younger but because the trials in themselves only included people of that age that's why it's only approved for that but in the future if we do more studies it could work just as well for people younger i've been hearing from my friends that some of them have been pretty sleepy the first day after they get the vaccine any sentiments you're getting your vaccine tomorrow i just have to wake up earlier than i'm supposed to you'll be fine yeah i'm gonna miss it and they're gonna give it to somebody else no they won't kevin's workplace got the vaccines way earlier and by way earlier i mean like a week and a half earlier than my workplace and so we're still in phase one they are now moving on to what's actually phase one part two yeah phase one part two so kevin has so graciously offered to come with me because i'm a tiny bit nervous but he's post night shift but you did sleep a little bit last night right yes so they only had one patient so he's chilling you're ready i'm not doing anything i know i'm talking to myself hello okay let's do this thing do you have the address yes i do shoot i thought i sent it to myself but i didn't oh my god oh my god cue the nurse guys [Music] it's a 22 minute drive it's only 22 minutes away i thought it was like hours and hours and hours away i was like mentally prepared to drive babe yes this is like mickey's asian mom jeans coming out definitely my asian mom jeans coming out i cleaned those glasses for you yes now that we have time to clean our glasses i show up to everything early like i cannot be late it's my biggest pet peeve when other people are late [Music] thanks for coming with me no problem i know you're very nervous i think we figured out i wasn't nervous about the vaccine i was nervous about being able to vlog it and bring you guys with me i mean i've been getting so many comments and messages from people saying that they would love to hear how my experiences and how it is after kevin actually already got his vaccine you are day three post-vaccine i went to work right after for like 12 hours yeah so no major issues for kev the way that it works in washington at least is the state has purchased a certain amount of moderna and pfizer vaccines and then it gets distributed to the different locations or locations and hospitals based on the contracts that you have with the state i don't know exactly how it works and also like if you think about it flu shots and other other types of vaccines also have different types and are made by different companies we just don't name them as such should i just go in early or should i just do it yeah is there an earlier slot okay [Music] it was great everyone was super nice and understanding of your like of your famous life well yeah totally that's totally okay like you let me know what angle you want blah blah i just set it up on the tripod we got the footage um my arm is sore already back home we are eating some korean food some tsundubu some takeout it's been what an hour or so my arm is a little bit sore but otherwise i feel great over a million people have gotten the vaccine and obviously there are some instances of people who are allergic to certain ingredients or things like that and so there's obviously people who are going to have allergic reactions or things like that and that's normal no matter what drug no matter what yeah i mean like vaccine a lot percentage of the population is allergic to like peanuts shellfish and things like things that are harmed like apples and yeah so i think it's important to remember that when you read those articles right now it's obviously just a very exciting thing to have this vaccine and so the news is hyper aware of these situations right hello guys little buddhos is here with me wow i don't know if i'm just tired from life or the vaccine got me a little tired but i just took a little nap and kevin obviously had a night shift last night and so he went back to bed and i was just feeling so tired i figured i would just close my eyes for a little bit and i got woken up when kevin woke up ayo hi hi sleepyhead i'm the awake so it is currently 3 30 p.m i'm in fact not the one working night shift but i did take a little rest so my arm is pretty sore um but not any more sore than like it would be after a flu shot or anything like that get pretty knocked out with vaccines anyways like i'll just sleep through it so not the end of the world i feel okay look a little bit like a crazy person little update can you hold it my arm is so sore that's not even the right arm they're both really sore why like i don't know if you guys can see how like toned this looks like i'm not flexing it's just straight up swollen it kind of feels like i got a couple different flu shots on the same day the pain kind of radiates up my neck a little bit and sometimes my other arm hurts too but we're doing fine we're doing great kevin on the other hand didn't have any symptoms after his shot what do you mean my arm is sore yeah just for a little bit don't complain about it i'm a complainer no it is 4am probably about 36 to 48 hours between when i first got my shot yeah i just woke up with really really crazy chills um i don't know if it's just really cold in washington it totally might be that but i just turned on that two heaters and one blanket and everything else that i'm gonna try to bundle up but i think i definitely have the chills um it's one of the most common side effects of the vaccine and a lot of times it takes your body a couple days to mount an immune response so not out of the ordinary but kind of took me by surprise because i actually was feeling a lot better um yesterday compared to the first day i'm gonna try to sleep but i will update you guys good morning i'm sorry i look really rough but i figured i should give you guys an update um it's now eight in the morning and i feel much much better the chills the fever everything has stopped so we are good now um but since it kept me up all night i didn't get any sleep so i'm just gonna go back to bed right now i debated whether or not i wanted to even include these clips in there but i wanted to be an accurate representation of how i actually felt but just because i feel this way doesn't mean that your body will feel this way or you won't feel this way this is just my personal experience anytime i get vaccinated whether it's the flu or anything like that my body just reacts more and so this isn't something out of the ordinary or unexpected for me and all my co-workers who have gotten vaccinated feel just fine except for a little bit of arm soreness so again i think it's just it's my body but working really hard to build spike proteins which i am very excited for my body is generating an immune response which is exactly what we want so up today it's now 1 pm um i feel like absolute i want to say that in more less colorful language my body is not having it i look like i have a super bicep you mean it's just swollen it's super like it looks like i've worked out like tremendously and it is really tender so i do have a salon pus that is probably expired on my arm and on my neck um to hopefully make it feel a little bit better i'm gonna look horrible throughout this entire video but kevin has made me chicken noodle soup with some rice inside there's no noodle it's just chicken and chicken rice soup i was feeling really crummy again after we did some errands and then i had to like rest for a little bit and then i took some day quilt now i'm feeling infinitely better i took my temp 99 7. not a fever just a little warm we're getting close i want to emphasize again that all these symptoms i'm experiencing are completely normal like this is literally i will list out the side effects the most common side effects i just happen to have all of them yo what is up you guys it is now 6 p.m i feel great i'm back to not 100 my arms are still really sore but i'm feeling good i'm not sure if i'm just feeling better or if it was the day quill that really kicked in i'm scheduled for work tomorrow and i heard from some of my friends that the second dose is actually going to be way worse and so i have quite a couple days off after my second dose so i feel reassured about that i got my appetite back i'm starving hungry as heck so i'm gonna eat some din din hey guys it is 5 am post vaccine day 3. i feel great i feel amazing my arm is still a little bit sore but now i feel completely fine i no longer am taking any sort of dayquil nyquil after that clip i basically stopped vlogging because i didn't have any other symptoms i was feeling 100 a-okay and as you can see i've gone into the new year with no arm soreness i did kind of have a rough couple of days after the vaccine i want to answer a couple questions that i think you guys will have about the vaccine number one is the covid vaccine free technically yes it's free however it is being paid for by u.s taxpayer money and so you probably have already paid for it in your taxes while there is no upfront cost for the patient providers administering the vaccine can actually charge a administration fee and get that reimbursed through either private or public insurance or through a fund i have it written down here it's called the health resources and services administration's provider relief fund very long name now i bet you're wondering after you get the two doses of your vaccine how long before you actually have your 95 effective immunity that is a great question we don't have exact data on this we do know that it takes your body a couple weeks after that second dose to build immunity for the fisa vaccine we know it takes at least seven days in the modern vaccine at least 14 days and the cdc website itself says that it takes a couple weeks for your body to build immunity so especially if you've gotten the chance to get vaccinated please be extra careful you can still get covid before and after your vaccine how long does the immunity last this is the question that scientists and researchers all around the world are trying to figure out right now the short answer is that we don't know yet experts are not expecting it to be a lifelong vaccine and so we are expecting to have to re-vaccinate people at some point in time we just don't know exactly when that will be as i've already mentioned multiple times in this video every single person's body is different well some people experience no side effects no symptoms whatsoever i ended up getting almost every single one on the list please do not use my personal experience as a testimony for you not to get vaccinated there is seriously no world where getting covet 19 is a better alternative to getting vaccinated and protecting not only yourself but your loved ones and also don't forget to follow me on my socials i post on my instagram stories pretty much every single day so you can keep updated on my life and what i'm doing with work as always stay safe i love you guys so much and don't forget you're a 10 out of 10 and don't let anyone ever make you advice okay bye [Music] [Applause] you

Health Secretary urged to release data that ‘may link Covid vaccine to excess deaths’
MPs and peers criticise ‘wall of silence’

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/03/02/health-secretary-release-data-covid-vaccine-excess-deaths/

MPs and peers have accused the Health Secretary of withholding data that could link the Covid vaccine to excess deaths 

A cross-party group

“growing public and professional concerns” UK’s rates of excess deaths since 2020

Demand to be shown the underlying data for to support the Government’s assertion, “no evidence” linking excess deaths to the vaccines for Covid-19.

21 MPs and peers

“If those data do indeed exist, please share them; if thorough investigations have already ruled out such a link, please share the relevant reports,” 

“There is no place here for blind faith.”

Written to

Health Secretary

Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC)

Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)

UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)

Potentially critical data, which maps the date of people’s Covid vaccine doses to the date of their deaths,

have been released to pharmaceutical companies but not put into the public domain.

Data should be released “on the same anonymised basis that it was shared with the pharmaceutical groups, and there seems to be no credible reason why that should not be done immediately”.

“Questions about these trends, however, have to date been met by a relative wall of silence from your organisations and other public health officials.”

A DHSC spokesman

“We are committed to data transparency and publish a wide range of data on excess mortality. The datasets published are kept under constant review.”",2024-03-03,244506,24507,4770,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg, hello War welcome to today's talk Sunday the 3rd of March now today we're going to be looking at a letter written by British parliamentarians to the data holding agencies in the United Kingdom asking for very fine week by week year bye of age data relating covid vaccinations to Deaths and excess deaths and I'll be looking at this letter in some detail it's really time that this debate was put to bed there been there been rum on for such a long time now and if this data is released we can say you know what all our fears were misguided that there is no relationship here unless of course there is a relationship which is what we want to know of course now uh this is the tweet from Andrew bridgin uh dealing with this letter which has only recently been released into the public domain and we can see here it's been validated by Professor Norman Fenton and Professor Carl henigan two of the lead um authorities in the country and I think I haven't been able to contact Norman Fenton today but I think basically what they saying is this data can be released without compromising a patient individual confidentiality I think it's basically what it's saying now let's just look at the letter very briefly before we dive into some of the detail uh this is the letter here um three pages and I'm going to unpack it a bit but what's also really reassuring or comforting really is this is being covered by The Daily Telegraph now the United States you won't know about it but it's one of the major UK uh newspapers so this is getting into mainstream media certain parts of mainstream media didn't see it covered on the BBC but uh let's look at what the telegraph says first and then we'll look at the letter in some in some uh detail now Daily Telegraph as we've said Health secretary urged to release data that may may link covid vaccines to excess deaths so it may and we're looking for this link covid vaccines and excess deaths we really need to know about this MPS and peers me that's members of the houses of L House of Lords criticized a wall of Silence why the heck have we got this wall of Silence MPS and peers have accused the health Secretary of withholding data that could link covid vaccines to excess deaths it's a cross-party group and the cross party group say there's growing public and professional concerns UK rates of excess death since 2020 there's been excess death since 2020 and there persists to be excess deaths we need to know what is going on here we really do um so the demand to be shown the underlying data the underlying data the fine granular level data that we can give to our statisticians uh for the support of the government's assertion so the government's assertion is currently there's no evidence linking excess deaths to vaccines for covid-19 fine give us the evidence and we'll have our own statisticians review it that's what we need it's a very simple request now there's 21 MPS and peers in the Daily Telegraph article supporting this there were seven have signed the letter um in those if those data do indeed exist please share them uh if thorough investigations have already ruled out such a link please share the relevant yes so if the government's data is ruled out then all we're asking is for the transparency to see that data what is unreasonable about this request absolutely nothing that I can see now they've written to the health secretary Department of Health and Social care medicine's Healthcare products regulatory agency UK Health Security Agency so that pretty well covers the data holders so all of these have been approached um potentially critical data which Maps the data of people's covid vaccine doses to the date of their deaths is what we want so we can eliminate this possibility and validate the government's claim the government's claim that um no evidence linking excess death to the vaccines that's all we want to do we simply want to validate the government's statement that's all now this data apparently has been released to pharmaceutical companies now this is deeply concerning if this is true from The Daily Telegraph that the data has been released for to pharmaceutical companies that are basically there to make money but not released to um the public and uh for our public spirited statisticians to analyze then why would they release it to Big farmer and not to the public I mean can you think of any reason why they might release it to Big farmer but not to the Hoy pooy like you and me not to the pitaria the plean class um maybe we simply don't need to know we just have to be grateful and take their word for anything that dribbles down from their table so why would they do that why would they release it to pharmaceutical companies but not the public I mean obviously there there independent politicians with no vested interest in this why should they possibly do that data should be released on the same anonymized basis as it would shared with the pharmaceutical groups so the pharmaceutical groups believe have this data on anonymized basis and there seems to be no credible reason why that should not be done immediately immediately today is Sunday so let's hope for a response tomorrow on on Monday morning Monday afternoon let's let's not be too over enthusiastic this this could be released very very very soon realistically within days to be quite honest I would have thought uh questions about these Trends however have today been met by a relative wall of Silence from your organizations and other public health officials in the view of these parliamentarians and peers now uh Department of Health and Social care spokesman says we are committed to data transparency and publish a wide range of data on excess mortality the data sets published are kept under constant review now given that the Department of Health and Social care are committed to data transparency I expect we can get this data in the next few days let's wait and see now all um uh intimations aside realistically I don't think this is going to happen this side of the general election now the general election in my country could be as early as May or it could be later in the year here I really don't think we're going to get this data until the general election time because because um because you fill in the gaps in the comments I couldn't possibly say why this data wouldn't be released until the general election but that's my fear and suspicion we are going to know this this is going to come out I firmly believe that it's just a case of when it's going to come out and I'd like it sooner rather than later we need to know what is going on so future decisions can be based on this uh on this information now um this is probably a bit hard to uh to see but I'll read out the main points these are direct copies from the uh from the letters that we have um so basically here they're saying that um the UK stati statistics regulator agrees so basically the UK statistics regulator has agreed the currently the data that's current released does not provide information on vaccine Effectiveness or vaccine safety and should not be used in this way so here we have the people that hold the data um agreeing that the data in the public domain is so far insufficient to make firm adjudications the letter goes on we are we are requesting that the authorities redo the analysis with the following parameters and basically that is looking at the data on a week-by-week basis giving the accurate number of vaccines whether it's one through to seven imagine having seven vaccines incredible um and the the timing related to that what time did people have the vaccines at what time did the death occur so we can eliminate this lurking suspicion that the vaccines were a significant eological causative Factor in these deaths now the letter says these parameters have been used in the records in New Zealand and the results were made public and no person has claimed it revealed any personal information because it simply Aggregates statistics this excuse has been used so many times we couldn't do that we we'll release individual data no it can be done without that there are many ways to do it without that we've talked about this with various authorities including members of parliament that this can be done uh now your staff was asked to produce a detailed report and they declined to do so this is why we are bringing the matter to your attention and they are bringing it to the main cheese this guy he's he's the boss Professor sir Ian Diamond National statistician and chief executive UK statistics Authority in the government buildings in Wales now the letter does go on it gives some detail I'm not going to go through it in detail it is now in the public public domain but basically they are asking for information of the timing from doses 1 to 7 they want it registered for from week to 0 to 156 because it's 2021 to 2023 and they want fine grain details they want male Fe male female data separately they want the ages accurate up to age of 100 after 100 it can be aggregated because there's not that many people over the age of 100 and they could potentially be identified so that just eliminates that possibility granular granular level data is what we want currently uh 10 to 20 years of age ranging starting at 18 so there's big gaps at the moment we want we want individual ages of individual years of age precise time of vaccine doses precise times of deaths uh deaths on a week by week basis and then the statisticians will be able to give us definitive reassurance that the government statements are in fact correct and uh they they give a few more details here they want precise this is about the precise numbers of deaths people that are alive and how that is going to be counted so there we have it there is the details of the letter here so you can obvious viously check this out for yourself it's now fully in the public domain and perfectly reasonable it appears to me and thanks to these uh seven parliamentarians and the other 21 members of parliament and the House of Lords who have asked for this data simple request reassure us all shut us the heck up and let's go on with the next job because there are plenty obviously as soon as these any of these departments release this data and its analyze we'll be talking about it as soon as we possibly can but I'm afraid it might not come this side of the general election which is disappointing that such political considerations may be employed when we're dealing with people's lives that's the letter it's a reasonable request and uh

for there are always adverse uh impacts of from drugs uh of any form whatsoever but perhaps 177,000 people maybe more died from taking hydroxychloroquine uh across four or five countries we'll get to that later but as covid is uh surging and it is surging now we don't have a of it in the same way because we don't get daily reports anymore we still have 200 plus people a day dying that is double what the normal rate was back in 2019 of uh more than double of the daily deaths from the flu but between the flu and covid and RSV that is floating around there I know one local hospital they they have reinstituted uh mask mandates because these lunatics who are doctors and health officials think that masks somehow prevent respiratory diseases or inhibits the spread of respiratory diseases so these crazies at the hospital deedarian um Institute a mask mandate at the hospital to protect um both people who are you know vulnerable at a hospital you're You're vulnerable and also others coming into the hospital because others may have it coming in there and I know that sounds just insane that these doctors uh they're still in the um you know they have the Mind virus the co mind virus with their surgeries where they're not breathing fouchy brainwash yeah but um the uh latest that's going around and we'll talk about this uh later in the program about one study that is reporting that um I I don't know what even it reports to be honest with you because of the way that it's presented but that there were people examined who supposedly are dying from the covid vaccine I would be shocked if no one has died from the covid vaccine in the history of its being administered hundreds of millions of covid vaccine shots have been given I would be shocked if we didn't lose people to the flu vaccine every year in fact every vaccine that exists I'd be shocked if we had no deaths whatsoever um in the same way that I would be shocked if we had no deaths from people going under anesthesia for a colonoscopy On Any Given year or uh people who have adverse reactions to Tylenol or Advil this is the the reality but nevertheless uh in Ronda Santos's land of sort of like a I mean sort of like Disneyland except for without uh without the wokeness without the wokeness just a lot more death in Co in a state that is famous for old people living in by the way uh his um Surgeon General uh is basically saying they want to outlaw the um M vaccine and here he is on Steve Banning to explain why and interesting Theory from this supposed doctor other uh uh streaming services or podcasts whatever uh the mainstream media immediately you know the medi ites the world the the Media Matters it's all of a sudden you know we're conspiracy theory guys were Cooks um that were talking about uh you know keeping people away from this tremendous this vaccine that save so many lives what what evidence do you point to cuz I know you're a man of science that's where you came and took the Surgeon General pause it for one second I just want to highlight that the reason why he's there is because he's a man of science continue please away from this tremendous vaccine that saved so many lives what evidence do you point to because I know you're a man of science that's where you came and took the Surgeon General I think you were at UCLA after Harvard you came and took the Surgeon General job under Governor DeSantis because you actually wanted to get this out into the field what evidence do you point to that backs up your contention yeah well the great news here is the evidence has been completely provided by the FDA so it's their evidence and the evidence is a combination of their guidance documents in the past that acknowledge the risk of DNA integration and the need to test for it to make sure you're not fouling up the human genome their evidence is their acknowledgement that there is DNA in there and that's been found to be billions of particles small particles of DNA with each dose in at least one study and they've acknowledged because we asked them specifically whether they have tested for this and they they gave a non answer they talked about a bunch of other things and they never answered the question which I refer to mean that they haven't tested for it so it's literally all their evidence and I'm not saying frankly I think it probably does have some integration at some levels with the human genome because these vaccines are honestly they're they're the Antichrist of all products so I think it probably does but I'm not saying it does I'm saying that they themselves have said you should test for it and it hasn't happened and they've provided no proof that it's happened and that's that's so wrong you know it's just complete disrespect to the human genome and the importance protecting it and preserving it and that is our connection to God now that pause is Steve Bannon going wait um Science Guy um just a couple of notes that I took here um one that there's DNA particles that are integrating with the human genome and stop fouling up that Human Genome okay it's our bridge to Jesus know I don't I'm not not sure I fully get how a vaccination goes to the genome also it's mRNA not DNA these are separate things if you listen closely he's not saying that either he's just saying that you have proven that it did it doesn't in anyway right they haven't tested for our insane theory that uh there is like particles in the MRNA vaccines that foul up The Godly Human Genome now um Ashish ja who is the dean of Brown University public uh health school now to be fair he also um uh worked in the National um uh uh the White House National Corona virus response uh before stepping down last year quote this idea of DNA fragments it's scientific nonsense people who understand how these vaccines are made and administered understand there is no risk here um hospitalizations have been on the rise nationally uh that's from this this it's one of the most studied vaccines at this point said the CDC director um Mandy Cohen uh the FDA which is authorized stressed the shots quote safety Effectiveness and Manufacturing quality so he's listening to the FDA up to a certain point but the scientific um evidence that he's brought on and this is a guy now who is trying to uh who called for a halt on using these vaccines in Florida and probably all around the world is um and I want to quote here it's probably the Antichrist of vaccines probably the anticrist of vaccines which I think is a scientific term see it's so weird how um the purity of one's body and you can kind of see these religious uh constructions being Gra Ed on to antiva conspiracy theories like they just genuinely don't want certain things being put into their body because that might poison them in some satanic way I mean they'll eat any processed food or exist in society and consume what they want they won't eat the Antichrist of but for some reason the Antichrist of you know of of medicine is what they're most concerned about odd Surgeon General of estate scoffing at the idea that the vaccine saved lives and and the idea too like I love when right-wingers do this they're so dismissive of credentialism and like scientific uh consensus and all of like the Academia that goes into science and being a doctor until it serves their interest until Steve banon can be like oh you're credible UCLA here as opposed to the fact that he's obviously a crank when it comes to the field he is a Harvard trained physician and researcher who had not specialized in infectious disease uh sometimes you want a new set of eyes on the problem exactly um the FDA We Stand firmly behind our regulatory decision-making with the authorizations improval of the covid-19 vaccines they're not swayed by the Antichrist argument the Antichrist argument did not uh come up in the FDA but it's interesting in that they don't research whether it is the Antichrist of vaccin pretty disrespectful pretty disrespectful s not going to just look into if these this is anti leardo has been calling for it he said can you look into the Antichrist particles and the FDA won't do it so what does that say the former uh Florida Surgeon General said uh cited data showing that 8,000 covid deaths in Florida last year the vast majority are likely to be vaccine preventable if people are up to date on their current vaccines um but you become what um possessed by a demon maybe I don't yeah the only problem is the neck strain associated with being able to spin your head around ah yeah don't tell that people it's just one more reason not to get uh vaccinated because you get possessed by the door downstairs though yeah there you go allows you to levitate that's right but then P I don't know my I'm citing The Exorcist and that's like a hundred years old that that movie so"
388,vitgOb96jmg,US joins support for a waiver on COVID vaccine patents | DW News,"The US will support a proposal to waive IP protections for coronavirus vaccines, Washington's top trade official said. More than 100 countries want the temporary suspension of patents on COVID-19 vaccines.

Many countries want the lifting of patents, copyrights, and protections for industrial design and confidential information related to COVID-19 vaccines. They are calling for suspension of such protections for several years to help speed up vaccine production. The idea of waiving intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines has wide support among the developing world, as countries struggle to secure enough doses to inoculate their citizens. Meanwhile rich nations such as the US have been accused of hoarding vaccine supplies.

Both international and domestic US leaders praised the move by Biden. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called the Biden administration's decision to support the waiver proposal a ""monumental moment in the fight against COVID-19."" Ghebreyesus backs the initiative, saying that such waivers are within the powers of the WTO and that it is the perfect time to use them.

The proposal has faced stiff opposition from countries with powerful pharmaceutical and biotech industries. They say that such a waiver would not provide the relief that people hope, as vaccine production is a complex procedure that cannot be ramped up simply by lifting protections, which could have an impact on future innovation.

#Vaccines #Patents #Waiver",2021-05-06,45412,867,489,UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg, we begin with what could be a big breakthrough in the drive to boost the world's coronavirus vaccine supply the white house has announced support for waiving vaccine patent protections now the u.s trade representative said that extraordinary measures are needed to end the pandemic the u.s has previously resisted efforts at the world trade organization to temporarily suspend intellectual property protections on covet 19 vaccines it now joins more than 100 countries in supporting the move shares of major vaccine makers moderna and novovacs dipped on the announcement let's bring in william bluecroft who joins us now from dw news william tell us what exactly is u.s president joe biden advocating here so he's joining the calls to have a temporary exception to intellectual property rules that govern pharmaceuticals including vaccines to allow for a quicker and broader supply to be created all around the world so generic pharmaceutical companies like in india and israel and other places can produce the very vaccines including the mrna vaccines without getting permission or having to do deals with pfizer with modena these kinds of companies now should be noted the united states is usually a very strong advocate for intellectual property rights for patent protections it's often criticizing china for skirting those rules to protect their own industries and also to protect um the incentive for companies to invest in new technologies but in this case what basically what biden has come out and said is the the urgency of the pandemic outweighs those economic and technological innovation uh arguments talk with us about the timing why now well this was a campaign promise that joe biden made last year he said he would support this very kind of temporary lifting or a waiver to the intellectual property rules at the who and he's come under intense pressure from fellow democrats from progressive groups from world health advocates trying to get him to do this um and he's basically making good on that campaign promise of course he's had to fight the opposition of the pharmaceutical industry that makes a lot of money off of these patents it should also be noted that it also costs them a lot of money and takes a lot of risk to develop these kinds of treatments so that's kind of the back and forth and there's also the diplomacy aspect for example china and russia have been using their vaccines very effectively as a kind of currency a diplomatic currency in relations with other countries and the us that's been so successful vaccinations at home is under a lot of pressure to show good will to help end this pandemic elsewhere especially in places like india that have been just getting hit so hard by the pandemic and that is something that advocates of this waiver are hoping uh will help will help get more vaccines out into the world especially lower and middle income countries dw's william bluecroft thank you so what does all this mean for the business side of things let's bring in chelsea delaney who's joining us from frankfurt chelsea how significant would this be for vaccine makers this patent waiver well vaccine makers are obviously very upset by this proposal we've seen particularly the shares of some of the smaller biotech firms like moderna and biontech get hit really hard on the market and these are companies that were developing the technology behind these vaccines for years before the pandemic so for them they really don't want to give up this technology we're hearing a lot of different different arguments from the pharmaceutical industry one is that this would discourage companies like biontech from wanting to innovate and to invest money into new technologies in the future the pharmaceutical industries are also arguing that this would really open up this technology to some of some of the us's competitors like china and russia but also a lot of pharmaceutical companies are saying that this is just not the most effective way to boost a vaccine supply for these smaller and poor countries okay and just to remind our viewers i mean this isn't a done deal yet so it's really just speculation at this point as to whether or not indeed it actually happens but you know tell us in the meantime how are manufacturers potentially positioning themselves right now well this is one of the other arguments against opening up the waiver from the pharmaceutical industry making these vaccines is extremely complicated it's a very difficult scientific procedure and we've even seen some of the more developed pharmaceutical industries in the u.s here in europe really struggle to get these production lines off the ground so a lot of people are arguing that even if this deal even if this procedure goes through which could take several months it would be very difficult for some of these smaller poorer countries to uh get the the the supply the workforce and the industrial capacity to quickly ramp up the production of these vaccines okay so many different angles to this story chelsea delaney giving us a view on what the business world is saying thank you so much here are some other developments in the pandemic indonesia is banning travel during the popular homecoming period to celebrate eid al-fitr covet 19 cases there have been falling but the government wants to prevent a repeat of last year's mortality rate rise after the holiday the world health organization is planning to set up a global pandemic hub in the german capital berlin to gather and to analyze data on emerging pandemic threats and canada has authorized use of the biontech pfizer vaccine on children as young as 12. it is the first country in the world to approve a vaccine for children you

I THINK LOT OF STATES ARE LOOKING AT NEW YORK AND THE HEALTH CARE WORKER MANDATE AND THE CITY MANDATE AND SEE HOW IT GOES AND WITH COMPLIANCE AND HOW THEY FAIR AGAINST LAW SUITS. >> SO YOU ALSO HAVE REPORTING ON THE VACCINE MANDATES FOR TEACHERS IN NEW YORK CITY AND THAT IS TEMPORARILY BLOCKED BY A JUDGE. WHAT IS HAD THE LATEST WITH THAT AND IT IS A CONCERN FOR PARENTS BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE YOUNGER CHILDREN WHO CAN'T BE VACCINATED A LOT OF PARENTS WANT TO BE ASSURED THAT THE TEACHERS AND STAFF ARE MANDATED. >> THE MANDATE WAS TO GO IN EFFECT TODAY BUT FRIDAY EVENING THE FEDERAL APPEALS JUDGE ISSUES AN INJUNCTION AND LASTING THROUGH THE THREE PANEL JUDGE LOOKS AT THIS ON WEDNESDAY, THREE JUDGES ARE GOING TO CONSIDER THIS LAW SUIT APPEAL FOR TEACHERS, AND MAKE A DECISION. SO CITY SCHOOL OFFICIALS EXPRESS CONFIDENCE THIS IS A BUMP IN THE ROAD AND THEY CAN APPLY THE MANDATE SOON, BUT IT IS UP TO THE JUDGES AT THIS POINT >> ALL RIGHT, THANK Y"
391,bPDm-RV0Xks,Covid Vaccine side effects made life difficult for over 6 months and still there......,"Here is the true story of my side effects after getting Astrazeneca vaccine, which lasted for 6 months and are still on-going.......

website: https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk

I also made a follow up video answering some of the comments",2021-12-18,505513,9663,5449,UCoBXlot3tta4Bz5y7m-8YRg, hi guys welcome back to the channel I know I made a funny video about my coronavirus um vaccine reaction but unfortunately um I got a real reaction and I thought I should make a quick video in case other people are having this and they're wondering what's going on I had the AstraZeneca vaccine um I don't know 10 months ago when it first came out and it was announced and then I was all right so after the second dose I got a bad headache that started off just above my left eye in this region and it carried on got worse and worse over three four days so much so that I had to call my doctor and make an appointment to say I need to see someone because I have this really severe bad headache and it's not going away then I saw them and they couldn't figure out did some tests and things and everything seemed normal and then the headache kind of moved and went into the eye socket like the inside of my eye started to hurt and gradually the headache went away but it turned into this really awful burning sensation that was happening to the right side of my face it was kind of a feeling when you get severely sunburned and your skin is just constantly burning it was that kind of feeling where I felt like somehow my skin was damaged and it was just burning all the time I was having trouble sleeping and then I went to see a few more doctors and they did some checks and tests and they couldn't figure out eventually they suspected it might be related to the covet vaccine but they couldn't be sure because there weren't enough other cases or people with similar symptoms but then um I read online somewhere that the vaccine damages the myelin sheath so if you think of a cable that's the easiest example I can give you the metal bits are inside these rubber tubes to keep them away from each other and also so if someone touches it from the outside they don't get electrocuted similarly the nerves inside our body they have the nerve itself and it's covered by a myelin sheath so the electricity that's flowing inside the nerve doesn't isn't impacted by the touch or transmission across there is a nerve called the trigeminal nerve that comes out from behind or rather above the ear and it goes into this direction on the side of the face from both sides and I believe along with the several doctors I spoke to and we had extensive discussions about this that perhaps the vaccine damaged the myelin sheath of my nerve and now the nerve was irritated somehow and sending the messages to my brain saying there was something burning but it wasn't anyhow they put me on anti-epileptic medication which basically is designed to reduce the firing of the nervous system down to a very low amount so uh because epilepsy is created by extensive firing of the nerves so I was on that for about six months I had to take one tablet at night every day and as soon as I took it it would make me feel very drowsy and I would sleep and it would make me feel really relaxed and flaccid so even when we're asleep and we're resting our body has what's called a basal tone where the muscles still have a little bit of um strength or tension in them but after that medication my muscles were so relaxed at night that I started to snore I never snowed normally unless I'm really drunk and it was like I would wake up in the middle of the night because I could hear myself snoring and it was because my mouth would open everything was just so relaxed it also made me extremely hungry all the time I was sleeping eating a lot and gaining weight so I gained a lot of weight and I made another video about that but um as a result of this weight and the whole sleeping issues I decided to come off it so I spoke to the doctor and I asked them to help me taper it down and I can come off it so I stopped taking the medication and now I still have those flashes of pain or burning sensation that comes so once or twice a day I will get this like a spark that's like burning here and then I'll touch it and there's nothing there and then I'll get like a spark of something burning here or here it just comes and goes so I think there's still something wrong with the nerve that was damaged and it's slowly healing and the parts that are not fully healed they sometimes send that wild message and when I went for my third booster they told me they're not giving me AstraZeneca and they gave me moderna because they said it's better to have a different brand for the third one because it kind of mixes it up and improves your immunity so there's a website if you don't know that's been created to report any issues you may have or side effects so then they can collate that information and fix those issues or address those issues in the future vaccines so if you're experiencing any of those I would highly encourage you to go and look at that and a report I did as well um but yeah I thought I should share with you something serious that happened um because the last one the video I made I'll link it up here but uh that was a complete joke and um kind of cry wolf came and got me so thanks for watching and until the next one

#MegynKellyShow #MegynKelly #News #Politics",2021-07-26,311517,5625,1705,UCzJXNzqz6VMHSNInQt_7q6w, [Music] it's it's the we're only as strong as our weakest link policy right we have to find the most fearful american out there and then everyone must behave accordingly to make that person feel a little bit better about walking around it's like well that's that's just not how america works and we did our part you know we did we wore the mask we did the national shutdown which now i mean in retrospect looks deeply problematic as a policy choice and we're we refuse to learn we're we're going to do it again you know you look at just in new york city you've got de blasio saying um that he thinks we need employers to mandate the kovi coveted vaccine for all of their employees meanwhile he can't even do that at the city level because the unions won't agree so he can't even manage to make it happen at the city okay but he wants all the employers to do that the biden officials are now saying that they expect vulnerable americans to to get booster shots of the coveted vaccine which is also questionable about whether they need that um and all it's all boils down to republicans why won't republicans get the vaccines completely ignoring the fact that you've got black and latino americans who continue to lag behind whites when it comes to vaccinations there's there's a hesitancy within the communities and we're not allowed to talk about that at all it's all the evil trump supporters who are ruining the recovery for everyone yeah that's exactly right i mean the part that drives me nuts on sort of a personal level is there were two articles last week that both had to be corrected both of which were sort of listing the the republicans who had switched over the vaccine because there has been sort of this newfound enthusiasm for vaccination among some members of sort of the openly political right and people were listing me in there and i was like well no i've been recommending vaccinations since literally before covet existed i'm very very big on i can back you up on that as a listener to your show yeah exactly i've been pushing vaccination since the day that this was available i've been vaccinated my wife has been vaccinated my parents have been vaccinated but the the assumption from the left is that if something is bad in the country it must be those evil people who are on the other side of the aisle it couldn't possibly be people on my own side of the aisle or by the way it couldn't be people who have serious doubts about the institutional credibility of the folks who are talking to them it's amazing to me to see the biden administration continue to try out anthony fauci we've been wrong six ways from sunday as the face of the coveted outreach plan i mean he has switched on every major topic in this pandemic from whether schools should be open to other masks are necessary to whether after you're vaccinated you should have masks or not to by the way whether there was american funding for coveted research in wuhan right he's switched on like all of these particular areas and yet they're saying that if you have doubts about any of these institutional players that that's your fault that that's that that's your problem it seems like a power game not like an actual attempt this is what i'm really noticing i'm noticing that there's an overt viciousness with the way that people are talking about people on the right who are back who are unvaccinated that doesn't apply to people on the left and the overt viciousness is not designed to get those people to vaccinate it's not designed to get those people to make a different risk-reward calculation if you want to convince somebody to actually get vaccinated what you say is look here are the statistical risks risks to you if you're 25 years old right not particularly high you have a shot like one in a thousand people who get it when you're 25 years old are going to die of covet the risks of you getting a serious side effect from the vaccine by all available data are much much lower than the one in 1 000. so just by risk reward you probably should get the vaccine right instead of saying that and then saying that you're a free individual you might regret it if you get sick and you get the vaccine but that's up to you instead of doing that it's you're a bad person you're terrible you don't care about grandma you don't care about like none of that is designed to actually elicit a response where people get a vaccine that is designed to create a dichotomy between the people who are good the elect and the people who are not good the unelect and i'm seeing it wherever i go i feel like i'm vaccinated too and i believe in the vaccines and i hope people get them but i don't believe in shaming the people who have chosen not to do it and i'm getting a little uncomfortable with this this division between those who have gotten it and believe in it and those who just feel hesitant about it as if they're bad people i mean especially those who have had covet yes and then refuse to get the vaccine they have natural immunity i don't know why we went from accepting that as you know we used to understand that if you had coveted you didn't need a vaccine and to switching over to you still must get the vaccine and if you don't get the vaccine you're running around as you know sort of this purveyor of a deadly deadly virus in a reckless reckless way it's not true yeah by the way the data tend to support the notion that natural immunity may be actually much more durable than vaccine-driven immunity there's some data from israel that have supported that idea so listen again i'm i'm i think that a few things can be true at once one i think the vaccines work i think that it is a good idea to get them particularly if you are above the age of 21 or above the age of 18. i don't know about the data between 12 and 18. i just know that the risk of death 12 to 18 is very very low i also understand that individual human beings are going to make different decisions i also understand that there was no world in which we went to zero covet and if you understand those three things what you end up with is everybody's got to make a decision on their own thank god we have these vaccines because the math would be different if we did not right if we didn't have the vaccines then the math becomes slightly different because then probably what we'd be talking about is what we were talking about last summer do we trans people who are less vulnerable back into the workforce more easily but with the vaccine available you now have the ability to protect yourself so why are you trying to push somebody else in ways that they are uncomfortable with or they don't want to do into getting the vaccine when again that is their call

How Covid Vaccine Hesitancy Impacts Herd Immunity",2021-10-21,315915,1233,6227,UCeY0bbntWzzVIaj2z3QigXg, covid-19 vaccines can help save lives but many people are still hesitant to get that job take a look at this map 57.1 percent of the U.S population is fully vaccinated now when looking at just people over the age of 18 that number becomes approximately 69 now while it's great that more than half of the US population is fully vaccinated vaccine hesitancy is slowing down our chances of reaching herd immunity and returning to some kind of normalcy Dr Melanie cornedis an epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing joins us now to discuss all things vaccine good morning doctor so just first tell us where does vaccine hesitancy come from and we're saying hesitancy not anti-vax because a lot of people who are hesitant about this vaccine have received plenty of other vaccines throughout their lives vaccinated their children but now they're hesitant about this one walk us through that uh good morning thank you for having me that's absolutely correct um vaccine hesitancy is the right way to phrase it because it's a behavior and many people out there have concerns that are specific to the covet vaccine and they may have accepted other vaccines in the past vaccine hesitancy isn't new it's actually been around for a long time as far back as the smallpox vaccine and it comes from a place of concern about most often side effects of the vaccine so we've been seeing concerns about vaccines whenever they come out when they're new such as with the HPV vaccine or the chickenpox vaccine that it's too new that there's a concern about long-term side effects that it hasn't been tested and that's exactly what we're seeing with the covid vaccine as well and Dr Cornelius you've done a lot of research on this what impact do you think misinformation has had on vaccine acceptance or fueling this hesitancy or reluctance unfortunately it's had a huge impact on fueling vaccine hesitancy so there's a lot of misinformation that's circulating out there and it's all sort of driving this concern around safety and side effects we've been seeing a lot of the same things that we saw with other vaccines this concern over long-term side effects the concern that we don't know what's going to happen and it's driving people to want to wait and see to see what's going to happen to hold off and to see you know let's wait and see what's coming down the road it's also this sort of concerns over misinformation that we've seen such as around fertility or around other sort of uh different things that we've seen on social media so I think that that is causing people to be reluctant to get the vaccine um absolutely now I think something important to note here especially as we're talking about boosters and needing you know another shot is that getting vaccinated does not make you completely bulletproof you know there are still these breakthrough cases so walk us through why people should still get vaccinated even though they're hearing hey people got the shot they're still getting coveted or people got the shot now they need another shot tell us what it does even if it means you might get a breakthrough case and why it's important actually that's a great question and what we know is that getting vaccinated protects you against all forms of covet so in the beginning it protects you against mild moderate and severe covet um and then after about depending on which shot you get from three to five months it protects you continuously against moderate to severe copen so if you do get a breakthrough case if you're vaccinated you're you're highly unlikely to get moderate to severe copage you're not going to end up in the hospital you're not going to die from coping um so that's a great reason to get vaccinated you're also less likely to get sick and to transmit the virus to others and then you're going to have a shorter case of covet so that's a great reason to get vaccinated because you don't want to transmit the virus to others and you're not going to have such a severe case absolutely Dr cornetis thank you so much for sharing your expertise and having this important conversation with us that we will keep having good to see you thanks for watching our YouTube channel follow today's top stories and breaking news by downloading the NBC News app

The Challenge Of Shipping A Covid Vaccine At Sub-Freezing Temperatures | NBC News NOW",2020-12-04,23636,380,150,UCeY0bbntWzzVIaj2z3QigXg, a kovic 19 vaccine is being developed in record time and now the u.s is getting ready for another history-making moment one of the largest vaccination efforts it's ever attempted pfizer confirming this week it has already started moving its vaccine to distribution centers in the u.s but a major challenge that company faces transporting and storing its vaccine at an extremely low temperature this is a very complicated process in terms of getting it to the point in which it gets into someone's arm we understand that these temperatures are different than what we've seen in the past we're hauling in some cases deep frozen type temperatures minus 70 degrees celsius and that's something that the distribution channel has not seen train technologies thermal king in bloomington minnesota specializes in refrigerated transport the company's trucks were used as temporary morgues during the covet surge in new york city this past spring they confirmed their vehicles will also be used by several companies distributing the vaccine just to be clear this is not the pfizer cooler this is however a cooler from a manufacturer that builds your typical pharmaceutical coolers we've been reaching out to these manufacturers to help us understand what these solutions look like and so we can get a better handle on how our product can work in conjunction with this type of product to extend the dry ice life engineering manager bruce kranz said their trucks could double the life of the dry ice inside this box you have what's called the payload box that's what this is right here and the vials would go in in their own containers and then those containers would get loaded into this payload box so one of the challenges here is if you have to re-ice this the potential of damaging this box dropping it or leaving it out too long if delivery is delayed the dry ice might have to be replenished and that's not a simple task they have a rather tight seal on the lid i'm going to set that aside we're going to remove the payload box so that we can get part of the charge of dry ice into the bottom of the payload box you could transfer this by gloved hand you can get a scooper i'm going to pour some of this into the bottom in a normal process it would be a little more process centric where maybe the ice is weighed out and you have scoops to load it then you load back the payload box like i said this one's instrument and so it's a little more difficult to work with it's not easy to maintain minus 70 c minus 80 c once you're outside the dry ice the temperature starts to go up rather quick so time is of the essence once this lid is off to make things even more complicated each payload box requires a lot of dry ice more than two hundred thousand pounds for the first 6.4 million doses what i can tell you about getting 300 pounds of dry ice is the first two companies i contacted were taking no new business the third company was willing to work with me but could only supply me with slab or block dry ice and what's required here is pelletized dry ice so the pelletized dry ice will turn from a solid to a vapor much quicker than the slab type dry ice therefore you have to get closer to the the manufacture of the dry ice to actually have a reliable supply of the pelletized form which is what's recommended to be loaded into these boxes thermal king vp of cells dwayne cowan shows us how they track the trucks as you can see right here this load is at minus 15 degrees fahrenheit and that's very important because we want to understand exactly what's going on with that load with limited supply of the vaccine no one wants to risk it becoming unusable so frozen trucking just one of the complicated steps in the process of getting you a safe and effective coveted vaccine

New York City To Require Covid Vaccine For All Private Sector Workers",2021-12-06,143908,1327,3170,UCaXkIU1QidjPwiAYu6GcHjg, since the omicron variant was detected 17 states have had confirmed cases at least 10 of which are in the new york new jersey connecticut tri-state area at least one case was detected in a person who had just went to a convention at new york city's javits center an event attended by more than 50 000 people that's not good joining us now the mayor of new york uh new york city bill de blasio and bill you are revealing right now new measures to keep covet infection cases down what are they yeah mika look we just talked about an attack on democracy while we're under attack a different way right now from the coronavirus and we've got omicron as a new factor we've got the colder weather which is going to really create additional challenges with a delta variant we've got holiday gatherings we in new york city have decided to use a preemptive strike to really do something bold to stop the further growth of covet and the dangers it's causing to all of us so as of today we're going to announce a first in the nation measure our health commissioner will announce a vaccine mandate for private sector employers across the board all private sector employers in new york city will be covered by this vaccine mandate as of december 27th we're going to have some other measures as well to really focus on maximizing vaccination quickly so we can get ahead of omicron and all the other challenges we're facing right now with covet and uh curious first of all that's anybody and everybody who works in new york city has a vaccine mandate at this point how do you enforce this we're going to work with the business community we've seen a lot of cooperation so far when we have put in place our mandate for example for restaurants indoor entertainment indoor fitness we actually got a lot of cooperation there were a few times where we had to penalize people but it was rare so we're going to put together the rules work with the business community but i'll tell you something the fact that this is universal and this would be my advice to mayors governors ceos all over the country use these vaccine mandates and the more universal they are the more likely employees will say okay it's time i'm gonna do this because you can't jump from one industry to another one company to another it's something that needs to be universal to protect all of us so mr mayor you see here one of the other measures is the requiring vaccination uh for indoor dining fitness entertainment for children too children now have access to the vaccine ages five to eleven i will say i am surprised that more cities have not followed new york city's lead even washington dc does not require to prove your vaccination status to come in for a restaurant but talk a little bit more about the reason behind that but i want to go back to also the mandate for the private sector workers with the the bible administration's efforts to do this are tied up in courts right now a lot of legal challenges do you not anticipate the same will happen here and how confident you can prevail we are confident because it's universal um i don't know all the intricacies of what the biden administration has been through but i do know this our health commissioners put a series of mandates in place they have one in court state court federal court every single time jonathan and it's because they're universal and consistent and they're about protecting the public right now from a clear and present danger our youngest kids we got to reach them now right now in the city it's about 20 percent have gotten vaccinated in that 5 to 11 range it's new the vaccine's relatively new but what we're trying to say to parents is it's urgent before omicron grows before delta continues to stress us even worse in the winter months get your kid vaccinated and here's an incentive to do it a lot of parents of course want to take their kids out to wonderful things that will be happening in the holiday season here's a reminder get your child vaccine just one dose will immediately qualify any child to be able to participate in those activities but look i'm a parent and i remember vividly when my kids were going to school you know you don't end up in a situation where a child is left unprotected i might i urge parents really strongly get that vaccination it's safe it's been proven here's another incentive to do it so it's one dose for children but two now for adults is that right for the program we're going to be phasing in two for adults as of december 27th okay and then secondly just on give us an update on the omicron variant here we know there was at least a couple cases tracked to a convention that was at the javits center uh the governor you and the governor had gave an announcement i think on friday that gave updates of more cases throughout new york city and new york state uh where do things stand up this morning where are you seeing spread how concerned are you about the new variant right now yeah i am very concerned jonathan and we have to assume community spread at this point i mean we'll track the cases we have very strong test and trace apparatus but let's be honest and this is true for new yorkers and all americans at this point omicron's here yeah it looks like it's very transmissible that's just going to make a tough situation even harder i mean the timing is horrible with the winter months so i think this comes down to a recognition we got to put this covetera behind us i mean here's the bottom line for all of us we've been living with this now for most of two years we got to put it behind us and vaccine mandates in my experience are the one thing that really breaks through and we do know this vaccines every single time you know every single time there's a fear the vaccine won't have an impact on a new variant well guess what every single time the vaccines have worked that's a good track record let's lean into it even more wow all right mayor bill de blasio thank you very much and thank you for announcing that right here on morning joe hey thanks so much for watching our youtube channel you can follow up on today's top stories and breaking news or catch up on your favorite msnbc shows all in one place download the nbc news app today

#VICENews #News",2021-03-05,54741,991,851,UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ, facebook time lies every day somebody's burying somebody so for us it is a very real situation we know the coroner scott muhammad has spent much of the last year trying to help people in his neighborhood in tuskegee get information and supplies to fight covet 19 but when it comes to stopping the spread there is one thing he won't do i don't have evidence that the vaccine is going to save me i don't have that evidence there is a lot of pressure on people to take the vaccine you got to ask yourself why you know well we want to end the pandemic you just said so many people are dying in this community but that's under question we have to see what the long-term effects of the vaccine are going to be nationwide black people are two times more likely than white people to die from covid but a poll at the end of 2020 found that one-third of black adults say they probably would not or definitely would not take the vaccine people are now using words like disparities right okay well these disparities are the reason why we're dying in these numbers but nobody's trying to address the disparities they're just telling you take the vaccine it'll be all right what it sounds like i'm hearing you say is the systemic racism needs to be addressed first but covet needs to be addressed now so what do you think about that so you're going to make kovitz shut up and then what then you back to square one your grandmama got sugar your grandmama got diabetes and high blood pressure and heart disease covert had getting laughed people have issues that preceded the pandemic and they're going to be here when they say everybody's vaccinated no i i do not trust the vaccine this is the site of the infamous tuskegee syphilis study that started in the 30s and lasted 40 years and even today people cite the study as the reason why they don't trust the cova vaccine in 1932 the tuskegee institute in the organization that later became known as the cdc recruited 600 black men to study the effects of syphilis on the body only the men had no idea they were told they were being treated for quote bad blood and were deprived of an effective treatment many of the men spread the disease to their families hundreds of them died the tuskegee institute is now tuskegee university where dr steven showdeke began teaching bioethics in 1983. can you talk about how that study has impacted this community um and how they feel about the healthcare system yeah of course this is this suspicion that here we go again okay the suspicion is legitimate i mean if anybody was put in that position you'll be suspicious too i think that we need to treat one another with enough compassion to listen to people understand their concerns well that's the tough part right because like you said this community has reason to be skeptical yeah these whole things didn't happen yesterday so it's going to take time right if i have to choose between dying and suffering because of coffee and letting my if we get the rest of me i will choose to kill the boxing one of the ways state health officials are trying to address concerns is by asking black doctors academics and community leaders to act as liaisons it is my privilege today to be here in person with my mentor and colleague public health officials tell us that the idea of using vaccination to protect us from further spread of the virus and prevent continual suffering and deaths only works if everyone gets vaccinated even if all black americans were down to take the vaccine there's no guarantee they could get it the race of recipients is only recorded about half the time but the cdc reported that only about seven percent of vaccines have gone to black people access is particularly difficult in rural places like tuskegee and surrounding macon county which only has four inoculation sites we want to remind our citizens to continue to wash up mask up stay up and listen up so you can mitigate with us the covet 19 situation in our county frankly is in charge of making county's emergency management agency one of his jobs during the pandemic is to spread information about the vaccine every morning he calls into a popular local radio station to give updates 1785 cases it's very strong base of listening a lot of people call in and it's just a typical southern gospel format that's very very very productive as far as us getting the message out can you talk about what the access to the vaccine has been like in those difficulties in a rural area we have experienced medical challenges for the last 65 or 70 years and this has only increased the need for providing those services without a hospital in our county we are hampered because uh hospitals get the most dosages we don't have a hospital so we have not one hospital not one hospital we have clinics so are you planning on taking the vaccine let me answer that question this way i personally don't want to give my personal opinion about it and the reason that i don't want to do that because a lot of people listen a lot of people have faith in the information i provide and i don't want to persuade i don't want to encourage i don't want to discourage it i don't have enough information to personally feel in my own heart to tell people it's good or bad so as head of emergency management you know isn't that is that part of your job to have the information about this vaccine at this point to give an honest judgment i have information i've researched it i don't feel i have enough of it some emergency managers may feel that they must say this or say that but i'm not compelled to that uh i have the only answer to my god and i don't have any political pressure that says that i have to make a decision so these are the names of the 600 participants that were part of the syphilis study all of them which were black males and the fact that they created this exhibit in the heart of the city just shows the impact that that study had on this community we just came from the multicultural center where they have have you been there yeah museum yes yes i had some pictures of my uh grandfather i took a picture of his name on the floor his name was willie fitzpatrick was in the study he was in the control he did not have systems thurling williams is a member of the voices of our father's legacy foundation a group of descendants of the men in the tuskegee study he passed away in 1957 i think i was about 8 years old but i remember him we used to call him papa he was a farmer he had cows he planted gardens food cotton corn he was a good man and you could often see him outside sitting uh underneath the shade tree that grew up in the yard cutting the men hat in the community he was just a family man we were down my mom's house on christmas and my mom didn't work she was a half wife and she had bought all of us guests and i said dear where you getting money from maybe buying those gifts like this she said lena that's my dad's name got some money from some kind of study that papa was in he's gone so they divided it among his children so once you learned about the details of the study what was your initial reaction learning about that as an adult i wasn't pleased with it because those people died not knowing what some of them not knowing what happened what was happening to them they never knew like papa never knew the family members who were with us in tuskegee on behalf of the american people what the united states government did was shameful and i am sorry [Music] my sister and i wrote that we had to do a write-up really fitzpatrick was born in 1908 he married sophia eccles eckles and they had nine children they lived in cotton valley community in tuskegee alabama in a small two-bedroom house the hallway straight through the middle really popeye as we called him like you mentioned was a very quiet and hard-working man who farmed and raised just about all the food needed to feed his family and to share with the community it's great that you guys do this because you're humanizing them you know like you said these were actual people with families let the people know that these were our family members and they were somebody they want just nothing we have been hearing so many people that aren't even from this area that will reference the study and say that's why they don't want a vaccine but here you are a descendant of one of the people that were in the study yeah what would you say to those people those people didn't know those people were not educated like most of the people are now and you chose you chose to do it yes i did i chose to take the shot okay so today you will begin the madonna vaccine this is a two dose vaccine you've already had your first dose so this is your last dose for that all right it's gonna be a stick okay take the shot it's not gonna hurt you it's a big difference between the syphilis study what happened there and the covet night team take it because you know about it you can research and read about it talk to doctors about it really say the people that might read the information they have the information but they just don't trust it then it comes to prayer you shouldn't have got to pray to him you

402,_LKITdRDppY,"MYOCARDITIS STUDY: New Research Tracks Covid Vaccine &amp; Disease In Kids, David Zweig Analyzes","Journalist David Zweig weighs in on a new paper on Covid-19 vaccines. Originally aired May 23, 2023; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hwncDw-XPI #pandemic #vax 

According to the CDC, all COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States are effective at preventing COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can offer some protection from future illness, sometimes called “natural immunity,” but the level of protection people get from having COVID-19 may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age.  Getting a COVID-19 vaccination is also a safer way to build protection than getting sick with COVID-19. 

COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without you having to experience sickness. Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can cause severe illness or death, and we can’t reliably predict who will have mild or severe illness. If you get sick, you can spread COVID-19 to others. You can also continue to have long-term health issues after COVID-19 infection. 

 While COVID-19 vaccines are effective, studies have shown some declines in vaccine effectiveness against infections over time, especially when the Delta variant was circulating widely.  The mRNA vaccines do not contain any live virus. Instead, they work by teaching our cells to make a harmless piece of a “spike protein,” which is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. After making the protein piece, cells display it on their surface. Our immune system then recognizes that it does not belong there and responds to get rid of it. When an immune response begins, antibodies are produced, creating the same response that happens in a natural infection.  In contrast to mRNA vaccines, many other vaccines use a piece of, or weakened version of, the germ that the vaccine protects against. This is how the measles and flu vaccines work. When a weakened or small part of the virus is introduced to your body, you make antibodies to help protect against future infection.

While COVID-19 vaccines are effective, studies have shown some declines in vaccine effectiveness against infections over time, especially when the Delta variant was circulating widely. According to the CDC layered prevention strategies — like staying up to date on vaccines and wearing masks — can help prevent severe illness and reduce the potential for strain on the healthcare system. Wear a mask with the best fit, protection, and comfort for you.  

If you are in an area with a high COVID-19 Community Level and are ages 2 or older, wear a well-fitting mask indoors in public.  

If you are sick and need to be around others, or are caring for someone who has COVID-19, wear a mask. 

 If you are at increased risk for severe illness, or live with or spend time with someone at higher risk, speak to your healthcare provider about wearing a mask at medium COVID-19 Community Levels. 

In April 2021, increased cases of myocarditis and pericarditis were reported in the United States after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna). Data from multiple studies show a rare risk for myocarditis and/or pericarditis following receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. These rare cases of myocarditis or pericarditis have occurred most frequently in adolescent and young adult males, ages 16 years and older, within 7 days after receiving the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna). There has not been a similar reporting pattern observed after receipt of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (Johnson & Johnson). CDC continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination for everyone 6 months of age and older. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and CDC have determined that the benefits (such as prevention of COVID-19 cases and its severe outcomes) outweigh the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis after receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. For more info: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19...",2023-05-27,61606,1548,574,UCPWXiRWZ29zrxPFIQT7eHSA, [Music] journalist and Twitter files author David zweig shared yesterday that a new Journal of American Medicine paper on coveted vaccines for children finds a safety signal for Perry or mitochonditis in 12 to 17 year olds buried in the text zweig says he calculated 93 of the studies confirmed samples are male yet the rate for young males is not in the table abstract or anywhere else he's asking why they might obscure data for the relevant cohort so I also included a tweet from New York Times contributor Benjamin Ryan about the report and he said a study of safety outcomes after the coveted vaccine for youths 5 to 17 years old found that myocarditis and pericarditis were the only safety concern out of 20 analyzed occurring in 39 cases per million doses within seven days and only in 12 to 17 year olds David swag joins us now to elaborate on what he's noticed in this data thank you for joining us thank you thanks for having me again so what do you think is the is the relevance here you're saying a a parsing of the data that you'd like to see was partly obscured because it was not broken down by by sex although 93 percent were male so do you think there would be more illustrative breakdown if it was just the mail even though most of them were male right yeah so the reason this caught my eye is this particular study I don't think came out with anything um particularly revelatory um most of the findings at a quick glance um Echo with what we've seen regarding myocarditis and pericarditis um incidents following vaccine in in young people so it's not that the results themselves were were you know some sort of uh bombshell there's been you know a dozen if not several dozen studies um that have come out in the last couple years on this but what did jump out at me was the fact that the sort of Top Line finding was don't worry here the rates it's very rare and they cite the rate for uh for five to 17 year olds in general um and there were two things that were strange about the way they worded that they say here um it should be noted that myocarditis or pericarditis is a rare event with an average incidence of 39.4 cases per million doses administered in children 5 to 17 years now here's the interesting thing in the same study they tell you that the in the age bracket where it really only mattered were 12 to 17 year olds so the first question is why would they have a Top Line finding where they talk about the rate from 5 to 17 when we know the real group are worried about that according to their own data we're 12 to 17 year olds that's number one and then number two why are they talking about males and females together when we know that almost all the cases were in young males according to their data in their own study and that's and we can get into this but this is a pattern that I've seen over the last several years um in regarding a bunch of topics but in particular related to myocarditis incidents following vaccination because because really just to follow up honestly even from like a pro vax perspective I get like I guess you could look at that and say that their their Top Line finding is misstating a little bit uh if it's if it's not leading with the fact that these were all uh these were overwhelmingly male subjects they could actually be disguising how safe it is for female subjects or that they just don't have relevant data on that given that it was mostly males right I think that's a really good point or it's like so if you have one group that that's you know the vast majority of these um Adverse Events um and then you're bundling it together that does two things the one I'm most worried about is obscuring a higher incidence for one particular group but as you noted but that also does is it artificially inflates the incidents for the other groups who are at lower risk um so there's really two things that are happening and this has happened repeatedly one of the things that I wrote about a couple years ago um Rachelle wolenski the CDC director had mentioned this was when the the um myocarditis really started getting into the news more and she did a press conference and said don't worry look it's like 30 to 40 incidences per million um and you know it's mostly self-limiting don't worry but what she didn't say was she bundled everyone together the rate for young males was more than double um that instance in the CDC Zone data that they presented at at a um at one of their advisory meetings I'm shortly before wilinski's statement so there's this pattern and and this study that did it again is is not the only one whether it's from the studies themselves or whether it's from the CDC director where they continue to not specifically mentioned young males and in particular age bracket and instead you take that and then just bundle them I've seen studies where they included from 12 year olds up to 34 or 39 year olds again this is against the sort of basic principles of epidemiology and really against common sense you don't need to be a public health expert to sort of see why this would be problematic when you continue to present the data in this manner yeah I mean I I guess I just want to be really clear about what the top lines of this really are they looked at 39 sorry they looked at 20 different kinds of potential risk factors ailment side effects out of those 20 there were only two with these uh so-called safety signals meaning an unexplained correlation between the treatment and this bad outcome that that seemed to show up which were myocardial carditis and pericarditis these like inflammation of the heart and that the incidence of those things occurring among the people studied was 39 cases per 1 million doses so the argument here now and moreover you're saying that because they are lumping in males and females and we know that myocarditis the incidence of myocarditis from other studies is higher in young men that it is obscuring that the number could be you just mentioned in another study twice as high as it might otherwise be but in this particular study 93 of the people in the sample are already male so at best you would have a seven percent increase in what the number the incidence rate is going to look like if they were all male assuming that there's none basically zero in women and it's all in men or girls and boys and so what we are we focusing on here is that instead of say 39 cases out of a million of myocarditis there might be 43 cases out of a million of myocarditis and that this is you know I think some people might be asking is that really so significant statistically significant that it is evidence of an intent to mislead as opposed to an attempt by the researchers in the first instance to basically focus on men or boys because they know to your point the boys are the people that are most affected by this particular disease I think you're a little confused about the data in the study the the study was of males and females and I believe they were roughly uh equal in their um in the representation in in the participant pool um that they included um but of the cases of myocarditis I'm looking at at the study here 25 of 20 of the 27 they they did have which which is smart they did a sort of um chart review where they kicked out actually a bunch of cases so that the rate of myocarditis was higher they did a more stringent um process where they um threw out a bunch of them so of the sample cases that they looked at um like 93 of them were males do you understand so it's it's actually it's not the way you were presenting it it's it's almost all of the cases were males even though the entire pool that they were looking at were males and females again the findings here are not particularly revelatory the thing that's interesting is so let's do a hypothetical imagine there's a treatment or a um a vaccine or or a medicine that affects one particular group more than other groups and sometimes this happens for any number of reasons so imagine it's um women of color have an incidence rate that's double or triple that of the general population and the study comes out and they say great news the incident is one in a hundred thousand um for whatever the thing is you know we looked at the study you know we looked at the population this is fine I suspect people would be find it problematic that they didn't say but wait the incidence for um women of color is actually four times that do you understand what I'm saying and this is something that happens about your Tweet though David you tweeted buried in the text I calculated 93 of confirmed sample are male what did you mean by that does that mean that 93 of the people study in the study sampled or not either no 93 of the um of the confirmed cases this is after they threw out um a bunch of cases 93 of them were male almost all of the K of the incidents of myocarditis in this age group were in young males so is that not a disclosure of the exactly the kind of reporting that you'd like that this is something that is overrepresented in men or boys and that people who are looking to vaccinate their young male children should have more concerns about than if they have young female children right so the the thing is this is I'm looking this is buried way way down in paragraph you know 15 or something in there and what I'm saying to me uh it that should be in the abstract which is you know runs at the top that should be in the conclusion here's the group we're concerned about this is we know that this particular cohort of people young males for for any number of reasons they are the ones who are most affected um by this adverse event related to the vaccine and it that the only mention of that where it's sort of sliced out is you know buried in the text and you know way way down in paragraph whatever um typically in a study what you would like to see researchers do is in the abstract itself and in the conclusion they're going to highlight the most important finding for what group are we concerned about the great news about this study which again is not new is that look it looks like these by and large are very safe they didn't find a signal in any number of other Adverse Events that's great news um to me what's interesting is you have something there is a particular group we're worried about and once again the information related to this particular group what we want to know wasn't that should be in the title practically or at least should be in the abstract in my view and from talking with epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists that is typically what you want to do if you actually have the granular data on a particular cohort who are most affected by some whether it's for vaccines or a medication or something else that's the the thing that you really want to highlight and as I mentioned you know the example from from Rochelle walensky you know it was a similar thing where she said oh it's 30 to 40 cases um but but you know but she didn't but she grouped everyone together so this to me what the reason I tweeted about it is again this fits in a pattern that we've seen um repeatedly about sort of bundling one the the data from one particular group and grouping it either with both sexes or grouping it with a larger age bracket um and so much so that it's not just in the studies but you have the CD CC director grouping things in this manner and like I said if you can imagine a different cohort a different group whether it's women or certain minority groups or whomever it is we're this same type of thing was happening it's I think people will be very upset about it hmm David thank you so much for joining us we really appreciate it thanks for having me [Music] foreign [Music]

Turkey to start production",2020-11-11,157342,5592,2123,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg, welcome indeed to this video and i want to do a bit of an update on vaccines and where we are with different vaccine candidates and it's looking very promising because the fires are bioend tech vaccine basically illustrated the point of principle that it is possible to make an efficacious vaccine against this virus and i'm sure that many others are going to follow as we're going to look out firstly though today just briefly i've had the torrent of emails and complaints about yesterday's video which looked at the effects of hydroxychloroquine on patients that had been diagnosed for about a week in hospital patients that were already poorly and rightly so many of you have pointed out that that said this says nothing about the use of hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic agent it says nothing about the use of hydroxychloroquine at very early stages because the patients we were looking at were already hospitalized were already poorly already had acute respiratory distress syndrome so you're quite right the study simply doesn't address that and for some of you who say that the study in yesterday's video completely missed the point i take that point entirely it says nothing the study you looked at yesterday says a lot about patients that already sick from that you're right we can't generalize it and this is an area where knowledge is still lacking hydroxychloric as a prophylaxis or in the very early stages of infection yesterday study simply doesn't comment so we're no further forward on that so i fully take that point uh now going on to the vaccine now the the fire is a bioentech vaccine that so far used the vaccine on the sample size of 43 000 people including the placebo just over 43 000 people and 94 people who have been infected and 90 of those were in the placebo group indicating the vaccine is 90 percent effective now pfizer bioentech obviously are pretty pleased with themselves that there's the first vaccine to demonstrate efficacy but basically um there's several other vaccines at the same late phase three clinical trial and if you want to look at it like this the fibers of bioentech one was actually a bit lucky in that 94 people in their sample got infected because basically what you do is you vaccinate a load of people with a vaccine you give another load the control group a placebo and then you just wait to see who gets infected these people are not deliberately infected they are not inoculated with an inoculum dose of the virus they're just told to carry on living their lives as normal so from the point of view of the vaccine trial organizers they were lucky that 94 people caught the infection and that was able to give them some significant data so they've been a bit lucky it's good they've got lots of good publicity it's fine they deserve it there's a lot of hard work gone into it they weren't actually officially funded they weren't part of the operation warp speed so uh but they got money from other places obviously but uh so basically it's not that this vaccine is better than the others they got there first because most people got sick uh got the infection who happened to be in their group so they were somewhat fortunate it could have been another vaccine got lots of people getting sick in their group so the others are basically just waiting for people to get infected it's a funny way to look at it but it's the case anyway not to take anything away from them um messenger rna vaccine so what these vaccines do as you probably know now is you give some of the rna that codes for the size corona virus ii that gets into cells in the body and it kind of hijacks the cells protein-making machinery and the rna that codes for part of the virus that part of the viral protein is is actually made by the cell excreted not excreted but moved to the outside of the cell where it's detected by the body's immune system who learn the body's immune system then learns to recognize that particular molecular shape and of course that molecular shape is part of the sars corona virus too so that's how the immunity is developed first time it's ever been done all really quite impressive actually um so 94 people infected so far therefore because it was 90 defective now we do know from phase 2 trials that it gives antibodies and t cells and we've talked about this my personal view is that the immunity could last for quite some time it's reported to have mostly moderate to mild side effects now all vaccines have side effects to some extent and so the fact that they're moderate to mild sounds like the side effect profile could well be acceptable now we have to differentiate between side effects and complications two completely different things quite normal to get some side effects that's not the same as a complication so side effects yeah you know after a vaccine you might feel a bit knocked off for a couple of days that can happen although i had my flu vac last year and i felt fine straight away but you know it just it just but it can it's normal saw a ramen feeling under the weather for a couple of days after a vaccine is normal as the body amounts an immunological response to that vaccine now the rna the ribonucleic acid that this vaccine is made or falls apart at normal temperatures now i must apologize in my last video on this i said minus 18 degrees centigrade that was wrong this vaccine needs to be stored at minus 80 degrees celsius or centigrade which is minus 112 degrees fahrenheit very very cold now the manufacturers are making special boxes to transfer it in and in sophisticated countries like the uk or the us there is an infrastructure there that can facilitate this it's not easy but it can be done so i imagine it's going to be transported in dry ice which is liquid carbon dioxide and liquid not not liquid carbon dioxide what we're talking about solid carbon dioxide i don't think there's such a thing as liquid carbon dioxide because what the dry ice does the reason it's dry is it sublimates it goes straight from being a solid to being a a gas at minus 78 degrees celsius so we could pack it in dry ice that could kind of work i think that's probably how it's going to be done now what is going to be the next vaccine well it depends it depends how many people get the infection in the experimental group and the placebo group for the uh the vaccine that's being trialled my money's on the astrozenica oxford one has probably been the next one made from a chimp adenovirus adapted to express sars coronavirus to proteins but not cause sarcoidosis infection this has had a shed load of money the us has given 1.2 billion dollars for 300 million doses the european union has given a similar amount of money for 400 million doses and uh it's being studied in india and being produced in india as we speak so up and running at india's uh serum institute and they apparently the combined manufacturing capacity for this vaccine is two billion doses for next year for the oxford astrozenica vaccine this is an impressive level of production so um trials should report next month they're just waiting for people to get the infection so they can find out or they would hope to find out that many more people got the infection in the placebo group and far fewer people got the infection in the group that are actually injected with the active vaccine so basically the hoping for people in the placebo group to get the to get infected is really what what this amounts to um but the point is the people in the placebo group and the people in the vaccinated group in theory because it's a wrap well in practice because it's a randomized sample they've got the same chances of catching the virus so this is what a clinical trial is um now next could well be the moderner um modern national institute of health from the united states of vaccine another mra vaccine to produce viral proteins in the body as we've said uh providing uh so already already they've been provided with rather provided with nearly a billion dollars in support there's a lot of money thrown at it um october they finished recruiting 30 000 people including people of different ages which is very important and one of the encouraging things so far is that these covered 19 south carolina virus two vaccines do seem to be generating a good immunological response in the older age group flu vaccine was terrible at this they had to add an adjunct into it to try to try and make it do that so this is encouraging that it seems to produce an immune response in in all age groups emergency youth authorization by the end of 2020 is expected for the modern nih vaccine and the us have pre-ordered uh 100 million doses and uh canada japan qatar have also ordered huge amounts of vaccine so that could well be the next one and shortly after i'm predicting the johnson and johnson this is an adino virus so adenoviruses common type of viruses often cause common cold type features um but uh one that's been modified to produce sars coronavirus two proteins that the immune system will recognize as being foreign therefore amount an immune response against against hopefully a antibody response and a memory t cell response as well and we believe that is we believe that is the case at the moment so the johnson johnson could well be next again it just depends who gets infected in their samples this is based on a technology that was developed for an ebola vaccine a bowler vaccine is named after the ebola river where the disease ebola was first discovered interesting to note that that was named after the geographical location where the virus was first discovered um us funding getting on for half a billion pretty good u.s has ordered 1 billion paid 1 billion for 100 million doses you see the way that rich countries are just buying up options on all the different vaccines so whatever whatever horse wins this race they're gonna get that and they're gonna get that vaccine they're gonna end up with several i think these are all promising um european unions ordered 200 million doses phase three was launched in september 60 000 people being recruited now the advantage of this is a single dose vaccine and again results in december so you wait for a bus and none comes for 10 months and then four come all at the same time so they are all very promising pfizer uh bayern tech everybody there well we're just waiting for regulatory approval being applied for now but pretty soon we're going to have the johnson and johnson and the um the national institute of health one as well the modern uh modern ni national institutes of health vaccine as well so what we'll be able to do is once these vaccines start being used work out which is best for which age groups then people can be given a vaccine which is most specific to them we're going to be awash with vaccines in the next few months in developed countries i just hope that the the excess purchases that we've made that we're probably not going to need because we'll have way way more than we need are going to be distributed distributed and manufactured hopefully manufactured globally because this isn't over for any of us that it's over for all of us now i'm not sure what this means i don't think anyone knows at the moment but brazil has just halted the phase three trial of a chinese vaccine serious adverse incident reaction to a participant on the 29th of october don't know what happened to him word is he died or she died now if you've got a large number of people it's quite possible that people get sick or even die after being vaccinated doesn't mean it's caused by the vaccine but the brazilian authorities are sufficiently concerned to at least pause the trial it's happened before with other vaccines might not mean anything we simply don't know yet but we do believe that someone has died after taking the vaccine whether they took the vaccine or the placebo i don't know if that's been decoded yet this is called the coronavac and it's uh cynovac is the chinese organization that is producing it uh apparently there's 11 vaccines in phase 3 now the ones i talked about i think are the hot favorites though so they're not saying what happened to the patient although word is the patient has died officials in china allowed emergency use now so we understand this is being rolled out in china now under emergency use now emergency use should be just that emergency use because the study the studies are not done yet the phase three trials aren't completed but yet we believe that tens of thousands many tens of thousands of vaccine doses have already been given in china and the data for what's happened to those patients is not published as far as i am aware and i have looked for that and it doesn't seem to be out yet so um authorised for emergency use in china but that's turned into i don't know if it's quite turned into carte blanche but it's um it's been used more than i would classify emergencies now the fire is a bioend tech vaccine ninety percent effective so what do you do what do you hear in the news today the 11th of november the russian vaccine is not 90 effective it's 92 percent effective obviously better do excuse my cynicism but um yeah let's look at it and let's not jump to conclusions so sputnik v for vaccine i guess the saturn v rockets were saturn vs weren't they so i don't know if that's coincidence that they're playing on that as they think back to the space race and the russians of course were the first to put sputniks into orbit right um this is based on two human adenoviruses that normally cause the common cold they're claiming it's 92 effective this is based on interim results from 16 000 trial participants now the the pfizer vaccine had uh 43 000 participants was it so based on a slightly smaller sample size but it's still a good sample size we haven't been told yet how many people have caught the infection but we do know that in russia at the moment a lot of people are getting infected um as far as we can tell cases are still increasing in russia so presumably there was a pretty good chance of quite a large number of these 16 000 participants getting infected because of the situation russia which paradoxically is good for vaccine research um two doses uh three weeks apart it's being rolled out domestically now before the studies have been done so both the chinese and the russian vaccines have put the cart before the horse and they are rolling it out before the phase three studies are completed so in essence the current domestic rollout in russia and china is that is the phase three study that's really what it means and um let's just say it's not that it's not the way the other ones are being done phase three study the uh gamaliel institute is in charge of that 29 claims across moscow 40 000 volunteers being recruited at the moment uh just 16 000 data available on just 16 000 at the moment but 40 000 being recruited in total which is about normal 30 40 50 60 000 would be reasonable a quarter receiving the placebo so it's not half and half so 75 are getting the act of uh getting the active vaccine 25 getting the placebo so so that means we should have 30 000 versus 10 000 still very adequate ample sizes and the turkish government as far as we know has just agreed with the russian authorities to produce the vaccine in turkey so it's looking like it's effective what we don't know is the safety profile hasn't been published yet but having said that to be fair to the russian vaccine we have no we have no um fully peer-reviewed academic work on uh any of the phase three studies for any of the western vaccines either at the moment so that's where we are with that now um i was going to go on and talk about uh other things the united states and the uk and um new research on mask wearing but i think i'll leave that to a separate video because i've gone on a bit longer than i intended to so we'll leave that one there on on vaccine update what i now believe well i believe this for months but but this this is confirming it that there's going to be several vaccines you and i should be vaccinated in the early part of a few of us but by christmas or new year most of us should be vaccinated in january february march april next year and that means that um covered 19 i believe can be eradicated in a few seasons this is a case i believe where vaccines are really riding to the rescue of uh humankind as indeed they did for smallpox okay thank you for watching as oh i should just mention it is the 11th of november so um now if you're in australia of course you rather anzac day america you have um memorial day of course in the uk we have um remembrance day is the 11th of november uh the 11th of november um 1918 was when the guns fell silent on the western front that's why i remember the 11th of november and the reason we have a poppy is the poppies grew all over the the flanders fields in northern france where all over the fields of the somme and uh the battles of the first world war and if you go to france now um and i i've done this quite a few times to go to the war graves it's always a remarkably moving experience and in spring and summer there are a lot of poppies still growing around there blood red poppers so um it's quite quite quite uh quite a moving experience if you get the chance to go and uh and of course this is a symbol for all the people that we remember who have been killed in all the wars since then as well as as well as those uh first wars and uh recently remember people from of course arachna afghanistan we all have our views on those wars but uh that doesn't alter the loss that many have suffered okay thank you for watching this video as always

THE REQUIREMENT GOES INTO  EFFECT DECEMBER 8 FOR ALL  FEDERAL WORKERS.  HOWEVER, MANY STATES LIKE TEXAS  AND FLORIDA CLAIMANT IS A MAJOR  OVERREACH.  GREG ABBOTT EXPANDED AN  EXECUTIVE ORDER LOCKING THE  REQUIREMENT FOR ANY ENTITY  INCLUDING HEALTHCARE FACILITIES  AND PRIVATE BUSINESSES.  MEANWHILE, RON DESANTIS HAS  CALLED FOR A SPECIAL  LEGISLATIVE SESSION TO ADDRESS  THE CONTROVERSY.   JOINED ME TO BREAK IT ALL DOWN  IS OUR CBS NEWS LEGAL  CONTRIBUTOR.  TEXAS AND FLORIDA ARE AMONG THE  HANDFUL OF STATES SUING THE  BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OVER THE  MANDATE.  CAN YOU DESCRIBE A LITTLE MORE  ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY THESE LOSSES  ARE ALLEGING?  >> ABSOLUTELY.   THE LAWSUITS ARE ALLENG THE  VACCINE MANDATE VIOLATES THE  CONSTITUTION IN SEVERAL  DIFFERENT PROVISIONS, AND ALSO  A NUMBER OF LAWS.   ESSENTIALLY, WHAT THE LAWSUITS  SAY IS LOW, THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT IS NOT LIKE THE  STATE GOVERNMENT.  IT IS A GOVERNMENT OF LIMITED  CAPACITY.  IT HAS CERTAIN SPECIFIC JOBS.  EVERYTHING ELSE UNDER THE 10th  AMENDMENT IS RESERVED FOR THE  STATE.   IT DOESN'T HAVE THE STATE POWER  THAT HE CAN DO WHATEVER IT  WANTS.  WHAT THESE LAWSUITS ALLEGE IN  LARGE PART IS THE GOVERNMENT IS  AN ACTING ACCORDING TO ONE OF  THOSE SPECIFIED RESPONSIBILITIES AND IS ACTING OUTSIDE OF THEM.   CONGRESS HAS NOT GIVEN THE  PRESIDENT'S AUTHORITY.   THAT IS THE ALLEGATION IN A  NUTSHELL.  THERE ARE LIMITED PROVISIONS  THAT THE STATES ARE SAYING THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS VIOLATED  BY ISSUING THESE MANDATES.  >> TO THE LAST POINT ABOUT  NEEDING CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL,  IS THAT TRUE?  IS THAT NOT WITHIN THE  BOUNDARIES OF THE EXECUTIVE  OFFICE?  >> AS OFTEN HAPPENS THEIR  ARGUMENTS ON ALL SIDES.  IT'S NOT LIKE THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION ACTED WITHOUT  JUSTIFICATION.  IT HAS ITS OWN ARGUMENTS FOR  WHY THIS IS LEGAL.  IT IS ACTING UNDER SOMETHING  CALLED A PROCUREMENT ACT, THIS  LAW THAT SAYS THE GOVERNMENT  HAS TO ENGAGE IN PROCUREMENT.  IT HAS TO GET THINGS, GIVE  THINGS, SELL AND BUY THINGS AND  IT NEEDS THESE CONTRACTORS TO  DO IT.  THE PRESIDENT AND DIFFERENT  AGENCIES CAN DO THINGS  NECESSARY TO MAKE THAT PROCESS  EFFICIENT.   UNDER THE LAW THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID WE NEED  TO HAVE OUR CONTRACTORS  VACCINATED.  OTHERWISE, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE  PEOPLE CALLING OUT SICK, THINGS  SHUTTING DN, QUARANTINE, AND  ALL OF THOSE THINGS WILL LEAD  TO THIS MASSIVE INEFFICIENCY.  THEREFORE WE ARE GOING TO ISSUE  THESE MANDATES.   THAT IS THE RATIONALE.  THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT  YOU BUY IT.  THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER OR  NOT THE COURTS BY IT.  THAT IS THE ARGUMENT THAT THE  LAWSUITS ARE MAKING THAT THESE  MANDATES ARE ILLEGAL UNDER THE  LAW.  THEY ARE SAYING IT IS JUST NOT  WHAT THE LAW SAID OR MEANT.   IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY UP A LOT  IT IS NOT WHAT IT ALLOWS.  I DO THINK THAT THEIR ARGUMENTS  ON BOTH SIDES.  THUS FAR THESE CHALLENGES TO  VACCINE MANDATES HAVE LARGELY  FAILED. THERE HAVE BEEN A  NUMBER OF CHALLENGES  SPECIFICALLY FOR INSTANCE TO  COLLEGES REQUIRING STUDENTS TO  BE VACCINATED BEFORE THEY COME  BACK.  THOSE HAVE MOSTLY NOT SUCCEEDED  IN THE COURTS.  THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH THESE  CHALLENGES ARE DIFFERENT AND  ONE IS THIS IS THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT AND NOT THE STATE  GOVERNMENT.  SECOND IS THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT IS A GOVERNMENT OF  LIMITED CAPACITY.  THERE ARE ONLY SPECIFIC THINGS  THAT THE CONSTITUTION ALLOWS  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO.  THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT  CHALLENGS AND WE WILL SEE WHAT  THE COURTS AND UP SAYING.  >> IN TERMS OF THE FLORIDA  LAWSUIT, AND YOU MAY HAVE COVER  THIS IN YOUR RESPONSE, THE  TEXANS LAWSUIT HAS A DEAL WITH  CONGRESS NOT GIVING THE  EXECUTIVE OFFICE THE AUTHORITY  TO DO THIS, FLORIDA'S LAWSUIT  ARGUES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO  INSTITUTE SWEEPING VACCINE  MANDATES IN GENERAL.  THERE ARE ARGUMENTS ON BOTH  SIDES.  WHAT ARE THARGUMENTS ON BOTH  SIDES?  >> AGAIN, I THINK THE PERSON  YOU'RE POINTING OUT IS POINTING  TO THE FACT THAT WHEN WE TALK  ABOUT STATE POLICE POWER, WHICH  IS ESSENTIALLY THE POWER THAT  THE STATE HAS INTERFERE WITH  LIBERTY IN ORDER TO PROTECT  SAFETY, THAT IS LARGELY  SOMETHING THAT THE STATES HAVE  AND NOT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.  THAT IS AN OVERGENERALIZATION  BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN WAYS  IN WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  CAN DO THINGS THAT OVERLAP WITH  THE STATE POWER.  IN SOME WAYS IT MAY LOOK LIKE  STATE POLICE POWER.   BASICALLY THAT IS SOMETHING  THAT IS THE JOB OF THE STATE.  WHAT THESE LAWSUITS ARE SAYING  IS YOU ARE TRYING TO HIDE THIS  UNDER THE GUISE OF CERTAIN  THINGS LIKE YOUR SPENDING POWER  AND THE COMMERCE CLAUSE.  YOU ARE TRYING TO PRETEND THIS  THING IN THE PROCUREMENT ACT.   REALLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS  ESSENTIALLY SOMETHING THAT IS  THE RESPONSIBILITY OF  INDIVIDUAL STATES.   YOU ARE STEPPING ON OUR TOES.  AGAIN, I THINK THAT FOR THE  MOST PART THE WAY IN WHICH IT  WAS CRAFTED IT MAY SURVIVE  JUDICIAL REVIEW.  THESE ARE SPECIFIC ARGUMENTS  THAT HAVE NOT BEEN MADE AND ARE  A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THESE  OTHER CHALLENGES.  TO ME THERE IS NO SWEEPING  VACCINE MANDATES ARE OR ARE NOT  ALLOWED.  IT IS ALL VERY CONTEXTUAL.  THAT IS WHY THE SPECIFICS ARE  REALLY IMPORTANT AND WILL  DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE  COURSE WILL BUY IT OR NOT.  THAT IS WHY THESE LAWSUITS ARE  CRAFTED THE WAY THAT THEY ARE.  THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE CONTEXT  AND EXACTLY WHAT THESE MANDATES  ARE REQUIRED AND JUSTIFIED.  >> IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THIS IS  AN ARGUMENT AND FIND THAT  REALLY HAS TO HAPPEN IN EACH  INDIVIDUAL STATE AND THAT IT  REALLY HAS TO DO WITH THE  RESIDENTS OF THAT STATE AND  THEIR FEELING ABOUT THEIR OWN  GOVERNMENT.  THE RESIDENTS IN FLORIDA WILL  HAVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR  NOT AC RON DESANTIS AND HIS  ADMINISTRATION HAS THEIR HEALTH  IN ITS BEST INTEREST OR NOT.  IT KIND OF SOUNDS TO ME LIKE  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ON  SHAKY GROUND.  >> YES AND NO.  THERE ARE THESE TECHNICAL AND  LEGAL QUESTIONS.   IF THE FEDERAL MANDATE IS  LAWFUL AND IF THE COURT  DETERMINES IT WE HAVE THIS  THING CALLED THE SUPREMACY  CLAUSE.  THE FEDERAL LAW IS LAW OF TH LAND.  IF IT CONFLICTS THE FEDERAL LAW  WILL TRUMP.  I MEAN, YOU'RE RIGHT IN CERTAIN  WAYS.  IS THE COURTS ARE TO LOOK AT  THIS AND SAY THIS IS WRAPPED UP  AS A FEDERAL ISSUE, IT IS MADE  TO LOOK LIKE IT FITS UNDER THE  FEDERAL POWER, IT REALLY DOESN'T . IF THE COURSE BY THE ARGUMENT  IT GETS KICKED BACK TO THE  STATE AND THE STATE RESIDENTS  TO CHOOSE HOW THEY WANT TO  TREAT THE PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, IF THE COURTS SAY THIS  IS WITHIN THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT'S POWER, THEN STATES  ARE OUT OF LUCK.  WE SAW THIS BATTLE BETWEEN THE  STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN  VARIOUS WAYS IN THE LAST  ADMINISTRATION.  THE MORE POLARIZED OUR COUNTRY  GETS THE MORE RED STATES ARE  GOING TO EJECT TO A DEMOCRATIC  PRESIDENT AND HIS AGENDA AND  VICE VERSA.   YOU SEE THESE THINGS PLAYING  OUT IN COURT AND THE COURTS ARE  NOT LOOKING AT THE POLITICAL  ISSUE, THEY ARE LOOKING AT  THESE VERY SPECIFIC LEGAL  ISSUES TO DETERMINE IF THIS IS  SOMETHING THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT GETS TO DECIDE.  OR HAS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  OVERSTEPPED ITS BOUNDS UNDER  THE CONSTITUTION IN WHICH CASE  IT IS KICKED BACK TO THE STATES  FOR STATE CITIZENS TO DECIDE  HOW THEY WANT TO TREAT THE  PROBLEM.  >> IT IS REALLY INTERESTING.  THANK YOU VERY MUC"

#VICENews #News",2021-03-05,54741,991,851,UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ, facebook time lies every day somebody's burying somebody so for us it is a very real situation we know the coroner scott muhammad has spent much of the last year trying to help people in his neighborhood in tuskegee get information and supplies to fight covet 19 but when it comes to stopping the spread there is one thing he won't do i don't have evidence that the vaccine is going to save me i don't have that evidence there is a lot of pressure on people to take the vaccine you got to ask yourself why you know well we want to end the pandemic you just said so many people are dying in this community but that's under question we have to see what the long-term effects of the vaccine are going to be nationwide black people are two times more likely than white people to die from covid but a poll at the end of 2020 found that one-third of black adults say they probably would not or definitely would not take the vaccine people are now using words like disparities right okay well these disparities are the reason why we're dying in these numbers but nobody's trying to address the disparities they're just telling you take the vaccine it'll be all right what it sounds like i'm hearing you say is the systemic racism needs to be addressed first but covet needs to be addressed now so what do you think about that so you're going to make kovitz shut up and then what then you back to square one your grandmama got sugar your grandmama got diabetes and high blood pressure and heart disease covert had getting laughed people have issues that preceded the pandemic and they're going to be here when they say everybody's vaccinated no i i do not trust the vaccine this is the site of the infamous tuskegee syphilis study that started in the 30s and lasted 40 years and even today people cite the study as the reason why they don't trust the cova vaccine in 1932 the tuskegee institute in the organization that later became known as the cdc recruited 600 black men to study the effects of syphilis on the body only the men had no idea they were told they were being treated for quote bad blood and were deprived of an effective treatment many of the men spread the disease to their families hundreds of them died the tuskegee institute is now tuskegee university where dr steven showdeke began teaching bioethics in 1983. can you talk about how that study has impacted this community um and how they feel about the healthcare system yeah of course this is this suspicion that here we go again okay the suspicion is legitimate i mean if anybody was put in that position you'll be suspicious too i think that we need to treat one another with enough compassion to listen to people understand their concerns well that's the tough part right because like you said this community has reason to be skeptical yeah these whole things didn't happen yesterday so it's going to take time right if i have to choose between dying and suffering because of coffee and letting my if we get the rest of me i will choose to kill the boxing one of the ways state health officials are trying to address concerns is by asking black doctors academics and community leaders to act as liaisons it is my privilege today to be here in person with my mentor and colleague public health officials tell us that the idea of using vaccination to protect us from further spread of the virus and prevent continual suffering and deaths only works if everyone gets vaccinated even if all black americans were down to take the vaccine there's no guarantee they could get it the race of recipients is only recorded about half the time but the cdc reported that only about seven percent of vaccines have gone to black people access is particularly difficult in rural places like tuskegee and surrounding macon county which only has four inoculation sites we want to remind our citizens to continue to wash up mask up stay up and listen up so you can mitigate with us the covet 19 situation in our county frankly is in charge of making county's emergency management agency one of his jobs during the pandemic is to spread information about the vaccine every morning he calls into a popular local radio station to give updates 1785 cases it's very strong base of listening a lot of people call in and it's just a typical southern gospel format that's very very very productive as far as us getting the message out can you talk about what the access to the vaccine has been like in those difficulties in a rural area we have experienced medical challenges for the last 65 or 70 years and this has only increased the need for providing those services without a hospital in our county we are hampered because uh hospitals get the most dosages we don't have a hospital so we have not one hospital not one hospital we have clinics so are you planning on taking the vaccine let me answer that question this way i personally don't want to give my personal opinion about it and the reason that i don't want to do that because a lot of people listen a lot of people have faith in the information i provide and i don't want to persuade i don't want to encourage i don't want to discourage it i don't have enough information to personally feel in my own heart to tell people it's good or bad so as head of emergency management you know isn't that is that part of your job to have the information about this vaccine at this point to give an honest judgment i have information i've researched it i don't feel i have enough of it some emergency managers may feel that they must say this or say that but i'm not compelled to that uh i have the only answer to my god and i don't have any political pressure that says that i have to make a decision so these are the names of the 600 participants that were part of the syphilis study all of them which were black males and the fact that they created this exhibit in the heart of the city just shows the impact that that study had on this community we just came from the multicultural center where they have have you been there yeah museum yes yes i had some pictures of my uh grandfather i took a picture of his name on the floor his name was willie fitzpatrick was in the study he was in the control he did not have systems thurling williams is a member of the voices of our father's legacy foundation a group of descendants of the men in the tuskegee study he passed away in 1957 i think i was about 8 years old but i remember him we used to call him papa he was a farmer he had cows he planted gardens food cotton corn he was a good man and you could often see him outside sitting uh underneath the shade tree that grew up in the yard cutting the men hat in the community he was just a family man we were down my mom's house on christmas and my mom didn't work she was a half wife and she had bought all of us guests and i said dear where you getting money from maybe buying those gifts like this she said lena that's my dad's name got some money from some kind of study that papa was in he's gone so they divided it among his children so once you learned about the details of the study what was your initial reaction learning about that as an adult i wasn't pleased with it because those people died not knowing what some of them not knowing what happened what was happening to them they never knew like papa never knew the family members who were with us in tuskegee on behalf of the american people what the united states government did was shameful and i am sorry [Music] my sister and i wrote that we had to do a write-up really fitzpatrick was born in 1908 he married sophia eccles eckles and they had nine children they lived in cotton valley community in tuskegee alabama in a small two-bedroom house the hallway straight through the middle really popeye as we called him like you mentioned was a very quiet and hard-working man who farmed and raised just about all the food needed to feed his family and to share with the community it's great that you guys do this because you're humanizing them you know like you said these were actual people with families let the people know that these were our family members and they were somebody they want just nothing we have been hearing so many people that aren't even from this area that will reference the study and say that's why they don't want a vaccine but here you are a descendant of one of the people that were in the study yeah what would you say to those people those people didn't know those people were not educated like most of the people are now and you chose you chose to do it yes i did i chose to take the shot okay so today you will begin the madonna vaccine this is a two dose vaccine you've already had your first dose so this is your last dose for that all right it's gonna be a stick okay take the shot it's not gonna hurt you it's a big difference between the syphilis study what happened there and the covet night team take it because you know about it you can research and read about it talk to doctors about it really say the people that might read the information they have the information but they just don't trust it then it comes to prayer you shouldn't have got to pray to him you

freezing i have a headache oh that sucks okay so today i'm getting the second dose of my covered vaccine i got the moderna i got the first dose i want to say a little over three weeks ago i think the time period is you're supposed to get it around 28 the second dose around 28 days after the first dose so i'm going to the same site if you watch my last video you know that i waited in line for literally a little under two hours last time for my appointment time so i'm going to leave very very early today for my appointment my appointment is at one o'clock and i'm gonna leave maybe around 11 it's about a half hour walk so i'm gonna get there super early and hopefully that means i'll be out pretty quickly and now i'm going to complete the questionnaire that they send you before you can get your vaccine and i'll see if it's the same or different as the last one so i'm going to open it up right now oh and before i go into that i do just want to say if you are on the fence about the vaccine or you're thinking i don't know if i'll get it does it even work blah blah i have literal proof i'm living breathing proof that one dose of the vaccine works so i was in super close contact with someone who tested positive as in i was next to this person inches away without masks we were conversing for a long time that kind of close contact and so i was like yep i definitely have covered here we go i definitely have coveted so i went to get tested and my rapid came back negative but i was like rapid aren't the most accurate my pcr also came back negative and i have only had one dose of the moderna vaccine at this point so one dose of the vaccine protected me against kovitz like i literally was this close to someone whose droplets had coveted in it so i would just like to say do not hesitate to get the vaccine because i actually am here to tell you it works so now i'm just filling in my information on the website birthday and my name i was hoping this process would be easier because this is the same site that i got my first one but it's still making me put everything in are you feeling sick today no have you had vaccines in the past 14 days no are you pregnant no do you have cancer no do you take medications that affect your immune system no have you had a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction to a shot no have you been diagnosed with code in the last 10 days no which i can double confirm now because i have a negative rapid and pcr okay that was it you have successfully completed day of screening questions all right so that was very easy okay so i'm about to head out to my vaccine super duper early it's about 11 20 so i should get there over an hour early and we will see how it goes but i'm super excited here we go alrighty so i got my second dose of the moderna vaccine i got it like five hours ago i got it around one o'clock it's almost six o'clock and yeah so this time around the line and the weight was way shorter than before i waited in line a little under two hours last time and the site i went to the same site this time and they had it way more under control i was in and out in maybe 20 minutes so that was really nice um the woman who gave me my vaccine said that she was the sickest she'd ever been in her life the 36 hours following her second dose of the moderna vaccine which is what i got so i was like cool okay so yeah she really felt very very very ill she said she felt extremely weak and fatigued and had horrible brain fog where she like couldn't think clearly which was interesting i was like oh okay so yeah she had a horrible experience and she told me all about it as the needle was going in my arm yeah so she basically told me to get arnica gel for the muscle soreness but last time my arm was really sore in the first dose and i don't know it's not that big a deal you just wait for it to go away so personally i didn't buy this arnica gel that she was talking about because i don't think it's that big a deal to just like wait out the soreness maybe i'll really regret that but last time my arm was very sore for 24 hours and then it was literally gone the next day so but what she did say was to take tylenol if i start feeling sick because advil which is ibuprofen i guess just doesn't i don't know doesn't help as well as tylenol so i might buy some tylenol per her recommendation i have my little card from the cdc oh yeah it just has my name and birthday it's not a big deal any other sagittarii out there from the first day of sag some may say the last day of scorpio i do not identify that way i am a sagittarius anyways so she also told me something interesting that was in the future it's highly likely that to fly on an airplane you will need to prove you've had two doses of the vaccine so she said take a picture of it and don't lose it so i'm gonna try not to lose it alrighty so it is now 10 o'clock and i was just telling lexi my roommate actually that i think it's gonna be hard for me to tell what the side effects from this vaccine are because one of the common side effects is like muscle soreness and just general fatigue and like sore muscles and i did a really hard workout on thursday or friday i think using weights it's called body pump if you've ever done it before you know what i'm talking about anyways i'm so sore today i'm like walking like the tin man i cannot use my quads like i can't engage my quads like if i had to bend down right now i literally can't move my legs like i'm really really sore so i feel like if i wake up tomorrow and i feel sore it'll just kind of be like maybe it's from the vaccine but also maybe if that's just my sore muscles from working out but i can already feel my arm that i'm holding the camera with this left arm where i got the vaccine is starting to get sore at the injection site which is faster than the last one i had like i don't remember like the first shot i got didn't feel sore until the next morning and i haven't even gone to bed yet and it's starting to feel sore so we'll see what happens i did end up buying tylenol which is acetaminophen not advil which is ibuprofen i took two tylenol just as a preventative basically hi guys i'm deeply unwell i i tried to go to bed around 11 30 and i've had the worst chills up and down my body i'm freezing and i just took my temperature and it's just at 100 and it's definitely rising because i'm getting chills upon chills upon chills um and i just can't sleep like i'm so uncomfortable ah i don't know why i just thought i wouldn't have a reaction but i'm having a reaction um i also took those two tylenol which means my fever would probably be higher if i had not because yeah i also am slightly nauseous i keep burping up like gas oh i don't know i'm really really tired i can't sleep oh i forgot to mention it's 1 34 in the morning and i started trying to fall asleep at 11 30. i've literally been tossing and turning with chills like freezing up and down like goosebumps my feet are so cold i'm going to take more tylenol i'm going to take one more tylenol right now hopefully it doesn't make me more nauseous because i'm not going to eat anything with it oh my god i really can't believe i filmed the whole clip with my mask on my forehead my brain is like not here i have a headache oh that sucks i just hope this really passes soon i'm going to keep taking my temperature and checking it but yeah i'm really tired and i can't sleep and i have a fever okay okay so it's like 11 30 in the morning i just woke up i think i probably fell asleep between 4 and 4 30. oh snapchat chatting my high school group chat and my sister's and the last one i sent was around 3 30 so that's why i think probably fell asleep between 4 and 4 30. so yeah i took tylenol before i went to bed and even then i still got a fever of 101 and the shivers like the chills up and down my body and the sweats like these sheets are so sweaty it's gross so i was just tossing and turning all night but that was really the only symptoms was chills and fever but now when i just woke up my fever is still 100. like my temperature is still 100 and i took three more tylenol so i texted my mom i'm going to see if i can take more i don't want to like kill myself on tylenol but this fever is very persistent and also because i took tylenol before i got the first fever that tylenol already helped to lower the first fever so my first fever was 101 and it could have been like 102 or whatever if i hadn't even taken tylenol so i'm very grateful i took tylenol because i was gonna get a fever either way so hey so i just got out of bed it's 11 53 i made coffee i had a yogurt and i took two more tylenol and i actually feel okay for currently having a fever right now i feel okay i feel like this vaccine just gave me fever and chills like my body's a little bit sore but all right so i want to film this just as another symptom of the vaccine i'm just like freezing and usually i'm not the one who's cold in the apartment usually it's my roommate who needs blankets and stuff but now i'm feeling really cold and my hands are cold to the touch and so are my feet and i think it's just the fever but if you feel really cold after the vaccine i did as well so yeah i feel very cold the end okay hey guys so it is over 24 hours later after my second dose of the kovid moderna vaccine and i just want to recap what has happened i feel like it's been a hectic time so as you guys saw around 10 30 i took two tylenol as like a preventative measure just in case and good thing i did because i tried to go to bed around 11 30 and like clockwork it was insane like immediately as soon as i try to start falling asleep i feel this nausea creep up and i'm like whoa i'm really nauseous and then i got insane chills like i was freezing like i had every blanket i had two blankets on on top of my thick comforter and i was freezing like chills up and down my body and so i finally took my temperature around 1 30 in the morning and i had a fever even though i had taken two tylenol at that point like two to three hours before so i was like wow i got a fever eaten with tylenol which means that um whatever my fever was it would have been worse if i hadn't taken tylenol then i woke up around 3 30 i don't think i've logged this part but i took more tylenol at a little over 101 i was like all right i'm so hot so then i was sweating so it went from shiver cold too hot sweaty like getting the cold sweats you know it was so weird like my body like didn't know what temperature to be and i finally fell asleep between 4 and 4 30 i would say and then i woke up around 11 and took my temperature again in the morning and it was exactly 100.00 so then i took more tylenol as you guys saw and it went up to 100.3 and then i waited a little bit and it finally went back down to 99.3 i'm feeling a lot better right now i just stripped my bed and washing my sheets because they were nasty i washed the pajamas i was wearing because they were soaked with sweat and i took a shower because i felt gross brush my teeth washed my face put myself together and i'm feeling like completely normal now like if i had to describe it it was like the world's fastest flu if you've ever had the flu before you know you get the chills like i said you get a fever and your body hurts i will say when i was lying in bed my back was like killing me and like my joints too for some reason like where my elbow hinges was really sore and my knees just like muscle body aches yeah fever chills whatever so right now live on camera i'm gonna take my temperature again so i'm feeling a lot better and i feel like i don't have a fever and i took tylenol last about two hours ago so let's see okay so 98.8 really not bad maybe that's like slightly higher than i usually am but not bad i knew it i knew i felt better so i literally am like fine now so if i was going to give any advice to someone who's getting the second dose of the vaccine one try to schedule it where you don't have work the next day because you could get lucky and have nothing or you could be like me and have a miserable night so try to do it on a weekend or a day where it's a holiday for example today's president's day so i didn't have work and i would also say just and just just expect the worst hope for the best prepare for the worst so buy tylenol ahead of time and take preventative tylenol keep water by your bed keep some food if you want to take it with tylenol if it's going to upset your stomach and yeah just be ready for things to come on fast because i was fine like you guys saw that clip at 10 30 where i was literally fine and then all of a sudden i was not fine and now i'm back to being fine out of nowhere like i'm fine it's so weird like that was the fastest flu ever it just came on so fast and now it's gone i hope this video was helpful to some of you guys who might be getting your second dose or your your or you are just curious about it thank you for watching bye
407,MSjqi2Zw9JY,Covid vaccine: How does a vaccine get approved? - BBC News,"The NHS is carrying out the biggest mass vaccination campaign in its history with a jab that protects against Covid-19.

Some people have been surprised to learn how a process which usually takes at least ten years could have been done in less than one.

What safety checks have been made to get the Covid vaccine to this point?

BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains.

morning how you doing i'm good you're looking good do you know what other than a little bit of a sore arm a bit of a headache and just feeling you know when you you feel like you're coming down with something i've just got that nothing else and that's totally expected i mean you get loads of information when you go for your job as to what to expect afterwards and these are common side effects and it is a sign that your immune system is working your immune system is recognizing the vaccine it's making antibodies and t cells and this is how you should feel and it's temporary so actually i feel all right so which vaccine did you have i had the oxford astrazeneca one that was the one that was approved more recently yes the one that you don't have to store at -70 so it's a bit easier to distribute and uh give out to people but obviously we have two vaccines that have been approved in this country the fires are beyond tech one and also the oxford astrazeneca one they work on slightly different principles but they both train your immune system to do the same thing which is to fight coronavirus if you encounter it they don't they can't give you coronavirus yeah but they train you to fight it i don't want to put you on the spot but you were saying that uh if you get the first vaccine that's the that's the all-important do you think that they're going about this the right way in terms of getting the first vaccine first and then yeah so loads of people have had questions about this and i completely understand so the joint committee for vaccination and immunized immunization is an independent body and the mhra is a regulator in this country they decide how we do vaccines they decide so they take they've taken information from the manufacturer that is published and not published it's not the manufacturer that decides how action should be given they are an independent body that look at it and say right actually this is the best way and because cases are surging so fast and hospitals are on the cusp of being overwhelmed and i work in one of them we need to vaccinate as many people as possible because you know that one getting one dose out to double the number of people gives them at least 70 percent protection yeah so we might just break the back of this pandemic just by doing that and that's the priority get as many people protected as soon as possible what about this new strain there's a brand new straight yeah the vaccines are going to work about this work against this new strain this is the south africans yeah so there are actually over time there have been various different strains of coronavirus around because it changes all the time but every now and again there's a big change that makes it behave slightly differently and the thing about these the kent strain and the south african strain is that they are likely to be more infectious they don't look like they cause any more severe disease but the big worry was are they going to escape the vaccine is the vaccine going to be able to target them there's no evidence that says it can't so far which is great and also a very small study came out of about 20 people where they looked at some blood samples from patients and it looked as though the fisa biontech one was definitely going to work against it even if the virus mutates these vaccines are adaptable we can change them if we need to as well so this you've got this base and then you add to it yes and and these vaccines have been developed on existing technology i know they've happened quickly yeah but they've happened quickly and been developed quickly because we've sped up the process to make it more efficient we've still had all the safety checks in place that has not been compromised we've thrown money at this internationally and we used existing technology we already had from previous sars cases are you hearing people are quite nervous about getting the vaccine yeah and i was too i completely understand yeah initially but then do you know what i did i listened to the experts one of the professors who worked in the oxford astrazeneca vaccine is a pediatrician who is one of the most intelligent sensible and honest people i know and i spoke to him i was lucky enough to speak to him because i worked in a a documentary that looked at the oxford vaccine and you know what there is no conspiracy there is no fake news all medical treatments have potential side effects but in the cases of these and we've looked at the trials looked at tens of thousands of people we've already immunized 1.5 million people in this country that's a huge number of people we haven't seen a huge number of significant side effects from it we get minor side effects i trust this program it is the best line of defense we have and i would encourage everyone to get it if you're eligible and it seems like boris is going to be rolling out the army they're going to be doing battle preparation techniques yeah to roll this out yeah aren't you trained in well i've i've i'm really nice i've volunteered to be a vaccinator because i imagine it anyway it worked but there's a certain program that you have to go through to be a covert vaccinator um the army have been called in because we need to distribute these vaccines to the places where they're going to give them to people and that's currently where a bottleneck is the supply and the distribution i'm so glad they're bringing in the army because we need to set up as many vaccination sites as possible i was going to ask that can pharmacists play a part in that i'm sure all healthcare professionals should be able to some pharmacists already provide the flu vaccine service dentists should be able to do other allied healthcare professionals if you're not a healthcare professional you can still volunteer to be on the admin and support side so it's not just for healthcare professionals but you know what there's no shortage of people who are stepping forward to help out gps are ready and waiting we need to get the vaccine out to them can i just quickly say there was a story about a 92 year old woman yeah in london who was actually scammed into pain and we don't even know what that vaccination was so there are there is fraud out there as well and she's not the only person that's been scammed these vaccines are not available privately in this country at all at this stage so please if somebody says you can pay to get a vaccine done or get it done privately if you've got any concerns don't do it call up someone and check all right doctor thank you so much you just feel better when he's here don't you when when manchester united you know can you always just be sat there i feel great apologies for the gratuitous partial nudity in that video listen um we're gonna give you some more take it all close let's wear some sensible glasses am i gonna be all right you got it flaunting are you sure do you know what we are from i reject everything reject men i've rejected pins and needles and plates in are you sure i'm going to be all right range yeah you know it's low risk and it's especially important that people like you and i have it because we are from black and minority ethnic backgrounds it's we are at slightly higher risk thank you range been lovely thank you so much feel safer now

410,VGm7Dfp0EXo,"COVID Vaccine Vlog.. I got *SICK* | Miki Rai, RN","As healthcare workers, Kevin and I have both had the opportunity to get vaccinated. Kevin got the Pfizer vaccine, and I got the Moderna vaccine based on what was distributed to our workplaces. Please remember that every body is different and what one person experiences may be different from what another person experiences. Most common side effects include: pain, swelling and tenderness at the injection site, fever, chills, fatigue, muscle aches, and headaches.

Get vaccinated not only protects yourself, but also protects the people around you. By now we have seen just how scary COVID-19 is-- the symptoms can be severe and lasting many months. COVID-19 can damage your heart, lung and brain leading to long term chronic issues. Getting vaccinated can reduce the severity of your symptoms and protect you from the virus.

get any sleep hey guys it's mickey today is december 23rd it is the day of the day it is the day before christmas eve and i just got scheduled for my code vaccine washington state is receiving shipments um of pfizer and moderna vaccines however the issue is that we're receiving 40 less doses for the first phase than we had anticipated and so it's a scary time because we don't know who is going to be able to get the vaccines who isn't going to be able to get the vaccines and right now the vaccines are so valuable everyone is kind of scrambling and really hoping that they can get them originally we were told that we would be getting the pfizer vaccines but instead i will actually be getting the maduro in a vaccine because that is the shipment that came in first so when i signed up for the vaccine it asked me a couple questions am i pregnant am i under 18 and did i test positive for cobit within the last month to which all of my answers are no but let me just show you as you can see here on the screen i am in fact scheduled for the moderna vaccine and it automatically enrolls you in the first appointment as well as a second appointment because the doses have to be 28 days apart i believe plus or minus two by the way if you're new to this channel my name is mickey i'm a registered nurse and my boyfriend kevin is a physician and so kevin is actually getting his first dose of a vaccine tomorrow he's actually getting the pfizer vaccine and so we are getting two different vaccines although they are very similar there actually are some differences but they are both mrna vaccines messenger rna is a small piece of code basically that teaches your bodies to build a harmless protein that your body can then identify as covid and once it identifies it as covid then it can mount an immune response to basically prepare for an infection so going over pfizer versus moderna so effectivity is pretty close pfizer is at 95 percent while moderna is at 94.5 so pretty much almost identical pfizer vaccine is 30 micrograms and it's given 21 days apart and so that's three weeks where opposed to the moderna vaccine is 100 micrograms and that's actually given 28 days apart which is four weeks there is a grace period most places are doing plus or minus two days the fisa one actually has to be stored between negative 112 to negative 76 degrees fahrenheit which is obviously very very cold and so right now refrigerators are in high high demand whereas the moderna one is actually very special because it only needs to be negative 13 to negative five pfizer is approved for use over the age of 16 where opposed to moderna is approved for over 18. so those numbers they could work for people younger but because the trials in themselves only included people of that age that's why it's only approved for that but in the future if we do more studies it could work just as well for people younger i've been hearing from my friends that some of them have been pretty sleepy the first day after they get the vaccine any sentiments you're getting your vaccine tomorrow i just have to wake up earlier than i'm supposed to you'll be fine yeah i'm gonna miss it and they're gonna give it to somebody else no they won't kevin's workplace got the vaccines way earlier and by way earlier i mean like a week and a half earlier than my workplace and so we're still in phase one they are now moving on to what's actually phase one part two yeah phase one part two so kevin has so graciously offered to come with me because i'm a tiny bit nervous but he's post night shift but you did sleep a little bit last night right yes so they only had one patient so he's chilling you're ready i'm not doing anything i know i'm talking to myself hello okay let's do this thing do you have the address yes i do shoot i thought i sent it to myself but i didn't oh my god oh my god cue the nurse guys [Music] it's a 22 minute drive it's only 22 minutes away i thought it was like hours and hours and hours away i was like mentally prepared to drive babe yes this is like mickey's asian mom jeans coming out definitely my asian mom jeans coming out i cleaned those glasses for you yes now that we have time to clean our glasses i show up to everything early like i cannot be late it's my biggest pet peeve when other people are late [Music] thanks for coming with me no problem i know you're very nervous i think we figured out i wasn't nervous about the vaccine i was nervous about being able to vlog it and bring you guys with me i mean i've been getting so many comments and messages from people saying that they would love to hear how my experiences and how it is after kevin actually already got his vaccine you are day three post-vaccine i went to work right after for like 12 hours yeah so no major issues for kev the way that it works in washington at least is the state has purchased a certain amount of moderna and pfizer vaccines and then it gets distributed to the different locations or locations and hospitals based on the contracts that you have with the state i don't know exactly how it works and also like if you think about it flu shots and other other types of vaccines also have different types and are made by different companies we just don't name them as such should i just go in early or should i just do it yeah is there an earlier slot okay [Music] it was great everyone was super nice and understanding of your like of your famous life well yeah totally that's totally okay like you let me know what angle you want blah blah i just set it up on the tripod we got the footage um my arm is sore already back home we are eating some korean food some tsundubu some takeout it's been what an hour or so my arm is a little bit sore but otherwise i feel great over a million people have gotten the vaccine and obviously there are some instances of people who are allergic to certain ingredients or things like that and so there's obviously people who are going to have allergic reactions or things like that and that's normal no matter what drug no matter what yeah i mean like vaccine a lot percentage of the population is allergic to like peanuts shellfish and things like things that are harmed like apples and yeah so i think it's important to remember that when you read those articles right now it's obviously just a very exciting thing to have this vaccine and so the news is hyper aware of these situations right hello guys little buddhos is here with me wow i don't know if i'm just tired from life or the vaccine got me a little tired but i just took a little nap and kevin obviously had a night shift last night and so he went back to bed and i was just feeling so tired i figured i would just close my eyes for a little bit and i got woken up when kevin woke up ayo hi hi sleepyhead i'm the awake so it is currently 3 30 p.m i'm in fact not the one working night shift but i did take a little rest so my arm is pretty sore um but not any more sore than like it would be after a flu shot or anything like that get pretty knocked out with vaccines anyways like i'll just sleep through it so not the end of the world i feel okay look a little bit like a crazy person little update can you hold it my arm is so sore that's not even the right arm they're both really sore why like i don't know if you guys can see how like toned this looks like i'm not flexing it's just straight up swollen it kind of feels like i got a couple different flu shots on the same day the pain kind of radiates up my neck a little bit and sometimes my other arm hurts too but we're doing fine we're doing great kevin on the other hand didn't have any symptoms after his shot what do you mean my arm is sore yeah just for a little bit don't complain about it i'm a complainer no it is 4am probably about 36 to 48 hours between when i first got my shot yeah i just woke up with really really crazy chills um i don't know if it's just really cold in washington it totally might be that but i just turned on that two heaters and one blanket and everything else that i'm gonna try to bundle up but i think i definitely have the chills um it's one of the most common side effects of the vaccine and a lot of times it takes your body a couple days to mount an immune response so not out of the ordinary but kind of took me by surprise because i actually was feeling a lot better um yesterday compared to the first day i'm gonna try to sleep but i will update you guys good morning i'm sorry i look really rough but i figured i should give you guys an update um it's now eight in the morning and i feel much much better the chills the fever everything has stopped so we are good now um but since it kept me up all night i didn't get any sleep so i'm just gonna go back to bed right now i debated whether or not i wanted to even include these clips in there but i wanted to be an accurate representation of how i actually felt but just because i feel this way doesn't mean that your body will feel this way or you won't feel this way this is just my personal experience anytime i get vaccinated whether it's the flu or anything like that my body just reacts more and so this isn't something out of the ordinary or unexpected for me and all my co-workers who have gotten vaccinated feel just fine except for a little bit of arm soreness so again i think it's just it's my body but working really hard to build spike proteins which i am very excited for my body is generating an immune response which is exactly what we want so up today it's now 1 pm um i feel like absolute i want to say that in more less colorful language my body is not having it i look like i have a super bicep you mean it's just swollen it's super like it looks like i've worked out like tremendously and it is really tender so i do have a salon pus that is probably expired on my arm and on my neck um to hopefully make it feel a little bit better i'm gonna look horrible throughout this entire video but kevin has made me chicken noodle soup with some rice inside there's no noodle it's just chicken and chicken rice soup i was feeling really crummy again after we did some errands and then i had to like rest for a little bit and then i took some day quilt now i'm feeling infinitely better i took my temp 99 7. not a fever just a little warm we're getting close i want to emphasize again that all these symptoms i'm experiencing are completely normal like this is literally i will list out the side effects the most common side effects i just happen to have all of them yo what is up you guys it is now 6 p.m i feel great i'm back to not 100 my arms are still really sore but i'm feeling good i'm not sure if i'm just feeling better or if it was the day quill that really kicked in i'm scheduled for work tomorrow and i heard from some of my friends that the second dose is actually going to be way worse and so i have quite a couple days off after my second dose so i feel reassured about that i got my appetite back i'm starving hungry as heck so i'm gonna eat some din din hey guys it is 5 am post vaccine day 3. i feel great i feel amazing my arm is still a little bit sore but now i feel completely fine i no longer am taking any sort of dayquil nyquil after that clip i basically stopped vlogging because i didn't have any other symptoms i was feeling 100 a-okay and as you can see i've gone into the new year with no arm soreness i did kind of have a rough couple of days after the vaccine i want to answer a couple questions that i think you guys will have about the vaccine number one is the covid vaccine free technically yes it's free however it is being paid for by u.s taxpayer money and so you probably have already paid for it in your taxes while there is no upfront cost for the patient providers administering the vaccine can actually charge a administration fee and get that reimbursed through either private or public insurance or through a fund i have it written down here it's called the health resources and services administration's provider relief fund very long name now i bet you're wondering after you get the two doses of your vaccine how long before you actually have your 95 effective immunity that is a great question we don't have exact data on this we do know that it takes your body a couple weeks after that second dose to build immunity for the fisa vaccine we know it takes at least seven days in the modern vaccine at least 14 days and the cdc website itself says that it takes a couple weeks for your body to build immunity so especially if you've gotten the chance to get vaccinated please be extra careful you can still get covid before and after your vaccine how long does the immunity last this is the question that scientists and researchers all around the world are trying to figure out right now the short answer is that we don't know yet experts are not expecting it to be a lifelong vaccine and so we are expecting to have to re-vaccinate people at some point in time we just don't know exactly when that will be as i've already mentioned multiple times in this video every single person's body is different well some people experience no side effects no symptoms whatsoever i ended up getting almost every single one on the list please do not use my personal experience as a testimony for you not to get vaccinated there is seriously no world where getting covet 19 is a better alternative to getting vaccinated and protecting not only yourself but your loved ones and also don't forget to follow me on my socials i post on my instagram stories pretty much every single day so you can keep updated on my life and what i'm doing with work as always stay safe i love you guys so much and don't forget you're a 10 out of 10 and don't let anyone ever make you advice okay bye [Music] [Applause] you

you the philippines they'll be going crazy in the philippines about the fact it's a filipino nurse who has actually administered the first covert 19 vaccine job so a huge moment for the nhs huge moment for the uk but also a huge moment for the philippines you send so many fantastic people here to work in our health system yeah just wonderful to speak to mae there and there's so many nurses just around the corner that's where all the vaccines have been taken place since 6 31 this morning they're just beginning to there's majors wandering off now i hope she has found a cup of tea she's she's such a lovely lady he really is uh the first care home worker is now being administered the vaccine as we've said uh william shakespeare as well let's just hear from margaret show she was the very first person margaret keenan 91 years old next week it's her birthday she was the very first person to receive the vaccine you're part of a moment of history the first to receive this vaccine how does that feel it hasn't sunk in yet i can't really answer that question yet it's just really i don't know what to say it's just it was at first really yeah what do you say to those who might be having second thoughts about having this well i would say go for it go for it because it's it's free and it's the best thing that's ever happened at the moment so do please go for it that's all i say you know if i can do it well so can you absolutely brilliant and what can she say she she's a remarkable lady she's 91 next week i think she retired as a jeweller shop assistant four years ago she was 87 and still working she's from ennis skillin originally i think in northern ireland it's a great lived in coventry for over 60 years let's hear a little bit more from our pioneer margaret keenan oh my word as i've just said before at the moment on the high field it's just just so strange and so wonderful really yeah so anyway you see this is for a good cause so i'm so pleased i had it done yeah did you ever think in your whole 90 years you would ever be sitting here the first person to have a covet vaccination no never ever does anything come close in your lifetime to this moment no i i can't think of anything no not true it's so so different than you know i this is a terrible terrible disease so we do we do want rid of it you know so anything that helps it's a bonus isn't it really i don't know what else to say really what do your family make of you being here today being well they don't find it tall they're all for us it's liberating isn't it um jonathan swain for people like uh margaret keenan this it unlocks the year for her she has this uh first dose of the vaccine today in 21 days she gets the second dose you know like like many people in that age group many many more people out of that age group as well self isolating for most of the year unable to enjoy life you know sort of an almost permanent lockdown and now she can feel much more confident about living her life again and and that's what we all want for everybody it's a giant leap forward isn't it what's happening just around the corner from here in terms of a giant leap forward for us all getting back to some kind of normality if not now or before christmas but certainly in the spring certainly by the summer that's what all the nhs staff are telling us this morning and in terms of margaret herself well she is hoping now after the second dose in 21 days time that's by the 29th she'll have some form of protection i know that that's sort of quite limited because she's still exposed to the virus but then she is then hoping to spend new year with her family she has grandchildren and she has a son and a daughter so after spending so much time as you say in self-isolation uh for her there's a great sense of normality and what a great start to the new year not just for margaret but for bill and for all the other people that have been vaccinated around 100 or so here today in coventry there'll be thousands more around the country today 800 or so thousand doses are here in this country millions more doses will come into the country before christmas and into the new year i mean just tremendous and then if you can just feel the sort of atmosphere here it's just so nice seeing nhs staff and the nurses just they've got smiles on their faces for the first time and you genuinely do get the sense that this is a huge huge day and a massive step forward for not just coventry i'm a local lad so i'm really proud that this hospital is the first uh in the country to be doing it but so we normally um people to coventry as a punishment today we sent the pfizer covert 19 vaccine to save the world so coventry has really bounced back [Music] he absolutely has piers and it's just so great on the map for all the right reasons i mean my dad you know in his eighties himself and as he lived through the blitz uh during the war coventry was was hammered then and uh it's got a football team who i support who are are doing okay they don't have a stadium at the moment so and coventry has been through it it's a bit of a ghost town at the moment people have been telling me family members with kovid they are in tier three so not a huge amount to celebrate at the moment but the people are wonderful here and you can see from may who has spoken to just the effort and what it meant to her to administer the first vaccination here it's a great moment for coventry and uh yeah i'm really proud of the place this morning yeah jonathan it's fantastic news so the phased vaccination program will see patients aged 80 and above already attended some brilliant footage just watch this this is margaret the first person margaret keenan this is her being clapped out after having the vaccine give it a bit of volume [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] absolutely brilliant brilliant so we've seen these scenes didn't we throughout the first wave of the pandemic when people survived kovid after weeks or months in some cases getting clapped out by unbelievably exhausted but relieved staff and now they've got a moment yeah of just total jubilation yeah this is not somebody who's had to survive or beat the virus it's somebody who's now been protected from it against getting the virus totally different dynamic that is margaret keenan 19 years 91 next week says it's the best birthday present she's ever had so as i'm saying the phased vaccination program sees patients aged 80 and above who are already attending hospital as an outpatient and those who are being discharged home after a hospital stay they will be first in line there care home providers going to begin booking staff in of course because we want our care workers to get this vaccine gps are expected to be able to begin vaccinating care home residents because my goodness we need to be back in contact with our friends and family who are currently in lockdown in care homes um so it's an absolute i mean margaret keenan 90 years old is a total pioneer you

COVID Vaccine Hesitancy and Risk of a Traffic Crash 

https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(22)00822-1/fulltext

Background

Coronavirus disease (COVID) vaccine hesitancy,

is a reflection of psychology that might also contribute to traffic safety. 

So
People that take covid vaccines are the sort of people who have less traffic accidents

People who do not take covid vaccines are the sort of people who have more traffic accidents

Methods
Population-based longitudinal cohort analysis of adults

Determined COVID vaccination status from electronic medical records

Traffic crashes requiring emergency medical care

Subsequently identified accidents from all (178) hospitals

One month follow-up

Results, (2021)

N = 11,270,763

Total traffic accidents, 6,682

Unvaccinated, 16%

Vaccinated, 84%

Unvaccinated individuals

1,682 traffic crashes (25%)

Equal to a 72% increased relative

Confidence interval, (95%) 63% to 82%

(P less than 0.001)

What about

Socioeconomic status

Alcohol

Sleep apnea

Diabetes

Depression

Dementia

Hypertension

Cancer

Covid infection

Equal to a 48% increase after adjustment

Confidence interval, (95%) 40% to 57%

(P less than 0.001)

The increased risks extended across the spectrum of crash severity

Results similar for Pfizer, Moderna, or other vaccines

Conclusions

These data suggest that COVID vaccine hesitancy is associated with significant increased risks of a traffic crash. 

An awareness of these risks might help to encourage more COVID vaccination.

Factors

Distrust of government

Belief in freedom

Misconceptions of everyday risks

Faith in natural protection

Antipathy toward regulation

Chronic poverty

Exposure to misinformation

Political identity

Negative past experiences

Limited health literacy

Social networks, misgivings around public health guidelines

Primary care physicians who wish to help patients avoid becoming traffic statistics, 

could take the opportunity to stress standard safety reminders such as wearing a seatbelt, obeying speed limits, and never driving drunk

Paramedics, should be aware that unvaccinated patients are overrepresented in the aftermath of a traffic crash.

Driver insurance policies in the future

Together, the findings suggest that unvaccinated adults need to be careful indoors with other people and outside with surrounding traffic.

But

Unvaccinated in Canada could not use, planes, trains, buses

Also
https://covid19-sciencetable.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Science-Brief_Vaccines-in-Essential-Workers_20210423_published2.pdf

Vaccinated more likely to work remotely in Ontario in 2021

‘Essential workers’ had lower vaccination rates 

(several pile ups in ice and bad weather)

Over 65s do not commute 

So
Staying at home reduces the chances of being in an accident

Invalid title

Patient in emergency department as a driver, passenger, or pedestrian (codes V00-V69)

Total = 6,682

Drivers, 2,856
Passengers, 1,189
Pedestrians, 2,637
(Table 3 of the study)

(Therefore, unvaccinated pedestrians more likely to be in an accidents that vaccinated pedestrians)

People were considered unvaccinated for the first 14 days after vaccination

Given the study only lasted a month, this is half of the time.

So how many casualties were misclassified?

If 602 of the 6,682 were misclassified,

Any difference between the two groups would vanish (Igor Chudov)

https://igorchudov.substack.com/p/the-unvaccinated-had-more-car-crashes

Deaths at Scene

Excluded

42 deaths at scene

8 deaths were included

(550 people were actually admitted to hospital)

Therefore 84% of death outcomes ignored

This also excluded all sudden deaths that resulted in an accident

What about people not in the system

Dr Clare Craig
https://twitter.com/ClareCraigPath/status/1602650802186772481

Unvaccinated typically underestimated

Therefore

Rate of incidence of anything overestimated in the unvaccinated

Rate of incidence of anything underestimated in the vaccinated

E.g. Covid cases, hospitalisations, deaths, car accidents

Or indeed, anything else

Forest plot

In all subgroups the risk is increased by the same amount (possible systematic bias)

Source data not available to public

The study dataset is held securely in coded form at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES).",2022-12-17,542763,29906,12136,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg, a warm welcome to today's Talk Saturday the 17th of December now I'd been reading about this article in the popular press and on various social media places about a study which purported to show that people that were unvaccinated against covid-19 were 72 percent more likely to be involved in a traffic accident now I just assumed that this was a joke um but it actually turns out it's not when I actually looked into it it turns out this is actually based on something that's purported to be a scientific paper and here it is it comes largely from workers in Toronto and it's published in the American Journal of Medicine and it's a full scientific paper absolutely quite uh incredible and uh for example here here there pointing out that uh people that are of uh no vaccine get more accidents than people that have had the uh the vaccine over a period of a month um this is not a joke this is actually purported to be a genuine scientific paper and I really feel that these authors and the American Journal of Medicine have done themselves no favor at all with with this now they do claim of course that the uh the study is is a correlation they're not saying it's causal but there is there is a but here because they actually put forward this diagram as well here uh where they actually point out potential causal mechanism and I'm not going through this at all it's quite weak but while they actually say um that this is a correlation study they actually do try and give some potential causal mechanisms now it's a population study over 11 million people quite how they got the data I don't know you and I can't get access to the data of course it's not public domain data but they give these reasons why it's good data and that they attest to the validity of this data so I think we can accept that but um pity that was not open to a public access there for peer review um talking about peer review it really makes me wonder what the peer reviewers were thinking when they looked at this article but there's a few factors so 72 percent more likely to have an accident if you are unvaccinated in other words vaccination against covert is protecting against uh against uh accidents according to this this line of thinking but there's a few things to look at and I'm going to look at this in quite a lot of detail but not in this short video this is just a bit of an introduction so in Canada in 2021 when this data is referring to uh people that were unvaccinated weren't allowed to use public transport a lot of public transport in Canada anyway Planes Trains buses so they were forced to rely on cars so they were going to be traveling more and the unvaccinated it turns out in onto Ontario were more likely to work sorry the vaccinated in Ontario were more likely to work remotely so people that were unvaccinated were more likely to have to travel in to work and again I've got evidence for this that's in the description so for example over 65s had a very low accident rate but of course they don't uh commute that they don't commute to work now it turns out that this data and they look at over 6 000 accidents includes drivers passengers and pedestrians so are they seriously trying to make the point that covered vaccination protects protest pedestrians against road traffic accidents it really is a bitter is a bit bizarre and there was nearly as many pedestrians involved in the study as there were drivers as well as passengers um now they they classed people unvaccinated for 14 days after the vaccination but the study only lasted for one month so so if people if people had been vaccinated uh there were classed as unvaccinated for 14 days after after the vaccination now um this this could completely all you would need is about six like most 700 people to have been misclassified out of this over six thousand and that were completely invalidate this data utterly completely invalidate the results another thing that's slightly more disturbing really deaths at seen when people died at the scene were excluded and this actually works out that it excludes 84 percent of the deaths in the study now it some people might think it's a bit convenient that they uh excluded deaths at the scene because sometimes the road traffic accident is caused by a medical emergency so for example just say for example if someone a driver had myocarditis for example and that caused a spontaneous ventricular fibrillation a cardiac arrest and that will cause the accident and the person would be dead at scene that their body May well be traumatized but the cause of death would actually have occurred before the accident because of the cardiac arrest they were excluded from the study completely excluded from the study I'll leave you to draw your own conclusions from that now under vaccinated percentage in populations is usually uh underestimated so unvaccinated is usually underestimated or people vaccinated normally overestimated and now that means that the rate of anything will appear higher or overestimated in people that are unvaccinated so it doesn't matter what it is if you're comparing vaccinated unvaccinated so you could have um you could say that people um people who are unvaccinated have a greater liking for porridge in the morning or whatever so because the unvaccinated percentage is usually underestimated in the vaccinated percentage is usually overestimated the rate of anything will appear higher or overestimated in the unvaccinated in this case road traffic accidents and the rate of anything will appear underestimated in the vaccinated so really uh quite a um an amusing study if it wasn't so if it wasn't so serious that this actually gets into the medical literature really is uh quite bemusing and that's just a very quick romp through that um I'll just point out some of the factors that the the authors suggested they suggested a distrusting government it might be a factor in other words people that distrusted government were more likely to be involved in road traffic accidents as well as more less likely to be vaccinated um some people might think that's offensive belief in Freedom might be a factor this awful thing this belief in Freedom Dearing me imagine believing in freedom but that might be a factor that makes people less likely to be vaccinated and more likely so people that believe in Freedom are more likely to be involved in road traffic accidents okay misconceptions of everyday risk that they are uh purporting as an idea they don't talk about vaccine risk they're talking about covert risks of course uh people that have faith in natural protection are less likely to be vaccinated according to their thinking and more likely to be involved in a traffic accident faith in natural protection antipathy towards regulation chronic poverty is another Factor they uh propose again saying this makes people less likely to be vaccinated more likely to be involved in an accident exposure to misinformation political identity so are they really saying that your political identity influences your likelihood of being involved in a road traffic accident is that really what they're purporting here and this is this is in the published medical literature it really is quite incredible negative past experienced limited health literacy so all you stupid people out there who have got low uh uh health literacy it appears that you're more likely to be involved in road traffic accidents because you don't realize that when a ton and a half of metal hits your body it can do some damage it's just incredible that this has made the literature social networks misgiving around Public Health guidelines so people that have misgivings amongst Public Health guidelines really don't seem to think it's a problem to walk out in front of a car dear me primary care physicians who wish to help patients to avoid traffic accident statistics could take this opportunity they say to stress standard reminders such as wearing seat belts obeying speakers and for drinking alcohol so if you're going to drive let me give you some advice wear a seat belt don't exceed the speed limit oh and don't drink and drive groundbreaking stuff paramedics should be aware that unvaccinated patients are over represented in the aftermath of a traffic crash so all these these people are unvaccinated are a really big dangerous to paramedics here according to this thinking and they actually talk about this affecting driver insurance policies in the future so because of this groundbreaking research we now realize that people that are unvaccinated are going to covid-19 are more likely to have road traffic accidents therefore we should increase their insurance premiums are they really saying this anyway that's just a few things about that I'm going to look at it in a bit more detail because I'm aware I haven't given my full uh sort of a level of evidence so we'll be giving all the references for this but I'm going to do that as a separate video because it is quite complicated but there there we go um needless to say we don't accept the the uh this contention that uh covid-19 is uh associated with uh fairly to take covid-19 vaccines associated with increased risk of road traffic accidents and uh it's done the medical literature and The credibility of science no good at all in my view that this has been published so we'll leave that there for now um I'm going to do this in detail uh straight away while it's all still fresh in my head if you want to watch it do check out the next video for all the detail for now thank you for watching

#MedicinewithDrMoran",2021-09-17,488206,14193,3718,UCretxef46N9r-v0FOlHWIVA," Hello, Welcome to my channel Medicine with Dr. 
Moran. If you've not been here before I'm Dr.   Keith Moran. Today I want to talk about two 
specific side effects of the Covid-19 vaccine   Myocarditis and Pericarditis. I want to report on 
a study that was done in the province of Ontario   in Canada. This province includes the cities 
of Toronto and Canada's capital city Ottawa.   This looked at the incidence of Myocarditis which 
is inflammation of the heart muscle as well as   Pericarditis. Pericarditis is inflammation of the 
sac that surrounds the heart. Now there's a long   list of causes for Myocarditis. The main causes 
include viruses, fungi, bacteria, parasites,   as well as toxins, medications, radiation 
chemotherapy, trauma, and autoimmune diseases.   The list for possibilities of causes for 
pericarditis is actually very very similar.   The study in question looked at the frequency 
of these two conditions between December 13,   2020 to August 7, 2021. This was done because 
there were significant signals from the United   States as well as Israel about Myocarditis 
and Pericarditis secondary to the vaccine.   I recently mentioned this side effect was more 
frequent in the vaccinated versus control and   vaccinated group on a recent video. This video 
looked at short-term side effects to the Pfizer   vaccine over a six-week period. There's a 
link to that video below in the description.   Now on to the Ontario study. Since the start 
of the immunization program they found 204   cases in Ontario of either Myocarditis or 
Pericarditis which met the Brighton collaboration   case definition for those two diagnoses. 
So we know that there are definite cases.   Now of these 204 cases 79.9% occurred in 
males and 69.6% occurred following the   second dose. The average time from vaccine 
administration to symptom onset was two days   and 79% of cases occurred within seven days of 
vaccine administration. There were 72 cases of   Myocarditis, 58 cases of Pericarditis, and 74 
cases of a mixture which we call Myopericarditis.   99% of the cases attended the emergency department 
with 72% of the cases getting admitted to the   hospital and 1.5% of the cases ended up in the 
intensive care unit. Now fortunately there were   no deaths. I was very disappointed to not see any 
data on the patients that were admitted in terms   of their length of stay, whether there was cardiac 
dysfunction, the levels of their cardiac injury,   blood test markers, and whether there were things 
like heart failure, or rhythm abnormalities.   As you can see on this graph the majority 
of the cases occurred after the end of May   when vaccination programs started to involve 
younger adults. Many second doses were also   around that time being administered. There was 
also an increased vaccine supply particularly   of Moderna as well as release of an enhanced 
surveillance directive to follow Myocarditis   and Pericarditis. So at this point doctors as 
well as people who were vaccinated were more in   tune to look for symptoms that might indicate 
Myocarditis or Pericarditis. These symptoms   of this would be chest discomfort, palpitations, 
shortness of breath which typically would occur as   I've mentioned one to seven days post-vaccination. 
This is the reporting rate of Myocarditis and   Pericarditis per million doses administered 
by age by Pfizer in green and Moderna in blue.   You can see that the majority of cases are 
occurring in people under the age of 40 with   a much higher incidence in the younger age 
group. As Pfizer in Ontario has been given to   people below the age of 18 there's an increased 
rate in the green line of Pfizer at those ages.   Moderna has not been approved in Ontario and so 
its statistics only go down to the age of 18.   When you look at the Moderna statistics which 
is the blue line the risk of Myocarditis or   Pericarditis is much higher in the 18 to 24 
age group. On this slide the overall reporting   rate in all age groups of Myocarditis or 
Pericarditis following the Pfizer vaccine   was 8.7 per million following the second dose 
compared to 6.4 per million following the first   dose. For the Moderna vaccine it was higher it 
was 28.2 per million following the second dose   and 6.6 per million following the first dose. 
What they found though was that the frequency   was highest for individuals between 18 and 24 
and it was much higher following the second dose.   So here Moderna was 263.2 versus 37.4 per million 
doses for the Pfizer vaccine in this age group.   Now this difference in the reporting 
rates persisted when the analysis was   just restricted to the June 1st to August 7th 
period which was the surveillance directive time.   To put it in better perspective Moderna at 
263 per million is a risk of 1 in 3,800.   For the Pfizer second dose their risk was 1 in 
26,000. These numbers are in line with what has   been seen in previous observational reports 
from the USA as well as Israel. These are a   definite increase from the baseline incidence of 
cases that we would expect to see in the general   unvaccinated population. Meaning the vaccine is 
definitely causal here meaning it's causing what   we're seeing. It's possible but not proven that 
the higher frequency with Moderna over Pfizer may   be simply due to the dose of the Moderna vaccine. 
The Moderna dose is a hundred micrograms in each   vaccination whereas the Pfizer MRNA vaccine 
is only 30 micrograms. So there's a threefold   difference there. I would also point out that the 
dose given to people in the 12 to 17 age group are   exactly the same as the adult dose which may not 
be optimal. Many 12 year olds are not fully grown.   I would point out that there have been numerous 
case reports in children between 12 and 18 in a   number of medical journals and Myocarditis reports 
early in the pandemic from Covid-19 infections   they mostly stemmed from an abnormal MRI scan 
without symptoms without ECG abnormalities and   without significant troponin elevations. 
Troponin is a marker for cardiac injury.   There were a handful of flawed medical studies 
which nearly stopped the U.S. college sports   scene last year due to this. Now the pediatric 
cases that I'm talking about post-vaccination   are in contrast to Myocarditis from the 
virus because they had significant troponin   elevations which is a marker of injury. 
They had abnormal MRI scans, abnormal ECGs,   and significantly elevated inflammatory 
markers. Heart ultrasounds also demonstrated   reduced cardiac function in some people with this 
diagnosis. So when it comes to the vaccine these   cases of Myocarditis are definite cases with not 
just a mild abnormality on an MRI but many other   abnormalities seen on their tests. Over the years 
I've managed numerous people with Myocarditis   and Pericarditis in my practice and I point out 
that we would recommend avoiding high intensity   exercise for six months after the diagnosis has 
been made. So it isn't always a benign diagnosis.   It appears rare in the literature thus far 
that vaccine-induced Myocarditis causes   any long-term cardiac dysfunction but there's 
always a small chance of that from the vaccine.   Myocarditis itself can be a serious condition but 
it's been downplayed in the media. So there are   some things to consider moving forward should 
we give a lower dose vaccine in this age group   or simply a single dose. These are important 
considerations. People can feel risk differently.   Some patients fear the illness more than the risk 
of the prevention or treatment. Understanding   concerns of the patient is important to try to put 
the risks and the benefits in context for them.   Parents or the individual may feel 
more risk from the virus than from   the vaccine or even vice versa 
despite whatever data you provide.   There are many factors that come into play such 
as whether the young adult has comorbidities   or whether their parents or grandparents 
that might live with them are at risk also   and if so in this situation it would make sense 
to consider vaccination. This kind of discussion   with your physician is important and of course it 
should be up to the kids and parents to decide.   This is a nuanced decision. This is why in the 
UK they've not been vaccinating people under   the 18 as of September 2021. They're looking for 
more evidence-based data. The data of course can   change with new variants and we do need to be 
ready to change our course if the data changes.   I appreciate you watching till the end today. 
Thanks for joining me on Medicine with Dr. Moran.   I'm Dr. Keith Moran. Get healthy and stay healthy."

about the nova wax vaccines fda briefing document that fda made available before the tomorrow's committee meeting for approval or authorization i'll tell you my immediate reaction number one i think it's not a good thing that they did that secondly looking at that document to me it seems like they'll get the authorization with a label on it that's what i think so but that is just my opinion let's look at the data together what i am really interested and i'm not just saying it to you for no reason i'm really interested in figuring out what do you think is this a uniform behavior of of fda for all companies number one number two if you are in australia or you collect maple art have you seen these data points that fda has in this briefing document and number three i would like you to pay attention to something that is very interesting i would show you what novavex said about fda's concerns and i would like you to see how fda put their concerns together if i spill the beans fda collected data for more than the three zero one study that that one study that nova wax has is three zero one there are other studies three zero two there is study for adolescent expansion fda took all of that data and then said hey we have concerns nova wax looked at i believe 301 and said well the myocarditis is comparable in both placebo and vaccinated group so i would like you to catch that language difference between the two two entities so let's start so these are our gifts for humanity quick references for the um so this is dr bean.com then here this is novavac so let's start with the novavac statement i would read it once more this is june 3. nova back statement on usfda briefing document related to myocarditis pericarditis so they are saying throughout the pandemic let me see if i can make it bigger yes throughout the pandemic as publicly available vaccines have been administered there have been numerous investigations into findings related to myocarditis we have learned that we can expect to see natural background events of myocarditis in any sufficiently large database and that young males are at higher risk of myocarditis is most often caused by often caused by non-specific viral infections then they say the data from our placebo-controlled studies show that overall in our clinical development program the rate of myocarditis was balanced so note their language they are saying it is balanced the rate of myocarditis was balanced between the vaccine and the placebo arms 0.007 percent and 0.005 percent furthermore in the post crossover portions of our studies the cases we have seen are all within expected rate this is their language so they're saying our data shows it's balanced then they say based on our interpretation of all the clinical data supporting noaa wax vaccine including including over 50 000 participants in clinical trials we believe there is insufficient evidence insufficient evidence i don't know why did they not choose the word to say there is not sufficient they should have put the not in there to make it clear sometimes this insufficient i actually read the insufficient as sufficient and then i went back and i said why would the company say sufficient and i read that i missed the in with it so there is insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship we will continue to monitor all adverse events including myocarditis and pericarditis okay so now catch one more thing before we look at the data that is fda would tell you that we looked at 40 000 patients or persons novavax is telling you that they have 50 000 in this third paragraph the studies that i'm going to show the debrief document the briefing document that fda has published that is also coming from fda that document actually shows that there were about 29 000 participants in 301 study there are multiple studies so now we are dancing between the numbers of 30 000 participants versus 40 000 participants versus 50 000 participants this is what's happening okay so please keep this in mind as we progress through the document the question that we are all going to answer together is it correct that there is myocarditis risk and neurological issue pathology risk and thromboembolism risk and if there is any allergic reaction risk that's one and the second is i want you to catch one more language from fda which i was surprised to see in their document i'm gonna put that language in front of you earlier as well they said and we will read the exact words i'm gonna paraphrase it at one part in their document said there are myocarditis occurring and we do not know the long-term outcome it blew my mind that people had been screaming at the top of the lungs to say hey these vaccines may have things that would have long-term effects and these folks were then labeled incorrectly and told that they are just fringe and now all of a sudden fda themselves use the term we not termed the expression we do not know the long term side effects and i was amazed that how they played the same game i think they are not too much in favor of this but that is my opinion and i have no idea we'll find out tomorrow i don't think that fda themselves have much control over the committee so i also think that committee would approve this vaccine and they would simply say here is a label with this one more thing my opinion is after looking at this data and i'll show it to you i think this vaccine for men under 30 is not the right vaccine because it does cause myocarditis and that myocarditis rate is high so with this let's start so this is novo vx this is the novovax news about other things and finally here if somebody from novavax is watching this guys know of x you should make your news more openly available so you used to have the page where you can click and read the news now you have to download the news who's going to download the news to read it and then there are some more references i'll come to that later on there is this as well so of course there is a financial outcome as well so novo x in 2019 early part of the 2019 or 2018. their stock used to be 37 40-ish then in 2019 their stock fell to 4.6 dollar five dollars or even lesser and then their stock went up i think for this vaccine this is 2021 and it went up to 289 and the latest high number was 217 on december 17 2021 so about six months ago and today it is at 47 and it has been falling since fda started offering their concerns so with this let's now look at the data please don't make any decisions based on this discussion over here this is not an advice of financial sort or medical sort this is really looking at the data together and i have their debrief or briefing document here as well and i would show you some parts of this documents as well i have been reading it and marking it since the morning and trying to figure it out so one more thing to keep in mind before we look at the document is because we're going to talk about myocarditis and younger male adults we should know the number so the number it just zipped past me over here it is ten thousand i can tell you off the top of my head i wanted to show you the reference itself so here this is table number six page number 20 it says demographics and other baseline characteristics male 10 367 females 9 368. so total 19735 in the vaccination side and placebo side 9847 this was a two to one ratio vaccination program and so two times the vaccinated versus one time the placebo placebo was saline so 10 367 males including all age groups the four cases of so there were six cases of myocarditis in this vaccination group out of those six actually 40 000 people because fda went and found more cases from other studies too so they say 40 000. so there were four four cases in young males 20 years and lesser two cases of myocarditis in females above 60 years i believe one was 60 and one was six is seven one case of myocarditis in placebo and i believe that was also a woman more than 60 years of age so we look into those so which tells me that prevalence of the cases was in men younger than or equal to 20. there is another thing that was interesting which i did not see from fda before and that was fda actually said that this is caused by vaccine in the other briefing documents that we had been seeing fda would come out and say we don't think it is caused by the vaccine it it seems or maybe not but here look at this this is table number 20. in here let's just look at this after this table and looking at it you can actually then stop this video and do something else i'm gonna go in details as well so here myocarditis and or pericarditis cases in order of time there are total seven cases six in the vaccination group and one in placebo so start here age 16 men male myocarditis dose to two days after the second dose and if you see here fda opinion this is the first time fda actually released a document before the advisory committee with their opinion fda opinion a concern for causal relationship causal they're saying causal they're standing behind their message there then 19 male myocarditis after two days after second dose and there's a causal relationship then 28 male three days after booster so there was i believe those one and two that were 21 days apart there was a booster as well and then a causal relationship to vaccine pericarditis 60 female eight days after those two causal relationship 20 male 10 days after dose one this male also had another illness so history of sore throat and fever eight days prior to the event so he also had sore throat and we know that the sore throat or the infection step can also cause cardiac event so although temporarily related to vaccine so in time related to the first dose of vaccine 10 days erf and non-rheumatic streptococcal myocarditis are also plausible alternative etiologies so acute traumatic fever or acute streptococcus can cause cardiac event as well so they agree to that although usually at this age mostly it doesn't happen but that is a possibility because this patient did have sore throat a week ago and normally sore throat related or streptococcal related cardiac events usually appear after a week or two so the times are kind of in that range as well then is the 67 male those one 28 days after the dose one so 28 days after dose one doesn't look very much like vaccine causing it but this patient also had developed covert so fda agrees that this may be covered or something else then 31 female myocarditis in placebo group and so long time to onset unrelated to placebo so this is their um data now if i can give you a quick if we take this data if we say remember i read to you what novovex said novavac said in our study they are comparable they're equal so fda then went out and i let me read this to you this part this is page number 47. in summary the i had actually drawn all of this and i'm just reading it to you over here in summary the events of myocarditis pericarditis are concerning for a causal association with novobax for the following reasons number one five events were reported within two weeks of vaccination and i agree that is within the vaccination time number two only one event had a clearly identified alternate etiology and that was 67 years man with covet strongly covered strongly associated with myocarditis number three four of the events occurred in young men which is a known population to develop myocarditis so i wanted to use this for a second so 10 000 total men i do not know exactly young men what was their number in this data they have two age stratifications 18 to 64 and 65 and above so 18 to 20 or 30 is not available at least not to me they may have it in their data they will have it in their data so let's just take all the men 10 000 men now ten thousand men at least got two doses you saw that one of them had a booster as well and i don't have that data here so i'm just going to consider two doses that means 20 000 doses right so these four cases occurred in men 10 000 men two doses is 20 000 doses if we do the rough math and we say how many 20 000 in 1 million there are 50 20 000 in a million and that means if you take 4 and multiply it with 50 that makes 200 cases in a million people or million doses now the other cases with messenger for example messenger rna vaccines remember there was a study that showed background rate of 0.5 cases in young adults over 1 million versus the madonna messenger rna was 70 so that was 133 34 times higher here we are seeing 200 per million so there is an increase that we can see now the thing that worries me is that i do not have clarity because this data shows participant counts to be 29 000. then if you see here look at the second part of this highlighted one additionally identification of multiple potential vaccine-associated cases in a pre-market safety database of 40 000 vaccine recipients raises concerns that if causally associated the risk of myocarditis following novex could be higher than reported during post authorization use of mrna covet 19 vaccine so what they're saying is we are seeing 40 000 people not before the authorization and out of those 40 000 people there are number of people who have myocarditis and they're saying with the messenger rna vaccines we saw no myocarditis in the trial phases and when they went out in production in market there were cases so here if we are already seeing cases in the trial then what will happen when we go out in the market so the numbers are all over the place 29 000 here 10 000 men out of which four developed this 40 000 people analyzed by fda then if you go back to what noah wax was saying novavac said he based on our interpretation of all the clinical data supporting noaa wax including over 50 000 participants in clinical trials so they are using 50 000 so as you can tell there is i think the best way to look at this will be to look at those countries that have already authorized it for example australia and then look at their data and here is why i was angry in the beginning i wanted to actually before this discussion go over novovax's news to see which countries are authorized and go and see if i can find data from there but their news cannot be read without downloading it and i refused to download all those f documents to see where my information may be this is just the weirdest thing they did anyways back here then the fda goes into the other cardiac events as well more than myocarditis arrhythmias and hypertensions and other so now let's go back once more to my and i will try not to waste your time now because we have already talked for the majority quick refresher it's a subprotein based vaccine spikes and that is why it is not going to be entering any other random cell it will have to be picked up by the immune system cells matrix m is the adjuvant it is already authorized in many countries fda advisory committee meeting is tomorrow fda has already given their opinion and concerns i read to you this statement from novovax the study 301 that we are seeing it this is actually still an ongoing study it is a randomized observer blind placebo-controlled crossover study september 27 2021 people crossed over from one side to the other placebo used was saline 29 945 people we looked at this it started on december 27 2020 the enrollment completed on february 18 my birthday 2021. 19735 in the vaccine group 9847 in the placebo group those one and those two the distance between them is 21 days 5 microgram gram of the spike protein material and 50 microgram of the matrix m age stratification we discussed it before 18 to 64 and 65 that is how they stratified they wanted to make sure that 25 of the population is above 65 65 and above plus they also tried to bring in as many folks with the high risk so high risk were prioritized efficacy was overall 90.41 so there were 17 cases of the covet in 17 272 people who are followed up on the vaccine side on the placebo side out of 8385 there were 79 cases clearly there is a difference 0.098 was the case rate on the vaccinated side and 0.942 percent was the case rate on the placebo side 18 to 64 there were 15 cases out of 15 220 or 0.099 and in 18 to 64 on the placebo side it was 1.01 so efficacy there in 18 to 64. 91 if you can see greater than 64 65 and above as efficacy was actually lower 78.63 75 and above 100 but that number was in i think 300 total so 75 plus the efficacy was 100 but the count was really small now we looked at this myocarditis and i wanted to read to you this one part which i did not see these authorities ever acknowledging even and people who were talking about long-term outcomes they were shunned and look at this available data from short-term follow-up suggests that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms so they became better we agree with that although information is not yet available about potential log terms equally how about that have you read this kind of a statement with any other vaccine data if you have please tell me i may have missed it so fda said of particular interest this is their page 44. of particular interest were events of myocarditis and pericarditis post marketing data from the individuals receiving messenger rna vaccines have demonstrated so we did that right this was very interesting the blue part and they said the spike protein antigen can induce antibodies to sustain spike glycoprotein that cross react with myocardia myocardial contractile proteins including myocardial alpha myosin heavy chain this is not new to us we know that antibodies have been the or immune reactions are a possibility for vascular and cardiac damage then the table that i showed you in the beginning table number 20 where there are total six cases on the vaccine side one on the placebo side we went over those as well four caused by vaccine according to fda two possibly vaccine or something else then i read this to you already so we're good now we're going to move on from cardiac and if you are someone who is interested in knowing more after the myocarditis the fda briefing documents then talk about other cardiac events that happened as well for example rhythmias and other such things so if you see here acute infarction angina pectoralis coronary artery disease myocardial infarction acute coronary syndrome coronary artery occlusion stress cardiomyopathy ischemic heart cardiomyopathy so they have them all over here so if you see for example remember the number of patients were persons were double on the vaccine side compared to placebo so if you see the number of the cases as double then that is still equal because the number are double over here for example if you see number of cases 15 cardiac events in the vaccine side and 77 on the placebo side that is equal 0.1 on both sides and similarly if you continue to go down acute myocardial infarction 2 on the vaccine side and 4 on the placebo so actually placebo had more so you can look at that plus you can read some more over here where they go one topic at a time and discuss the situation for example in the post crossover period through september 27 a total of 53 out of 21 714 or 0.2 percent participants who received vac nova x either in the pre or post-crossover period experienced adverse events in the soc cardiac disorders symptoms of the of the 61 events 40 were serious including three fatal events one event each of cardiac arrest and myocardial infarction and one event of alcoholic myo cardiomyopathy the time to onset of the fatal event from the most recent novovax those was eight days for an event of cardiac arrest and more than 80 days for the remaining events so they have actually gone in this kind of detail to provide more information so here additional data provided at fda's request in a data set with a cutoff date of february 17 2022 was used to assess additional accrued adverse events of cardiac events in the post crossover period so crossover occurred on september 27 2021 so some people who are in placebo came to the vaccinated side meaning they were vaccinated and then some from the vaccine went to placebo site an imbalance in the proportion of participants was observed for the term of acute myocardial infarction heart attack n equals 6 over 6 146 so 0.09 in participants crossed over to know of x and n equals 4 0.03 percent in crossover to placebo so those who crossed over and received the nova wax 0.09 percent developed heart attacks those who crossed over and received placebo 0.03 percent had heart attacks and coronary artery diseases so once again coronary artery disease zero point zero eight percent for normal vaccine zero point zero one percent for placebo so that's a huge difference at least in terms of percentages in aggregate terms associated with myocardial infarction were reported by 18 by 6 146 or 0.3 percent participants who crossed over to receive novex compared to 0.1 percent of participants who crossed over to receive placebo so they have more data in here so then they say in summary numerical imbalances were noted between the treatment arms with respect to events of cardiac failure and cardiomyopathy including some events in closed temporal proximity to vaccination so close time cardiac events including fatal events of cardiac arrest and myocardial infarction were reported with closed temporal relationship to nova wax vaccine however the proportion of participants with fatal serious and ischemic cardiac events were generally balanced across the treatment arms for the blinded pre-crossover period with comparable times so before crossover they seem to be comparable after crossover there was an imbalance [Music] enough electric reaction so let's just quickly go over these allergic reaction no issues no issues at least according to the data so 0.01 percent developed allergic reactions on the vaccine side 0.02 developed allergic reactions on placebo sign of nervous system issues or neurological issues this is interesting stroke-like events or symptoms signs and symptoms that were stroke-like 0.06 percent on the vaccination side and 0.02 on placebo sites there is an imbalance 11 strokes or stroke like syndromes or stroke like um clinical presentation 11 out of 19 000 and here 2 out of nine thousand i'm rounding the numbers so there is a imbalance in these strokes after crossover the stroke count was higher in placebo then gaya berry syndrome 0.2 percent on the vaccine side 0.3 on the placebo side pre-crossover 0.2 percent on the vaccine and 0.3 on the placebo post crossover so equal so balanced then thrombotic events pre-crossover on the vaccine side 0.14 events that looked like thromboembolism and placebo had 0.16 percent that's 11 deaths on the novavex vaccine side five deaths in the placebo side so once again vaccine number or people getting vaccination but double compared to placebo so percentage is the same 0.1 so this is page 58 i have the page numbers here four had clear etiology so this is interesting that even after this 0.1 percent on both sides fd actually goes out and says out of these 11 four had clear etiologies and then there are some doubts on the other so if you go to page 59. this is page 59. so what they do is if you see here of the 11 deaths in the novovax arm four had a clear alternative etiology including toxicity to various agents cocaine fentanyl heroin intoxication accidental overdose alcohol and prescription drugs gunshot wound to the head and septic shock pneumonia and blood culture positive to streptococcus the remaining seven are here so remaining seven so do you see the verbiage four had a clear alternative etiology what does that invoke in your head seven did not have a clear alternate etiology now let's look at them 75 year old female with a history of hypertension experienced a fatal cardiovascular accident 48 days following the second dose although no clear alternative etiology is identified for the cba this participant had several risk factors for cva including her age and a history of hypertension so they say we don't see any other reason than to say if it is not vaccine then it is her age and the history of hypertension the temporal distance the time distance from the most recent vaccination less more than 45 days ago make a causative association with novobax unlikely and the sponsor and nev investigator assessment investigators assessment that the cv is not related is reasonable so they didn't actually put it over here this because they said over here the wording is clear alternative so then these things did not fall in clear then here a total of five cardiac arrests were reported 0.03 percent of participants the time to onset for each of them were 12 and 58 days following the most recent fatal adverse events of cardiac arrest were reported 12 and 21 days after the first novabx vaccine 12 to 21 days after the first dose of normal wax in a 44 year old female and a 66 year old male respectively both of whom were found pulseless and unable to be resuscitated the three remaining fatal events of cardiac arrest occurred 23 days 40 days and 58 days post second dose in participants 39 50 and 45 years of age these are young ages no autopsy data were available for any of these participants of the five participants with fatal cardiac arrests four had co-morbidities as well as histories of substance use including cocaine meth alcohol and one death was attributed to overdose so then they say at this time there is insufficient information to assess for causality to novovax vaccine and fda's assessment vex vaccination cannot be definitively excluded as a contributory factor so for these fda says we can't say this was not the vaccine then they say there were three similar events of cardiac arrest on day 6 8 and 14 post dose 1 in the placebo arm 0.03 percent which suggests that the co cases in the novo vxr may reflect background rates of the cardiac arrest in the study population unrelated to vaccination this whole thing was treated differently in other documents in other documents they simply said a similar count was seen in placebo it seems to be balanced here they provided all this information they created a lot of concern and then they said maybe this is the same for everyone in placebo versus noaa wax because if you see here a total of five cardiac arrests were reported 0.03 percent of the participants then they say in the placebo there were three similar events of cardiac arrest which is also 0.03 so anyways it this document made me very confused about what to think about the vaccine and i had to continuously remind myself that there are other countries that have approved or authorized it we should look at the data there as well a 79 year old female with a history of hypertension hyperlipidemia sleep apnea and obesity bmi 43 experienced a fatal myocardial infarction 79 years 64 days following the second dose this participant's age and comorbidities are significant risk factor for myocardial infarction in the context of these risk factors and temporal distance time distance from vaccination more than two months the sponsor and investigators assessment that the event is not related is reasonable so then they say in summary there are no deaths that appear to be clearly causally related to vaccine fatal events were generally balanced across the treatment arms with respect to time to onset and number of cardiac related events however the lack of autopsy information for multiple fatal events of cardiac arrest following novo x limits assessment of causality so what do you think with these how does it make you feel about this vaccine we are reading a document i'm trying i'm not adding any or removing anything from here how does it make you feel so then there are serious side effects and serious events i'll just read one or two and then we'll stop the most common serious adverse effects occurring at higher rates in the nova wax arm than placebo arm were cerebral vascular accidents and cholecystitis the gallbladder side acute 0.04 in vaccine and 0 in placebo so seven cases in vaccine and zero in placebo of cholecystitis atrial fibrillation zero point zero four percent in vaccine eight cases versus two cases in placebo and pneumonia aspiration and spontaneous abortion zero point zero percent in vaccine four cases versus zero cases in placebo so spontaneous abortion is what they brought up here as well the small number of cases of spontaneous abortion and pneumonia aspiration do not suggest a causal relationship the most common serious adverse effect occurring at higher rates in placebo arm than the noaa wax arm was pneumonia covet and suicidal ideation a total of five participants in the nova wax arm 0.03 and 3 in the placebo 0.03 experience severe adverse events that were considered related by the investigators so then they have a discussion of those events as well as you can see here so this is the discussion i wanted to make sure that we go over the myocarditis discussion today and try to understand what they're saying it from the data it does seem like if you extrapolate it it is a higher number what is missing for me yet is to compare it to the other countries i actually try to go to australia's official site here however in this australian government nova wax vaccine rare side effects so i went there rare side effects after the novomax vaccines are severe allergic reactions which in this data that you saw from fda says balanced some covert 19 vaccines have been linked with the rare side effect of myocarditis and pericarditis the risk after the novovax vaccine is not yet known a small number of cases of myocarditis were reported in the clinical trial though it is not yet known if these were caused by vaccine so this is australia saying here you can see clearly fda saying four cases 28 years and younger out of 10 000 men 20 000 doses are known of x they said in their document caused by here australia is saying that is not yet known if these were caused by vaccine the tga and the australian technical advisory group on immuno are monitoring the safety of vaccines find out more about myocarditis and pericarditis so i thought they would have the data here but that's not the data it's just the definition of what these diseases are then i thought the risk can benefit so maybe they would have the risk and benefits but actually risks and benefits they only write the benefits of vaccinations with no vaccines greatly outweigh the risk of side effects so i think that this is not the best way to handle the data meeple art is here so we'll ask nepal art for where to find the australian data australia is not a police state the media blew up a few protesters okay so so this is the discussion thank you very much for your time your attention what i am really sincerely am curious because i told you this document made me confused so what is your experience what is your knowledge what data have you seen what do you feel about this situation and please do me a favor please like subscribe and share in the description of this video there are links if you would like to buy dr bean plan that

Why The U.S. Should Trust The Covid-19 Vaccine",2020-12-22,1413547,11601,12829,UCvJJ_dzjViJCoLf5uKUTwoA," You're looking at video of Sandra
Lindsay, an intensive care nurse, receiving the first vaccination at Long
Island Jewish Medical Center in New York. The U.S. began vaccinating the population against
the coronavirus in December of 2020. The goal is to get the Covid
vaccine to every person in the U.S. who wants one. But survey data shows
that nearly 40% of the U.S. population doesn't want it. Widespread mistrust might have something to
do with the fact that if anything goes wrong with the vaccine,
the drug makers that produce them aren't responsible. This is a remarkable circumstance. It's certainly not like anything
anybody's ever seen before. That means that companies like Pfizer
and Moderna have total immunity against lawsuits related to injuries
resulting from taking the Covid vaccines. Meanwhile, employers are legally
allowed to require employees to get immunized against the virus. Requiring a vaccine is a health and
safety work rule and employers can do that. Ultimately, if we want any chance
and returning to life is normal, mass vaccination is going
to be critical. So how do you convince the public to
take a vaccine made in record time, using technology that's never
before been licensed? And is anyone to blame
if something goes wrong? Frontrunners Pfizer and Moderna built their
Covid vaccines with a new kind of technology that's never before
been licensed in the U.S. Typically a vaccine puts a weakened or
inactivated virus into our bodies to trigger an immune response. But the coronavirus vaccine relies on
messenger RNA, which contains a piece of genetic code with
instructions for our body. The mRNA tells our cells
to make a protein. The same protein that's a spike
on top of the actual Coronavirus. This is what triggers the immune
response to Covid-19, which then produces antibodies. Those antibodies are what
ultimately protect us from getting infected if we ever
encounter the real thing. Both companies have said that taking
their vaccines could result in side effects similar to mild covid symptoms
like muscle pain, chills and a headache. Even those side effects
of the vaccine resemble Covid-19 symptoms, it's impossible to contract
the coronavirus from the vaccine because the mRNA vaccines that Pfizer and
Moderna are making don't use the live virus. I experienced stiffness pain in
my left arm where I had gotten the vaccine, but it was mild. The second dose was a
different story for Batalvi. After the injection, I had the
same side effects as the first. So the localized pain, stiffness, there
was a little bit worse. More significant symptoms
presented that evening. I had developed a low grade
fever and stuff associated with that. So the fatigue had worsened. I had gotten chills. Other trial participants from both the
Pfizer and Moderna studies have reported similar issues after
the second shot. One Pfizer trial participant told CNBC that
after the booster shot, he woke up with chills, shaking so
hard he cracked a tooth. For him, it hurt to even
just lay in his bed sheet. But this kind of
reaction isn't the norm. Both of these vaccines are about 95%
effective, but it's still unclear how long this protection lasts, which is
what worries some doctors more than the potential for any sort
of long-term side effects. There is a concern that once
the initial response against the vaccine wanes, that we might
see more disease. And that is why all the
Phase 3 clinical trials against Covid continue to run, even after
demonstrating the early efficacy. One major benefit of the mRNA technology
is how quickly it can be developed. And that is one of the
reasons why the messenger RNA technology was sort of first in line right
after knowing the virus' genetic sequence. But the Covid vaccine's faster manufacturing
timeline is part of what has been fueling widespread fear that it's
unsafe to get the shot. Experts, however, say the process was
no less rigorous than usual. A lot of the steps that would occur
in sequence in the past, has been occurring in parallel during Covid, but
they were not eliminated in terms of determining the safety
of the vaccine. The FDA may have cleared the
Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use. But mass adoption?
It's not guaranteed. Roughly 4 in 10 Americans say they
would ""definitely or probably not"" get a vaccine. While this is lower than it
was two months ago, to achieve herd immunity, experts say that about 70%
of the population needs to be vaccinated or have
natural antibodies. Central to closing the trust gap
is a robust and reliable national education campaign. The Department of Health and Human Services
is slated to spend $250 million in taxpayer money on this effort. But this push by the federal government
to educate the public has been plagued by controversy. For everything from allegedly trying to
politicize the message, to concern over the lengthy delay and rolling
out the targeted messaging that was promised. At least 15 states told NBC
News in early December, they weren't waiting for the HHS campaign. Instead, they launched their own
communication campaigns to expedite the message. The private sector is
also playing a big role. It's everyone's responsibility. And what we do know is that
pharmacy and pharmacists are actually in everyone's community. We have pharmacists who are within 5
miles of probably 90% of Americans. Really, pharmacists are up there as one
of the most trusted health care professionals. And the survey recently said
that 3 of 4 Americans basically said they trust pharmacists
to administer their Covid-19 vaccine. Closing the Covid vaccine
trust gap will prove especially difficult in communities of color, which
have been hit hardest by the pandemic. Black Americans, for example, are
dying from Covid-19 it almost 3 times the rate of
White Americans in the U.S. That's part of why federal health
officials have talked about giving priority access to the vaccine
to people of color. But there is an
overwhelming resistance to inoculation. A survey released at the end of November
2020, found that only 14% of Black Americans ""mostly or completely trust"" a Covid
vaccine will be safe and 18 % trust that it will be effective
in shielding them from the Coronavirus. We've had continued mistrust because of
people who have been frankly abused within the health care system. Not treated respectfully, not approaching
a culturally competent manner, denied access to care. Experts say the memory of the
Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment has also fueled suspicion. For 40 years, starting
in 1932, the U.S. Public Health Service used Black men to
conduct a study of the progression of the lethal Syphilis disease. And because of racism, overt racism
and even microinsults that have occurred to people of color
in the health system. You know, people developed
a degree of mistrust. Combating this narrative may take
a more targeted approach. The National Medical Association, of which
Benjamin is a member, is convening a group of Black doctors for
an expert task force that will independently assess the safety and
efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines. We know that patients trust their doctors,
and many of the surveys have shown that if their physician recommends it,
they are much more likely to take the vaccine. If you suffer
severe side effects after getting the vaccine, there's basically no one
to blame in a U.S. court of law. Take
the vaccine makers. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex
Azar invoked the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act in February
of 2020, which protects the makers of Covid products such as
vaccines and treatments from legal action. This protection
lasts until 2024. Essentially, in order to encourage companies
to get into the space, to develop vaccines for the good of
the public, for public health. The government comes up with a
program which immunizes those companies from liability for any injuries or
damages caused by taking the vaccine. That means for the next four years,
companies like Pfizer and Moderna can't be sued for money damages in
court over injuries related to the administration or use of products to
treat or protect against Covid-19. But drug makers, like Pfizer, continue
to reassure the public no shortcuts were taken. This vaccine is getting
approved by all authorities in the world, so that should
say something to them. Pfizer and Moderna did not return CNBC's
request for comment on their legal protections. But remember, it was the
FDA that actually cleared the vaccine for use. So does the federal
government bear any responsibility? You can't sue the FDA for approving
or disapproving a drug, that's part of its sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity traces back to
British law before the American Revolution. You couldn't
sue the king. The U.S. adopted that same principle. There are limited exceptions, but legal
experts say they don't provide a viable legal path to hold the
government responsible for a Covid vaccine injury. And the workplace now introduces
a unique set of legal challenges related to the vaccine. Once the FDA upgrades its emergency authorization
to a full approval in a few months from now, there's
speculation that employers could require staff to get inoculated. The clients of mine that are most
interested in making a mandatory vaccine a condition of employment are brick and
mortar operations that have a lot of foot traffic from their customers. They view it as a selling point. Look, you can come to our business
location and it's safe because all employees have been vaccinated. That's particularly important for restaurants,
bars, gyms and salons. While this is in part a PR tactic,
it is also legally within an employer's rights to roll out
this kind of requirement. Requiring a vaccine is a health and
safety work rule and employers can do that. Now, some employees could apply
to be exempt from a blanket requirement. If a workforce is
unionized, the collective bargaining agreement may require negotiating with
the union before mandating a vaccine. Anti-Discrimination laws also provide
some protections, but legal experts say that if an employee is forced
to get a vaccine and suffers a debilitating injury from it, claims
would be routed through workers compensation programs and treated as
an on the job injury. So if you're looking for accountability,
you're probably going to have to use other accountability tools
beside the court. If you're looking for compensation,
you should use a government compensation program. The National
Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, better known by the name ""Vaccine Court"",
is relatively easy to use and generous in terms of what it's willing
to pay out to those who are eligible. But because the Covid vaccine
has not yet been recommended for routine administration to pregnant women
or children, it doesn't qualify. Another program, and the only real pool
of cash available to those harmed by the Covid vaccine is a
fund attached to the PREP Act. The so-called Countermeasures Injury Compensation
Program has been around for a decade, but experts specializing in
vaccine law say it's a lot more difficult to navigate. The problem with the PREP Act is
that it's attached to a government compensation program that's very hard to
use, where the bar for compensation is very high. Since the program began 10 years ago,
the CICP has only compensated 29 claims, totaling more
than $6 million. If a case for compensation through
the CICP is successful however, the program provides up to $50,000/year for
reimbursed lost wages and any out-of-pocket medical expenses. It won't cover legal fees nor anything
to compensate for pain and or suffering. It's also capped at the
death benefit of $370,376, which is the most that a surviving family member
receives in the event that a Covid vaccine proves to be fatal. There's also a strict one year statute,
meaning that all claims have to be filed within 12 months
of getting the vaccine. People who are harmed by Covid-19
vaccine deserve to be compensated. Compensated fast and generously. The PREP Act doesn't do that. The HRSA declined CNBC's
request for an interview. Reiss says the best fix is to
change the rulebook of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. An easy solution is to say: ""Anyone
harmed by the Covid-19 vaccine is compensated under that program. But that will
require legislative change. Should that legislative change happen, lawyers
tell CNBC that there usually is a retroactive provision once a new
vaccine is added to the VICP. That would be good news for those
injured by the Covid vaccine, who would then have access to a much larger pool
of cash that has a better track record for rewarding compensation. But for now, it remains to be
seen whether Congress will actually make the change, meaning that compensation
options are limited. I'm hoping people don't look at this and
say: ""Heck, I'm limited in what I can recover in the event of a serious
injury or the event of any injury. So I'm not going to take it
or it's not overreaching by the government whatsoever. It's the government doing what
it should be doing, which is protecting the public
health, generally."

to compensate those injured or even killed as a result of side effects from the covid19 vaccine we have a simple question tonight is the covid19 vaccine safe to debate this i'm delighted to welcome virologist professor george lemonassoff american infectious disease physician amish adagia consultant pathologist dr claire craig author and journalist naomi wolf and actor john boe naomi has a book out and we'll uh be joined by naomi shortly i'll let you know all about her latest book so let's get to this is the kovid 19 vaccine safe professor george lemonisov well of course there are actually several different vaccines um which have been used um and i think just looking at the latest figures a total of about 12 billion doses have been supplied worldwide um and i think was pushing about five billion uh people have had you know the full full dose of them which is getting onto a very large percentage of the population now i mean any treatment any medical intervention i mean there are always some risks but i mean with that sheer number um of uh doses of ministers if there were a you know systematic risk and it was somehow a dangerous thing to do and remember of course covert itself is a dangerous disease especially in the vulnerable i think you know you'd be seeing several million people reporting these symptoms um but as far as i can tell and looking at all the you know the data i can find i mean there are you know sad cases where individuals that there is and something happens after the vaccination whether it's directly caused maybe you'll never know um and certainly if someone's suffering um what wants to help them but i mean generally i think the the vaccination program has been a very good thing um and any side effects i mean might be unpleasant to an individual um have been very minor compared with what you know with with all vaccines there is some very slight risk although professor lamonisoff if the vaccine is safe for example the astra zenica vaccine why is it not administered to those under 30 in the uk well i mean you do get certain vaccines or certain treatments are recommended or not recommended for different groups of people um so i mean there's you know there's not always a panacea you look at you know the dose for say paracetamol is different for under 12s and about 12. so you always get that kind of thing because people's immune systems are at different stages when uh of different ages and so you you know you don't administer many vaccine the coverage vaccines to no young infants possibly in that case because it's just not very effective so they're all those kind of things you don't tend to just have a universal formulation for everyone uh dr claire craig is the covid19 vaccine as innocuous as paracetamol well no it's not i mean everybody has accepted the regulators have accepted that there were cutting problems that there's the government have a document out about guillain-barre syndrome we know about myocarditis and pericarditis issues so you know there are some conditions that's absolutely accepted that there have been problems and there are the real issue we have is that the problems haven't been measured so an foi came out today showing that the cdc had written out a protocol for what was to happen to follow up a signal and the intention was that they would measure the incidence over time so you see if something that was rarer has become more common and they laid this all out very clearly their methodology and didn't do it they didn't do what they said they would do to find the issues so if they're not looking properly you won't find them and what we also saw was instead of situation with the tail wagging the dog where there were no deaths related to the vaccine zero until the regulators said there is this problem with the brain clots and then we've had a handful of brain clock deaths that have been certified as being due to the vaccine so in theory what should happen is the doctor should be calling it out and then the regulator can say we've got an issue here but the doctors are waiting for the regulator to say it before they're calling it out and so in that situation you can't trust the data but you can see problems in the excess mortality they're not huge problems but in the young in particular there are been too many excess deaths and that's seen across different countries and we've had too many cardiac arrest calls way too many now cardiac arrest calls are fairly common so to see a signal in the cardiac arrest cause is a really big concern uh dr amesh adalja could you tell us whether you think the kovit 19 vaccine is safe i think the code 19 vaccine is a very safe vaccine and i think the best way to think about this is the relative risk benefit that you get with the vaccine you can't just look at the vaccine on its own you have to think about what cova 19 represents how many millions of people that have died from it and what the risk is of the vaccine versus the benefits you get from the vaccine and when you look at it yes there are some rare side effects like bling brain cuts that occur that are being addressed myocarditis that's being addressed you have to then juxtapose that to the great benefit you get from the vaccine and not look at only one side of it often people who talk about the safety of the vaccine don't actually mention any of the benefits the hundreds of thousands of lives that have been saved by people who have gotten vaccinated including myself on as soon as i was able to be vaccinated so i i think that when you look at the amount of data that's there and look at the risk and benefit this vaccine is outweigh the benefits outweigh the risk in almost every scenario that we can we can see because we're not this isn't something we're taking for no reason we're taking it to fight coven 19 to prevent covet 19 from overwhelming our hospitals and it clearly does that uh john bowe you've set up a charity uh a gofundme page i believe that will aim to support the victims of covet 19 vaccine injuries what's your view about the safety of the vaccine i don't believe it's safe i if you will indulge me i'd like to read an extract from an article that uh dr tess laurie who's on the committee of the world council for health which i predict in the future will take over from the world health organization when that is finally discredited it's a brief statement there is a mountain of evidence including the testimonies of so many who've been harmed to show that these injections are not fit for purpose they do not work they are not safe they systematically destroy our immune system and they contain secret ingredients that have not been disclosed to the public purportedly to protect pharmaceutical manufacturers commercial interests but what about our interests what about informed consent now all these esteemed and uh extremely well qualified people have made their comments about the vaccine but we're only talking about so far already we have uh myocarditis pericarditis we have uh terrible skin rashes and blisters we have thrombosis blood clotting there's some cases of spongiform encephalitis and now certain pathologists are talking and people who've been doing autopsies and post-mortems are suggesting that we're coming into a period of accelerated cancers and other problems i mean we don't know where this is going to go well john when we get to accelerated cancers are we not in the world of speculation at that point yes of course of course but they're seeing it already i i don't need to justify what i'm saying uh because we're in a situation a bit like during the um during the the pandemic you know did somebody die with covid or of covid this muddied the whole water and now because we don't the bear system was a complete failure the yellow card system is a complete failure i mean i i don't know of any relative of mine who was asked before they were injected um you know here's your yellow card do you know about the yellow class and can can you go to the no no one was ever asked so this is a complete bogus assessment of what's happened to people george i worry about where it's going yeah george lemonasoff um my personal view is that if you're 75 or 80 with a high body mass index and asthma you'd be stark raving mad not to have the vaccine but the vast majority of the healthy population don't need it so why take the risk even if it's a rare one well you can probably argue about that against the vaccine against any disease that a given individual is probably that the odds are against you getting it but it's all about uh or in a serious way the trouble is you continue to transmit it and you make life much worse for those who are vulnerable i mean they basically well hasn't hasn't hasn't that ship passed already the idea that the kova 19 vaccine stops transmission professor lemonsoft bill gates himself an investor in vaccines has uh has been uh he said quite disappointed about the fact that the vaccine doesn't stop transmission well i mean it's not perfect and that's for sure i mean it's not 100 effective so of course that's not gonna you know completely eliminate it you'll still get it but it does certainly seem to knock down the rate of transmission um and also um of course and stop such serious diseases and you made a comment about paracetamol that wasn't just the facetious comment i made there's quite a lot of people die every year through paracetamol poisoning um and that's actually in some ways a drug of suicide um and uh so that you know even something as apparently innocuous as that can have side effects amish adulterer nobody has convinced me as to why the healthy population need this vaccine the healthy population i recommend get this vaccine because why suffer through cova 19 even if it doesn't land you in the hospital even if you don't get severe disease why would you want to have a more severe case of it than you needed to why not be on your feet faster why make it why not have it be an innocuous illness why not have to to have to to call off work there's so many diseases that we vaccinate for that don't have a big impact on the person getting vaccinated but they're almost like a nuisance infection it's an innocuous disease for most anyway even at the start of the pandemic uh with the early covet variants the british government was saying that a third of people will have no symptoms they said act like you've got it that doesn't sound like a virus for which everybody should be vaccinated well i think that not everybody has asymptomatic infection and there are people who are tired coughing have fevers and chills why not prevent that what's wrong with the vaccine there's there's no the vaccine is safe and effective why not prevent yourself from getting that infection and there is some proportion of people that do get long coveted symptoms that we don't quite understand but the thing is we're talking about a safe and effective vaccine this not as if this vaccine has major side effects that are that that outweigh its benefit and i think why not prevent this infection if you can prevent it with a vaccine that is easy to to take how can it be safe and effective how can it be safe and effective when it lasts for about seven weeks i believe uh you can tell me whether or not that is true effectively lasts for about seven weeks and your body's filled with millions of mrna uh uh uh spike proteins which it takes the body i believe you can tell me what this is true because i'm not a doctor you tell me whether this is true it takes the body at least 12 to 13 months to flush these spike proteins out of the system that's completely not true and what what's important to remember is yet the protection against infection may wear off in in several weeks especially with omron variants to protect against severe disease hospitalization and death is intact and it does make you less likely to get infected and i think that what's going on here is people are just minimizing the benefits of this vaccine and really only looking at the the harms that they have picked up the misinformation about this vaccine and much of it is being asserted in the absence of evidence or in defiance of evidence is it misinformation that the mrna spike proteins cause blood clots it's it what we know is that certain blood clots are occurring in people who got the johnson johnson and astrozenica oh is it just john john let the doctor speak so so blood clots can occur in rare circumstances with certain of the vaccines astrazeneca and johnson and johnson vaccines but i think it's also important to remember that the the virus itself causes blood clots including strokes and pulmonary emboli and blood clots in the legs people minimize what covalent 19 can cause and then only focus on one side of this equation when they go after these vaccines which i think are some of the safest vaccines with most of the most transparent that we've ever seen i think we're in a real danger now of attacking vaccines attacking science and the scientists and the rationality and the reason behind them with this kind of these arbitrary assertions that are are made without any kind of evidence without any kind of experience of taking care of covet 19 patients which i've been doing since the very beginning of this pandemic and was in the hospital even today i i think that there's just so much wrong with this debate and the way it's being framed that that i think that science is going to be under siege for for some time and we're already seeing this bleed into our influenza vaccination campaigns our measles vaccination campaigns uh this is just something that we never thought we would really be facing at this stage in the pandemic because people actively go into med science well dr ajala i completely uh understand uh what you're saying about that but isn't it because of things like vaccine mandates where people lost their job if they didn't get the vaccine surely the policy the strategy around vaccines should have been here's the nature of the disease the vaccine is available take it or leave it as is the case with all other vaccines i think that the policy prescriptions of ma government mandating vaccines was wrong it created a backlash it gave a lot of the anti-vaccine people fodder i think what we the vaccines sell themselves they are so valuable that they shouldn't need to be mandated and i think mandates by the government really have no place when it comes to to vaccination and that's a separate issue and i think that there are major policy failures that have emboldened the anti-vaccine groups uh uh unfortunately well yes and i i think that's the issue isn't it claire craig it's the coercive nature of the rollout which makes people concerned about having the jab absolutely the way it's been pushed the way that people have been patronized has meant people have totally lost faith in public health public health have played a terrible terrible role with this and i'd like to come back on two of the other points that were made if i may um one of them is that the dodger was making trying to really emphasize the pathology caused by the spike protein which is absolutely the case a spike protein causes all sorts of pathology it interacts with the endothelial cells it causes the plotting it can go into the brain it's a horrible horrible protein and he's recommending injecting people with it that's what he's recommending now and just to talk about him claiming that it saved thousands of lives it should keep banding around this claim it's absolute nonsense you just compare geographical regions next door to each other with high and low vaccination rates we've got eastern europe which has a huge range of vaccination rates no difference in excess deaths none the excess deaths were the same israel palestine massive difference excess deaths are the same you can do the same with counties around the usa you can do the same in any way you know that the the claim does not stand up it just does not stand up um george lemonisov i'm triple jabbed but i believe it's got to be personal choices to whether you have the vaccine i don't think it's right that in order to travel or go to work that you should have had to have the vaccine personal choices got to be the way forward um have we not also in the course of this pandemic enjoyed sorry ignored the issue of natural immunity the fact that for the healthy population to get covered is the ultimate vaccine you get coveted you recover and you have great antibodies well that you know was one thought that might happen but sadly with the various new omicron strains um natural infections don't seem to be that great of protecting you so um people don't fully understand why the strains vary in for such a way but you can certainly get it again and that's something which has in a sense been a bit disappointing that that it it's not like say um measles or chicken pox or something that you know you get lifelong immunity it and that's obviously connected to it wearing off which will happen with the vaccine as well so that's why you get repeated and boosted um but you know it is an issue i mean the point is about vaccines you do give them to healthy people they're prophylactic i mean you don't wait until somebody's ill and i'll just put a contrast with the current situation i mean i'm old enough you know to be aware of you know the polio situation in the 50s and but you know in the uk i mean people who got polio everyone's heard of it and we can think of ian jury victim of polio um it was a few hundred a year but they didn't stop people saying we'll have a vaccination campaign against it because it's you know we we want to eliminate that and you're giving that in um initially a kill vaccine than a live attenuated one to prevent you know even those matter of hundreds a year to prevent that horrible scourge um and so it seems an awful thing to say we don't want to do that now with diseases the clock is against us final thoughts john beau the doctor to my right was very uh dismissive and didactic about misinformation and disinformation but i always thought that science was about debate okay don't debate me i'm just an actor but debate uh dr peter mccullough dr pierre corey dr robert malone dr ryan cole why don't we ever see those people in this debate and you talk about myocarditis uh you know it can be caused by covet as well but it's a different kind of uh myocarditis that you get with covid than you get with um the injections and i got that from a cardiologist uh yes i mean a doctor uh adulterer i want you to share your concluding thoughts uh picking up on what john has said but also i mean i know it's easy to choose isolated examples but it was well reported that the award-winning bbc radio presenter lisa shaw died of covid vaccine complications this was days after her first astrazeneca dose she was a slim woman in good health at the age of 44. the bottom line is and i know it's an isolated example but if she hadn't had the vaccine she'd still be with us and she in her profile is not someone that needed the vaccine i think that there are tragic cases where individuals have severe side effects but when you're looking at the vaccine program as a whole you have to weigh the risks and the benefits and there are always going to be rare cases where something may happen really tragically as has happened in the case that you're presenting but that doesn't erase the benefit that the vaccine provides overall and i think we've understood why the astrazeneca vaccine has that risk and i would just a couple of last comments you talked about the spike protein the best way to get spike protein through your body is actually getting infected so that's if you're worried about what the spike protein does to your body the best way to prevent that from happening is be vaccinated and on myocarditis it is very different the myocarditis you get from cova than the vaccine the vaccine-induced myocarditis is very transient very mild does not cause severe complications so it is a much better type of myocarditis to get anyway but no no no my cardiologist said exactly the opposite well it is different but it's it's a milder myocarditis you can look at the data on the patients that have had myocarditis from the vaccine it is mild they do not have severe complications they are transiently hospitalized very different than myocarditis from covet 19 which i've taken care of both a debate that will continue what a fascinating and important conversation i'm grateful to all of you for your good manners and ability to listen to opposing points of view my thanks to virologist professor george lemonasoft u.s infectious disease physician amish adulterer consultant pathologist dr claire craig and actor

426,tGs0ucefm38,Mini Episode 2: mRNA COVID 19 Vaccine In Pregnancy,"Many pregnant people are hesitant to get vaccinated against COVID-19 despite worse clinical outcomes (hospitalization and death) if they do fall sick. Here, I review three of many peer reviewed articles clearly showing the safety of mRNA COVID vaccines in 10,000 to 100,000+ pregnant people and infants from four different countries. 

The CDC and professional medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and several more recommend COVID-19 vaccination at any point in pregnancy. Despite this there is hesitancy that can be deadly for both mother and child. 

I invite you to read more on this topic yourself and I have also provided a list of peer reviewed articles in my free Substack article ""mRNA COVID-19 Vaccinations During Pregnancy: Deadly Hesitancy Remains""",2024-02-19,1479,39,42,UCkorbMKMvRbyyMmwD4DIzAg," hi welcome to from bench to bedside I'm Dr Melanie Matthew the host and known as laughter and light on social media and I am really excited to share with you today three different papers done in four different countries about what happens if you are pregnant and you get the SARS CO2 vaccine so we're going to review that literature right now if you're following Along on YouTube I will put the titles and the Articles and the figures up so that you can see them as I'm talking about them and um if you are following along and you're watching me I'm going to be looking over here at my second screen if you're just listening to the podcast um please enjoy and then take a look at the uh media recording so that you can follow along with the papers and or look up the papers yourself and give them a read okay so this is going to go all the way back to 2022 and then all the way forward let me double check the dates on this to um a paper published February 6th of 2024 and we're going to cover three articles okay because I think three is a a decent enough number to get an idea and a handle on what's Happening um and you know if you guys have any questions about other articles please go ahead and drop those in the comments on my YouTube channel it's an lore science all right so let's get started um these are the titles of the papers I'm going to put them on screen and I'll read them out to you the first one we're going to go over is from 2021 oh I'm sorry 2022 and it is evaluation of acute Adverse Events after covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy the next one we're going to go over was published October 23rd 2023 newborn and early infant outcomes following maternal covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy and then the third one we're going to go over is neonatal outcomes after covid-19 vaccination in pregnancy published February 6 2024 so let's start with the first one published in 2022 so um it is known that this time um going back in history that people who are pregnant with symptomatic Corona virus disease as they said here covid-19 have a higher risk of adverse outcomes of women who are not pregnant so being pregnant increases the risk factors so they wanted to know hey is this going to be problematic how can we stop this for people so what they did in this correspondence to the new New England Journal of Medicine was they did a retrospective observational matched cohort study involving pregnant women um the ages of 16 to 49 years old and they looked at um vaccination from December 15th 2020 through July 1st 2021 in this study they identified 45232 pregnant women who had received one or two doses of a covid-19 vaccine immediately proceeding or during pregnancy the vast majority had received two doses of the MRNA vaccine that's 72.5% and here is a table showing who got which vaccine and it does break them down um by age and by race the frequency of all medically attended events was less than 1% so here on this table you will see that there are several different potential events that are tra act and it's covid vaccine during pregnancy versus no covid vaccine during pregnancy a number of events per 10,000 people now if you look over on the right you will see something called the adjusted rate ratio all right and if that line touches the number one it is going to be non-statistically significant that's something to remember so if it goes over the number one if it's going over to the left in this particular version of the graph lower risk with vaccination is shown it's going over to the right higher risk with vaccination all right so in the first 1 to 7even days after vaccination they showed that more women had fever Mala or fatigue and um a local potential allergic reaction um usually it's monitored as pain or swelling in the area so normal responses to the VAC were seen um 1 to 21 days after vaccination they had more lymph node swelling other than that nothing was statistically significant in these groups of women the women that were vaccinated did not have higher rates of acute myocardial infection no higher rates of heart attack they did not have a higher rate of Bell's paly they did not have a higher rate of stroke and they did not have a higher rate of pulmonary embolism seizure Venus um thrombo embolism and indeed the authors go on to say that covid-19 vaccines are not associated with an increased risk of clinically serious acute Adverse Events that were evaluated in that list that we just looked at together so the present data um adds to the growing literature for the authors supporting the safety of covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy now we've got two more papers so let's get to it all right so the next one moving forward in time was published in jamama Pediatrics October 23rd 2023 newborn in early infant outcomes following maternal covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy so the question the authors wanted to answer here was is maternal covid-19 vaccination with mRNA um during pregnancy associated with adverse newborn and early infant outcomes okay so now this is focusing on the newborns and early infant outcomes and let's go over the finding summary so in this population-based cohort study of 42,6 live births in Ontario Canada covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy was associated with lower risks of severe neonatal morbidity and neonatal death and neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission they found no increase in neonatal re admission or Hospital admissions up to age 6 months compared to those who did not receive the SARS K2 vaccine before delivery they go on to state that maternal mRNA covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with an increase in verse events and early infant outcomes and may be protective against adverse newborn outcomes all right so really quick let's take a look at the summary of the cohort selection so the they started with 182,780 live births several groups were excluded and they ended up focusing on 14206 live births um 85,681 were not vaccinated now there are a lot of figures and tables in this paper but I'm going to hop over to Table Three and you can I encourage you to look at the other figures in this paper as well it's going to be linked Down Below in YouTube and you can find it in recently covered research in my link tree all right so we're going to hop over to Table Three association between covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy and neonatal and infant outcomes all right so they have the outcomes listed over here on the left um including severe neonatal morbidity neonatal death neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission Etc they have the total number in and percent in the vaccine exposed versus unexposed and then they look over here on the right risk ratio or Hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval and they have the crude and they have the adjusted now remember from the last paper we went over if it touches the number one or it it straddles the number one then it is no longer statistically significant by this measure so if you look at these numbers you can see that severe neonatal morbidity death Intensive Care Unit admission are all lower in the vaccine exposed groups of of children where their mothers were vaccinated and then you can see that neonatal readmission and hospital admission up to 6 months of age there was no statistical difference so here is the author's summary in the conclusions um they state that our study substantially expands on existing evidence of the safety of maternal mRNA vaccin ination during pregnancy for newborns and young infants covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy was associated with lower RIS of SNM neonatal death and nicku admission and no increases in neonatal and six-month readmissions all right we're two-thirds of the way through let's get up to present day with the paper that was just published February 6 of 2024 in jamama Journal of American Medical Association all right this stud took place in two different countries Sweden and Norway so the questions the authors asked was does mRNA covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy increased the risk of Adverse Events in newborn infants and then they go on to State their findings let's go through them in this populationbased cohort study from Sweden and Norway that includes 9433 infants exposed to covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy and 10 12,167 control infants born between June 2021 and January 2023 vaccination during pregnancy was associated with lower odds of neonatal intracranial hemorrhage cerebral es schea and hypoxic esic incopy and neonatal mortality the interpreted meaning of this study is that in this large populationbased study vacc of pregnant individuals with mRNA covid-19 vaccines was not associated with increased risk of neonatal Adverse Events all right here is figure one showing how they selected their cohorts and who was excluded from the group and who was included in the group here in figure two we're looking at time to death of liveborn infants exposed or unexposed to the covid-19 MRNA vaccine and this graph clearly shows that no vaccination has a fast fter rate of death in times per day and that more children did die after they were born if they had not prior had the vaccine just like the other two papers we looked at there is a lot of data in this paper but I'm going to direct you to table two this is association between covid-19 vaccination and pregnancy and neonatal outcomes now if you look at the AO the adjusted odds ratio about four columns from the left over you will see that those numbers straddle the number one for the most part there is no increased statistical significance in um between people who had the vaccine and are pregnant and people who haven't had the vaccine and are pregnant in adverse outcomes and in fact a few of them show statistical significance in being protective of the infant if the pregnant mother had the vaccine and so especially if you scroll all the way to the bottom neonatal mortality is significantly reduced in this case now the authors do say that they are not going to make any claim that the vaccine is protective against these things even though there is statistical significance shown but they do make the final claim that this is a large population-based study and it does show the vaccination of pregnant individuals with mRNA covid-19 vaccines was not associated with increased risk of neonatal Adverse Events in their infants all right so let's let's put this all together so pregnant people when they get SARS kobe2 are at a higher risk of having Adverse Events because it's putting extra strain on already strained physiology um pregnancy is already a risky adventure and so when you add a severe viral infection on top of that not great things can happen also SARS kov 2 is associated with a higher rate ofe preclampsia still birth pre-term birth and NICU admission so it's not good for baby either and you know these are just three papers that I happen to choose but and I know that there are more out there but I hope that it helps people rest assured that SARS Koby 2 mRNA vaccination is actually protective if you are pregnant and may um help you have a better pregnancy and could potentially save your baby's life all right I hope that all helps and again the references are linked below I will see you guys later take care"

#MedicinewithDrMoran #myocarditis #suddendeath",2022-12-06,1025865,29485,7127,UCretxef46N9r-v0FOlHWIVA," Welcome to Medicine with Dr. Moran. Today I'm 
going to talk about an autopsy-based study from   Germany. It looked at people who died suddenly 
and unexpectedly within 20 days after receiving   a Covid-19 vaccination. This has just been 
published in Clinical Research in Cardiology and   as always there's a link below to the study in the 
description. What did these people die of? First I   want to give you some background. I've reported 
on numerous studies looking at Myocarditis and   Pericarditis after vaccination on my channel. 
We know that the incidence of this seems to be   on the order of about 1 in 5,000 in young males 
after the second vaccination with Moderna but   it's less common with other vaccines and it's also 
less common in females and other male age groups.   Many countries have not used the Moderna vaccine 
in people under the age of 30 and a number of   countries have delayed the second shot further 
away from the first to reduce the chance of   Myocarditis. Now some have said that the risk of 
Myocarditis for Covid-19 is actually greater than   the risk of Myocarditis from vaccination but this 
is not true if you look at a large study from the   UK or a large Nordic study which I've reported 
on. There has been only a single prospective   study that means a study actually looking forward 
after vaccination which was done in Thailand.   I read this study back in August of 2022 and 
I must say it's disappointing that we do not   know more about Myocarditis given the concerns 
regarding this were brought up just over a year   and a half ago. It's important to let people 
know the risks of an intervention especially   if it's serious even if the risks are very small 
or uncommon so that people can balance the risk   against the benefit and make an informed 
decision. The Thailand study has been peer   reviewed and there's a link below to the study 
in the description. This flow chart shows what   the investigators did. They enrolled 314 people 
into their study and they did baseline blood work,   cardiac enzymes, and Echo prior to the vaccination 
which was the original Pfizer vaccine in Thailand   and then they did it again day 3, day 7, and 
day 14, after the second Pfizer vaccine dose   and they studied participants in the 13 to 18 
year old a range and 67% were male. Nobody died   in the study. Nobody required mechanical 
ventilation or drugs to keep their blood   pressure up. Now the main findings on this 
slide are that seven individuals developed   Myocarditis which means inflammation of the heart 
muscle or Pericarditis which means inflammation   around the lining around the heart. The seven 
males were out of a total of 202 male subjects.   No females developed Myocarditis or Pericarditis 
in this prospective study. Now the first three   patients on the slide here were people that 
actually presented to the hospital and were   admitted with one additional patient going to the 
ICU. These three cases were symptomatic cases.   Patients 4 through 7 were people who developed 
subclinical myocarditis with abnormalities in   their cardiac enzymes without another obvious 
explanation without symptoms. So in total 7 cases   out of 202 which is 3.5% or 3 symptomatic cases 
out of 202 which is 1.5%. Now this is a lot higher   than the number of symptomatic cases found in 
other studies that I mentioned at the beginning of   the video. One might think that this is the case 
because the study's perspective going forward so   the young men and their parents knew exactly what 
the study was about. Thus there may be people who   simply do not attend the doctor or a hospital 
with symptoms of Myocarditis and so they're not   actually counted in the incidence of Myocarditis 
which would obviously be much higher. This is   obviously a very small study in Thailand but it's 
disappointing that the vaccine manufacturers or   other researchers have not evaluated this problem 
further to get a better sense of the scope of the   disorder. The vaccine manufacturers are making 
billions on their vaccine and the onus to me is   clear on them that they need to prove safety when 
safety concerns are raised. The onus of course is   also on governments to require the companies to do 
this in a timely fashion which has not occurred in   this case. It would not cost Pfizer or Moderna a 
lot of money to do a much larger study like the   Thailand study given that they're making billions 
of dollars annually. Now on to the German autopsy   study. At the University of Heidelberg they 
found 35 cases of people with sudden death at   home occurring within 20 days following SARS Cov2 
vaccination. In 10 of those cases the autopsies   revealed other causes of death. They looked at the 
remaining 25 bodies that were found unexpectedly   dead at home and they found 5 cases of likely 
or possible vaccine-related Myocarditis with no   other reason for their death. All of these people 
died within the first week of vaccination with the   average length of time 2.5 days post-vaccination. 
Now of course there were no blood tests, ECGs,   Imaging, or clinical findings because none of 
these people sought medical attention before they   suddenly died. In one patient a witness described 
a rattling breath shortly before discovering an   absent pulse. In another person they complained 
about nausea and were found dead soon thereafter.   Resuscitation in that case was not successful. 
The other three people were simply found dead   at home without any information about terminal 
symptoms. According to the available information   none of the deceased had previous Covid infection 
and swabs taken for the Covid virus were negative   at autopsy in these people. Four people died 
after the first vaccination and the remaining   case was after the second one. There were three 
females and five males in this autopsy study.   The average age was 58 with a range of 46 to 
75 years of age which is certainly older than   what I've been talking about in the above 
studies. On this slide you can see the five   cases and in these five people it's important 
to note that they found no other cause of death   the Cardiac Pathologists felt that 4 out of the 5 
cases were definitive for Myocarditis according to   our standard Dallas Myocarditis criteria. They 
felt that 3 out of the 5 were likely related   to the vaccine with 2 out of 5 being possibly 
related. The Pathologists described their findings   in the study and in all five cases the microscopic 
findings were the same. They did say that during   the last 20 years of their autopsy service at 
the University Hospital in Heidelberg that they   did not observe comparable microscopic cardiac 
muscle inflammation or infiltration like these.   This autopsy information in five patients allows 
Physicians and of course Pathologists to better   understand situations where we may have a patient 
in the hospital that we choose to biopsy. This way   findings can be interpreted and correlated 
with what they found in this study. They   summarize by saying that in these five patients 
no other cause of death except Myocarditis was   identified and hence Myocarditis has to be 
considered the likely mechanism of death.   They felt that the Myocardial damage they were 
seeing in the cases were not sufficient to suggest   that poor heart function was the terminal cause of 
death and so most likely an abnormal heart rhythm   either a cardiac arrest with no electrical impulse 
or another life-threatening rhythm had to be   assumed as the mechanism, the immediate mechanism 
leading to the patient's death ultimately.   Now Myocarditis related acute to cardiac arrest 
due to life-threatening rhythm disorders is   well-established mechanism in other cases or 
causes of acute Myocarditis. Their summary is   a very small number of patients just five and 
it's obviously descriptive or observational. It   gives no idea about the frequency of Myocarditis 
from vaccination and obviously ultimately it does   not provide a direct causal link from vaccination 
to myocarditis and I can't emphasize that enough.   They finish by stating that considering that this 
adverse event which is fatal may affect healthy   individuals such as registry and surveillance 
programs they may improve early diagnosis close   monitoring and treatment. If these deaths at home 
were secondary to vaccination we of course may be   missing some severe Myocarditis cases in our 
studies. Not every death at home will have an   autopsy. Please note that this video is clearly 
not anti-vaccination. It's reviewing research   into Myocarditis and vaccination has been helpful 
for people particularly at high risk of a severe   outcome to prevent hospitalization and death 
but with any intervention it's important that   we as physicians select the right people for the 
intervention balancing the risks and benefits and   the risks of course need to be known. Certainly 
risks that are serious even if very uncommon   need to be elucidated and understood. This 
allows physicians to have good risk benefit   discussion with patients so the patients can make 
an informed decision. As we go down the road and   people receive more vaccines, more boosters, 
whether it be annually or what is recommended   for people at high risk we need to understand the 
benefit in that group as well as the risk. We also   need to know what it is for different patient 
populations because obviously the risk is going   to be different if somebody's young and healthy 
versus older as well as whether these people in   question that you're talking to whether they've 
recently had infection or how many infections   that they have that might deliver some immunity 
to them each time they get reinfected. These are   the sorts of things that we try to balance when 
we're making decisions on health care for people.   Thanks for joining me today on Medicine 
with Dr Moran. Get healthy and stay healthy."

STORYLINE:
India gifted two million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine to neighbouring Bangladesh on Thursday. 
Doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford University vaccine, manufactured under licence by the Serum Institute of India, were taken from the airport to a government storage facility in Dhaka.
India, the world's largest vaccine producer, began supplying coronavirus vaccine to its neighbours this week as it attempts to strike a balance between maintaining enough doses to inoculate its own people and helping developing countries without the capacity to produce their own vaccine.  
India's foreign ministry said it sent one million doses to Nepal, 150-thousand doses to Bhutan and 100-thousand doses to the Maldives, and would send more to Myanmar and the Seychelles in coming weeks.
Bangladeshi Health Minister previously announced that the vaccination of health and frontline workers will begin on February 8.

433,_cP00AfRIrk,Joe Rogan: Pharma DESPERATE To Blame Vaccine Injury On ANYTHING ELSE; 16K+ Report Tinnitus After Jab,"Briahna Joy Gray and Robby Soave react to a new finding that thousands of people are reporting symptoms of 'life-altering' tinnitus after taking the covid-19 vaccine. #covid19 #covid #tinitus According to the CDC, all COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States are effective at preventing COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can offer some protection from future illness, sometimes called “natural immunity,” but the level of protection people get from having COVID-19 may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age.

Getting a COVID-19 vaccination is also a safer way to build protection than getting sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without you having to experience sickness. Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can cause severe illness or death, and we can’t reliably predict who will have mild or severe illness. If you get sick, you can spread COVID-19 to others. You can also continue to have long-term health issues after COVID-19 infection.

While COVID-19 vaccines are effective, studies have shown some declines in vaccine effectiveness against infections over time, especially when the Delta variant was circulating widely.

The mRNA vaccines do not contain any live virus. Instead, they work by teaching our cells to make a harmless piece of a “spike protein,” which is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. After making the protein piece, cells display it on their surface. Our immune system then recognizes that it does not belong there and responds to get rid of it. When an immune response begins, antibodies are produced, creating the same response that happens in a natural infection.

In contrast to mRNA vaccines, many other vaccines use a piece of, or weakened version of, the germ that the vaccine protects against. This is how the measles and flu vaccines work. When a weakened or small part of the virus is introduced to your body, you make antibodies to help protect against future infection.

Everyone ages 18 and older should get a booster shot either 6 months after their initial Pfizer or Moderna series, or 2 months after their initial Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine. People ages 16–17 may get a booster dose of Pfizer at least 6 months after their initial series of vaccines.

The CDC says A person is fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving all recommended doses in the primary series of their COVID-19 vaccination. A person is up to date with their COVID-19 vaccination if they have received all recommended doses in the primary series and one booster when eligible.

Getting a second booster is not necessary to be considered up to date at this time. A study by The Cleveland Clinic found that both previous infection and vaccination provide substantial protection against COVID-19. Vaccination of previously infected individuals does not provide additional protection against COVID-19 for several months, but after that provides significant protection at least against symptomatic COVID-19.

if it is going to stop it why do you care who gets it you should just get it because if you get it that means that no one else again you're never going to get it everybody who gets the shot is never going to get it that was the narrative that was alive from the beginning and now we're realizing that it was a lie everybody realized it was a lie now like I was talking to someone last night that got had coveted really bad after being vaccinated like really bad two weeks wrecked so I have a I have a a great friend and his daughter College gets the shot she ends up emergency room and she's got blood clots on her liver and they're all like you know what do you think of it well you know she she Rose a lot on the road team and like are you are you really you're really gonna believe that's what it was well people do anything to not blame it on the vaccine like when there's an injury like people want to find all sorts of other reasons that was Joe Rogan uh making some comments about vaccine injuries which come as new NBC news reporting details the allegedly thousands of Americans who say that they have symptoms of Life altering tinnitus ringing in the ears after they took the covid-19 vaccine now as of Sunday at least 16 000 people had filed complaints with the Centers for Disease Control and prevention that they developed tinnitus or ringing in their ears after receiving a vaccine the CDC conducted internal reviews of the reports they did not find any data specifically suggesting a link between covid-19 vaccines and tinnitus according to an agency spokesperson despite the cdc's findings researchers like Xiao and Bao and associate professor at the physiology Department of the College of Medicine at the University of Arizona Tucson are beginning to dive deeper into the possible link according to the NBC news report Bao who has been studying tinnitus for over a decade was convinced to look into the issue after getting messages on Facebook after surveying roughly 400 cases from the online group along with ringing in their ears but participants reported a range of other symptoms including headaches dizziness vertigo ear pain anxiety and depression significantly more people first developed tinnitus after the first dose of the vaccine compared with a second so if our bowel believes that ongoing inflammation especially in the brain or spinal cord may be to blame so this is all quite preliminary the CDC looked into this and didn't find the evidence that you would might like to see but they also didn't release the full report they have done that with the myocarditis claim so you can judge for yourself not able to do so in this case I was interested in frankly kind of heartened that NBC News a very textbook mainstream Outlet is taking this concern very seriously wrote this pretty good news article about it you know want to apply a lot of caution here because uh tinnitus again ringing in the ears is something that actually a lot of Americans suffer from 25 of Americans suffer from it and there's this question some degree of it might not be severe sure and these people are registering um severe symptoms yes that apparently manifest after their first shot including that doctor looking into it right yeah right so it is it's worth noting that a lot of people are going to experience these symptoms anyway and that it might be you have these preconditions for tinnitus that are perhaps exacerbated by the vaccine obviously we don't know people are looking into it but it is worth noting that one the CDC hasn't found a link yet although as you've pointed out they haven't released the review the way they have in the context of myocarditis and other side effects that 16 000 complaintants which is about the number we have here equals about one in every 15 vaccinated Americans so again the odds are relatively low still and again 25 of people are gonna but that's just the number of people you know who actually went ahead and reported to the CDC I'm having bad tinnitus and I got vaccinated there there are probably a lot more people out there who have tinnitus or got tinnitus maybe it was after a vaccine and haven't reported it so we can't sure and maybe they were going to get tinnitus anyway maybe they already had it might have nothing to do with the vaccine that's the you know the difficulty in looking at some of these things including like the blood clot issue that Joe Rogan was guest was talking about there um you know and that's a that's a more unlikely complication especially for a very young person who is an athlete a rower Etc um you know that's why this whole idea of of requiring and forcing vaccines on people as again many colleges have it seems so wrong-headed to me uh when you know we don't look we don't have I want to be careful how I say this I I don't think there's a lot of really strong evidence of serious risk and serious dangers associated with the vaccines but we also know that a lot of the things that were said by experts about the necessity of being vaccinated to keep yourself safe from from just from infection from covet even did not pan out and if we're looking at age groups where the where the coveted risk is very low and maybe the vaccine risk also very very very low but how can you say as like an expert or a policy maker that I'm taking that choice away from you how could that be that has to be to the individual to decide in consultation with their with their doctor maybe maybe they have some precondition that makes them more at risk of blood clots or or even tinnitus theoretically they might make a different vaccine decision than someone else that should absolutely be their right it's ludicrous yeah as the as the benefit goes down and risk reward right calculation and then a social benefit going down to almost nothing yeah as the reward as the reward goes down you don't actually have to prove that the risks are especially High to have a good argument against not pursuing a vaccine or at least not requiring the vaccines so that's that's kind of the world we're in now when where we've shifted dramatically from what we had hoped the vaccines would offer in terms of protection from the virus in the early days and especially now that people have immunity from having gotten the VAC gotten covid et cetera et cetera we're in a different we're in a different world I think what was so remarkable about this piece in particular was simply the fact that it was being covered a story like this about vaccine consequences That vaccine side effects is being covered in a mainstream institution as many people pointed out online they won were willing to credit the story simply because it appeared in in NBC and two the fact that it did appear in MSNBC given there's been so much pushback against the idea of like fomenting vaccine hesitancy and the mainstream press that they they were like oh this must really be a story this must be really credible because otherwise this type of institution wouldn't carry the story now I don't know that that's necessarily Fair we've seen an interesting kind of opening up of discourse bases about covid in the last few months whether it is the Lively Theory now being kind of a more mainstream valid Theory now that it has gotten the okay from various government agencies but it's more likely to have come from live League than a zoonotic origin and now this open conversation about not covet side effects but coveted vaccine side effects I mean what should we read anything at all into what appears to be a shift in the discourse I mean I'm I'm applauding this shift in the discourse but it's just what should have been all along and some people are upset yeah so there needs to be some apology some people are saying I've been talking about this for a long time when I was dismissed as a crank and still we don't know that maybe less as a society maybe we'd be less polarized and radicalized maybe um maybe people would be less certain people would be uh less inclined to just disregard everything they hear from Health officials because it was just so one-sided for so long yet right the concerns about spreading vaccine related misinformation I mean content moderation decisions were made on that basis on social media platforms we've seen that over and over again that Facebook for instance essentially outsourced its content moderation to the CDC itself and and the CDC was took the position that basically any claim you would make that would be negative about vaccines even vaccines for children is some something that could cause hesitance and is not something that should be allowed it was harmful on that basis and that was just such a wrong way to try to control the access to information that people have it is not a that's not a healthy way of looking at this entire debate it was not instructive for public debate and it's gotten to us to where we are now so I I was glad to see NBC uh cover this like this I I would have wanted to see coverage on all the other covid related issues if the door is open the door is open it is also interesting timing it seems to me given that RFK has this new candidacy that is surging in some ways and that the main attack that the mainstream political press seems to be making at him is the idea that he's a vaccine skeptic talking about some of his past statements linking vaccines to autism in a way that the medical community has not linked vaccines and autism and I think more substantively for the current moment being very skeptical of a lot of covet era policies which have not necessarily wasted the test of time so if he is surging at the same time that the broader public is a lot more open to discussions about vaccine risk vaccine vaccines skepticism and things like that it could be rather auspicious timing for that particular candidacy right and if if some in the mainstream are worried or wondering why why are people listening to RFK Jr remember that Joe Biden said that if you get the vaccine you're not going to get coveted and that turned out not to be true yeah tomorrow on Rising Brianna and I will be back right here to bring

434,V0ENHzLE3OI,What you need to know about serious COVID-19 vaccine side effects,Dr. Jen Ashton explains how severe vaccine incidents will be tracked and reported.,2020-12-22,645696,2292,2942,UCH1oRy1dINbMVp3UFWrKP0w, latest numbers of course this ongoing crisis and this crisis the worry is that it could be getting worse as people start to travel for the holiday for christmas now but here are the numbers now more than 77.4 million diagnosed cases of coronavirus worldwide more than 18 million cases here in the u.s death toll has now climbed to more than 319 000 dr ashton that's something that was just unimaginable just weeks maybe even months ago but uh but look we were talking about the vaccine so much about the vaccine let's talk about hope so that's right we've also been talking about some people having allergic reactions and some people having more serious rights there is a difference here we need to make this clear there is and today i want to do a deep dive on this concept of background events because these adverse reactions will make headlines and i really want to take you through how you should interpret them and how you should understand these news this news when it happens so first of all background events you need to compare reported events that occur possibly in conjunction with the vaccine with those events that occur at background rates which is defined as how often these various events happen in the general population every single day even before the vaccine so for example incidents of heart attacks in people age 55 to 64 years of age tj there are about 793 heart attacks every week in this age group now imagine we start to vaccinate 10 million people let's say a week we are going to see heart attacks occur in people who have received the vaccine just like we were and in people who haven't gotten the vaccine so part of the vaccine safety surveillance will be following these events to see if they occur in a rate that's higher than we would normally see just because it's tied chronologically with someone who's gotten the vaccine obviously does not prove cause and effect and this is going to be critically important moving forward yeah and speaking of that jen so how exactly will these events be tracked how will they be reported they're going to be tracked amy very very closely and just like the way we track adverse events with every vaccine it's something called vares v-a-e-r-s anyone can make a report to that if they've received a vaccine and have any number of symptoms or serious systemic adverse events and then the fda will be tracking that pfizer moderna every vaccine developer will be tracking it very very closely all right dr ashton thank you well hey there gma fans robin roberts here thanks for checking out our youtube channel lots of great stuff here so go on click the subscribe button right over right over here to get more of awesome videos and content from gma every day anytime we thank you for watching and we'll see you in the morning on gma

436,WB6yucemJ-o,Dr. Rhonda Patrick on Vaccine Misinformation and Long-haul Covid,"Taken from JRE #1701 w/Dr. Rhonda Patrick:
https://open.spotify.com/episode/7y8MKnfhML6KzvA6GVd83B?si=DcI5bwdyTC-rTGKjN2Md4A&dl_branch=1",2021-08-25,4938755,68210,63771,UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ, the jurgen experience but you know the since we're on this topic can we talk a little bit of vaccines because i'm it's something i've i have seen a lot of misinformation like on everywhere facebook on you know different news media outlets and and i think there's really like some some main ones that that i just feel are causing harm and so um there's really eight of them we don't need to talk about all of them but i think the eight really are that you know sars cove two is not that bad copa 19 is not that bad and you know vaccines basically don't prevent transmission spike protein from vaccines are cytotoxic therefore they're really bad um that vaccines are going to cause something called antibody dependent enhancement which is going to make you have a more severe disease there's the vaccines are going to cause infertility there's the um vaccines are going to cause a more violent virulent strain or variant and then there's one more that alternatives to vaccines exist right now that are just as good and i think that there's a few of those that are really i mean just like blatantly they're wrong all of them i think there but i mean you know there's some that are more important than others and i think that i would like to talk about them um you know i think first and foremost the there's like two groups of people mostly one take thinks copenhagen's bad doesn't want it guess wants the vaccine and the other one that thinks it's not that bad and uh that the vaccines may be harmful and there's do you think that vaccines are harmful to anyone well of course i mean do you know anyone that's had bad reactions to vaccines i personally interestingly the only i know a lot of people that have gotten vaccinated and the only person that i know that had something was like she had a headache for like a week and a half and then it went away um oh no another person i knew had like nausea for like a couple of weeks they were like nauseous more more frequently but it went away um you know do you think you would feel differently if you knew someone that had a stroke or someone who's had heart attacks perhaps young people that have well it's hard to say so you know i do people react differently obviously when you're giving you know 100 and more than 169 million people are vaccinated right i mean that's half our adult population is is vaccinated fully vaccinated with copenhagen and um it's not zero risk people are some people are going to have an adverse reaction and they do it's a big world out there you know like if you were to give 169 million people a peanut or a shellfish like some people are going to have very adverse reactions some people die like it's a big world but you know with the with the stroke or the heart attack you know you have to like like so if you're trying to compare for example let's say you know you're looking at actual cover 19 deaths and from heart attacks and strokes and you're looking at the vaccine adverse events reporting site there's right and and that as well you know you have to realize that basically in the united states like in 2017 there was a publication in the journal of circulation someone dies from cardiovascular disease every 30 seconds in the united states like every 30 seconds most of those people are above the age of 50 and certainly most are above 65. but every 30 seconds someone's dying from cardiovascular disease every 40 seconds someone in the united states has a stroke every four minutes they die from a stroke but this is also very very rare in young people particularly young healthy people but one thing that has occurred in young healthy people they've been vaccinated as myocarditis and some people have had blood clots like quite a few blood clots and there's speculation right the salk institute released that paper about the uh spike protein causing uh some sort of deterioration of the blood vessels did you read that i looked at the spike i've been looking at a lot of the um spike protein and that's from covet 19 they're discussing it they're talking about from yeah from the actual disease itself yes so um you know first of all like they're you have to like there's you're either going to get infected with cyrus grove 2 most people are going to be eventually we're all going to be exposed to it so you're either going to be vaccinated when you're exposed to it or not and people are dying from heart attacks and blood clots and even people are getting myocarditis like 100 full times more than vaccines like the the myocarditis link from the mrna specifically the mrna vaccines is real and i think the last i saw it was like 50 per million which is still rare and it's happened to two people that i know it so up until then and actually now that you asked me um i forgot i had a um someone who's a supporter i talked about vaccines in one of my q as i do and they went and got it and they were younger and ended up having some kind of myocarditis so i do know someone that had i don't know them but they emailed me now what happens if you have that and like how do you recover from that but you realize it's happening to young people so myocarditis is caused by two things one by inflammation two by direct viral infection and it's more common in adolescents and young people and it's an enlargement of the heart it's inflammation of the heart can lead to that yeah but it's it's happening in young athletes with covid19 like and it's happening like more frequently than people that are getting vaccinated so it's still like well if the person that got vaccinated look it is a risk but it's still pretty rare and it also is treatable in most cases they treat it like within a few days and it's isolated why do you think that people like there are people that are completely asymptomatic when they get coveted or if they do get it's very mild do you think that's because they have a lower viral load that they've been infected with or do you think it's their immune system that fights it off like what do you think is happening it could be any and all of those things a combination of them and you know but so like even if you think you know if you're looking at just like the most extreme part of like the deaths right you know you've got like over 624 000 deaths in copen 19. most of those deaths are happening in people over the age of fifty um and if you look at like most of them have four plus comorbidity factors right isn't that the average i don't know if it's four plus a three average for i think the comorbidities increase yeah i think what the number of comorbidities are in terms of like uh the deaths it used to be 2.6 but i think they raised it to four really the number of them before okay so i might be wrong but i know it was at least two points right so then there's the argument well i'm healthy i don't have comorbidities right i mean so so what what should i do like should i you know get vaccinated or or should i be exposed to the virus and i think there's a lot of evidence and there's multiple lines of evidence one you know there are people with mild symptoms that are getting post-acute cobalt syndrome they're getting this what people call it long-haul covered and a lot and the majority of people what do you think that is what is post what is long haul covet i don't know what it is i think it depends on the the symptoms i think there could be a variety of causes for it um you know so there are people and most of us this is happening in teenagers to like 50. most of the people that are older are not getting this long-haul code but it's like happening in people that are mostly not being hospitalized people that don't get hospitalized originally like they have mostly like pretty mild symptoms in some cases even asymptomatic you know there was a study published in the lancet like last year showing there was a seven-fold increase in stroke incidents in people under 50 in the united states compared to the year before that before the pandemic start and that is probably because the spike protein that causes this deterioration of the blood vessels and blood clots is that what it is from the from the virus well i don't know what it is i mean there's lots of things you know viral infections themselves can cause hypercoagulation they can cause blood clots like just like that's like known from other viruses like that's something there's inflammation without the spike protein so let's okay i feel like i haven't got to address everything but let's talk about the spider real quick i think this four points out where i would find this information i hope that's the spot yeah there is an average of 4.0 additional conditions or causes of death for data on deaths involving covet 19 by time period jurisdiction and other health conditions this is only five percent the covert was the only cause and then so for only five percent of the covet does covet 19 was the only cause mentioned so out of those 600 thousand people that died only five percent died just from covet 19. well i mean so you have people that are coping 19 is going to make their comorbidities worse and and that could be the same for a vaccine it could be the same for anything right i mean so like something that's going to activate the immune system yeah but i've the the concern is with what vaccines the negative effects that what people are worried about i think is young people that are healthy that have negative effects like that have had strokes or that have had thrombosis or myocarditis and those issues right well i think you know again if you look at the data you know young people are also experiencing those things at a higher rate and are those all the people with the co-morbidities like i don't know you know like i i'm not sure but it seems as though no matter which way you look at it like it it's it is worse to be exposed to that virus and like how do you know that person that had that myocarditis wouldn't have had it x-fold worse with the with the coba 19 because it's been shown to happen in young healthy athletes you know and people have been shown in large numbers like the more more so more so more so than the vaccines that we were saying yes i'm saying that it's happening myocarditis is from the vaccines it's happening in younger people at a higher rate than from the vaccines do we have accurate data do you think about how many myocarditis instances we have from the vaccine well you could argue there's an under reporting um i think people so anyone can submit data to the to the bears and i think when it comes to someone who's younger they're more likely i mean so healthcare professionals have to submit to the bears if there's like something that's life-threatening some which myocardials could be or if it's death or something that's like you know changes their daily functions like congenital effects yes they are if they are but if uh do they how do they know that myocarditis is caused by the vaccine it they don't but if it if the person had gotten vaccinated and by the way there's no time constraint like it's not like oh if they've only been you know vaccinated within like in two months like they're supposed to they're supposed to submit to theirs like if someone was vaccinated and then something yes is there encouragement or discouragement to submit to theirs i don't know i don't know but i mean you know if you again even just looking at the deaths in every age group even like you know people that are in my age group 40 to 49 you know there's 20 000 deaths that have been linked to the confirmed kova 19 cases right whereas you know in various it's 200. for people with comorbidities obviously it's a real issue yeah i don't know if that's if that's always the case but yes definitely with people with comorbidities because according to this what we pulled up it's five percent that are dying just of the covid 95 have an average of four comorbidities okay well if that's true for all ages um then you know yes people with comorbidities are more likely to die but also younger people i like i said they're more likely to get you know these long-haul symptoms where i've known so many people you know that they're they've they've gotten like their loss of smell or taste has been like several months and there's now studies showing that you know if you there was a huge study out of the biobank um uk biobank data where the where right before the pandemic started mris were done brain scans on like almost a thousand people was like over 800. and then the pandemic hit people got covered some people didn't whatever so they brought these these the same cohort of people back in for a brain scan and you know basically they corrected for people so they had people that they compared people that were the same age same gender same sex and and then they um also time between scans and they found that both mild and severe cover 19 cases caused a atrophy in the gray matter region of the brain it was worse in people that had it more severe right understandable but people that had mild cases that didn't go to the hospital had it how many people did they study with this it was over 800 yeah i mean you know it's you need you need more data to confirm but i mean were these people did they stratify it by age did age gender ethnicity health i don't know did they have comorbidities did they factor that in they had people that age the same age you know as the people didn't get code and they didn't have it i mean you know this is several months this is just months after i don't know about the health did they monitor their nutrition or find out what kind of supplements they were i don't know i don't i don't know if any of that data was was you know in it but do you think that data would be a factor at all i don't know because i know people that supplement that exercise that have had um were diagnosed with they had a mild case and they were diagnosed with pots you know post postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome where their heart was racing like tachycardia was racing just control like uncontrollably they were dizzy couldn't had no energy i mean this was months and they finally got diagnosed there's like a lot of people coming out with this but you know do you know anybody that had covid and got through it with almost no symptoms at all and was very mild um well yeah no symptoms at all but the people that i do know most of them had some kind of weird taste issue like or smell thing for like weeks and weeks but um but you don't know anybody that didn't have that um i don't because most the people i know that had it lost their smell watch the entire episode for free only on spotify
437,s40QaVcMhzY,Vax-happy 62-year-old gets COVID shot more than 200 times — leaving scientists stunned,"He followed the science — and now the science is following him.

A 62-year-old man claiming to have received more than 200 COVID-19 vaccines is being studied by experts who say they’ve been amazed by their findings thus far.

Analysis of the über-cautious German, published in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases, found that the vaccines continued to create antigens and provide increased immunity — even after an alleged 217 doses. 

Researchers at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg and Universitätsklinikum Erlangen, Munich and Vienna approached the unnamed individual after hearing local media reports.

438,4usVIX5B6Rs,What Did Bill Gates Say About COVID Vaccine Side Effects?,This clip is taken from the Joe Rogan Experience #1573 with Matthew Yglesias. https://open.spotify.com/episode/0JwtEENqDW0DbpNRHh7ekh?si=ucLSwSGLR_2EqMu4SlFpvg,2020-12-03,4389228,53276,38645,UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ, the jurogan experience i don't know i don't know either i like vaccines you know yeah i'm excited um i like vaccines i i mean um the problem that a lot of people have is that this was fast-tracked and they get nervous about they do they do possible potential side effects and we don't know what those are going to be and then there's a lot of people that are very uncomfortable with the idea of getting very sick after they take the vaccine which seems to happen with 80 percent of the people that take it and so they're concerned about that 80 of people who are taking this vaccine yes that's not what i heard well that's what bill gates has said bill gates yeah i don't know i mean i don't know if we see it i don't know if we can look it up and play it for you pull it off of i know it's weird when people say that people like wait what um it's on my instagram there's a interview with bill gates where he's talking about i believe this is the moderna vaccine the pfizer vaccine has a very similar effect because it's um the way this uh mrna vaccine works they've taken the common cold vaccine and added this to it your body develops these proteins to fight off but you get sick yeah i mean well i i can't say i don't know you know i mean i've read the sort of report the readout from pfizer and mederna biontech and they said there were very few serious side effects i mean i don't know i don't know serious or not i mean i got the flu shot you know uh whenever it was a couple months ago and you know my arm hurt for a couple days i wouldn't do it just that's just the injections yeah your body didn't feel bad right but it was fine you know i felt okay this is different than that um this is different than that and there's a there's a consequence of taking this and i'm not saying that i won't take it i will it's if it's safe i will encourage other people to take it too but there's a reality of taking this particular vaccine that it's going to make a lot of people feel like and it'll last a couple days and look you can play play that video oh okay but it's in the the it's in the uh feed it's in the igtv but if you just go to my instagram feed from the last time uh the the dylan jones episode um it's uh it's that's just what it is hold on keep going wait a minute did they remove it oh my god did they remove it from my instagram is that real holy dude that is crazy hold on let me check because that's kind of crazy if they removed it from my instagram that's kind of crazy because this was a i believe it was an nbc interview oh they removed it wow okay well here here i got i got an article from from science it says uh there's fever and aches that are intense in some cases but not dangerous you found it okay okay it hasn't been removed then okay here we go has it been removed why don't i find it i've i don't know it's a month ago says october 28th right okay play it this video was edited though remember also no no no no no no no that's a totally different video that's a totally different video that video was the video where people were talking about uh that bill gates is concerned with the uh profit margin from vaccines but that is we should talk about that too because that's actually important that's actually important because that's really distorted and that's not what he was saying at all he was not talking about profit concerning we looked after the second dose at least 80 percent of participants experienced a systemic side effect ranging from severe chills to fevers so are these vaccines safe well the the fda not being pressured will look hard at that the fda is the gold standard of regulators uh and their current guidance on this if they stick with that is is very very appropriate uh and you know they it the the the side effects were not super severe that is it didn't cause permanent health problems for uh the things that they you know moderna did have to go with a fairly high dose and so uh you know to get the antibodies some of the other vaccines uh are going able to go with lower doses to get uh responses that are are pretty high including the jnj and the pfizer and so there's a lot of characteristics of these vaccines um it's great that we have multiple of them uh that are going out there and yes you know the data better than i do but the bill though the data showed that everybody with a high dose had a side effect yeah but some of that is is not dramatic where you know it's just you know super painful but yes there we need to make sure there's not severe side effects the fda i i think will do a good job of that despite the pressure how many doses of the vaccine will we need well none of the vaccines at this point appear like they'll work with a single dose that was the the hope at the very beginning uh maybe one of them particularly in the second generation won't surprise us we hope just two although in the elderly sometimes uh it it takes more and and so making sure we have lots of elderly people in the trial will give us that data no so let's be clear okay so it is hold on a second yeah if that is all it is it's just you you have severe chills and you feel like for a couple days that is way better than getting the coronavirus and risking the potential death and side effects and you know the long-haul people experiencing blood clots and if it's better than that yeah but it's just it's not a free ride so i just i just want to get the numbers what i see here from from science is that uh the the sort of fatigue you know that you were talking about feel like for two days they did about ten percent of people had had the side effects which hold on a second but why is bill gates saying 80 well no she was saying it's some side effect comes in 80 percent right but like what you were talking about is in a subset you know of the people get it well i didn't know i don't know if that's true because there's many articles about the the side effects of this vaccine i've never seen one of them that relegated it to 10 of the population that took the well actually i mean specifically the second dose yeah the other thing about this is you have to take two the second dose seems to be the doozy for people right i mean i guess that's that's the tough one um now do you think so this is something that's interesting is i have like one set of conversations with people and they're saying who's gonna be able to get the vaccine like how are we going to roll this out you know healthcare workers essential workers all this other kind of stuff and then there's another conversation where people are like maybe you're not going to want to get it right and me i'm like i'm really eager you know give it to me tomorrow i don't even care that the fda is not done why is that um you're not worried about side effects hey i'm not worried about side effects why are you not worried about side effects you guys fever for a couple days i mean that's what if that's all we know of now yeah but look long-haul coveted survivors one of the things they're finding is these people have blood clots like many many months later no i mean i know like a serious serious but that's it like i i would really like to not get coveted yeah sure so what if there's a similar situation with the vaccine what if the vaccine this is not outside the realm of possibility that the vaccine gives some sort of a a side effect that that's unintended i mean i have a lot of confidence in the basic process here with the vaccine but this isn't the basic process this is a completely new process much faster than any process i mean it's an unusually rapid development i mean it's an usually rapid development because they have this m r m rna i don't know what that means i mean it's messenger rna but i don't know what it means um so it just means that it's tricky it's not giving you a like a dormant version right so there's no there's no virus right there's a particle that's specially designed it triggers antibodies yeah we create them and so i think the basic antibody immune response situation is fairly well understood scientifically it's why we're pretty confident that the people who've recovered you know are immune that you know younger and healthier people in most cases are okay if they get sick they get better um so to me like it's a good thing i'm all for it i'll take it i'll get the fever but i'm also not i want to walk the line like i want to encourage people to take vaccines like as a responsible person but also knowing that the supplies will be short if somebody doesn't want it like somebody else will take that dose but you know what one of the best things uh in terms of uh outcomes is vitamin d like vitamin d deficiencies are a huge part of negative covid outcomes and then uh one in one some people some studies about that yeah in one study 84 of the people that were in the icu had deficient levels of vitamin c and only four percent had sufficient levels of vitamin d vitamin d is a huge problem and it's not just a vitamin it's a hormone you know one when j mackey was on the other day he was trying to say that it's a precursor to hormones so i had to look it up that's not true it's a hormone vitamin d is actually a hormone and it's weird because we call it a vitamin but it regulates so many things in the body and it has a significant impact on the immune system but you never hear anybody telling you to supplement with vitamin d you're not seeing this from any of the leaders any of these politicians that are shutting things down even fauci has said it recently that vitamin d does seem to have a pretty significant impact but health experts like people that study like the mechanisms of disease and vitamin supplementation like particularly dr rhonda patrick had a thing on her twitter when she published a study that showed positive outcomes and kovid vitamin d is a huge factor catch new episodes of the joe rogan experience for free only on spotify watch back catalog jre videos on spotify

हमे देखा है की यह महामारी डेढ़ साल से चल रही है और कम होने का नाम ही नहीं ले रही है।  तो Covid Vaccine यही एक अपने पास उपाय है जिसे  बीमारी पे काबू पा सकते है।  Vaccine लेने के बाद हमारी शरीर की immunity बढ़ जाती है और antibody production होता है। इसके साथ ही cellular immunity नहीं बढ़ जाती है , जिससे आगे जाके इन्फेक्शन हो गया तो उससे लड़ने की ताकत होती है। तो आइए जानते है ५  तरीके के vaccines  

Types of vaccines 
-Kill Vaccines - इसमें वायरस मरा हुआ होता है। ये vaccine लेने से बीमारी जैसी लक्षणे हमारे शरीर में उत्पन्न नहीं होती। इसका उदाहरण है flu vaccine जो की हम प्रेगनेंसी में दे सकते है। भारत में उपलब्ध vaccine में Covaxin यह kill vaccine है। 
-Live attenuated vaccine : जिसमे covid के virus को अर्धमरा किया जाता है और उससे vaccine बनाया जाता है।  लेकिन immuno compromised लोगो में , pregnancy में यह vaccine नहीं दे सकते क्योकि इससे बीमारी के लक्षण होते है। 
-Protein Subunit vaccine : covid-19 के protein यह vaccine बनाने केलिए उपयोग करते है।  इस तरीकेके vaccine देनेसे बीमारी के लक्षण बिलकुल नहीं होते। इसका एक उदाहरण है tetanus vaccine  जो की हम प्रेगनेंसी में दे सकते है।
-Viral Vector vaccine : इस में एक safe virus जो हमेमें  बीमारी पैदा नहीं करता, वायरस में covid के genetic material डाले जाते है। यह vaccine लेनेसे covid जैसे virus या लक्षण होने की संभावनाएं बोहोत कम रहती है। इस वैक्सीन का उदाहरण है ebola vaccine | जो FOGSI के guidelines है उसके हिसाब से यह vaccine जिसमे adeno virus रहता है यह शिशु को और माँ को संक्रमित नहीं करता तो यह vaccine pregnancy में दे सकते है। 
-Nucleic Acid vaccine - जिसको mRNA vaccine भी कहा जाता है  जिसमे covid का mRNA component को seperate किया जाता है और यह vaccine के रूप में दिया जाता है। यह काफी नए किसम का वैक्सीन है। mRNA देने से बीमारी होनी की सम्भावनाये नहीं होती है इसीलिए यह vaccine pregnancy में और स्तनपान करने वाली माओमें एकदम सेफ बताया जाता है। 

I am pregnant/breasteeding, can I take covid vaccine ?
American V-safe registry का डाटा देखा जाए तो 35,000 गर्भवती और स्तनपान करनेवाली महिलाओ को vaccine दिया गया था और उनमे देखा गया की शिशु में गर्भावस्था के दौरान होने वाले complications में बढ़ोतरी नहीं थी। उसके साथी ही उनके शरीर में antibody का निर्माण अच्छी मात्रा में हुआ था और umbilical cord में और शिशु में यह antibodies मौजूद थे जिससे शिशु को भी protection मिलने की सम्भावना बोहोत अच्छी है। 


तो इसका मतलब यह है की pregnancy के दौरान और breastfeeding  के दौरान covid vaccination लेना माँ और शिशु केलिए  बोहोत ही महत्वपूर्ण है और बोहोत ही उपयोगी है लेकिन भारत में जो vaccine है Covaxin और Covshield  है इसके studies में pregnant और lactating mothers का समावेश नहीं किया था इसलिए भारत सरकार ने इनका प्रेगनेंसी और lactating mother में यह वैक्सीन देने पर निर्बंध लगाया है।  जब तब भारत सरकार निर्बंध नहीं उठाता तब तक pregnant और lactating mother को यह वैक्सीन डॉक्टर्स नहीं दे सकते।  जब इस वैक्सीन केलिए सरकार अनुमति देगी तब बे झिझक यह वैक्सीन प्रेग्नेंट और स्तनपान करनेवाली महिलाओ को लेनी है।  क्योकि यह आपकेलिए फायदेमंद रहे वाली है।

440,Trstysfnfwc,Eric Clapton Blames ‘Propaganda’ for ‘Disastrous’ Covid Vaccine Experience | RS News 5/17/21,"Eric Clapton detailed his quote-“disastrous” health experience after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and blamed quote-“the propaganda” for overstating the safety of the vaccine in a letter the guitarist shared with an architect/anti-lockdown activist.

Welcome to Rollingstone News, I'm Dan Halperin. Eric Clapton detailed his, quote, disastrous health experience after receiving the covid-19 vaccine and blamed, quote, the propaganda for overstating the safety of the vaccine. In a letter the guitarist shared with an architect, Argante Lockdown activist in February, Clapton received his first of two AstraZeneca vaccinations. He wrote in his letter to Robin Monazite, Zyad, who shared the letter on his telegram with the guitar's permission, quote, I took the first jab of A-Z and straight away had severe reactions, which lasted 10 days. I recovered eventually and was told it would be 12 weeks before the second one clapped and wrote. About six weeks later, I was offered and took the second shot, but with a little more knowledge of the dangers. Needless to say, the reactions were disastrous. My hands and feet were either frozen, numb or burning and pretty much useless. For two weeks I feared I would never play again. I suffer with peripheral neuropathy and should never have gone near the needle. But the propaganda said the vaccine was safe for everyone. Clapped in previously shared his thoughts on the covid-19 shutdown when he appeared on Van Morrison's anti lockdown song Stand and Deliver in December. 20-20 Clapton said, quote, Then I was directed to Van. That's when I found my voice. And even though I was singing his words, they echoed in my heart. I recorded Stand and Deliver in 2020 and was immediately regaled with contempt and scorn. On a similar note, Clapton allegedly lent a van to a British band that continues to perform live music throughout the UK as a protest against lockdown measures. Thanks for watching.

recommend against the coven 19 vaccines for healthy children that was florida surgeon general joseph vladipost speaking at a panel on monday alongside governor ron desantos the new guidance is to deter floridians from vaccinating their healthy children that guidance says quote the risks of administering a covit 19 vaccine to healthy children may outweigh the benefits and that quote healthy children aged 5 to 17 may not benefit from receiving the currently available covid19 vaccine the announcement goes against cdc guidance which recommends everyone over the age of five get the shot child coveted cases spiked during omicron at least 4.8 million cases were recorded since the beginning of january a cdc study released in february showed hospitalizations of children and adolescents during the omicron wave was four times higher than with delta the highest increase was found among children younger than four joining us now to break all this down is dr sonja rasmussen she is a pediatrician epidemiologist and a professor at the university of florida doctor thank you very much for joining us thank you i'm happy to be here and you know before we get started i also want to mention another data point from that cdc study hospitalization rates among adolescents ages 12 to 17 in december of 2021. they were six times higher for those who were unvaccinated versus fully vaccinated so given that why are some florida health officials and professionals saying that doctors are saying that children may not benefit from this vaccine yeah i think there's some misconceptions out there about kids in covid i think from the start people have said well kids don't get cold but kids don't get as severely affected with covid it's true that kids are at lower risk but they're not at no risk and as you say there's been lots of hospitalizations there's been about a thousand kids that have died of covid19 and given that given that we have a safe and effective vaccine i think it's important that we use it so we can prevent those hospitalizations and deaths in addition we can prevent illness which keeps kids out of school and we can also prevent things like long covid which i i think we don't fully understand the impact of long covert on kids right now all right so dr rasmussen let's talk about chickenpox because the mayo clinic says this is a normally mild disease in healthy children in the pre-vaccine era it was considered an endemic and virtually everyone got the illness by adulthood but since the vaccine program in 1995 cases have dropped by an average of 97 percent and hospitalizations and deaths are down about 93 percent so while most kids won't get seriously ill if we have the means do you believe it's better for our collective public health to nearly eradicate an illness that could negatively impact anyone absolutely so i i remember the days before the chickenpox vaccine since i've been a pediatrician for a long time and there were times when kids would come in and be really sick from chickenpox and yeah most of the time chickenpox was a mild disease but it could be severe and the fact that now we can give kids a chickenpox vaccine give them the varicella vaccine and they can prevent those hospitalizations and severe illness that otherwise they would still have so i think this is really what is the important thing about coping 19 as well this is oftentimes a mild illness but can be severe and can cause death and potentially long covid as well why not prevent that when you have a safe and effective vaccine and doctor given that what should parents know about getting their child vaccinated against coven 19 and also so many parents want to know why is approval for a shot for kids under the age of five taking so much longer than expected yeah what i want parents to know is that there is a safe and effective vaccine available for covid19 for kids five and above and that if they still have questions the experts to talk to are their pediatricians your child's doctor is a person that's been trained to learn about infectious disease to learn about vaccines and they've learned a lot the last two years about cobia 19 that's the expert to talk to now why is it taking so long for a vaccine for kids under five i think that we have to keep in mind that we want to be sure that when a vaccine rolls out that we can say that we as pediatricians can say that it's safe and it's effective and right now those studies have not been completed to show that it's effective that the information we have is that it had was shown to be safe for kids under five but for kids two to five years of age it wasn't clear that it was going to be effective and of course we want a vaccine that works and is safe absolutely dr sonia rasmussen thank you very much for joining us all right thank you

#RumorReport",2021-09-14,360066,6703,4080,UChi08h4577eFsNXGd3sxYhw, [Music] this is the rumor report with angela yeah on the breakfast club well nicki minaj was on social media and she was explaining that she got covered while getting ready for the mtv video music awards she said i was prepping for vmas and i shot a video and guess who got kobe do you know what it is not to be able to kiss or hold your tiny baby for over a week a baby who was only used to his mama get that and then um she said drake told me he got covered with the vaccine though so child and then somebody uh responded to that and they said nikki the vaccine doesn't prevent getting covert it prevents you from getting serious symptoms non-vaccinated people are 11 times more likely to pass away from covert than vaccinated she responded babe that's not true i had the exact same symptoms as people with the damn vaccine she said they want you to get vaccinated for the med if i get vaccinated it won't be for the met it'll be once i feel i've done enough research i'm working on that now in the meantime my loves be safe wear the mask with two strings that grips your head and face not that loose one then she goes on to say my cousin and trinidad won't get the vaccine because his friend got it and became impotent his testicles became swollen his friend was weeks away from getting married now the girl called off the wedding so just pray on it and make sure you're comfortable with your decision and not bullied and then one person said i have to get the vaccine because they won't let me look for a job or get a job and to earn some money and you know i'm unsure about getting the second vaccine and she responded i know babe a lot of countries won't let people work without the vaccine i definitely recommend they get the vaccine they have to feed their families i'm sure i'll be vaccinated as well because i have to go on tour etc well julianne reed responded to nicki minaj's tweets on the cobot vaccine and here's what she had to say on msnbc people like nicki minaj i have to say this you have a platform sister that is 22 million followers for you to use your platform to encourage our community to not protect themselves and save their lives my god sister you could do better than that it's a blessing that you got that that people listen to you and they listen to you more they listen to me for you to use your platform to put people in the position of dying from a disease they don't have to die from oh my god as a fan as a hip-hop fan and somebody who is your fan i'm so sad i i respect julianne ray she's the homie but she missed the real moment to teach yesterday because nikki never said don't take the vaccine like she spoke on why she has vaccine hesitancy but she also in the very next tweet said she will probably get vaccinated to go on tour like joy could have used that moment on our show to correct nikki on whatever misinformation she put out and she could have said nicki minaj's incurring people encouraging people to do their research about the vaccine nikki put up a poll asking what's the best vaccine nikki said drake is vaccinated and she's going to get vaccinated to go on tour so if drake is vaccinated and nikki wants to get vaccinated why aren't you that's what joy could have could have done you can't vaccinate vaccination shame people though either like you got to allow people to make it when they want to make their own decision like this is something that's new this is something that that's we don't know about every other day something changes something is different we don't know about how this affects wear double masks we're a triple mask don't wear a mask you can go out no you can't go out nobody knows and that's her decision of her choice nicki minaj responded to joanne reed she said this is what happens when you're so thirsty to down another black woman by the request of the white man that you didn't bother to read all my tweets my god sister do better imagine getting your dumb ass on tv a minute after a tweet to spread a false narrative about a black woman and then somebody said nick shouldn't even have to say or explain anything it's literally in her tweets all you got to do is read it's that simple she said why would they bother to read when the lie is so juicy and provocative and got her dumb ass on tv they got someone with black skin for a reason they always use us against us and i mean yeah i mean it could have been a real teachable moment instead it turned into the verses that we don't need like i really hate how we live in this era where everything has to be aversus like joy and reid versus nicki minaj why if you see someone might have some misinformation school them and when you have a platform it can control a narrative put the narrative out there that you want because this could have been a moment to encourage folks to get the vaccine because the biggest rapper in the world drake is vaccinated and nikki said she wants to get vaccinated like why not focus on that she then posted a old post from joanne reed and she said a lying homophobic [ __ ] i guess i can join in the reindeer games too people can go on tv and lie on me i can report on them too right doesn't have to be truth it can be half truth uncle tamiana asked who on earth would trust the us fda guys and the post uh from joanne reed said i mean will anyone ever fully trust the cdc government again and who on god's earth would trust a vaccine approved by the fda how do we get a vaccine distributed after this broken trumpist nonsense has infected everything even if biden wins that's why you got to have more grace because just some months ago that's how she felt and there's still some people who feel like that so why not use these moments to teach instead of bash each other all right well i'm angela yee and that is your rumor report all right we got front page news next what are we talking about well yeah and let's talk about some unfortunate situations we'll tell you about uh two different couples who passed away uh recently very close in time to each other leaving behind multiple children yeah this was so sad i heard that story yesterday we'll get into it next is the breakfast club good morning [Music] you
449,TsUuypZ2jLc,Silk Implies Diamond Killed By COVID VACCINE INJURY: &#39;She Died SUDDENLY&#39;,"Batya Ungar-Sargon and Robby Soave discuss the gathering that took place over the weekend to remember the death of Diamond, of Diamond and Silk. #Diamond #Trump #vaccine

According to the CDC, all COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States are effective at preventing COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can offer some protection from future illness, sometimes called “natural immunity,” but the level of protection people get from having COVID-19 may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age. Getting a COVID-19 vaccination is also a safer way to build protection than getting sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without you having to experience sickness. Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can cause severe illness or death, and we can’t reliably predict who will have mild or severe illness. If you get sick, you can spread COVID-19 to others. You can also continue to have long-term health issues after COVID-19 infection.
While COVID-19 vaccines are effective, studies have shown some declines in vaccine effectiveness against infections over time, especially when the Delta variant was circulating widely.
The mRNA vaccines do not contain any live virus. Instead, they work by teaching our cells to make a harmless piece of a “spike protein,” which is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. After making the protein piece, cells display it on their surface. Our immune system then recognizes that it does not belong there and responds to get rid of it. When an immune response begins, antibodies are produced, creating the same response that happens in a natural infection.
In contrast to mRNA vaccines, many other vaccines use a piece of, or weakened version of, the germ that the vaccine protects against. This is how the measles and flu vaccines work. When a weakened or small part of the virus is introduced to your body, you make antibodies to help protect against future infection.
Everyone ages 18 and older should get a booster shot either 6 months after their initial Pfizer or Moderna series, or 2 months after their initial Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine. People ages 16–17 may get a booster dose of Pfizer at least 6 months after their initial series of vaccines.
The CDC says A person is fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving all recommended doses in the primary series of their COVID-19 vaccination. A person is up to date with their COVID-19 vaccination if they have received all recommended doses in the primary series and one booster when eligible.
Getting a second booster is not necessary to be considered up to date at this time. A study by The Cleveland Clinic found that both previous infection and vaccination provide substantial protection against COVID-19. Vaccination of previously infected individuals does not provide additional protection against COVID-19 for several months, but after that provides significant protection at least against symptomatic COVID-19.

silk however things took a turn at the memorial when silk seemed to suggest Diamond's death was perhaps vaccine related let's watch we later like they told us to lay our flat they said do CPR and it was one two three four one two three four one two three four my husband and I alternated and kept going and going and going until the emergency truck came and came into the the yard and the EMS came into the house they did everything that they could so what I want to say to everybody is don't you dare call me a conspiracy theorist because [Applause] I saw it happen I saw how it happened I was there when it happened and it happened suddenly I want America to wake up and pay attention something ain't right it's time to investigate what's really going on here and give some answers to why are people falling dead suddenly so I thought this was worth discussing because I think it's implied there that Silk is saying Diamond's death was vaccine related alluding to the the idea that people are suddenly dropping dead which I'm seeing a lot of on social media claims about that um but here's the thing I I think I think we got to be very careful here and I think frankly silk is not being careful because well for one thing uh diamond and silk both railed against vaccination against vaccines so was she even vaccinated so either um either she wasn't vaccinated in which case this sort of implying this is really misleading or she was vaccinated despite saying the VAC the Things She Said publicly about the vaccine so that would be I think a pretty serious hypocrisy I I I think it's very wrong to mislead your audience or if you're implying to your audience you think there's something wrong with the vaccines of you yourself uh had taken one um and then the other thing being I I know she was hospitalized very seriously with kovid a few weeks ago so then so then to say that if even if she was vaccinated the cause is somehow linked to the vaccine rather than some lingering complication of the disease itself uh so I find this all a little confused from Silk's point of view and I think it's look you can be you can absolutely be against vaccine mandates or have questions about the vaccines about which age group should get them if if you think the the risks or the harms outweigh getting them that's absolutely your choice and I think people can make that decision in good faith so I'm not like disdaining that at all but to just like say that if everyone dies now we're gonna say that was because of the vaccine even if they weren't vaccinated and had recently had a serious case of covet I I think when people are grieving it helps a lot to feel that your personal grief is has been caused by a bigger issue I I think people often take comfort in feeling like there's something bigger to blame for having when they've been robbed of somebody dear to them and I I that that was sort of what it seemed to me like was happening here um I think that's a very human impulse and I think you see that with a lot of people who die are killed in ways that touch on you know culture War issues or larger issues it just sort of I think people take comfort in feeling like there's just a bigger Crusade at stake and that it wasn't just like the horror of you know a quotidian death caused by um something like covet I mean we don't know right um I think your point is interesting that if she if if you know the implication here is that she died because she got vaccinated well then why was she railing against the vaccine while also being vaccinated um I think also another aspect of this is um you know the role that diamond and silk played in the in the in the kind of the imagination of the nation um vis-a-vis Trump was always extremely interesting to me because his relationship with them was um it was one of those moments where you he his his Humanity really came out I mean I you know you could say oh it was cynical you know he wanted to show that he had support from the black community he liked you know the the how supportive they were of him they were huge Trump cheerleaders but I think that um the the closeness there was not something you can fake I mean it was just there were like four or five moments people times that um showed a different side of trump a more human side of trump the side that the people who are close to him say exists you know that a lot you know a lot of other people don't regularly see and um in that sense I think you know I I think that was a really important role that they played um in sort of complexifying what what seemed to be very straightforward easy categories um and you know he sort of you know came out and you know spoke about his grief and um in that sense I think it was super interesting and and um and and the reason I bring that up is because of course Trump has been a big booster of vaccines you know he sort of put his stamp of approval on them you know operation warp speed was his and it's really put him at odds with the more extreme side of his base that's very anti-vaxx um and sort of leans towards these these theories about you know we we can't really call them conspiracy theories because we really don't know because so much of the information has been suppressed but just you know the the kind of the the the other side of this vaccine project um you know being more vocal about the potential the potential complications and of course these big pharmaceutical companies um requirements that they be uh protected from any liability there yeah that is a very interesting point it's something totally true and it's interesting Trump is at odds with the base on that a little bit the hardcore Maga base um he gets some of his only uh kind of boo uh boo responses when he speaks about operation warp speed and he wants to take credit for the vaccines being delivered and it's sort of a losing issue with the with the hardcore uh his hardcore supporters I don't think it's a losing issue necessarily with with the the rest of the population I mean most people did get back like the majority of Americans got vaccinated and don't hold intensely negative views about the vaccines themselves obviously the the the required requirements mandates are a much more uh divided topic and a topic where I probably agree with the hardcore Mega people on um and nor did I want to bring this up because I wanted to you know make light and this is a horrible thing obviously someone dying I'm very sad for her loved ones for uh for silk Etc but they they are public figures they were public figures and uh you know I think it's when when a public figure is using um a a tragedy I mean I say this right when Democratic politicians take tragedies and they then start trying to say well if only we'd have X Y and Z policy and then Republicans do that on different policies right everyone says oh we should have had my policy in certain to use that moment to to influence how what the laws are going to be or how Americans should feel about something I mean I think that's worth uh uh probing a little bit and she seemed to me very much there to be going down the people are suddenly dying and it's because of the vaccine which look if that's your argument just show me some data right show me some evidence that that's the case because people keep pointing to things and then I look actually at the data and they're talking about deaths that could not actually be attributed to uh to vaccine-induced heart problems that are I mean it's a little bit like like anything it's a little bit actually like kova desk themselves now which are Dr Leanna Wen thinks are being over counted actually because people get brought to the hospital for some other reason uh and then but if they have covid it gets recorded as a coveted death even if covet is not contributing to it there's a little bit of that I think even going on with the with the heart Edition deaths or or incidents that are affecting athletes and young people I mean there if you look at that database that was cited by um by the the one uh one of the very kind of anti-vaccine doctors you're looking like well some of these people died of like car crashes right that's not the vaccine um so people people ought to be I think very just as I said people ought to be careful about saying everybody who dies who had coveted it's because of covet or attributing everything wrong in our society to Long covid which is a subject I think you and I feel similarly about we've had we've talked to some guests about it and got a lot of a lot of blowback from that on social media I don't know how your uh your mentions were after we did that interview with uh with the new Republic reporter on uh on uh long covet and the people came for me after that one but similarly I I counsel a little bit of skepticism or caution with the with the vaccine deaths so with the alleged vaccine desk yeah and it's it's uh it's interesting because of course just a month into the pandemic conservatives were saying look you're over count the deaths like every person who comes in with a heart attack will happen Steph covet you're saying is a covet death right so of course to now see the Liberals admitting that I think it's very frustrating exactly with with never any any acknowledgment that you know some people got there two and a half three years ago right um you know I I I look you know we don't know what what Diamond died of I wonder if we will if that information will become public knowledge I just don't begrudge somebody in the grip of grief um you know trying to find some larger thing to blame and and I I would I would be Grudge her I wouldn't be grudger even if it turns out that she died of covet because she didn't get vaccinated right because she didn't get the thing that makes the symptoms less serious you know I think again in the grip of grief you you can't really fault somebody even if they're a public figure for saying something that you know may or may not be be based in reality uh but I get what we'll probably find out more and then you know we'll be able to judge and add it to you know the wealth of information we have and make more education decisions going forward all right well we will continue with more rising in just a minute please stay with us

#DRJ #cdc #who",2024-02-19,2213,236,31,UCkiTp9kSAJ70a5cD-BbNNog, a new study is making major headlines today even though it hasn't been released yet it's being massively promoted by mainstream media organizations so I'm immediately skeptical but I wanted to look into it and talk about it since they're calling it the largest covid vaccine study the study found covid mRNA gene therapy shots were linked to small increases in neurological blood and heart conditions several times in the media they mentioned the increases were small they used the word small a bunch but let's first talk about the organization that funded the study then we'll talk about the authors and then we'll look at the actual study so first the study was funded by the global vaccine Data Network which sounds very established and academic and they use fancy words on their website like post introduction of pharmo pharmaco vigilant pharmaco vigilance study responsiveness and they mentioned it's a multinational collaboration and they also specifically mentioned co9 vaccines which clearly is why they created this Global vaccine Data Network out of thin air by the way and they say six countries are involved and 31 sites and somehow 300 million people are involved this is all completely hilarious because if you go to their Facebook page they have exactly 139 followers and their first post was May 9th 2023 so clearly they're gaslighting you on their website I did a podcast a while back with Ben pulski and he has 3 million followers on his Facebook pages billions and billions and pages so that's genuine following not some over a billion 300 million trillion million furthermore When You Dig Deeper by going into the World Health organization's website it says the global vaccine network is a member of the World Health Organization L project V vaccine safety net so it's basically just a shell company for The Who for the World Health Organization which we all know is a deeply corrupt organization shame on anyone who works for them they should disband and do something better with their lives the we provided notice yesterday to Capitol Hill of our intent to withdraw from the World Health Organization but the president's made very clear we are not going to underwrite an organization that has historically been incompetent but don't forget the history this is an institution that got it wrong on SARS it got it wrong on Ebola the United States had to create its own system pep bar to do the work to prevent and come up with solutions to the HIV AIDS problem we did that the United States did that the World Health Organization has a long history of corruption and politicization next the principal investigator of this study the guy that oversaw the study was Harland Crum Holtz which of course he says these covid vaccines can save millions of lives which there's no data support by the way but he says there can also be small numbers of people adversely affected so let's look at the his legal conflict of interest in scientific research because these legally need to be listed which is a good thing he has served on the advisory boards for various pharmaceutical companies and he has a scientific adviser for centen which means he probably makes some bunch of money from them what the hell is centen it's a vaccine producer and one with a history as sketchy as the global vaccine Network for example the owner of this vaccine company Cen is Naomi balabin and she has a whopping eight connections on LinkedIn so she's almost as popular as the global vaccine network with their 139 Facebook followers and the global vaccine network doesn't even have a LinkedIn page so I can't compare that number so anyway this crumb Holtz is clearly a big vaccine Pusher or he's making money on vaccines and sure enough if you go to this new study the actual study its conclusion is that targeting Public Health messaging may be needed to ensure engagement in public health prevention measures AS Global vaccination efforts continue in other words we're going to push these things globally and we need to do anything it takes to get it done with the messaging so looking at the conflict of interest in other authors on this paper it reads like Fior do doki's Crime and Punishment book it's super long list and of course all kinds of influence were made here by the CDC since they're trying to save face on their debacle of pushing vaccines on kids that don't need it even six-month old babies their list of recommended vaccines on the CDC is so long it's hard to even find a covid vaccine recommendation and all the other ones they have but going back to the conflict of interest it's got the global vaccine Data Network listed so we know they're funding they're literally funding this and basically it's a list of who's who's in the Pharma companies including fire that's also on here because they have their tentacles and everything so what's really obnoxious about this supposed study is it's not even published yet you literally cannot yet analyze the findings because they didn't publish them yet they've only published an abstract where they can say anything any opinions they want but one thing that's disconcerting is that they only looked for Adverse Events of special interests up to 42 days following mRNA gene therapy and we all know how underreported the events are and sometimes how longterm they so basically what these corrupt organizations are doing here is they're trying to downplay the vaccine injuries because we all literally know someone all of us we know someone that had vaccine injuries and they're trying to publish something that researchers and mainstream media can point to as an authority and say see there are a few minor injuries and a few not small number of cases but overall we save millions of lives while making billions of dollars it's basically trying to get ahead of the land slide of vac vaccine injury data that's going to be coming out in the form of excess deaths heart attacks heart palpitations on and on so they can control the narrative and continue to push this cash cow which is the MRNA injection of all types not just for Co but of all types that's what it comes down to

453,ii8rqmLZhvM,How does the UK plan to rollout the Covid vaccine? - BBC Newsnight,"As the UK approves the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, what do we know about the rollout and could it start within days? Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog

People should not get ""carried away with over optimism"" after the UK approved its first coronavirus vaccine, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned.

The prime minister said it did not mean ""our struggle is over"", saying parts of the economy still faced tough restrictions.

England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam urged patience over the rollout of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab, which begins early next week.

But care home residents will have to wait due to logistical challenges.

What do we understand of the rollout of the vaccine and who will get priority? 

How effective will the vaccine be long-term? And why has the UK approval come first?

UK Editor Katie Razzall reports and Emily Maitlis speaks to BioNTech’s Chief Business and Commercial Officer, Sean Marett, SAGE member Professor John Edmunds, the World Health Organisation’s Dr Margaret Harris and Professor Anthony Harnden, from the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation.

is the first country in the world to have given the go-ahead for this vaccine 800 000 doses are expected to arrive in uk distribution warehouses from belgium by this weekend that will then scale up to the 40 million doses the uk has bought enough for 20 million people it's a huge logistical challenge so what do we know about the plans today we learnt more about how the vaccine is stored and transported the so-called cold chain process it's kept in ultra-low freezer units at minus 70 degrees and can be stored here for up to six months but it'll be transported in what fies are called thermal shippers essentially pizza boxes packed with dry ice each tray inside can hold up to a thousand vaccines with five trays in each shipper these will be tracked from belgium into the uk using gps enabled temperature sensors to ensure the low temperatures but crucially fizer says the vaccine can be stored at a normal fridge temperature of two to eight degrees for up to five days making it easier for the nhs to administer although we are the first health service in the world to be able to get vaccinating supplies from the manufacturer are phased so the initial tranche in december is going to enable us to get started but the bulk of this vaccination program either through this vaccine or hopefully others as well that will join it will take place in the period january through to march or april for the at-risk population the jcvi the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation said today the best option is to target people most at risk of morbidity and mortality from next week in england 50 so-called hospital hubs will start the process scotland will begin with health and care staff from tuesday in england although over 80s and care home staff will be prioritized it's understood at first that will only be those going into hospital for an outpatient appointment for now this vaccine won't be going straight into care homes even though care home regulators and staff are at the very top of the priority list for vaccination that's because the regulator hasn't yet approved splitting up the contents of those trays that hold 975 doses into smaller more manageable numbers as soon as it is legally and technically possible to get the vaccine into care homes we will do so but you know that this is a complex product with a very fragile cold chain it's not a yogurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in multiple times it's really tricky to handle with more than 400 000 people living in uk care homes and hit so hard in the pandemic it's not what they wanted to hear we've been working on the expectation that holmes would be getting the tests and care home residents and care home staff would be getting the test as the vaccine as soon as those are available and that's been the working assumption uh since the publication of the jcvi priority list back in september so it's it's pretty disappointing to hear today that the plan for roll out doesn't actually enable that to happen when it comes to rollout gps are to be the next step in what's likely to be the biggest vaccination program ever they'll start operating local centers across england inviting in at-risk patients for a jab then a booster three weeks later those over 80 and front-line health and social care staff are second on the priority list for practices like ours we're used to doing it we're doing it at the moment with flu vaccinations so it's not a big problem except to do with fridges and temperatures that's an issue but we think we can get around that without too much problem we are already talking in our area so this is the east end of london 400 000 population probably having one main center where we vaccinate from the general practice perspective none of this is mandatory to reach immunity people will need to want to take up the offer the european medicines agency appeared to criticize its british counterpart today saying it won't authorize pfizer's vaccine until it's got more evidence and done more checks being first isn't always a good sell when it comes to medicines where people quite naturally have concerns about potential safety issues that's not always a good thing so i think the government's gonna and the medical authorities are gonna have to uh you know work very hard to make sure that the public is reassured around the safety and efficacy of this drug as the vaccine rollout spreads across the country expect a widespread campaign of information and persuasion over the coming months katie razzle and katie's with me now and we've heard on a sort of similar area katie but slightly different about university students and how they're going to have to stagger their returns tell us more yes emily the government's announced what more detail and what we were reporting earlier this week if you remember and they're saying that yes student return to english universities will be staggered over five weeks after christmas and that they'll be offered rapid covert testing by the universities that have already offered that to them for leaving to leave they'll be offered that on their return department for education is also saying that students who go home to tier three areas where mass testing's on offer should take up a test before they come back to university and that's obviously to try and stop the scenes that we saw in october with all those spikes and cases and student self-isolating i've heard that there was quite a lot of tough lobbying by universities with more students who do the kind of courses social work nursing medicine those kind of courses where you need in-person teaching you need placements and that lobbying worked they've they've won so they're coming back first they're allowed back to take up those offers replacements and all of that they get to come back between january the 4th and january 18th whereas all other students will have learning only online and they have a travel window between the 25th of january and the 7th of february so another start for many of them to an abnormal term in these abnormal times goodness kitty thanks very much indeed so what then do we know of the way the vaccine actually works and how quickly will other countries reach their own regulatory sign off earlier i spoke to sean merritt of the company behind it by on tech here the 1am email this morning and asked him whether we should be worried that the uk is the first country to give its approval there is no question in our minds that the uh questions we've received and we are the marketing authorization holder beyond tech meaning that we we get to interact directly with the uk regulatory authorities that the uk have asked us some very very deep questions about uh our vaccine before approving it and the significance of that is what that you feel they have been as rigorous as they possibly could at checking i can tell you we we we're so in in many jurisdictions we own the the product and so we deal with the regulators directly and from from what we have dealing with the uk and other regulators there is absolutely no difference in the depth of questions that they ask and they ask three questions uh the first one is does this look like it's going to help protect the population against covert the second is is this uh sufficiently tolerated to be given to the um british people and the third is does this company or in this case does this company with its partner manufacture this product to the highest quality consistency each time each time and those are the questions we've had to answer uh highly scientifically in a rigorous manner you're a german company and you're speaking to us from germany what's been the reaction there in germany that actually the uk will get this first i think that um i think that the uh if you look at the expectations around regulatory uh approval in europe we expect that this month uh if all goes well in the united states we expect that this month um so i think in terms of a couple of weeks here and there i don't really think that that makes a difference however what where it does make a difference is that of course the uk uh can go ahead now uh as the first country to start vaccinating its uh its population and for me i have a a a really uh specific interest in the uk and our kids are here and my parents are in the over 80s bracket and until they get vaccinated we can't see them this vaccine works differently to any other vaccine that's been approved the mrna the way it's used just explain to us what that is so mrna stands for messenger rna and it's a messaging molecule we have billions of copies of this in our in our body messenger rna and all we have done is we've taken that message message and adapted it to instruct the immune system to to watch out for virus and if a virus in fact destroy it and we know that the vaccine protects you but you might still spread it is that right you could still get infected with covid it just wouldn't make you ill yeah so i i we cannot answer that question yet what we can answer is uh the question what sort of protection do we see and protection is defined as in our clinical trial of 43 000 folks uh do you get symptoms of covert or not on our vaccine versus a placebo arm and the answer is in 95 percent of cases you do not on this vaccine get symptoms of the virus and that's true for all age groups elderly over 65 through down to 18 year olds now does that mean that we don't spread it that's for further scientific analysis we cannot say yet so if i have the two doses of the vaccine could i hug a friend straight after or could i still be passing on covert well what we've shown is that uh you yourself will be protected seven days after the second dose as to whether you would spread it uh it's unlikely uh we would say but we have no evidence to suggest uh that you uh that you would not spread it i think it's just simply too premature to be able to address that very important scientific question and will your christmas celebrations be even bigger for you because of this or do you think you'll be even more cautious you won't presumably be coming over here to hug your parents yet no i i i think that um i think of course we would love to come but i think you've got to wait 28 days from from uh first injection to make sure that according to our clinical trial uh you're you're you're covered and so unfortunately uh we're going to miss uh christmas in the uk this year but what we can say is uh the providing my parents get vaccinated over the next few months we can come for easter and that will really please the grandchildren here john thank you very much indeed thank you well let's take some of those thoughts a little bit further joining us now professor john edmonds the epidemiologist who sits on the sage advisory body professor anthony hardin from the joint committee of vaccination and immunization and dr margaret harris from the world health organization a warm welcome uh to you all professor edwards i'm going to start with you because you often come on this program you're quite calm and sanguine can i ask you how you're feeling tonight that's great this is fantastic news uh really is it's amazing achievement can you explain to us why this is a game changer not just for covert but potentially for all vaccines yeah so this is a new type of vaccine this mrna vaccine so the modern vaccine is very similar um and we haven't had these sorts of vaccines before they have been in development for some time but they haven't got through you know to licensure yet uh until today um and i think but there's lots of advantages of these vaccines which is why they've been so so much interest in them over the last few years so they're kind of easier to manufacture in a sort of in a in a in a way that is replicable and and so on which is one of the very important things that the manufacturers have to do they have to make sure that they can manufacture it in exactly the same way uh again and again and again and again and the way it's manufactured because of it because of it it's it's novel kind of construct it means that it's it's easier to do that most vaccines you have to grow the virus on some cells you have to grow some cells first and that's difficult to do and then you have to grow virus and that's difficult to do because viruses kill the cells and all that sort of stuff and then you have to uh somehow remove the bits of the virus that you want and purify that and and uh and use it in a vaccine so it's all complicated and lots of things uh you know there's lots of sort of difficult steps in all of that process and this is much simpler um a kind of uh chemical process really rather than a biological process can i ask you something um because you heard uh just before sean merritt talking about he called it the messenger rna should should people be concerned i mean is there any worry that that changes the dna or is this a is it safer than than using a bit of the virus itself it's safer probably um it can't change your dna you can't do that um there's there's you can't go from rna back to dna there's only a few viruses that can do that every other every other living organism can only go from dna to rna and so there's no way that it can change your dna there is just no no mechanism for any living organism to do that so professor honda that's that sounds like it's about as as safe as we could possibly hope for the question that you've been dealing with is how do you get it to the right places and who's on the priority list we've had a look at that if you were a younger man who's shielding versus an elderly person in a care home i mean how do you how are you weighing up those i mean these are very difficult issues to weigh up but can i just echo john's thought this is a pivotal moment for the uk in our collective response to this ghastly virus and i think we should all be celebrating at the moment um these were incredibly difficult issues to weigh up but we looked very very carefully to all the epidemiological data that was both published and unpublished and and it was quite clear that the the morbidity and mortality was so biased towards age you are hugely more at risk the older you get and in fact if you look at deaths for instance 90 of all deaths were in 65 year olds or above to date and um 99 of deaths will be covered by the nine priority groups which we've we've we've outlined so there will be there of course there are going to be individuals who will be outliers and and and and who we would love to give the vaccine given unlimited supply one of the great things about our country is that we have a nationalized health service we we believe in equity we believe in fairness and and actually we believe in protecting the most vulnerable in society and and and that that's the route that we've taken let me ask you with your gp hat on and also i think as a long covered sufferer yourselves if you're hearing people saying i've had covert i don't need it what would be your answer well well my answer is my own experiences i i developed covid three days after my 60th birthday with with with complications and i've still got lingering effects to date and and quite surprisingly nine months later i'm still not well so so my message without any shadow of a doubt is to get that vaccine i have two elderly parents one of which is very disabled both over the age of nine eighty my father phoned me up the other day should i get the vaccine of course you should get my vaccine dad it it's safe it's effective and it it's going to be a game changer let me bring in dr harris um and it was interesting hearing professor hondan talk about you know the the sort of the national health service here of course which we all depend on i guess some are looking at this on a more global level and they're worried that britain might have jumped the gun what would you say to them i would say that we are confident that the british authorities have looked fully you've got very good regulatory authorities and i think the important point was i heard the chairman describing or turbos and describing how they'd been working in parallel and work from the scientists to the regulators to everybody to do this work and really do it in a really efficient way to ensure we get to this stage so quickly so it's not about cutting corners it's about working i'm so sorry we're having complications with your line right now we're going to try and get this up because this is vital stuff and and we don't want to miss it but we're just maybe going to call you back dial you up again and make sure that we get a bit of a a clearer picture um can i go back to to you professor edmunds and one of the things that we know is that we we're going to start with the fires of bayern tech hopefully we'll get the um the vaccine from oxford university the astrazeneca one two now there's a big disparity in in how those are being charged so the fisa one is being charged at sort of proper market rates and the oxford one isn't do you think that is a complication in terms of how it's rolled out for um i don't think i think it's it's a bit of a complication of course to deliver two different vaccines and uh that that will be difficult and we'll have to monitor very carefully the effectiveness and safety of both of those vaccines and indeed the mod earner and others when they come on on stream as well and so we'll have to know because we'll have to try you know although this has been uh this first one the the beyond tech visor one has been uh approved for use we still have to monitor it very carefully to make sure that it is genuinely safe and it is uh genuinely effective and so we'll have to be able to work out what for each person what vaccines they got and when they got them in order to properly monitor their safety right and effectiveness but we can do that we have mechanisms to do that here in this country we've got very good systems very good electronic health records uh so we can do this sort of thing and we've got lots of experience of doing it professor hunter we heard the pm say there are immense logistical challenges tonight now in terms of the sort of rollout and how you get it and how it's stored and everything i mean a lot has been discussed on that already what would you expect when it arrives in this country are we going to work solidly through christmas i mean would you expect gps to have their surgeries open and the places whether it's football stadiums or you know garages or village halls or whatever would those be going right the way through the holidays now is that the only way well i would hope so i i must say that i'm not involved in the logistics of the delivery of the vaccine that's that's nhs england and the devolved nations but i'm involved in the deliver responsibility delivery for my own primary care practice and i know that primary care are going to step up to the plate here um i know that if we can get the hold of the vaccine what you're going to be working all the way through the christmas holidays we will work whatever we need to make sure that our patients are vaccinated without any doubt at all now now the the the the the logistic challenges are quite enormous with this particular vaccine but as john says there's others that are coming on board yeah and as soon as as soon as we um we in primary care we get the green light to go ahead we will be well organized we will be well set up and we will have we will marshal the use and use of experience of people that are experiencing mass immunization programs for instance emily we immunize 15 million people a year for the flu you know which is which is a fifth of what we have to do now okay we have to give two vaccines for this this this this particular vaccine but but it's possible it's feasible and i think i think i i think i speak on behalf of all my gp colleagues to say we want to embrace this we we want to protect our patients we want to be able to deliver the best system that we can for them let me go to margaret harris and i'm sorry about the problems we had earlier i guess the question that i was trying to ask is the difference between the uk having it before developing countries and how that works um do you believe it's ethical for pharmaceutical companies who've benefited from taxpayer cash to profit from the life-saving vaccine or do you think that in the way that the oxford vaccine is being rolled out you know cost price um everyone should be giving up their patents at this point and saying this is something global that we need to do for each other well we actually have a mechanism called the kovacs facility which enables the wealthier countries to in fact do that decent the fair thing to ensure that every country around the world gets it at the same time so uh what that involves really is the wealthy countries paying the cost price but the the countries that don't have burst resources being supported so and the aim of this is to ensure then that everybody will get the same time was allocated three percent to each country um so three percent of their population in order to again get it to the most vulnerable very very quickly so indeed there are no mechanisms and i believe they will come into action and we will see this happen and it's the first time we've ever done it as as humanity it's quite extraordinary thank you all very much indeed thanks for joining us

we're still suffering from excess deaths of about a thousand a week for the course of the last year now you know bear in mind we do have an aging population we do have a rapidly growing population but these figures are adjusted to deal with that well I'm joined by Angus leich professor of oncology at St George's University of London and I'm wondering about this Angus cuz I'm looking at excess deaths during the pandemic but equally before that I mean clearly the rate of death in Britain will grow with an aging population yes it will but these figures are meant to be adjusted for that meant to be adjusted for that and age adjusted as well and I mean I've seen the the very raw figures and they are they are quite worrying because there's excess deaths of the younger people going on not just in the older population but in the people under 40 and the real Peaks between 40 and 64 65 now this this is something that is highly unusual and highly alarming it was initially dismissed as due to people not getting statins remember Chris witty said this which I thought was really quite alarming because you don't get off at statins till you're over 55 60 so it can't possibly be involved with that group now the one major thing we said was lockdown the fact of lockdown and everything it did this would go on to excess deaths due to cancer and various other things because of misdiagnosis misdiagnosis mistreatments everything but there's something far worse than this now when you actually look at these these figures that we have they're the same in uh in in Europe in Australia in other places too and one of the things that I flagged up and nobody's taken any real notice of and it's even more pertinent now is that others have pointed out this excess death started and correlates with the vaccine program so it doesn't mean to say It's associated but why hasn't it been looked at why hasn't it been really really Sly looked at and it hasn't because myself and other colleagues have raised this ad nauseum and we get absolutely nothing but to say it's all expected I mean the claim is Angus the claim is from The Establishment claim is that having the vaccine saved a huge number of lives and that whilst there are some who suffer from side effects they are a tiny percentage that is what claim well I I personally don't believe it at all because one of the things that you get taught when you're at medical school if you know two people with a condition then it's very common well I I find it very difficult to find people who don't know uh someone who's had an adverse effect from the vaccine campaign the vaccine program and the bottom line it wouldn't matter so much if the vaccines were doing something against something which was killing us but it's not the covid against which the vaccines were against it's long since left the Earth it left the possibly getting on two years ago hang on a second we're told that CO's coming back and but it it's a different one and it will not be affected by the vaccine whatever they tell you the uh the companies tell you that they've got B veent vaccines which will protect against the vaccine well I can assure you they don't I mean they got passed in 8 mice and uh you can't tell anything from eight mice only when you can do those uh programs properly in a community can you uh make those sort of claims well I disagree that any of those claims can be justified does your skepticism about this vaccine make you a par in in academic and and and Medical Circle yes of course it does it does because there there is a uh a group think that thinks an accepted it's very good it's safe and effective when uh I was trained as a clinical scientist to look at the facts and to con constantly change my opinion depending on the facts and this is what's going on the facts are changing and some stage well I I point out in the big American flu vaccine flu crisis of 1977 when they were dying people the soldiers were dying in their 30s they rushed out a vaccine program 42 million people were vaccinated and then there were reports of Gillian bar which is this assembling paralysis which is is not uncommon with a lot of vaccines and instead of denying it they sent people out into the field and they came back and said yes it definitely goes and do you know what they did they turned around they said well no one's dying of the flu anymore let's get rid of the vaccine we should have done that I believe a couple of years well Angus it's fascinating as I say you know I could get a lot of people on from Academia and the medical world who take a very different view of and and I've had them on this program trying to convince me to get the booster but let's move on to your absolutely specialist field of oncology now the Times newspaper going very big today yes on on several issues to do with cancer the first one we touched on a moment ago lack of diagnosis for cancer during the pandemic how serious is that I think it was very very serious and that's why I said at the time with lockdown that anybody's lives saved from Lockdown would be more than tripled in people who died because of lockdown and if they had had the services I mean the NHS became a covid service so everything was shut down and we know that within cancer getting early diagnosis is absolutely crucial for cure I mean it's really amazing how well we've improved over the last 20 years we can cure a lot of cancers that couldn't be cured before but only if we get them early and what we are witnessing is uh people uh who've actually had the symptoms they've tried to get tests and they've been cancelled two three times and then by the time it's sorted and they go for their treatment they've been treated for a stage three stage four cancer when they should have been stage two potentially completely curable and that is the problem now the other thing that's come on uh that we're dealing with is the number of people who are now been susceptible to cancer because of their lifestyle and one of the biggest is actually obesity I mean we've recognized this this obesity for a long long time but it is a major cause it was picked up initially with renal cancer then endometrial cancer but actually when you look back it's all cancers and there was a report in the times it was costing us 100 billion which is nearly the cost of the NHS a year we're going to have to start tackling this sort of thing to bring down the cancer I me they were suggesting and it's it's modeling and it could be completely wrong but they were suggesting by 2040 there could be one diagnosis per minute in the United Kingdom so so that the the the regularity the percentage of cancers as as a percentage of the population is growing in our country without a doubt when I started uh doing oncology it was one in 10 people were going to get cancer and needing treatment and then within 20 years it was one in three and now one in two patients will get cancer in their lifetime so the the demand just from the current population let alone the excess population uh is just enormous and I don't feel that we've actually planned to deal with that that's the other thing well there are two points here one is how we deal with it we clearly going be a huge problem uh but the other is of course the best medicine of all is the medicine that can actually educate people and stop getting it in the first place we fought huge battles with drinking excess drinking smoking but you're suggesting actually diet is now playing as big a factor as anything else I know there are some experts more expert than me in these fields who actually say that the their diet and obesity is now a bigger cause of cancer than smoking and anything else put together so we we it's beholden on us not to ignore that and to act our policies because it could save us so much in the long term in the long run and it's not just cancer you get for obese you get uh all the other things go with dietes Hy no no well I think the education system's got a very big role to play Angus never boring thank you for coming on and joining us on GB news

Karen Freeman Wilson president of the Chicago Urban League speaking on chicago-based WTTW news dispelling any notion that coveted vaccine related employer mandates would shoot out black and brown communities that comment was the subject of independent journalist Lee Fong's recent sub stack piece examining how pharmaceutical giant Pfizer was behind funding groups like The Chicago Urban League heavily lobbying for covid vaccine mandates he found that Pfizer gave one hundred thousand dollars to the organization who's not the only organization Pfizer gave cash to now here to discuss the expansive Financial effort to Pfizer went to in supporting groups like The Chicago Urban League is author of that piece Lee Fong great to see Lee hey Robbie thanks for having me yeah yeah we're doing uh just fine exciting week it's been tell us more about your reporting and what you've found here we're very interested in efforts that you know all sorts of individuals and organizations made but particularly Pfizer itself to promote the vaccine yeah so this piece looks at exclusive documents um that detailed Pfizer's donations to outside third party organizations and really looking at their role in lobbying for policies that compelled people to take uh the coveted vaccine you know in 2021 there were a number of city state and the federal government's coveted vaccine mandate um really compelling and coercing people to take the vaccine there were not exemptions for prior infection or natural immunity um this was a very controversial policy and part of the lobbying effort to build public support and policy maker support for this coveted vaccine mandate was the role of these Community groups civil rights groups medical societies public health organizations a lot of these groups were very visible and pushing for the Mandate and like the Urban League was one of them they did not disclose that they were funded at the time by Pfizer and you know I was looking at some of these specialized grants they were funded in particular to promote immunizations promote the vaccine to kind of dispel myths about the vaccine to engage in legislative strategy um you know related to Pfizer so you know this is kind of a a long time strategy of big Pharma drug companies have been under the rate been under scrutiny for their role in funding third-party groups that kind of create the appearance of public support for their products but this is kind of an extreme example because you know this is the most lucrative uh pharmaceutical product but perhaps in human history this is a very controversial policy opposed by many civil Libertarians labor groups and others but the role of Pfizer funding this outside support for the Mandate hasn't been disclosed until now being one because earlier in the pandemic there was this sensitivity to the idea that black Americans in particular have had a complicated relationship with the you know medical industry because of instances like the Tuskegee experiment being experimented on injected with a disease not being told Etc and that the way the posture that the government took toward encouraging people to make use of a vaccine which did dramatically lower hospitalization rates especially in those early days before people had had any kind of booster or protection at all was to not browbeat blind people or not to kind of smear them the way that I think that some more conservative leaning people who objected to the vaccine were smeared but to be sensitive those concerns and to align them by talking about safety and all of those other kinds of things that shifted at a certain point and there was much more of a cudgel that was used or an implication that you know talking about the disparities in vaccines between black people and other people was seen as politically inconvenient because what you know if we're saying that anti-vac or non-vaxxers are bad Republican racist what do you do with this black population who's also expressing some concerns about vaccine hesitancy so so having a group particularly a a black oriented group receive funding does does help to paper over some of those tensions and I I also am concerned about it because so many I would say black groups are disproportionately underfunded have fundraising concerns we see this with black electeds that they tend to come from poorer districts have a tougher time earning money and do tend to be more susceptible for those reasons to taking money from various corporations when there is a time a difference of interest between the people who are giving the money and the groups that they are supposed to serve and I wonder if you've seen anything about whether or not there were any concerns about black black people in Chicago potentially losing their jobs having economic conflict sequences as a result of not wanting to that might take the vaccine being subjected to an actual mandate no we you know we know that the mandates uh created the firing of thousands of workers across the country I don't know if we have a racial breakdown but we do know that you know in municipalities like New York City and DC San Francisco and others um there was a kind of a racial disparity in terms of was taking uh the the vaccine who was not kind of abiding by these mandates uh there was kind of a disproportionate effect but you know you're you're right there there was kind of early early in the pandemic there was a concern and I think a very nuanced discussion about you know what are the legitimate fears and concerns around the vaccine how what's the most kind of effective way to talk about these issues and and to persuade but by 2021 on summer 2021 uh like a lot of the the covid discourse it was very polarized you know just like how in the media any kind of discussion around the origins of kovid became very polarized you know if you had kind of any suspicions about a lab leak you were condemned as you know a bigot or you know a Trumper um you know concerns around vaccine mandates uh similarly became polarized you know if you were condemned as a racist or you know extremist or an anti-vaxxer um you know there are many benefits to the vaccine now that we see um we there's a lot of research and studies showing that the Pfizer vaccine and others reduce kind of the severeness especially in elderly uh more kind of vulnerable populations um there's great benefits to that but rather than having kind of a detailed discussion based on the scientific research that became kind of a again a polarized discussion of you know you're either with us or against us not looking at the research showing that look um a lot of the the claims around um when from proponents selling the vaccine saying you know this will end the pandemic once you take the vaccine uh you know there's no chance of transmission you can't get covid that was wrong that was not supported by the evidence that those those claims by the administration and others were disputed at the time and now you know years out it looks clearly false um but you know we're in a moment of kind of Hysteria around these issues and you couldn't have a sober discussion yeah that is the Crux of this matter that the people pushing not just the vaccine but but being open to policies actually requiring it in the various places it was required is required for many workers it was required for some schools it's still to this day is required the bivalent booster on some college campuses when they go back in the fall they'll have to take it and the the justification was a public health benefit not for yourself but you have to take this because this is going to drive down cases in the long run the people making that the public health establishment the government Health scientists and advisors and Pfizer itself its boosters and and the media and you know everyone pressuring tech companies to to tow that line on social media like you said that all ended up being wrong and I don't know if there's there's going to be any Reckoning you know Dr fauci there was an article he was interviewed uh in the New York Times yesterday we talked about it and he's asked some pretty pointed questions about that about hurting about herd immunity about all sorts of things and uh and I saw I sensed very little accountability from him uh personally you know you've been on kind of the looking at the the Pfizer side of things can can you sense any Reckoning within the company itself on how on how this vaccine was was not necessarily sold under false pretenses but certainly the the necessity of requiring it was was pushed under under premises that turned out to be wrong well there are a couple things here you know when you're a big Corporation an oil company a bank or a big tech company you know the public uh is suspicious for a very good reason you know you're these corporations exist to make profit uh not to serve the public interest and so to build public support for their lobbying strategies for their other kind of goals in society they often use this Playbook of funding outside groups with much more credibility like here with more with Pfizer funding civil rights organizations and public health organizations uh medical societies and you know uh in Congress we're now seeing a lot of interesting questions being raised about the role of these um covid policies were they based on sound scientific and medical evidence the problem here I think is tension around money and politics um republicans in Congress are are quick to kind of investigate the CDC and other publicate health agencies but they're a little bit more reluctant so far in investigating uh big corporate interests you know they haven't really subpoenaed the big biopharma lobbying groups like bio and Pharma I you know I don't I haven't seen the kind of strident investigations of Pfizer itself I think there's a great opportunity to really understand um the way that these policies were crafted the role of large Pharma corporations and shaping the public debate shaping these regulatory policies shaking shaping even just the discourse by funding these groups that were very visible in the media back in 2021 2022 I think that's TBD it's yet to be determined yeah I'm so glad that you're on that beat Lee thank you for always following the money so assiduously I look forward to seeing your future reporting on the subject thanks for having me more Rising after this foreign [Music]
459,hIxbSQlOfbM,What Happens After The Second COVID Vaccine Shot (funny) | Brickology Stop Motion,"Recently, I read a story about a nurse that still tested positive for VOCID even after getting the first vaccine shot. Remember that the vaccine doesn’t start working IMMEDIATELY. It will take a while for your body to build up immunity.

So after you get the second shot (or even the first), please continue to protect yourself and others. The vaccine roll out will take some time to complete, but I believe it will be available to all who desire it. Educate yourself and stay informed!
Stay safe!

#covid #medicine #research",2024-03-07,12824,1291,314,UCSxeKmlI8XLrI1eMaqqM-kg, hi good evening I'm Dr Philip McMillan thank you for joining me and today I'm reflecting on covid Heroes people who stood up against the tide and made a statement and actually made a difference now sometimes Heroes don't know they're Heroes they're just doing what they think is the right thing to do and in this moment because about two years ago this doctor Dr Steve James stood up against vaccine mandates in the UK for the NHS the National Health Service was it was a very unusual moment that was captured and for those people who don't quite know what happened I'm just going to take you through a few steps to show you what he was thinking before he did it and and what he actually did I'm going to also highlight the um the BBC response because not long after he did this you had a very clear response from the BBC where they fact checked what he said when he challenged the health secretary so I'll come back to that afterwards but the first thing is to understand exactly what he was thinking and what he was doing and the background is eventually so he's a consultant an anst and he just happened to be on call he'll tell you the story as to why he did what he did at that point so I'll just let you listen to it and then you and then we'll take you back through it afterwards listen to what he was thinking before he did the presentation yesterday together declaration posted the video of me talking to Sag jvid sometimes there are questions about what what happened that day and whether it was set up so I thought I'd just give you a bit of background I was told that morning that s jav was coming into the hospital and would visit intensive care where I was the consultant on call that day uh I did think to myself I'll talk to him about the vaccine mandate it was an opportunity that I wasn't going to miss before he came in the film crew was from AP News not from Sky um uh we had a conversation before he came into the unit and I told them that I wasn't vaccinated so I wondered whether that would make them a bit more likely to record all the conversations AP news is a u recorder of information and rather than a broadcaster so when they had the video of the conversation with s Javid they would have then put it up to Tender and one broadcaster would then take it Sky News took it my assumption being that someone was going to run with it and they thought it would be a big story which it turned out to be so um uh if anyone's got any questions about this and wants to really ask me if it was genuine or not it was and um you can ask my colleagues who were fairly pissed off with me for doing it um I'm still in my job Kings hasn't given me a hard time for for doing it um but if you want to talk to me in person September the 1st this Thursday day I'll take it down there because that's an old video at the time so he was going to to meet with other people to discuss some of the points so he was just highlighting what essentially had happened before this interview had occurred so he was prepared he knew the health Minister was coming it was early in January 2022 they had set that the vaccine mandates would kick in at the end of February 2022 what that meant is anyone who was not vaccinated um in the clinical environment would no longer be able to work and so there was a whole system that was set up across the world people would have seen similar things and there was tremendous pressure on the staff to therefore become vaccinated at that point so when you see someone then stand in that Gap and make statements like that it really sticks with people because he made a stand the point I'm making is that your voice matters even though you may not necessarily think your voice matters it does my voice matters sometimes I forget that maybe somebody is listening to what I say I don't know but that that he did was inspiring for many people across the country and believe it or not he changed the trajectory of what happened in the NHS around vaccine mandates so to understand exactly what he did so remember the background he's um working in this hospital he knows that the health Minister sa Javid is coming along they are talking about health related stuff he sees this as an opportunity he has prepared the cameraman that he's likely to challenge the health secretary on vaccine mandates and and then he waits for the opportunity look and see what happens in real time do you think of the the new rule to require vaccination or NHS sta I'm not happy about that so you're not happy about so I've had Co at some point yeah uh I've got antibodies yeah um I've been working on Co IU since the beginning I have not had a vaccination I did not want to have a vaccination um uh the vaccinees reducing transmission only for about 8 weeks for Delta with Omicron is probably less and for that I would be dismissed if I don't have a vaccine it's not the science isn't strong enough that's your view and and your views do you have any view on that I respect that but there's a there's also manye other views but yeah and there's another colleague who who still in the same position yeah yeah no I understand that and obviously we have to weigh all that up for both Health and Social care and there will always be a debate about it but it's maybe there's an opportunity to reconsider with Omicron and the changing picture or at least the Nuance it and allow doctors who've had antibody exposure who've got antibodies who haven't had the vaccination to not have it because the protection I've got from transmission is probably equivalent to someone who's vaccinated yeah but at some point that will way as well but if you want to provide protection with a booster you'd have to inject everybody every month if it's worn off by 2 months yeah if it's if the protections worn off a transmission after 2 months yeah then after a month you've still got a bit of protection yeah so if you want to maintain protection you're going to need to boost all staff members every single month which you're not going to do we we take advice on on when how much you may not going to achieve a practic benefit yeah well we take the very best advice that we can from from the people that are vaccine experts so that was the situation and when I say that he was ready he was ready he knew what he wanted to say he knew he had a short window to get it in and he hammered it in and it's not without risk because his job was at risk and he then started to get criticism from outside that so this is where um say for instance right after this you have the BBC factchecking what he said because they realized that there was quite a significant social media response to this so this was the 10th of January 2022 so it was not long after he had done this Challenge and so this is here Dr Steve James and this is the health Minister here this is some of the staff in the background in that Intensive Care Unit and so they challenged what he was saying um they highlighted the fact that um he was saying that the unvaccinated person could still be just as protected they said that was wrong and it's fascinating how history works you know because at that time it was clear that there was a problem with Omicron whatever was happening with Delta before that and the vaccine was was based on the Wuhan variant there was some benefit against Delta but when Omicron came it was very clear early on that there was a significant percentage of breakthrough infection even within a short period of time and so he was bringing that up and saying well actually now that we have Omicron this is a significant transition in the pandemic does do it still apply and he raised that question that was very very uncomfortable so at that point they still were pushing back and you can see here in the BBC article they were saying that one people found those who were vaccinated with fiser were 85% less likely than the unvaccinated to be infected with covid after two weeks two weeks can you believe it um and so they were using this to say no absolutely people had to get vaccinated but as I said it it was very clear at that point that the vaccine couldn't control Omicron and we're seeing this more and more as as the variants come through that it is getting more and more difficult even with the updated vaccines to control the spread of Omicron now some people will argue that we're not seeing any impact but you have to remember that the vaccines have impacted on the severity of covid-19 so the very severe presentations where people U patients come in with severe lung disease end up on itu I think that there is strong evidence that the vaccine has impacted on that but here is my provisor I am not actually sure that it has necessarily reduced all cause mortality because excess deaths are up so we do need to clarify so at that point there was some argument but to mandate it against almost 10% of their working population would have lost their jobs if they had continued to push through with that now at that point he was one person standing up to the health secretary so what happened after that was quite remarkable because subsequent to that by the time we have now reached the 1st of March when this was supposed to kick kick in the regulations making Co 19 vaccination a condition of deployment to end was removed so effectively from the 15th of March 2022 they said actually no we're not going to do that and one of the interesting things because I then looked back and tried to think to myself did it actually have an impact through that discussion to the health secretary did it actually impact him or was it something else but again and you'll find this in the description this was the statement from the then Health Secretary of State uh sa Javid and he recognized that they had approved legislation um requiring vaccination a as a condition of deployment but on the 31st of January I announced the government intended to revoke the regulations making vaccination a condition of deployment in all Health and Social care settings subject to consult and parliamentary process he actually pushed through the reversal of that mandate now listen this is this is very important you have two sides of the puzzle here you have one side where somebody has taken a stand pushed back against the mandates or pushed back against something that they thought was wrong on the other side you had a politician or you could say a leader who was driving through a change but when they were challenged they stopped they thought about it they reflected on what was said they took more advice and realized that actually this is not in the best interest of the public because you'd lose 10% of your working uh NHS staff this is not in the interest of the individuals and he probably realized that the the consultant was correct the science didn't match up politicians who changed their Direction based on a better understanding of science even if it makes them look um less effective are the kinds of politicians that we need and I think that what he did there as the health secretary to make that turn that transition from where he was after that conversation show shows the incredible characteristics of a leader who actually is willing to listen to people so on both counts there are actually two Heroes one was the doctor who stood up the other one surprisingly was the politician who listened and then changed the direction of the mandates history will show that that was the correct thing to do because as we Now understand they were thinking at the time that hybrid immunity was more effective how could hybrid immunity be more effective than a natural infection how could that consultant who was in intensive care seeing covid patients for two years suddenly now at that point need to have something to make his immunity better anyone who says that doesn't understand science I will say this absolutely clearly natural immunity is always superior to any form of vaccine mediated immunity it doesn't mean that vaccine mediated immunity is not actually good what it means is that it can't be compared if somebody just had measles you don't go and vaccinate that if somebody had chickenpox you don't go and vaccinate them because you recognize that the immune system actually has a very sophisticated comprehensive response to an infection and just as with clotting too little and too much are diseases it's the same with immunity too little immunity you get many infections too much immunity you get damage and so therefore there is no such thing as being able to optimize the natural immune response unless somebody has uh poor immune response in the first place that's where but it's really important from the scientific point of view to remember these points I wonder what people are going to say to their grandchildren 30 to 40 years from now when they asked them what were you thinking when you said or did these things where was the science had you forgotten what you learned what was it that made you step into ideology that's effectively what has happened throughout the pandemic too much ideology not enough science that's the mistake that was made science just asks questions it's not attached to political views it's just observant and it follows outcomes that's the lesson that we must take from this situation let us never get in a position again where we are not following science let's ask the hard questions even when they're inconvenience I even when they challenge what we have done even when it may be that we could be wrong that's okay science is always happy when things are wrong because it gets to the truth so my thank you to Dr Steve James a covid hero who made his voice matter stood up made a trajectory for the health system in the UK just by raising his voice remember this everyone your voice as well matters make sure that you use it as best as you can have a great [Music] evening [Music]

466,8dGMmhny5EM,#DoNotSqueezeMyArm: Doctor Sounds Alarm on How to Properly Inject COVID-19 Vaccine,A doctor is sounding the alarm about how to properly administer COVID-19 vaccine injections so they are effective and truly protect against the coronavirus.,2021-01-03,182553,1027,347,UCBgcPSn61UQ4l_-FvcEgLQA, thousands of americans have already received their first dose of a coveted vaccine but tonight one doctor is sounding the alarm concerned that not everyone is receiving the vaccine correctly nbc 6 reporter ari osner gives us a look at the right way of administering the vaccine ari alina we're talking about an inch which could literally make the difference between getting vaccinated for real and getting a worthless shot so as we know the medical community has been ecstatic that science has delivered these vaccines which can end the pandemic if enough people are indeed vaccinated where we are here at holiday park they're taking a step in that direction converting this covet testing site into a vaccination site but we spoke to a doctor today who said he's literally been noticing too many injections missing the mark we've all seen video like this over the past three weeks people receiving the pandemic altering vaccine into their upper arms you can see the outline of the deltoid this is a very big muscle so let's start off with the fact that this is a very hard muscle that to miss and that's where the covid19 vaccine goes straight into the deltoid muscle if it's done correctly but dr tom pitts says he's noticed too many pictures like this in which the skin is being pinched which could lead to the vaccine being injected into the fat under the skin instead of into the muscle where it needs to go the hard part was getting the vaccine you know the hard part shouldn't be injecting it into the muscle so dr pitts has been sounding the alarm on social media and physicians groups circulating diagrams like this one and reminding health care professionals with the hashtag do not squeeze my arm inject the vaccine the correct way he says directly into the muscle i'm so excited we have it and i would just really hate to see not only people not get vaccinated but then to also give them the false sense of security that they were vaccinated that's almost worse right with millions of doses being distributed around the planet if even a small percentage are given incorrectly dr pitts says those numbers add up quickly if i point it pull it all the way out here i mean that's almost an inch in itself to get to where i started you put that that same situation in multiple hospitals across the world you have a catastrophe and i thought this is entirely avoidable and reversible so let's go ahead and jump on it early and see what i can do to help and dr pitts tells us that since he started this effort in physicians chat groups and forums like that on social media he's received overwhelmingly positive feedback as the word gets out to health care professionals keep giving the shots just do it right where it counts we're live in fort lauderdale aria odds are nbc 6 news

469,tGs0ucefm38,Mini Episode 2: mRNA COVID 19 Vaccine In Pregnancy,"Many pregnant people are hesitant to get vaccinated against COVID-19 despite worse clinical outcomes (hospitalization and death) if they do fall sick. Here, I review three of many peer reviewed articles clearly showing the safety of mRNA COVID vaccines in 10,000 to 100,000+ pregnant people and infants from four different countries. 

The CDC and professional medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and several more recommend COVID-19 vaccination at any point in pregnancy. Despite this there is hesitancy that can be deadly for both mother and child. 

I invite you to read more on this topic yourself and I have also provided a list of peer reviewed articles in my free Substack article ""mRNA COVID-19 Vaccinations During Pregnancy: Deadly Hesitancy Remains""",2024-02-19,1479,39,42,UCkorbMKMvRbyyMmwD4DIzAg," hi welcome to from bench to bedside I'm Dr Melanie Matthew the host and known as laughter and light on social media and I am really excited to share with you today three different papers done in four different countries about what happens if you are pregnant and you get the SARS CO2 vaccine so we're going to review that literature right now if you're following Along on YouTube I will put the titles and the Articles and the figures up so that you can see them as I'm talking about them and um if you are following along and you're watching me I'm going to be looking over here at my second screen if you're just listening to the podcast um please enjoy and then take a look at the uh media recording so that you can follow along with the papers and or look up the papers yourself and give them a read okay so this is going to go all the way back to 2022 and then all the way forward let me double check the dates on this to um a paper published February 6th of 2024 and we're going to cover three articles okay because I think three is a a decent enough number to get an idea and a handle on what's Happening um and you know if you guys have any questions about other articles please go ahead and drop those in the comments on my YouTube channel it's an lore science all right so let's get started um these are the titles of the papers I'm going to put them on screen and I'll read them out to you the first one we're going to go over is from 2021 oh I'm sorry 2022 and it is evaluation of acute Adverse Events after covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy the next one we're going to go over was published October 23rd 2023 newborn and early infant outcomes following maternal covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy and then the third one we're going to go over is neonatal outcomes after covid-19 vaccination in pregnancy published February 6 2024 so let's start with the first one published in 2022 so um it is known that this time um going back in history that people who are pregnant with symptomatic Corona virus disease as they said here covid-19 have a higher risk of adverse outcomes of women who are not pregnant so being pregnant increases the risk factors so they wanted to know hey is this going to be problematic how can we stop this for people so what they did in this correspondence to the new New England Journal of Medicine was they did a retrospective observational matched cohort study involving pregnant women um the ages of 16 to 49 years old and they looked at um vaccination from December 15th 2020 through July 1st 2021 in this study they identified 45232 pregnant women who had received one or two doses of a covid-19 vaccine immediately proceeding or during pregnancy the vast majority had received two doses of the MRNA vaccine that's 72.5% and here is a table showing who got which vaccine and it does break them down um by age and by race the frequency of all medically attended events was less than 1% so here on this table you will see that there are several different potential events that are tra act and it's covid vaccine during pregnancy versus no covid vaccine during pregnancy a number of events per 10,000 people now if you look over on the right you will see something called the adjusted rate ratio all right and if that line touches the number one it is going to be non-statistically significant that's something to remember so if it goes over the number one if it's going over to the left in this particular version of the graph lower risk with vaccination is shown it's going over to the right higher risk with vaccination all right so in the first 1 to 7even days after vaccination they showed that more women had fever Mala or fatigue and um a local potential allergic reaction um usually it's monitored as pain or swelling in the area so normal responses to the VAC were seen um 1 to 21 days after vaccination they had more lymph node swelling other than that nothing was statistically significant in these groups of women the women that were vaccinated did not have higher rates of acute myocardial infection no higher rates of heart attack they did not have a higher rate of Bell's paly they did not have a higher rate of stroke and they did not have a higher rate of pulmonary embolism seizure Venus um thrombo embolism and indeed the authors go on to say that covid-19 vaccines are not associated with an increased risk of clinically serious acute Adverse Events that were evaluated in that list that we just looked at together so the present data um adds to the growing literature for the authors supporting the safety of covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy now we've got two more papers so let's get to it all right so the next one moving forward in time was published in jamama Pediatrics October 23rd 2023 newborn in early infant outcomes following maternal covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy so the question the authors wanted to answer here was is maternal covid-19 vaccination with mRNA um during pregnancy associated with adverse newborn and early infant outcomes okay so now this is focusing on the newborns and early infant outcomes and let's go over the finding summary so in this population-based cohort study of 42,6 live births in Ontario Canada covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy was associated with lower risks of severe neonatal morbidity and neonatal death and neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission they found no increase in neonatal re admission or Hospital admissions up to age 6 months compared to those who did not receive the SARS K2 vaccine before delivery they go on to state that maternal mRNA covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with an increase in verse events and early infant outcomes and may be protective against adverse newborn outcomes all right so really quick let's take a look at the summary of the cohort selection so the they started with 182,780 live births several groups were excluded and they ended up focusing on 14206 live births um 85,681 were not vaccinated now there are a lot of figures and tables in this paper but I'm going to hop over to Table Three and you can I encourage you to look at the other figures in this paper as well it's going to be linked Down Below in YouTube and you can find it in recently covered research in my link tree all right so we're going to hop over to Table Three association between covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy and neonatal and infant outcomes all right so they have the outcomes listed over here on the left um including severe neonatal morbidity neonatal death neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission Etc they have the total number in and percent in the vaccine exposed versus unexposed and then they look over here on the right risk ratio or Hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval and they have the crude and they have the adjusted now remember from the last paper we went over if it touches the number one or it it straddles the number one then it is no longer statistically significant by this measure so if you look at these numbers you can see that severe neonatal morbidity death Intensive Care Unit admission are all lower in the vaccine exposed groups of of children where their mothers were vaccinated and then you can see that neonatal readmission and hospital admission up to 6 months of age there was no statistical difference so here is the author's summary in the conclusions um they state that our study substantially expands on existing evidence of the safety of maternal mRNA vaccin ination during pregnancy for newborns and young infants covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy was associated with lower RIS of SNM neonatal death and nicku admission and no increases in neonatal and six-month readmissions all right we're two-thirds of the way through let's get up to present day with the paper that was just published February 6 of 2024 in jamama Journal of American Medical Association all right this stud took place in two different countries Sweden and Norway so the questions the authors asked was does mRNA covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy increased the risk of Adverse Events in newborn infants and then they go on to State their findings let's go through them in this populationbased cohort study from Sweden and Norway that includes 9433 infants exposed to covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy and 10 12,167 control infants born between June 2021 and January 2023 vaccination during pregnancy was associated with lower odds of neonatal intracranial hemorrhage cerebral es schea and hypoxic esic incopy and neonatal mortality the interpreted meaning of this study is that in this large populationbased study vacc of pregnant individuals with mRNA covid-19 vaccines was not associated with increased risk of neonatal Adverse Events all right here is figure one showing how they selected their cohorts and who was excluded from the group and who was included in the group here in figure two we're looking at time to death of liveborn infants exposed or unexposed to the covid-19 MRNA vaccine and this graph clearly shows that no vaccination has a fast fter rate of death in times per day and that more children did die after they were born if they had not prior had the vaccine just like the other two papers we looked at there is a lot of data in this paper but I'm going to direct you to table two this is association between covid-19 vaccination and pregnancy and neonatal outcomes now if you look at the AO the adjusted odds ratio about four columns from the left over you will see that those numbers straddle the number one for the most part there is no increased statistical significance in um between people who had the vaccine and are pregnant and people who haven't had the vaccine and are pregnant in adverse outcomes and in fact a few of them show statistical significance in being protective of the infant if the pregnant mother had the vaccine and so especially if you scroll all the way to the bottom neonatal mortality is significantly reduced in this case now the authors do say that they are not going to make any claim that the vaccine is protective against these things even though there is statistical significance shown but they do make the final claim that this is a large population-based study and it does show the vaccination of pregnant individuals with mRNA covid-19 vaccines was not associated with increased risk of neonatal Adverse Events in their infants all right so let's let's put this all together so pregnant people when they get SARS kobe2 are at a higher risk of having Adverse Events because it's putting extra strain on already strained physiology um pregnancy is already a risky adventure and so when you add a severe viral infection on top of that not great things can happen also SARS kov 2 is associated with a higher rate ofe preclampsia still birth pre-term birth and NICU admission so it's not good for baby either and you know these are just three papers that I happen to choose but and I know that there are more out there but I hope that it helps people rest assured that SARS Koby 2 mRNA vaccination is actually protective if you are pregnant and may um help you have a better pregnancy and could potentially save your baby's life all right I hope that all helps and again the references are linked below I will see you guys later take care"

possibly not his birth name but it was on his passport i've learned quite a bit about him in the last few weeks they lived a life in full and were survivors in the music business which isn't easy zeon wasn't justin bieber but he didn't want to be justin bieber and the band got noticed by various panjandrums from karang magazine to radio 2 vicky played bass and they had a following around various parts of europe take a look at this fabulous album cover yeah look at that we won't that's uh that's vicky uh standing what is that second from right uh we won't hurt you but we won't go away that's the strap on the cover and then one day zeon went off to get the covered shot like everyone from the queen down told him to do and he got sick and his condition worsened and vicki found herself widowed in her thirties they did hurt him and then they went away vicky couldn't get anyone from the british state to acknowledge her existence and on the rare occasion that anyone did such as that chap we talked about last week the colossus of scottish politics glasgow msp john mason it was to laugh at her and sneer at her grief well vicky is back with us and she has some news great to see you vicky and uh you you have uh some a genuine bit of bad news after getting the cold shoulder from the government for over a year now i yeah i have some news finally before i do that i just want to tell you zeon was his birth name whoa whoa i i i apologize i i i'd assume i assumed he was christened earnest or wilfred or something and change it to something cooler but i uh i'm very glad to hear that so the passport was right in every particular i've i've learned a lot about him from from you and from his website which is still up there in the last uh few weeks he had a great life and it should have continued for another uh 40 50 years uh but you should have had another half century together but you didn't and then the government stonewalled you and now they've ceased stonewalling they have on friday afternoon i got a phone call to notify me that i am the first person whose claim with bdps has been processed and approved and so yeah over a year later from when i put in the claim it you know with the death certificate and it's finally been approved and they assured me that this would now speed up other um claims in the processing which is very good news because a lot of people are really struggling you know there are people who are at risk of losing their houses if they don't get some help soon well as we've said there's over half there's over 2000 deaths and over half a million adverse effects on that yellow card website and you are the first person to who will receive government compensation uh among the bereaved and injured by the the vaccines and now now they're telling you that now they've processed you as number one on the list they're going to be able to process everyone else why do you think this has happened out of the blue so suddenly possibly because the squeaky wheel gets the oil um and with the health of gb news we've been getting a lot more attention and um i do think that the vdp has begun and thank god she's going to leave us alone now and sadly for them they have just confirmed that we have won the first battle they have acknowledged causation and it just adds legitimacy as you know we've been mocked and ignored and told that we're making stuff up and that there's no such thing as vaccine damage for the last year and a bit and now this confirms there is causation and we can continue to fight on the amount they are giving out is 120 000 pounds which sounds like a lot of money but when you consider i'm going to have to pay a lot of it back to family and loans for uh funeral expenses and just getting part through the last year it's you know not very much money at all and when there are people who have ongoing medical expenses for the rest of their life is nothing um compared to what we could get if we could litigate against astrazeneca is absolutely appalling and seeing as they haven't increased the amount since 2007 in in rate of inflation it will leave us no choice but to continue attempting to litigate against sacramento or the government whichever whichever works so we've gone up with inflation we'll be looking at about 180 000 pounds which is still it doesn't bring anyone back but it's a you know it's a fairer amount well as you say 120 000 pounds sounds a lot of money if you get it in a check and you deposit it on a thursday afternoon in your bank but when you figure out the expenses you've got how long that check has got to last it's you know this is one of those things if you brought a lawsuit in the united states it'd be 30 million or whatever and and it would be a very different thing there are there are lots of people vaccine injured people who can't work uh can't drive a car and they're having to sell their homes to pay medical bills do you think the government is serious about expediting these funds i think they are hoping that it will pacify us um which it won we're not gonna stop until we've got fair recognition and fair justice for all of the bereaved and injured we at viv uk we're excited that we've we've got this far we really are but we have no intention of stopping until we believe we have fair recognition and fair compensation for what we've been made to suffer well i can't think of anyone who deserves it more than you to be number one on this list not necessarily because of your particular bereavement or because of the other people's injuries or whatever but because the the way we know each other is i did something on this a few weeks ago and i think you retweeted it and uh and and suggested that you had more to say on this and you've been absolutely terrific on this as you said the squeaky wheel gets the oil and you have been as squeaky as anybody vicki and we congratulate you on this and i hope uh the government of the united kingdom which can get money to ukraine in nothing flat will actually get money to you in nothing flat and to all the others uh you're welcome on this show any time uh we're gonna bring you down uh to london in uh i think a week or two or whatever so we can have a big in-depth uh discussion about this but we congratulate you it's way overdue it's an in it's an insignificant amount of money compared to what the government did to you and made zeon uh take uh which you shouldn't have had to take and um you have terrific memories they were cut off too soon this this is real folks uh vicky and zeon had a lifelong love and basically a stupid shot he had no need to take cut that off uh half a century before it should have been cut off i i congratulate you vicky and uh and uh i'll i'll i'll see you next time on our show you're you're a great credit to this cause it is a great cause and that boob of a scottish parliamentarian should be ashamed of himself for denigrating your grief thank you so much

475,yd5tV-SoCeo,"Myocarditis, COVID and Covid Vaccines - Pfizer &amp; Moderna Vaccines","Myocarditis, COVID and Covid Vaccines - Pfizer & Moderna Vaccines

Myocarditis is heart inflammation, but to be more specific, it’s inflammation of the heart muscle. Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium (outer lining of the heart). Myocarditis and pericarditis often occur together, hence the term myopericarditis. 
How often is it caused by COVID? 
How often is it caused by the mRNA vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna? 
What are the symptoms of heart inflammation? 
How is it diagnosed? 
I’m going to unpack all of it in this video.

Myocarditis is an interesting diagnosis because it can present in a variety of ways. Not just in terms of various signs and symptoms, but a variety of non-specific labs in the bloodwork. Non-specific EKG findings. Non-specific echocardiogram findings, meaning ultrasound of the heart. Also, most people with this diagnosis have zero or mild symptoms. On the flip side, it can RARELY present with sudden cardiac arrest. And even if you can make the diagnosis, it’s usually even TRICKIER to determine the cause. 

Disease severity can range from unnoticeable to mild symptoms, severe illness requiring the ICU to death. More often than not, it’s a mild, temporary issue. When there is more heart inflammation, the heart has a harder time pumping blood, leading to heart failure in more serious cases.

What are the Symptoms? 
The highest risk population for myocarditis is from puberty to the early 30s. It affects males more often than females. 
There are no specific symptoms associated with myocarditis, but common symptoms include: 
• Chest pain or pressure
• Shortness of breath
• Fatigue
• Swelling in the hands and feet
• Heart palpitations  
• Lightheadedness
• A sudden loss of consciousness 

How does COVID affect the heart?
Even though COVID is a respiratory virus, it can affect the heart in several ways. First, when COVID causes pneumonia, it can damage the lungs, decreasing the amount of oxygen that gets to the heart and making it harder to pump blood to the body. This is known as demand ischemia. 

Second, the inflammatory response from the immune system to fight the virus is sometimes excessive. The cytokine storm that you hear about, it’s a cascade of cytokines and chemokines of the immune system that can ultimately damage organs in the body. Basically, it's collateral damage. The damage from this inflammatory response is known to especially affect the kidneys, brain, and heart. And that’s when you have myocarditis.

What is the risk of COVID in Children?
As of June 10th,  4,008,572 children have contracted COVID. This number represents 14% of all cases and is about 5,300 cases per 100,000 children. About 17,000 children have been hospitalized, and 330 have died. COVID has been in the top 10 causes of pediatric death since the pandemic began. As a comparison, 188 children died of influenza in the 2019-2020 season. The CDC reported that as of June 9th, 2,637 people under age 30 have died of COVID. 

What is the risk of myocarditis from the COVID vaccine? 
The COVID vaccines that are mRNA (Pfizer and Moderna) have caused some cases of myocarditis (heart inflammation). There have been cases and minimal studies looking at patients who developed myocarditis after getting the covid vaccine. The CDC has received 1,226 preliminary reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following about 300 million total doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. 

These preliminary reports came through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System maintained by the CDC and the FDA. Among people 12 and older, there were 267 reports of heart inflammation after one dose of vaccine, 827 after the second dose, and 132 after an unknown dose. The CDC continues to recommend COVID vaccination for everyone 12 years of age and older. Why? There may be tens of myocarditis cases for every million second-dose vaccinations with either Moderna or Pfizer, but thousands of Covid cases are prevented.

In males aged 12 to 17, it’s estimated that for every 1 million second-dose vaccinations, 5,700 Covid cases, 215 hospitalizations, 71 intensive care unit admissions, and two deaths would be prevented, with an estimated 56 to 69 myocarditis cases. For females aged 12 to 17, it's estimated that every 1 million doses to complete a two-dose series of vaccines, 8,500 Covid cases, 183 hospitalizations, 38 intensive care unit admissions, and one death would be prevented estimated 8 to 10 cases of myocarditis.

#covid #myocarditis #vaccine",2021-06-25,794880,18882,3410,UCMSsLqxqvZsNXi0Z-VjN89A," myocarditis is heart inflammation or to be more 
specific it's inflammation of the heart muscle   pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium 
or the outer lining of the heart myocarditis and   pericarditis often occur together hence the term 
myopericarditis how often is it caused by covid   how often is it caused by the mrna vaccines 
pfizer and moderna and what are the symptoms   of heart inflammation how is it diagnosed i'm 
going to unpack all this in this video and if   you're new here i'm dr mike hansen welcome to my 
channel where i love to break down medical topics   and provide you with real medical explanations 
this is my dog legend he likes balls myocarditis is an interesting diagnosis 
because it can present in a variety of ways   not just in terms of various signs and 
symptoms but a variety of non-specific   labs in the blood work non-specific ekg findings 
non-specific echocardiogram findings meaning   ultrasound of the heart also most people with 
this diagnosis have zero or mild symptoms   now on the flip side it can rarely 
present with sudden cardiac arrest   and even if you are able to make the diagnosis 
it's usually even trickier to determine the cause there are lots of different things that can cause 
myocarditis heck even heavy metal can cause it you might also notice there that smallpox vaccine 
can cause it well i should say could cause it   because routine vaccination of the american public 
against smallpox stopped in 1972 after the disease   was eradicated but the most common cause of 
myocarditis is a result of the immune system   reacting to a viral infection common viral 
triggers include adenovirus coxsackievirus   influenza parbovirus b19 and herpes and of 
course you can add covid to that list as well as   the pfizer and moderna vaccines but before we 
get into the details of cases of myocarditis   after the vaccine let's get a baseline 
understanding of the seriousness of myocarditis disease severity can range from unnoticeable to 
mild symptoms to severe illness requiring icu to   death more often than not it's a mild temporary 
issue in more serious cases when there's more   heart inflammation the heart has a harder time 
pumping blood which can lead to heart failure   the highest risk population for myocarditis 
is from puberty to the age of the 30s   so it affects males more often than females there 
are no specific symptoms that are associated with   myocarditis but the common symptoms include chest 
pain or chest pressure shortness of breath fatigue   swelling in the hands and feet heart 
palpitations lightheadedness and a   sudden loss of consciousness in the early 
stages of viral myocarditis patients will   usually initially have fever in muscle aches 
now if there's pericarditis to go along with   that myocarditis the most common symptom is going 
to be chest pain and that's usually a sharp or   stabbing pain but some have a dull achy 
or pressure-like chest pain a diagnostic   clue with pericarditis is that the chest pain is 
worse when lying flat and better when sitting up making the diagnosis of myocarditis depends 
on signs and symptoms lab tests including   troponin levels and bnp certain ekg findings and 
echocardiogram findings usually a chest x-ray will   be normal but can sometimes show an enlarged heart 
coronary angiography meaning a heart cath or heart   catheterization is sometimes necessary to rule out 
coronary artery disease as a potential diagnosis   cardiac mri is indicated in patients with 
suspected myocarditis with elevated troponin   levels or if they have ventricular dysfunction 
especially if they don't have a clear cause such   as ischemic heart disease meaning coronary artery 
disease some might ultimately require a biopsy of   their heart called an endomyocardial biopsy but 
that's usually reserved for those who are very ill even though covid is a respiratory virus 
it can affect the heart in several ways   first when covid causes pneumonia it can 
damage the lungs decreasing the amount of   oxygen that gets to the heart and making 
it harder for it to pump blood to the body   this is known as demand ischemia second the 
inflammatory response from the immune system   to fight that virus is sometimes excessive the 
cytokine storm that you hear about it's a cascade   of cytokines and chemokines of the immune system 
and that can ultimately damage organs in the body   basically it's collateral damage so the 
damage from this inflammatory response   is known to especially affect the kidneys brain 
and the heart and that's when you have myocarditis   and as if that's not bad enough inflammation 
can cause small blood clots or micro thrombi   to form in different blood vessels throughout the 
body including in the capillaries of the heart   more than four thousand children have suffered 
from multi-system inflammatory syndrome in   children so mis-c which can cause inflammation of 
the heart the lungs the kidneys and the brain as   well as other organs finally sars cov2 can also 
infect the heart muscle cells themselves a study   from washington university school of medicine 
in st louis it showed that the sars cov2 virus   invades the heart muscle cells and interferes 
with contraction researchers there used stem   cells to model the contracting heart muscle tissue 
their research showed that the viral infection it   actually destroys the muscle cells and you're left 
with a heart that doesn't pump blood on a related   note when we talk about covid long haulers one 
of the common symptoms that i see from patients   in my pulmonary clinic is that they have this 
chronic central chest pain or chest pressure   especially when taking in a deep breath my 
suspicion is that there might be a small   degree of persistent myopericarditis going on 
there but that's hard to know one way or another as of june 10th about 4 million children have 
contracted covid this number represents 14 of   all cases and is about 5 300 cases per 100 000 
children about 17 000 children have   been hospitalized and 330 have died covid has 
been in the top 10 causes of pediatric death   since the pandemic began now as a comparison 188 
children died of influenza in the 2019-2020 season   the cdc has also reported that as of june 9 2600 
plus people under the age of 30 have died of covid  there have been cases in very small studies 
looking at patients who developed myocarditis   after getting the covid vaccine the cdc 
has received 1200 plus preliminary reports   of myocarditis and pericarditis following about 
300 million total doses of the pfizer and modern   vaccines these preliminary reports came through 
the vaccine adverse event reporting system that's   maintained by the cdc in the fda among people 
12 and older there were 267 reports of heart   inflammation after one dose of the vaccine 
827 after the second dose and then 132 after   an unknown dose the cdc continues to recommend 
covid 19 vaccination for everyone 12 years of   age and older why that's because for every million 
second dose vaccinations with either the moderna   or the pfizer there have been tens of myocarditis 
cases but thousands of covid 19 cases that are   prevented for males aged 12 to 17 it's estimated 
that for every 1 million second dose vaccinations   there are 5 700 covid cases 215 hospitalizations 
71 icu admissions and 2 deaths that are prevented   with an estimated 56 to 69 myocarditis cases 
for females in that same group age 12 to 17   it's estimated that for every 1 million doses 
to complete a two dose series of that vaccine   you get 8 500 covid cases 183 hospitalizations icu 
admissions and one death that would be prevented   compared to 8 to 10 cases of myocarditis and then 
when you look at the bracket of age 18 to 24 those   numbers look even better since wednesday there's 
been a joint statement from the leaders of more   than a dozen health agencies and organizations 
including the cdc the american academy of   pediatrics the american heart association and more 
and they're all saying that the covid vaccines   are safe ineffective and that they strongly 
encourage everyone 12 and older to be vaccinated   against covid 19 this is their conclusion quote 
the conclusion is that myocarditis is an extremely   rare side effect and only an exceedingly 
small number of people will experience it   after vaccination importantly for the young people 
who do most cases are mild and individuals recover   often on their own or with minimal treatment in 
addition we know that myocarditis and pericarditis   are much more common if you get covid 19 and 
the risks to the heart from covid 19 infection   can be more severe we recommend getting vaccinated 
right away if you haven't yet it's the best way to   protect yourself your loved ones your community 
and to return to a more normal lifestyle safely   and quickly that's all for this video thank you

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla On Covid Vaccine: Extended Interview | NBC Nightly News",2021-02-26,118002,711,675,UCeY0bbntWzzVIaj2z3QigXg, if someone has had two doses of your vaccine do you consider them fully protected against any variant that we're currently aware of for what we know so far we haven't seen any indication that the current vaccinated people with the two doses according to the regular scheme are not protected compared to the south african or the brazilian or the uk variant now we have confirmations that they are protected for the uk variants and we have data that are suggesting that they are protected against the south african and the brazilian virus but as you said we are going to run it's imminent the beginning of a series of studies that will check against all these new strains if the current vaccination is effective if a third those by boosting the car and vaccination will provide the efficacy and if a new version of the vaccine is the solution and we will know when we have this data but so far we believe that against those three we have enough coverage yeah i mean it would be a shame for folks to have waited months and months to get their their vaccine only to find that it's obsolete how much time do you think you have how much time is this virus going to give you to get ahead of any potential variants i think ideally you should be able to have annual revaccinations either with the standard vaccine and that annual revaccination with one single dose will create enough immune responses so to overcome the sense the resistance of all variants or this annual revaccination will be if needed with the variation of the vaccine as we do with flu i think that would be the idea right now it's it's a two-shot uh vaccine you as you said you want to start looking at a potential third shot uh what's propelling you in that direction do you think it'll be more effective last longer we are discussing with a lot of experts and of course we have a lot of experts in our [Music] company and we believe that the third dose at six months of the of the first which is what we are going to try right now will raise the antibody response to 10 to 10 volts what it is right now that will be significant the response to likely overcome all this resistance of what we know so far also i want to emphasize lester that this is a two dose vaccine for the initial initiation of the schedule it's supposed to be an annual single dose revaccination following that so walk me through that again so right now we know of two doses the third would be the same vaccine or a modified one what would it be we will try both we will try the same vaccine and we will try a modified one and right now we believe we likely a third one will provide enough resistance for all of these variants well let me back up a second with with the current two shots have you determined how long the protection lasts now we have only data for six months so far and uh the protection looks very good at this stage with the current two dose with the current if you add a third dose how long would the protection then be again i think it's something that needs to be static i don't think we can uh calculate right now yeah six six months doesn't sound like a lot when you consider people may wait six months uh for these shots is that based on data does do you have a hunch that it might be substantially longer it is uh no no no the six months will be one dose at six months just to create enough immune responses it's not the idea that every six months we will have to get vaccinated although this is something that the studies will prove eventually but we believe that um we have seen data not we believe that the variants they are just reducing the current immune responses so the higher the initial immune response the higher the remaining response immune response will be after the decrease so with that premise then knowing that with a third dose we can increase 10 to 20 volts the current uh immune responses is very very likely that we will see that the two or three folds drop from those new immune responses will do nothing to reduce protection against those variants in addition to looking at a third dose you're also looking at ways that you can quickly adapt your vaccine to future variants how long from the time you discover a new variant could you tweak your current vaccine to make it effective lester our goal it is to be able to do it in less than 100 days less than 100 days therefore would everyone have to go back you know get back in line for a modified vaccine i think and i hope that the best possible scenario right now would look that we will need to have annual revaccinations either with the same just to increase the immune responses levels or with the new variant i don't think that we will have to go to a six months annual every six months vaccinations would you have to go through the full fda review if you decided to add something or change something to make it adapt to a new variant would you have to start from scratch fda and other advanced regulatory agencies like the european uh or the japanese or the canadian et cetera they have already established the regulatory pathway pathway for flu vaccines as you know in flu we have to change uh slightly the vaccine every year to adapt it to new strains i think all regulators are looking right now and they are in active discussions with us to to present a variation of this framework you know listening do you speak it sounds like you're counting on covid to be with us for the long haul is that is that your belief i think we've discussed with a lot of experts right now and the dominant belief among all of the scientific experts and i have heard myself also dr fauzi publicly stating that it is that we all believe that the pandemic will end because of the vaccines but the covet will not go away i think likely will be converted to an endemic situation and to be remained what remains to be seen it is the intensity of it an endemic situation that will be very well controlled with vaccine solutions i'm sure you're aware of this israeli study recently that found after one dose there is substantial immune response from your vaccine and that leads many to wonder if hey can we just give everybody one shot and get more people protected has your data substantiated as well and what what is your thought about maybe just one dose to get folks through yeah we did have data ourselves and they indicated that the first dose provides limited immune protection in our study of 44 000 patients of all ages we had around 50 to 53 protection so to get the 95 96 protection you need to go all the way to the second dose i did see some of the data from the israeli static which are very encouraging i have to say that i believe the data were in much younger population so you expect to have much higher level of protections when the population is younger and then also what it is unknown right now it is what happens to this protection after one or two or three or four months because right now we do not have any data if this 52 for example protection that we detected in our studies is maintained post the third dose post the third week because in the third week already we are using the second dose which brings the 50 to 295. so there are a lot of unknowns and right now all regulatory agencies including us we recommend that we need to stick the current registered schedule of two doses so it's it's too much of a risk right now to try and rely on one devs it's very high risk i think no data about it obviously uh post phase three you've continued to collect data what have you learned about your vaccine is it more effective than we're originally told does it have weaknesses that have been exposed what have you found out a lot of things and we are keep analyzing it and i believe israel is has become the world's lab right now because they are using only our vaccine at the states and they have vaccinated very big part of their population so we can study both economic and health indexes what we've seen it is that the vaccine efficacy in real world data is getting higher as we speak following the second vaccination so seven days compared to 14 days past the second vaccination there is a difference in efficacy and that the africa supports the second dose is meeting or exceeding what we have observed in our clinical studies so it's a profound demonstration of the benefits that this vaccination can bring and doctor people get these vaccinations with obviously the hope that they won't die from this disease and they won't get horribly sick but they also want a sense of freedom and and right now we're being told you got to still wear the mask because of the possibility you could still infect others what do the data show you uh is it likely that you could still infect others even after two doses again it's something that needs to be confirmed and the real world data that you are getting from israel and other studies will help us understand this better i think it is uh i'm almost certain but the data needs to to provide that there will be a high degree of protection against transmission as well but this remains to be seen and also the degree the percentage i'm not sure is that going to be all the way to 95 as we have with the prevention from disease um in terms of prevention of infection but there are a lot of indications right now that are telling us that there is a protection against transmission of the disease how far away do you think we are from knowing for certain what the risk of retransmission is i think with clinical studies like you will be able to to prove that in a few months i think with real world data particularly in israel given that they are moving very very fast in vaccinating their entire population likely would be able to syndications in one or two months what's considered one of the drawbacks of the pfizer vaccine is the requirement that it be kept at these really super cold temperatures we know you went back to the drawing board and now hold the position that that's not necessary will you get permission from the fda to store it at a more normal temperature it's after fda to give us the permission i feel optimistic that they will based on our discussions and right now we have applied so that we have new data that we submitted to them that you can take it out from the ultra cold temperature and keep it into normal freezers at minus 20 degrees celsius for example for two weeks and then in addition one week you can keep it in a normal refrigeration of two to 8 degrees and we continue exploring further studies and data so that we can expand that even further if possible that will provide significant flexibility for people and i'm optimistic that fda will agree with us very soon i would think that's going to have a very big impact on getting more shots in arms that you won't have that requirement what what stood out what in the science suddenly told you that after all this investment in these high-tech refrigerators you don't have to do that anymore first of all let me say i think that uh we have developed a system that was that worked in the u.s 99.9 percent uh at the cases and reliable in terms of the ultra cold saying so i think ultra cold saying did not present any barriers right now with our vaccine and however you can always imagine that being able to keep it two or four weeks in the freezer of normal temperatures this is a great flexibility what happened is that we generated the data we had to go very quickly with the vaccine and we only had data in mind with 70 degrees we are progressing with our processes and we are generating many more data and once we generate this data we are submitting to authorities this is not something uncommon with drug development although in this time in this case is happening very very fast let me ask you the status of the vaccine for kids where are you in the testing and the trials and how soon might we see vaccinations for younger children now thank you for the question we have already licensed in the kids 16 and above we are already doing trials for kids between 11 12 years old all the way to 16. and i hope that we will be able to have data in couple of months about this population and they will submit them to fda so you can get clearance we are also planning to initiate pediatric studies from younger ages from 5 all the way to 11 and i believe that we should have data about this population by the end of the year any idea well obviously it would have to get regulatory approval but any idea how long before you could actually begin administering vaccines to that group i think as soon as we get up regulatory approvals i believe that if the data support the fda will give pretty soon the approval and the other authorities between 11 12 and 16 and again if the data support when we have data from five years old all the way to 11 again they will move very fast to give the the approval and once they give approval we will be ready to vaccinate are you optimistic think so i think so all right what can you tell us about the vaccines and pregnant women anything you've learned and where you are on that and you know it's uh right now as i said we started studies with pregnant women and we will wait to see the end results uh from real world data that we see right now and there are several of pregnant women that are choosing to get vaccinated together with of course the consent of their physician and we have not seen any issues right now what have you seen in terms of reactions negative reactions uh serious side effects from the vaccine in real world experience we've seen some reactogenicity we have seen some anaphylactic responses they are limited mainly to people that they had a history of allergic reactions before and they can let's say be taking care with the normal treatment of anaphylactic reactions this is why when you get the vaccine you need to stay 15 minutes typically within the vaccination center so to make sure that you have physicians coverage before you leave if there is any reaction typically is coming within the first five to ten minutes lots of stories circulating no doubt you have heard them of people who have taken the second dose and and have kind of a serious bout of illness for 24 hours or so is that something that was expected is something that concerns you it doesn't concern at all and it was expected we saw it in our uh clinical trial and we submitted those data to fda and all the real world data right now just replicating the same numbers all right i want to ask you now about about shipments and how much uh vaccine you can produce i think you're shipping about five million doses uh a week here in the united states you've said you can up that how much more can you crank up your production to the united states i believe that um in a couple of weeks we will be able to reach 11 and then immediately after 13. so within a month i think we will be able to release 13 million doses per week that's almost a triple than what we are doing right now which is 4.6 million doses so i think will not be an issue in a few weeks the availability of the vaccine i know you don't control all of the distribution pipeline but you certainly see how it's working and in many cases how it's not working what have you observed that we can be doing better to get this vaccine to people who need it i think that it's normal when you embark into a logistical marathon like that to vaccinate very quickly the citizens of a country you can always will make mistakes i believe that the biden administration released a very comprehensive plan of how they plan to enhance the vaccination rates really comprehensive i ask our scientists to go through it line by line and see if they have any suggestions that i can suggest to the administration to do more and they couldn't really so they are i think they're doing very very good job and i think pretty soon the whole thing will reach a very different level of efficiency there were some issues between the states and the central [Music] control collaboration that now they are addressed there were some issues with creating more vaccination centers that now they are addressed mobile vaccination centers so that they can go to neighborhoods that they don't have close enough and now they are a dresser a lot of things are happening that i think will resolve this have you been disappointed though at the the pace of vaccinations as you as everyone we would like to see things happening quicker but i wouldn't say i'm disappointed i thought that it was going to be very difficult and i think people are trying to do their best right now and pretty soon i think they will have it under control doctor if you could just address for us vaccine hesitancy not only in the general public but health care workers who are refusing or declining to to be vaccinated how would you address them lester always we had some vaccine skeptic population but of course was a much smaller percentage than what we see now and a big part of the problem now with covet 19 was that one this was severely politicized and it became a political statement to believe in vaccines and to believe in mosques or not based on your political affiliation which was of course completely wrong and in addition to to that you have a situation that the development happened so fast that provided the fuel of doubts to those that they were prone to to to be skeptical i think they are wrong what i can tell them it is that they need to think it uh again it's not a decision that will affect only their lives because at the end of the day that's their call if you don't vaccinate yourself you are becoming the weak link that will affect the whole society and unfortunately the ones that are more likely to pay the price are the ones that you love because they are the ones that they are close to you and you interact with them so i would urge to all of them irrelevant where they were and what they do think it wise and believe in science doctor we have just a few minutes left so i want to circle back if i can to this idea of a third dose what is your expectation is your expectation that uh this will turn into a routine three dose vaccine i think that um we we need to wait to see but a likely scenario is that we will not have a three dose vaccine we will have an annual revaccination and likely with one dose of the vaccine and that could be an annual booster either with the same vaccine or if there is a change in the variance with er and adapted to the new variance vaccine and is there a worry though that introducing a third vaccine will create confusion in terms of you know people's place in line in other words will we have to really start from scratch if if you change the protocol i think it will be a need to manage the situation there's no doubt that uh if we have to to either start uh on a six months vaccinations or if we have to go to another annual revaccination there will be we need to have some effort to manage the confusion and give to the people instructions but it's not something that is going to happen for the first time it's very typical for vaccines that you have a couple of shots to initiate a new response and then you have annual revaccinations with multiple vaccines it's happening with flu every year you need to go to get your flu vaccine so it's going to be the same with coffee any year you will have to go and get your annual shot for coffee to be protected so you would get the the two initial shots in in this near term period and then annually you get that that other shot this is the most likely scenario all right is it your expect i want to be clear on this too is it your expectation that you can adapt to any variants out there that that may pop up i think that we have demonstrated such a strong efficacy with the mrna technology but they are very optimistic that we will be able to do that of course data needs to prove uh the expectation but i am optimistic that you will be able to do that there's also the issue of vaccine being wasted i do want to get your thoughts on this idea of pooling vaccine you have a little bit left in this in this vial a little bit here pooling it to be able to extend the number of people you vaccinate is that something that you and the folks at pfizer support yes i don't think that it's allowed to pull from two different bottles it's not because of uh it's not something that has to do with a vaccine it has to do with sterility principles but they are universally applied so but i think right now people are able to extract the six doses and according to our studies sixty percent of the cases are able to extract the seventh dose as well are you worried about vaccine waste i think we are minimized that of course when you have a vaccine that saves lives and the demand is higher than what you can produce right now it would be criminal not to worry about the the waste of doses but i think it's right now quite well controlled and i just wanted to uh um ask one more this question one more time so we're very clear on it currently with with the two-dose vaccine how long does that extend protection going forward we don't know now lester because we have data only for six months at six months the protection is robust we need to wait and measure in one year to see if that remains for the full year very good well dr berla we really appreciate your time it's nice to see you again and and best of luck thank you very very much thanks for watching our youtube channel

478,fxVwCM1wkOc,A man was vaccinated against COVID 217 times! #Coronavirus #Vaccine #Research #Biology,"Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hashem.alghaili/

#Coronavirus #Vaccine #Research #Biology",2024-03-07,38495,1485,63,UCfAInEvJMxEq_pCb9vehdCw, imagine getting Corona virus vaccine 2117 times a man from magur in Germany got the Corona virus shot 217 times and guess what he is 62 years old but why would he do such a thing they asked him why did you do it he said he did it for private reasons the incredible thing is he had no sign of the virus and there were no side effects of the vaccine after 217 times but he is currently now facing criminal investigation because he is suspected of committing fraud so he basically getting the co shot and the certificate with every shot and selling the co certificate to people who didn't want to get vaccinated people will always find ways to turn anything into business there are some people who say that anybody who got the co shot is going to die within 2 years well it's 217 times enough for you
479,AsnjSouwEf8,Covid Vaccine side effects/വാക്സിൻ പാർശ്വഫലങ്ങൾ എന്തൊക്കെയാണ് ? / എങ്ങിനെയാണ് നേരിടുക?.,"Common side effects of COVID-19 vaccines
Like any vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines can cause side effects, most of which are mild or moderate and go away within a few days on their own. As shown in the results of clinical trials, more serious or long-lasting side effects are possible. Vaccines are continually monitored to detect adverse events.

Reported side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have mostly been mild to moderate and have lasted no longer than few days. Typical side effects include pain at the injection site, fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills and diarrhea. The chances of any of these side effects occurring after vaccination differ according to the specific vaccine.
COVID-19 vaccines are safe, and getting vaccinated will help protect you against developing severe COVID-19 disease and dying from COVID-19. You may experience some mild side effects after getting vaccinated, which are signs that your body is building protection.
After vaccination, it usually takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. So it’s possible a person could be infected with SARS-CoV-2 just before or after vaccination and still get sick with COVID-19. This is because the vaccine has not yet had enough time to provide protection.

different reasons just like there are a million different reasons why some people don't want to get any other kind of vaccine but of course if we can identify groups of people who all share a similar viewpoint we can take efforts to address that state of mind in the hope of convincing as many people as possible to get vaccinated one such group of people is black people a lot of a lot of people in the mainstream press at least are very concerned that african americans as a whole are hesitant to get the vaccine based on surveys like this pew research poll that found that only 42 percent of black americans said that they would get a vaccine compared to about 60 percent for whites and hispanics as well and about 80 percent for english-speaking asian americans there are a few problems with this though one issue is that i said groups that all share a certain viewpoint and just saying black people isn't particularly helpful if i said white people are hesitant to get the vaccine you would probably have some questions because you'd understand that that is not a homogenous group they're individuals we we need to narrow it down a little if we want to do anything about it and honestly any additional qualifier would help are we talking about suburban black people educated black people black people are super into anime literally like anything would help us here second of all that pew poll was conducted in november of 2020 and the question asked was would you definitely or probably get a vaccine for covet 19 if one were available today can we remember that far back i know like it's with the pandemic it's hard time is hard but um you know if you can put yourself back to november of 2020. you know i had just made a video a month prior to that about how i would be super skeptical of a vaccine that was rushed out before the 2020 election and i'm a middle class white person i would be skeptical as hell if i were one of the races that had just spent the past four years being targeted and denigrated by my white supremacist government like i know the pandemic has made time all weird but we had actual nazis in the government back then like we still do but we did then too so is that a sole reason though why a large number of black americans said that they wouldn't get a vaccine back then absolutely not again there are a lot of reasons why people do anything and black americans are not a monolith but we can look at a follow-up pew research poll that was done this month that found that now 61 of black americans say that they will get a vaccine compared to 69 nice percent of white people gosh i wonder what changed so the main problem that black americans have is not vaccine hesitancy it's vaccine access as reported in this great article over at rolling stone and also in another interesting piece at 538. the tldr is we don't have enough vaccine distribution centers in poor black neighborhoods we're not making sure essential workers have the time and opportunity to get their shots and richer white people are constantly swooping in to take spots that aren't meant for them because that's what we do but while the difference between the races has narrowed on vaccine hesitancy the difference between political parties has absolutely exploded turns out that according to this month's pew survey only 56 percent of republicans plan to get a vaccine compared to 83 percent of democrats and unlike guessing things about an entire race an entire political party gives us a bit of a better idea of why they might be hesitant since they you know chose to join that political party the pew poll found that most people regardless of what race they are say they're hesitant to get the vaccine mostly due to potential side effects for the record the side effects can be annoying i have friends who have gotten the vaccine and have been laid low for a day or two with fever general malaise besides the rare serious allergic reaction that happens within a few minutes of administering the vaccine i have yet to hear of anyone with any side effects that compared to actually having symptomatic covet which sounds [ __ ] awful because i have friends who have gotten that too not to mention the potential long-term effects of both symptomatic and asymptomatic covid way better to deal with those side effects just throwing that out there but why specifically are so many conservatives scared of the vaccine the pew poll doesn't break it down by political orientation so instead let's turn to another expert megan mccain um personally i said i tweeted last night i'm happy to get a vaccine live on the show i do trust science i trust doctors and quite frankly i let them put an ipod nano between my shoulder blades if it means i can get drunk at caesar's palace again so i'll do whatever anybody wants but i do trust the doctors however i want to show a clip to explain why it's happening with republicans let's just say there's a vaccine that is approved and even distributed before the election would you get it well i think that's going to be an issue for all of us i will say that i would not trust donald trump and it would have to be a credible source of information that talks about the um the efficacy and the and the reliability of whatever he's talking about i will not take his word for it that's right according to megan mccain the reason why white conservatives are scared of the coveted vaccine is because back in september of 2020 a black democrat said she would not trust donald trump and it would have to be a credible source of info that talks about the efficacy and reliability of whatever he's talking about i would not take his word for it hold on that doesn't seem quite right maybe there's some other reason why megan is upset about the vaccine i i don't understand the down playing of getting the vaccine because right now we should be wanting as many americans as possible to get a vaccine the fact that i'm megan mccain co-host of the view i don't know when or how i will be able to get a vaccine because the rollout for my age range and my health is is so nebulous i have no idea when and how i can get it oh right it's because megan a rich white woman can't skip the line womp womp here's another thought the same recent pew survey found that republicans who say science has had a mostly positive effect on society has plummeted from 70 percent in 2019 to 57 by 2021 which megan demonstrates perfectly by going on to compare donald trump with dr falchi saying that as liberals didn't trust trump on science she so she does not trust an actual scientist we're going to question it i'm going to question it and i think that there has been a real real misstep with messaging from people like dr fauci which i know i'm going to get eviscerated for saying this i don't 100 trust him and i i don't think that he is a unbiased actor in any of this and he is a government official as sarah pointed out i'm one of those people that feel that way about him amazing the pew researchers point out that the drop in trust in science is driven almost entirely by adult white republicans like megan i was curious if other countries had similar reasons for vaccine hesitancy as americans and i found that yes at least in the uk they're also mostly concerned with the side effects from vaccines and also the speed of vaccine development which was the number two concern for americans but i also happened across this study that found that people in the uk and turkey tended to be more skeptical of the vaccine if they believed that the coven 19 virus had a non-natural origin meaning that if they thought that the virus was actually created in a lab in wuhan then they were less likely to want to get the vaccine pointing to a possible fundamental mistrust of scientists at the base of this i found this interesting because immediately prior to reading that study i also happened upon this absolutely jaw-dropping clip of jordan peterson on brett weinstein's podcast talking complete nonsense i suspect if you did the statistics properly i suspect that that medicine independent of public health kills more people than it saves i suspect if you if you factor in phenomena like the development of superbugs in hospitals for example that overall the net consequence of hospitals is negative now that's just a guess and but it's and and it could easily be wrong but it it also could not be wrong and that is a good example or that's where my thinking about what we don't know has taken me with regards to the critique of what we do the fact that it's even plausible is a stunning well you know medical error is the third leading cause of death yeah you know and that doesn't take into account the generation of superbugs for example the generation of superbugs or you know if you're thinking broadly about it um let's i don't know where you stand on this issue but i have been tracking the lab leak hypothesis for covid and it is very distressing to me that as much as it's an unsettled question the evidence for the lab leak gets stronger over time all of the competing hypotheses fall one by one and are replaced by some alternative that hasn't yet been falsified but that's very ominous to me and if this is the case if this was a bug that was modified in the lab through gain of function research and escaped then you have to add that to the balance sheet with respect to the costs of medical errors because it looks like if this was an escapee from the wuhan lab that it was an escapee from experiments designed to create a vaccine to protect us from future coronaviruses so we can't say that with specificity but if we look at the circumstantial evidence of what was being studied how it was being studied and what the likely purpose of those investigations were then this is you know the mother of all self-inflicted wounds and it is uh downstream of naive thinking about the cost-benefit ratio of enhancing the infectivity of uh viruses like first of all no jordan peterson medicine has not killed more people than it saved you [ __ ] peanut brain but second of all i could have sworn that weinstein was one of the intellectual dark web losers who was actually smart enough to try to distance himself from the rest of these jabronis but i guess not because that dude just casually mentioned that he thinks covet 19 was created in a lab adam rutherford over on twitter links to a few good resources that explain why the majority of scientists do not believe the virus was created in a lab because it looks and behaves exactly the way that they would expect a natural coronavirus mutation to behave uh but you know there you have it in real time put put that next to last month's announcement from joe rogan that he's scared of the vaccine and also more [ __ ] from fox news so all of this should prompt some pretty tough questions for our public health experts in this country and one of those questions is how effective is this coronavirus vaccine how necessary is it to take the vaccine don't dismiss those questions from anti-vaxxers don't kick people off social media for asking them answer the questions and now we're getting really close to drilling down on why one significant group white conservatives are really avoiding getting vaccinated because even their intellectual taste makers are blissfully ignorant and terrified of science

About Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The show is inspired by the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Undha Chasma' written by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr. Tarak Mehta. This story evolves around happenings in ""Gokuldham Co-operative Society"" and covers topical issues that are socially relevant. The show predominantly - Promoolves around 'Jethalaal' (Dilip Joshi) who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta' (Sailesh Lodha), is his neighbor. 'Jethalaal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' (Disha Wakani) and a mischievous son 'Tapu' (Bhavya Gandhi). Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble for all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalaal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalaal' to call his father 'Champaklal' (Amit Bhatt) from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu. The opposite happens and the grandfather joins hands with the grandson to make life a roller coaster troublesome ride for Jethalaal.

after comparing the covid vaccines to the Holocaust he's now joined Lawrence Fox reclaimed party that's right the member for Northwest Leicester bullshin confirmed the culture of corruption collusion and cover-ups in Westminster and he joins us now good morning Andrew bridgen um lovely to see you why why the reclaim party well I think um you speak your truth see who's hangs around and you've found your tribe and I found my tribe with Lawrence Fox and and the reclaimed party um regrets Andrew because you were Tori and you've been a tour EMP for many years a member of the Tory party for even longer oh of course but I mean I haven't lost my conservative values I think the conservative party currently I I find unrecognizable I would challenge you Andrew as a as the great Tory boy you are to to tell me one conservative thing this government has achieved with an agency majority it's by far the least conservative government I've ever served in and I think it's a huge opportunity lost I think the conservative party has lost its way and it no longer is relatable to the hopes and aspirations of the people and I think parliament's lost its way we seem to have a uni party there's no real opposition and what we do know is that anyone that speaks out uh against the narrative uh as I have done uh will be canceled we I believe we should have a parliament that legislates for the people what we've now got is a parliament that uh that creates problems for the people and that can't be tolerated we need to reclaim our democracy Andrew yeah breakfast you're going to sync without Trace Andrew aren't you because reclaim you're the only MP for reclaiming I don't think they've got any accounts is you are it yeah but even even a journey of a Thousand Miles starts with a single step we're going to hit the ground running there'll be a campaign starting in Northwest literature as you know my constituency is the heart of England it's the center of population the furthest from the sea we are middle England and we're a good barometer and you'll be surprised I think there'll be a lot of constituencies asking to put up reclaimed candidates at the next general election and of course the longer we go on until the next general election which I don't think actually we're that long um the more I'm going to be Vindicated as further science comes out about the harms and uh lack of safety and efficacy of the uh covid-19 vaccinations and it's that the Sciences is unarguable now I um Andrew I I obviously as you know I have some sympathy with your position on the fact that there was so little debate around the rollout of the Kobe vaccines industry for all ages you and I were both at an all-party parliamentary group together where we listened to doctors talking about the cost and benefits for certain uh demographics I would quite like you to still be in the conservative party making some sort of impression from within that unit that possesses more power do you look back and regret that you made that comparison you effectively got kicked out for using a simile do you ever wish you'd rephrase that differently well it wasn't my phrase actually it was a Jewish researcher's phrase which is difficult to see how it possibly could have been anti-semitic and as I pointed out to the party I actually didn't have never had the the Twitter code so I I always had my tweets moderated uh for the last 12 years before they go up and that that one in particular was moderated by my conservative Association chairman who then refused to stand up and admit that he'd posted the Tweet not me uh it's it's a very regrettable State of Affairs but as you know I mean coming back to the to the issue of vaccine harms it's not just vaccine homes we can't even have a debate and the mother of all parliaments about excess deaths we can't have a debate about the Exodus last week's Figures were 2540 according to the ons excess deaths that's 22.1 percent above the rolling five-year average and in the mother of all parliaments we can't have a debate about it those are issues that affect every community in every constituency and there's only me asking for the debate there's something gone seriously wrong in our democracy Bev are you going to ask for a by-election well clearly not I know the answer to this question should you be holding a by-election in your constituency I think when our Anna salberries stood down uh or changed parties in 2019 you said that she should have a by-election should you we're going to have a general election in the next 12 months I wouldn't want to inflict two in in 12 months upon my uh my constituents we're going to hit the ground and start campaigning straight away I I think as soon as the boundary changes have gone through I think uh Rishi sunac is going to cut and run um if there um Andrew what Prospect do you have of holding that seat because it's a safe Tory seat I mean partly down to your hard work though I mean what was your majority of the last election well it wasn't it wasn't Andrew Andrew it was a safe Tory seat and we had twin we had control of the district council since I ran the campaign in 2007 and we won the council 40 Years of Labor we lost the council there they this party uh ejected or expelled their sitting conservative MP and my counselors lost with a huge crushing defeat they lost they lost 10 out of 21 the councilors elected in 2019 uh effectively the labor party won that election in Northwest literature as shocking as it as it might be that's a seat that we returned with a 20 400 majority uh in 2019 which which seems a very long time ago um and so many Manifesto pledges have been broken it's almost unbelievable Andrew to be a lot of people wondering why you didn't align yourself or join the Reform Party Richard Tyson's party probably in terms of independent parties a little bit better known than reclaim was that an option for you um it could have been but ultimately I looked at the policies and looked at the personalities and I'm afraid the the Reform Party of and being generous have been inconsistent with their policies particularly around the vaccines and that was disappointing okay and what what just give us an idea this is you've got a couple of minutes what's the pitch for reclaim what do you stand for what will that party represent running up to the next election the the freedom of speech is the basis of our society the rights and privileges of our democracy we offer smaller government letting people earn more money and retain more of their own money um we would certainly get rid of of hs2 we do not believe that there is actually a climate emergency this is uh I'm afraid another sort of propaganda that's been pushed onto the people we want Parliament to actually represent the views of the people not some uh some some Elite around the world who seem to have more power over policy in the in the house behind me than the people we're supposed to represent and don't think that Sakia stammer is the answer he's already said that he prefers to be in Davos than Westminster uh that man is not fit to be prime minister there is no real Choice out there what we what we need is is is the reclaimed party will grow very rapidly from North West leicestershire we'll have as many candidates as we can manage at the next general election and as many candidates as people want and I think there's going to be huge demand from a lot of constituencies uh for for reclaim uh candidates and we'll be a genuine alternative to what you're seeing in Parliament now which is is effectively the Union policy on on all the major issues that are going to change your lives which the public have never voted for the two major parties are in total lockstep and we're going to be uh a breath of fresh air it's not it's not cheap to launch and run a political party Andrew does reclaim have the sort of backing required to stand in multiple seats well that's well that's that's another problem I mean currently uh despite reclaim being a bona Friday approved political party for several years with the Electoral commission you'll be amazed how we're struggling to get a bank account that will accept donations and memberships anybody would think it was some sort of action to stop any competition out there and this is in Britain in 2023 but hopefully that will be sorted next week I think we're going to have we'll have huge demand for memberships I've already got lots of offers of support um oh and by the way I need to tell you that I've uh yesterday I filed in the in the in the court of justice uh the defamation claim against Matt Hancock MP um and that's gone live today as well okay right Andrew thank you so much what did you point out obviously the pharmaceutical companies are not here to defend themselves against accusations that they may be responsible for vaccine indeed

main story tonight which concerns the covid vaccines the end result of the world's greatest scientists working around the clock to save countless lives immortalized in a card we'll all definitely lose in a month vitally important but also too big to fit in any standard wallet way to fumble at the one yard line science and look not that we needed it but this week saw yet another reminder of just how dangerous kovid is with cases in india in particular surging at a truly terrifying rate india set a world record for daily covert cases of over 400 000 and that is probably an undercount and obviously the world should be doing everything it can to help india right now but our best way out of this mess long term is clearly vaccines and it's worth remembering we in the us are incredibly fortunate we currently have access to a lot of vaccines and more than half of u.s adults have now gotten at least one dose which is great the bad news is some vaccination locations have already gone from having not enough supply to not enough demand according to the cdc the daily average for vaccinations has dropped 20 percent since the start of the month a worrying trend vaccine demand declining in south carolina some providers left with extra doses and appointments for wide open palm beach county health care district says it is now facing 10 000 appointments for the county's vaccine sites remain unfilled since they opened this week appointments are going unfilled we've got thousands of appointments available over the next few weeks and no takers at this point it's true a worrying amount of people are holding off on getting the free covered vaccine and i'm not saying that you should immediately get something just because it's free i wouldn't recommend getting these old dolls on craigslist just because they're free they're weird broken and they will kill you in your sleep but these vaccines could save not just your life but the lives of people around you and it's genuinely dispiriting that just a few months into the vaccine rollout we are already at this point and the problem is for the coronavirus the herd immunity threshold is thought to be between 70 and 90 of the population but a survey found that while 60 of american adults have got or want to get the vaccine another 18 say maybe and 22 say no and if you're thinking well hold on if every maybe gets the vaccine that still puts us at 78 unfortunately that poll doesn't take into account children who were not vaccinating right now and who make up around 22 of the population so we need to get the vaccine into as many adults as possible as soon as possible and that means you really need to get vaccinated and obviously i mean the collective you but also you mike mike in baltimore i know you've got this on in the background at work on monday so listen to me schedule your vaccine mike don't say you're gonna look into it later just google vaccine finder baltimore it takes seconds here are a list of vaccine sites in your area and if you're thinking yeah i'm not sure i need it joe rogan says i'm probably fine look it is true you might not get seriously sick from covid or indeed sick at all but you could still inadvertently pass it to someone who could then die and before you say well vulnerable people should just get vaccinated then the vaccines are only 95 effective mike so they'll probably be okay but maybe not also the more the virus circulates the likely we'll see mutations that make it more dangerous possibly helping it to evade the vaccine completely putting us all the way back to square one so get the vaccine mike the point is there is a problematic amount of vaccine hesitancy right now even among people who you would really like to think would not need convincing we met robert gannon before he went in to visit his 77 year old mother kia who was on a ventilator right now in the icu due to coven had she been vaccinated she was not vaccinated i think she was being hesitant just wanting to see how things played out have you been vaccinated i have not what would it take for you to get vaccinated um i'd want to make sure that it's safe wow there is perhaps no clearer sign of just how deep vaccine hesitancy runs than someone in that guy's position still questioning whether to get it instead of asking is there such a thing as too much vaccine because if not i'm going to keep going back for injections until i'm around 80 percent pfizer so given all of that tonight let's talk about the covid vaccines why people are hesitant what their worries are and how they might be reassured and let's start with the fact you can't characterize any one group as uniformly vaccine hesitant no demographic is a monolith every group will have some who are excited and others who are anxious and different groups will be anxious for different reasons for instance early on you probably heard a lot about hesitancy among some black americans which can be a real thing even this pediatrician had reservations when the vaccine was first made available to both of you did you both jump at the chance to get it no no i mean not me anyway i am black first in this country and that has with it a lot of baggage to tell you the truth and so then my public health degree the culminating experience that i did was related to the the relationship between black people and physicians and that relationship has been a cantankerous one and so those are the kinds of things that are deeply embedded and challenging to overcome even within someone who's a scientist honestly i do understand that we've talked before on this show about the fraught relationship black americans have with healthcare based on both current bad experiences and the history of incidents like the tuskegee experiment where doctors lied to black men allowing them to suffer from untreated syphilis over decades or as most u.s history students would describe it something i have not heard of although it does feel important to mention that that doctor did wind up getting the vaccine and in general black vaccine hesitancy has dropped fast another group you might have heard have high hesitancy rates are republicans and that is also true around 30 percent of republicans say they won't get it and it's not hard to see why because fears and doubts about the vaccine have flown around conservative media with one of the most prominent super spreaders being this guy what about this vaccine why are americans being discouraged from asking simple straightforward questions about it questions like how effective are these drugs are they safe do you need a reason to turn on the vaccine and what happens if you do turn it down would you be allowed to fly on airplanes or go to work or enter the front doors of madison square garden oh now they're telling us the vaccine has a delayed response okay delayed by how long they don't say if vaccines work why are vaccinated people still banned from living normal lives honestly what's the answer to that so maybe it doesn't work and they're simply not telling you that well you hate to think that especially if you've gotten two shots but what's the other potential explanation okay it is genuinely weird to see someone hosting a show on a supposed news network and ending every sentence with a question mark especially when answers to most of those questions are out there for anyone who cares to know so for instance that last complaint that the cdc still recommends wearing masks indoors when around vulnerable unvaccinated people does not mean the vaccine doesn't work clinical trials found that the vaccines are spectacularly successful at preventing people from getting serious disease as for whether they protect you from spreading the virus the trials weren't designed to assess that but evidence so far indicates that they drastically reduce transmission the reason we still see mask and distancing recommendations is that the cdc is being cautious and wants to be sure that it is not spreading around during a global pandemic like a frozen dinner duke with a tv show anyway i hope that answers at least one of your gaped mouthed bad faith wonderings tucker you scrunch-faced fear baboon and the problem is when people like tucker raise questions without bothering to answer them there is a lot of misinformation out there for people to then stumble on anti-vaccine groups have been waiting for a moment like this to spread doubt and the scary thing is they don't actually need to convince people they're right they just need to convince people that no one is and that tracks with recent polling while few believe specific myths about the vaccine larger numbers say that they didn't know whether particular myths were true or false for instance only four percent of people believe the covet vaccine is more deadly than the disease but 25 percent say they don't know and that is not good because if anti-vaxxers can simply spread enough misinformation to cause people to throw up their hands and say i just don't know enough to get the shot they have already seriously things up for all of us and to be clear most people who are hesitant are not fanatics or conspiracy theorists many are just trying to make the best decision for themselves and their family like that pediatrician that we saw earlier you definitely know people like that in your life so i'm actually going to spend the rest of this piece trying to clear up some of the biggest myths flying around and some are pretty easy to debunk quickly like the claims that bill gates is using the vaccine to put a microchip in all of us something his wife had this response to i know my husband is not vaccinating people and putting a microchip in her arm because that technology doesn't even exist and he's never uttered the words out of his mouth so okay that wasn't the reassuring push back to a batshit conspiracy theory that i had hoped for to be honest we're not microchipping people because the technology doesn't exist yet and my husband hasn't said it out loud to me why would you put it like that there are lots of things a husband won't say out loud to his wife not dark things just things quiet thoughts a partner might not be ready to hear like how sometimes late at night i think wouldn't it be nice to live in an egg an egg to be in not just an oval-shaped sleeping pot i can get an oval-shaped sleeping pod nobody wants one of those i mean an egg a big egg with me in it or maybe a normal egg and i'm small it doesn't matter what matters is i'm in an egg not alone i'm with the gloop too it's just me and the glue no opening no windows no way to ever know if it's morning or night so do you know what time it is all the time egg time just egg time for me and the glute sometimes it's warm and that's when i feel safest sometimes i can tell i'm being carried or moved about and it's jarring enough that i'm nervous but not so rough that i'm panicking and you can shake me but do make sure not to do it hard because remember i'm fragile i am egg the point is you can't say any of that to melinda gates she'd never understand what wife could anyway for the record there are no microchips in the covid vaccine that rumor is based on the fact that the gates foundation funded research years ago which is frequently taken out of context in that study researchers looked into creating an invisible ink that could potentially be injected along with a vaccine in order for populations like refugee kids to be able to retain vaccine records without paperwork over time the original context was lost contorted and kind of telephoned its way into becoming something something bill gates microchips on facebook a claim which if you think about it for just a second doesn't make sense because if your main concern is that bill gates could use microchips to track you he can already do that that's what your phone is now another more reasonable sounding concern has to do with just how fast the vaccine came together wouldn't want to get it um i felt like i was too rushed i think the whole thing has been rushed through too fast it kind of came really fast like the vaccine they made up one really fast it was done way too quick i just i don't feel comfortable with taking it not anytime soon i think that they're using the public as guinea pigs right and that doesn't sound good nobody wants to be a guinea pig although i don't really know why being a guinea pig seems great you can eat a pepper while wearing the stem as a little hat run around a tiny city made of cardboard and best of all you get to use the guinea pig bridge [Music] yeah being a guinea pig has its upsides that's all i'm saying the infrastructure alone is incredible but that is clearly not the concern that those people have their worry is that we are being used as guinea pigs for a rushed untested vaccine it is an understandable thing to worry about even if some express it in less than ideal ways tell me why you're concerned six words testing testing testing testing and more testing it's important if you're going to put something into your body that it's absolutely and totally tested i tell you what i admire about that guy his confidence because i don't think i've seen anyone more self-assured than the man who just promised six words said seven and counted five all without even flinching that guy is so secure in his thinking he could be wrong about numbers on camera twice and do it with an unbreaking smile but it is worth understanding exactly how the vaccine was able to come to market so fast because researchers had been working on vaccines against other coronaviruses for years so when covid19 hit they had a significant head start operation warp speed as it was famously called wasn't about rushing the science it was about significantly cutting through bureaucracy that could have otherwise slowed it down as this vaccine researcher explains did you ever imagine that we'd be able to develop a vaccine in 12 to 18 months the short answer is no we're able to compress the timeline so that things that we would normally do in a linear fashion a to b we actually start the f and the a at the same time as a and b exactly they took steps that usually happen sequentially and save time by running them simultaneously and to be honest i am envious of that level of efficiency i would save so much time every morning if i could shower shave eat breakfast kiss my family and brush my teeth all at the same time unfortunately i've only ever managed to do three of them at once but i am so close to that fourth one now another concern that you may have heard or seen online is that the pfizer and moderna vaccines are the first authorized to use messenger rna which is true but that has given rise to speculation about what mrna is capable of doing basically anyone taking these vaccines they're all designed to the same thing is going to have neurological disorders within one year most of the people taking the vaccine will be dead within 10. let me tell you something you take the mrna it creates plaque in your brain it gives you alzheimer's and i got the studies too so hey you think they just put flora in the water to dumb you down man alex jones is having a blast isn't he no one else has as much fun while making the world a worse place to live in it's like he invented a jet pack that sprays everyone beneath him with human  but the thing is there is absolutely no evidence or credible studies supporting any of what he just said as for the claim that mrna vaccines modify your dna it is very important to know that the vaccines mrna does not enter our genome it does its work far from the cell's nucleus which is where your dna is but the fear of what the vaccine contains or what it could do to you seems to be common some evangelicals are concerned that it contains cells from aborted fetuses which it does not others worry that it could change the body's inner workings you might have had a friend tell you that they are worried that the vaccines cause infertility those rumors were fueled by a blog post which falsely claimed that pfizer's vaccine contained ingredients capable of training the female body to attack a protein that plays a crucial role in the development of the placenta but a few things there first experts say of that claim it's a myth it's inaccurate there is no evidence to support it and there is already pretty good proof that pfizer's vaccine doesn't cause infertility because during the trials last year multiple women became pregnant and the only one who suffered a pregnancy loss was given the placebo so it is just not true and look the final myth you may have heard is that the risks from the vaccine are somehow greater than the risks of covid that is a perception fed by the constant circulation of misleading headlines about people falling ill or dying after getting their shot for instance you may have seen this story that was widely shared about 23 people in norway dying within a week of getting the shot which does sound scary but that headline is missing some pretty major context while those people did die at that point in norway the vaccine was being administered to the oldest or sickest people and a certain percentage of them were statistically going to die that week vaccine or no vaccine on average 400 people died every week in nursing homes in norway and when the world health organization reviewed those incidents they didn't find any unexpected or untoward increase in fatalities which does make sense correlation isn't causation the vaccine protects against covid not the concept of mortality it is weird that i have to clarify this but you are in fact going to die one day mike yeah mike stop listening to what joe rogan tells you he's a and those are his words not mine that also goes for stories that you might see hyping up scary sounding data from veyers the vaccine adverse event reporting system it's a database that collects stories of medical events following vaccinations but any lay person has to treat data coming out of it with extreme caution because reports can be entered by anyone and are not routinely verified one doctor once claimed that the flu vaccine turned him into the hulk and that report was accepted and entered into the database which is completely absurd a drug cannot turn you into the hulk although admittedly it can turn you into captain america the only superhero whose origin story is a metric ton of experimental nazi steroids and look if we're just gonna share random unverified side effects i might as well show you this truly shocking video about what might happen to your mom so my mom got the vaccine because she's a healthcare worker and she told me she's experiencing some side effects mom what's that side effect you said you're experiencing being a boss ass very good and look i'm not saying veyers is useless it very much isn't the reason the cdc collects this data is so if a pattern does emerge actions can be taken that is exactly what happened with the johnson and johnson shot the cdc found a potential pattern of rare blood clots and paused the rollout under an abundance of caution and while some vaccine skeptics pointed to that as evidence that they were right about vaccines being dangerous in reality it kind of proves the opposite that the safety risk of vaccines is rigorously and publicly analyzed not secretly buried and somehow leaked to the human football's neon scream hour and none of this is to say that there are no side effects to the vaccines there can be it is just that serious ones like anaphylaxis are incredibly rare 4.7 cases per million for pfizer two and a half cases per million for moderna and you should know those also occur mostly in individuals with a history of severe allergies the fact is the vast majority of people can expect at most typical colds or flu symptoms in the first few days after they're shot or maybe just a sore arm or maybe nothing at all for what it's worth i actually got my second shot this thursday my arm hurt a little bit for a day but that's basically it i will admit the following afternoon for a couple of hours i did feel a little bit like a boss ass but that passed quickly and anyway the key thing to remember is that no side effect of the vaccine is worse than the alternative covid a disease that has killed over 500 000 people in the u.s alone while once again to date the vaccine has been proven to kill exactly zero so it is more than natural to have questions but there are reassuring answers out there and anyone just throwing out questions without acknowledging that probably has another agenda entirely but the problem is to get anywhere close to herd immunity we badly need to convince anyone who can be convinced so the question is how do we do that while some republican lawmakers to their credit have tried to reassure their voters although occasionally those attempts have looked like this live free and beauty surrounds you the world still astounds you each time you look at a star i'm senator john kennedy i can't sing very well but i'm free be free be cool get the vaccine i did it works okay i don't love that and not just because it is the worst thing to come out of a kennedy's mouth since the back of a kennedy's head but also because the truth is that probably didn't convince anyone in researching this piece experts repeatedly told us that the vaccine hesitant generally don't respond well to hearing from politicians celebrities or athletes telling them to get the vaccine and i get that i would love to think that i could end this piece having carefully laid out some data with a triumphant call for people to get vaccinated featuring a mascot of some incongruous animal know a vaccine cicada you don't think that that's something that i would be interested in doing the truth is we actually did that we had a vaccine cicada costume made but after being advised that this technique would not be remotely effective in convincing people who were hesitant we scrapped the idea completely we emailed our mascot guy and we told him not to come in because it was an absolutely stupid idea a vaccine cicada can you imagine how dumb that would look it probably wouldn't even look like a cicada more like some kind of unhinged cockroach it was a terrible concept that could have fundamentally undermined the very important message that we were trying to send and i am so so glad that we avoided making that mistake because the truth is i'm not going to be able to convince the people in your life who are hesitant the person with the best chance of doing that is you so if you know someone who is worried for whatever reason and you want to convince them otherwise don't show them this video but maybe do try and use some of the information inside it to tell them yourself and when you are trying to do that don't dismiss or judge them for having doubts and i know that that is not always easy i could have given that guy a pass for holding up the wrong number of fingers but i couldn't do it i don't have that level of restraint i'm a small petty man and that guy is a idiot but if you think you can do better it is incredibly important that you try or to put in the terms that that guy could understand i've got two words for you please just try as hard as you can you
486,1g1rSggnBv0,Excess Deaths Data Being HIDDEN?! Is THIS Why?,"http://bioptimizers.com/brand

With an increasing number of British MPs criticising the ‘wall of silence’ around adverse events, and the Health Secretary being urged to release data that ‘may link Covid vaccine to excess deaths’ – are the cracks in that wall deepening by the day?

being suppressed by the British government even though that information has already been given to Big farmer companies they wouldn't do that would they hello there you Awakening wonders thanks for joining us in our Voyage to truth and freedom and what a voyage it is with so many obstacles in the way that's why it's vital that you click the link in the description and join us for an extra video a week where we talk about even more explicit and difficult subjects I mean subjects that would get censored and in trouble for dissenting against establishment preferred narratives and we have conversations with what I call these days proper people who care about things that matter rather than ignoring and distracting you from things that are absolutely vital for today's story we have the perfect example it seems like data may already exist that demonstrates that there is in fact a connection between excess deaths which in our country they've just changed the way of measuring guess what it makes it less excess deaths that's surprising isn't it and the treatments that were available indeed quite heavily advocated for during the pandemic period now this information exists is already with pharmaceutical companies but they're saying astonishingly we can't reveal that data because of people's anonymity or whatever excuse they're coming up with some reason why they can give it to madna with whom they have some interesting Deals they can give it to fisa with whom they have some interesting deals but they can't give it to you I mean you only fund everything you only fund the government you only funded these vaccines you are the people that are suffering as a result if indeed there is a connection and I'm certainly not saying it's concrete yet that there is but you are not allowed the information note how similar this is to the advocation for ongoing censorship what position does it put you in the position of a child or an idiot we have to censor this information we have to keep back this information to what protect you to protect your children to protect your elderly when there's been a covid inquiry in this country that fell somewhat short of a rigorous investigation to what went on oh my phone it's on factory settings that's very interesting I wonder if rishy sunak or Boris Johnson or any of the people that appeared before that rather tepid inquiry had information that perhaps connected covid medications and excess deaths That's the Silver Bullet that's why people are getting shut down for Dissent that's why madna are spying on people that's why government funded departments are spying on people and that's why we're going to talk about this story now particularly given that they're advocating that all of us take yearly mRNA shots now that it replaces the flu shot let's have a look at how the Legacy Media are reporting around these issues and playing demonstrating that they don't have your interest at heart they in fact work for the very same interest that keep this information for you we should be demanding this information yeah well the Food and Drug Administration today proposing to make covid shots a lot more like the annual flu shot simplifying the process yeah simplifying it so they can do it every year so they can charge you for it continually like the pharmaceutical industry requires you to be on drugs for as long as possible they want Wars that last forever and drugs that work as long as you take them every day for the rest of your life can you believe that the pharmaceutical industry has not been exposed to a reckoning after the opioid crisis like Purdue Farmer and the Sackler family are still in some kind of version of business after half a million people have died as a result of their product when they concealed information prior to the release of those drugs when they concealed information and mitigated it through the entire investigative process that shows you how the system worked the pandemic wasn't particularly unique it was just big and in its vastness it showed us how these institutions and systems operate that's the challenges they're dealing with now too many people have been exposed to the the truth and too many people oddly are also being exposed to my cardas to one shot a year the FDA will decide on Thursday whether to go forward with the idea so wait should we go forward on this new idea that means that every year we'll earn this money well let's just talk through how you make your money again you know these companies uh-huh uh-huh they give you your money what so if we keep them happy keep going then they'll keep us happy that's right and if we said no we're not doing this there's no need in fact there are reasons to be very concerned in fact there's data that's being suppressed right now that might reveal that it was was evenly that that that that that that is exactly the line we don't want you going down oh oh I get it so I just approv the you just approv the drug and at the same time researchers are working on a new flu shot that will be a lot more like a CO shot even the fell off the news he confused it'll be a lot more like a CO shot which means that it might no that can't be right that be nope it is going to be more like the co shot but no hey don't shoot the messenger and please don't mandate those medications for the messenger either yikes Ursula Perry with how new technology is working its way into Old vaccine protections the co pandemic required scientists to move fast certainly did lightning speed they're not working so fast at releasing the data let me tell you right okay vaccines for sale vaccines for sale get your vaccines Astro Mna fisa Johnson and Johnson don't talk about that one much anymore do they get your vaccines hey these vaccines I'm worried if there's a oh well we just have to do some research on that so they can work out variet speeds bringing vaccine technology that have been studied for years but not approved front and center studied for years but not approved hm I've been studying this for years and I just can't approve it and why is that and I think that when the world had an urgent need for vaccines when SARS CO2 virus hit that causes covid then it became an opportunity to test this new approach to vaccine development it certainly did business is booming baby traditional vaccines put a weak into germ into our bodies but mRNA shots like the fiser and Mna covid-19 vaccines teach cells to make a protein it teaches cells like a Sesame Street level once again the infantilization of the audience what is a vaccine and does it have to be a shot and and will I still need to wear my mask I think above all else they want us in these states of fear and desire like a child banalized confused and baffled not like sort of astute empowered individuals that demand Freedom demand control don't hand that over to authoritarian institutions because they're planning to protect you under the aesthetic of liberalism but with the credos of authoritarianism that triggers an immune response if someone gets infected researchers take that mRNA template and can encode it for the flu or other infectious diseases yeah it seems to be some downside though we can just encode it for anything can you encode it to stop causing myocarditis that is the one thing we can't do it would also make it easier to tweak during Flu SE TW TW the MRNA vaccine for the flu is currently being studied and we could have the results as soon as March hoay meantime other studies are underway on other vaccines for other diseases including Lyme disease rabes HIV and even zika it seems like they've got the technology now and they're trying to apply it in as many markets as possible in order to make money rather than what's supposed to be the stated goal of the health industry making people healthy in Australia where during the pandemic authoritarian measures were piloted in a way that seemed very very surprising at the time the pendulum is swinging back the other way they're having to sort of admit that they shouldn't have mandated vaccines that their lockdown measures were ineffective and various other Admissions and concessions have subsequently been made indeed we are entering into the pandemic Reckoning period but I suppose the media are collaborating ensuring it doesn't seem like a reckoning they're trying to make it seem sort of normal and inoffensive there's been a bombshell ruling in favor of Queens an's Frontline workers who took their bosses to court fighting against covid-19 vaccine mandates the decision means directives ordering police and paramedics to get the jab were unlawful and had no power they were just telling us what to do with' no right at all take these vaccines I tell you take them they can't do that's not the law of a country they Tred to change what the relationship was in fact many people think that was kind of the point of the pandemic period was to alter the dynamic between the Govern and the the governing to one of authoritarianism and just obedience and through their propaganda and campaigning they achieved that to a large degree because if you can get people on side you get people you're irresponsible you're not wearing a mask you killed my granddad if you can get people out of their minds with fear which is understandable given the conditions then suddenly people are willing to accept Authority that is why we have to demand free speech and that's why you have to sort of remain a little bit calmer they sobbed and cheered inside court and even louder out we can't keep bringing you this ground breaking revolutionary heartwarming content without your love dedication and devotion and without the support of our sponsors can you believe that January is almost over how's them New Year's resolutions going I can't bother with all that it's difficult mine was easy of course as always it's to focus on well-being and overthrowing the establishment now we all know the foundation of well-being is a good night's sleep and throwing over the establishment means a willingness to absorb a lot of flack so if I could just do one thing to improve my sleep and overall well-being it is taking the number one mineral for that do you know what it is it also helps me personally on so many levels I can't even describe it do you know the mineral it's sounds like an X-Man magnesium actually I'm talking about the Magnesium Breakthrough by bioptimizers the seven different forms of magnesium in this supplement are involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions in the body pretty much every function in your body gets upgraded when you take magnesium from the quality of your sleep to your brain function to your metabolism stress levels will decrease and let's face it even if your 2024 resolution was to oppose Lo this odd globalist regime it's not going to hurt you to be healthy in order to achieve those goals cuz you're going to need quality sleep you're going to have to be out to manage your stress if you're confronting the globalists that's a fact isn't it so do yourself a favor and make magnesium breakthrough part of your daily routine this year so you can get the Vitality you need to conquer your dreams and the global Elites go to bioptimizers docomo and end at the promo code brand to get 10% off any order again that's by optimizers tocom FL brand now let's get back to bringing them down yeah how does everyone feel excellent I think I think that speaks volumes for how my clients feel about the decision notice those people aren't spontaneously fainting and having heart attacks dozens of police officers and paramedics challenged queensland's covid-19 vaccine mandates oh those enemies of the state whether go they now all those people who were saying we should shame them paramedics the very fabric of society you can find a way of adoring those people whether you're left or right who Among Us are oh you know I hate paramedics going around rescuing people in life and death situations these are the people that to some degree were brave enough to go I don't think that's right and the medical professionals as well what it migrates no no no no that doesn't sound right and now they've been Vindicated arguing they should never have been forced to choose between getting the jab and keeping their jobs today they won it's you know been a long time coming after being stood down without pay for 2 years there you go just sack nurse look at how those issues are leveraged like you know support the NHS which is our Health Service in this country support the troops support the police or defund like how these people are used as kind of symbols and like they were just sacking them in our country people were going hysterical about nurses and doctors they're painting rainbows I'm not even joking there's rainbows on people's windows hey they were doing dances everywhere do you remember that people were banging pots and pans on their doorsteps meanwhile will you do exactly what you're told well as a medical professional I've got some concerns about that you're f mate is what you are can I have a drawing of a rainbow yeah in fact I'm going to use a rainbow pin to tell you where to go up right off there you go there's your [ __ ] rainbow no pot of gold at the end of it though the Queensland Health in particular ruling could now open a door to lawsuits from other sacked workers in other Industries uhoh also other territories maybe people in America and Canada and Ireland and all across Europe and not so much in Africa cuz for some reason and I think it was money they didn't mandate that vaccines or even provide vaccines in many African nations to the same degree what an extraordinary coincidence that is an argument that might potentially be open to other employees who were dismissed as a result of of a vaccine mandate 34,000 people in New York all across America let me know your personal stories in the comments and chats I know it happened to you oh we wouldn't do it I didn't do it I did do it and I regret it all of that stuff let us know keep your voice going because you're being Vindicated welcome back well Queensland Supreme Court has ruled that the covid-19 vaccine mandates for emergency servic were unlawful now it's time to take your poppers and enjoy some Australian sexy news here to explain is today medical expert Dr Nick coatsworth doc good morning to you this is pretty extraordinary isn't it can you walk us through the ruling it is extraordinary K before I do that I can't do this segment without acknowledging my own role in the system that promoted vaccine mandates guy's actually admitting that he made a mistake in endorsing vaccine mandates he doesn't go so far as to say that vaccines themselves may have been deleterious or have had had some negative impact but perhaps because he hasn't seen the data because the data is not being released except to pharmaceutical companies what this ruling does is it calls into question the basis upon which those mandates were put in and it does so because the Queensland Police Commissioner by law had to examine the impact on human rights and it was clear through this case and the evidence which I read yesterday that she did no such thing she didn't give any regard uh to the human rights implications of the these vaccine Mand oh if only people have bought that up at the beginning of the entire pandemic period yeah they did didn't they everyone was isn't this a violation of our human rights are you sure that this is not going to cause more harm than it solves what about the subsidiary and tangental issues that may arise from lockdowns and what about potential unanticipated side effects caused by these new experimental medications all legitimate questions all questions that were asked all questions that were censored and so they were declared unlawful under Section 58 of the Queensland human rights act as you you know this caused so much conjecture and angst at the time right so what does it actually mean now for those Frontline workers who made this complaint it could mean a number of things it could mean that some of them get their jobs back it could open the way for civil proceedings and damages it could mean that people lose trust in all of their systems of government and institutions and we get a kind of Uprising where workers people that are committed people that are nurses firefighters police officials even the military start to turn against their own institutions and align with populations of their countries recognizing that we have more in common with one another than the institutions that govern us but you won't report on that will you against the governments with Human Rights Acts which are Queensland act and Victoria but importantly I think it opens all the decisions that we as senior health officials as senior police and ambulance officials made I say this gu is a good guy he's taking responsibility for it that exactly what's required isn't it look sorry have you seen anyone else do that have you seen Joe Biden do that have you seen Anthony fouchy do that have you seen anyone in the UK do that have you seen anyone in Canada do that have you seen anyone go sorry even when Justin Trudeau is talking about that emergency act he's like I'd do it again I am absolutely absolutely Serene and confident that I made the right choice they love their Authority they love their power they dress it up in an aircut and tell you that it's there to help you did we have regard to Australian's human rights when we made those decisions and to what extent did we balance those decisions against human rights and I think going forward that's probably the most important thing of this these decisions and uh and I think there's going to be more of them well Victoria needs to keep an eye on this then oh the guy on the left is just s of like wait a minute I've been reporting on this stuff for years the whole thing's a total blackag we can't trust them we started internment camps during that period what about Don Lemon are old CNN in America there that's ridiculous wait a minute didn't the British government employ a load of madna scientists and British government agents go and work for madna immediately after this hey well Victoria certainly does I mean there must be cases going going on down there and and I think that if we're going to have Human Rights Acts and they're supposed to be protective of people's rights well we do have to have regard from them and can't just like ignore them as soon as it's inconvenient like everyone in the world bloody well did you know we have a human rights commissioner a federal human rights commissioner who who was unfortunately quite silent during the pandemic on on some of these issues and well have you got to say rights conditioner do you know that koalas carry cidia yes I do stop telling me that it doesn't matter if the majority of the population goes along with it Human Rights Acts are there to protect the minority who may have very good reasons or beliefs I don't know they would have got much airpl um when you go back to the circumstances but he's realized he's Ted it wait a minute we were censoring that sort of stuff CU we were discussing here in the office and you told me I couldn't say but you rightly point out Nick that um that you're a government official promoting vaccines during the pandemic you're a big boy you can defend yourself did you get it wrong Australia news you're a big boy come on let's fight yes I think we did get that wrong and I think you can say hindsight is 2020 but Carl hindsight gives us foresight and if we have another pandemic we should think long and hard whether mandates for vaccines are Justified yes indeed if we have another pandemic we should think long and hard and we should certainly demand that all data be released that could help us to establish whether or not there is a link between medications and excess deaths which seem to be spiraling across the world oddly except in territories where they didn't have access to those medications because they couldn't afford them the literal irony let's get into it British MPS and peers have accused the health Secretary of withholding data that could link the covid vaccine to excess deaths and criticized a wall of Silence on the topic why would they ever want to keep back data that could establish a link between the vaccines and excess death let me know in the chat a cross party group has written to Victoria Atkins to sound the alarm about the growing public and professional concerns are the UK's rates of excess deaths since 2020 oh don't worry about that what we can do is we can change the way we measure excess deaths until there aren't any and then everyone can shut up ministers have blamed the rise in excess deaths on record NHS our Health Service waiting list and the pandemic backlog but the parliamentarians Congress are demanding to be shown the underlying data to support the government's assertion that there is no evidence linking excess deaths to the vaccines for covid-19 yeah if there is no link you'll have no trouble just giving us all the evidence right because the evidence will show that there is no link and yet you've given it to the pharmaceutical industry but you're not revealing it in the covid-19 inquiry and you've not revealed it yet curiously you are manipulating the figures around excess deaths what if we recorded it you know but we didn't include all these deaths that have been caused by who knows what if those data do indeed exist please share them if thorough investigations have already ruled out such a link please share the relevant reports their letter says there is no place here for Blind Faith No Blind Faith isn't how science work although blindness has also sh up like cancer and heart disease and all sorts of other conditions the group of 21 MPS and peers from four parties have written to the health secretary in the Department of Health and Social care as well as the medicines and healthc care products regulatory agency MH and the UK Health Security Agency UK HSA to request the data and I've been writing to those agencies to request data as well because it seems they spent a lot of their resources monitoring Des sending voices in this time and are now spending their resources not revealing data that could establish that there is is no link let's see that information it would be great wouldn't it to establish no link between excess deaths and covid-19 when they keep the data what does it make you think oh yeah no this data must be so brilliant that we'll all get so whoopy do and excited that data was about a surprise birthday party for you for your birthday and you've spoiled it you're just like your fizer they believe potentially critical data which Maps the date of people's covid vaccine doses to the date of their deaths have been released to the pharmaceutical companies but not put into the public domain doesn't that tell you everything you know about how power operates these days this information has already they suspect it's not proven being given to pharmaceutical companies but it's not being given to you how curious that they chose this time to reimagine and manipulate the recording of excess death which took the figure down from 30,000 excess death which is extraordinary you better believe that would have been on a ticket tape at the height of the pandemic to 11,000 deaths even using their new magical maths they can't eliminate the fact that an extraordinary number of excess deaths have occurred and also they're not releasing this information what could that be and also the covid-19 inquiry has been suspended until after the election so we can get another bunch of stoes in who similarly will protect establishment interest instead of looking out for your interest I suppose the positive thing to point out is is there is a cross-party group of MPS that are asking these questions and those are the kind of politicians indeed public figures that we should be supporting and thank God for them the MPS argue that the data should should be released on the same anonymized basis that it was shared with the pharmaceutical groups and there seems to be no credible reason why that should not be done immediately that presumably means that they're saying we can't release this data because of the anonymity meanwhile Tony Blair's globalist group are advocating for the mass sale of data to data companies private Health Data they don't care about your anonymity they don't care about your safety they care about protecting big business globalist interest am I being cynical let me know in the chat they add we warn that by withholding official data that could help reassure the public that dhsc the uksa and the MH are now fueling concerns and hesitancy about public health messaging questions about these Trends however have to date been met by a relative wall of Silence from your organizations and other public health officials remember at the height of the opioid crisis remember how they delayed the information remember how hard it was to campaign for the release of that data to expose the dangers of fenil and other comparable drugs if they will permit half a million people to die in an opioid crisis do you imagine they've had some radical change of heart and now put your interest above the interest of the pharmaceutical industry and if you do imagine that how do you imagine it because they won't release the data that objectively demonstrates that there is no connection why would that be just keep asking that question why would they conceal that data the letter was organized by the all party parliamentary group APG on pandemic response and recovery and the campaign group us for them like they've had to start a special group within Parliament called us for them it's like well hold on aren't we meant to be representing Ordinary People yeah they've had to start a subgroup that does the job that the whole thing's me at the that's what it's meant to do Congress Parliament all these institutions they work for us and we go oh I'm a bit worried about this get in there and tell everyone and have a chat about it and sort it out will you that's what they're meant to do they have to remind themselves and start break away like Splinter Group to do what they were supposed to do in the first place it's like someone at MTV bre my god look we're supposed to be showing pop videos on it that's what this meant to do its signatures include the conservative MPS Miriam Kates Danny Krueger Philip Davis and KL McCartney as well as the labor MP Graham Stringer who sits on the science Innovation and Technology committee the leader of Reform UK has committed his party to a public inquiry in excess deaths an alleged covid vaccine harms Richard Tai says there was a serious problem with thousands more people dying than expected and suggested the side effects of coronavirus Jabs could be responsible the office for National statistics on has been accused of overestimating excess deaths in the first year of the covid p pandemic the statistics body announced last week that it was updating its methodology for calculating excess deaths to include current death rates as well as the growing and aging population a change that many experts said was long overdue oh you know what this is this is a long overdue broad problem nothing to do with 2019 and 20 that's why we're just going to keep that data all nice and protected because it's nothing to these two things are not connected that's why we've got to protect the data and by some other coincidence we're changing the way we measure deaths all these coincidences coming out of the back of a great big Global coincidence where Authority benefited big farmer benefited the right to censor authoritarianism benefited it's all just one big wealth transfer more Authority more globalization coincidence so why don't you just shut up but academics from the University of Oxford warned the new modeling revealed a major drop in expected deaths in 2020 making it appear that far more people have died than normal during the first year of the pandemic the dhsc spokesman said we are committed to data transparency seems like it and publish a wide range of data on excess mortality the data sets published are kept under constant review and we Chang them according to what we told I added the last bit but you know sometimes I'd like to just modulate things to keep it more truthful bit like the national office of Statistics a wide variety of factors can contribute to excess mortality each year and we work closely with the mhra and the uksa who won't release their data to analyze significant Trends without looking at their data and adjust Public Health interventions where appropriate without looking at the data all of this can be done by by giving the data to Big farmer but not giving it to you so who do they work for really let's do it again slowly see if we can spot any pants they've given the data to Big Farmer they won't give the data to you hm is there a pattern emerging here is there a truth making itself known to us that we cannot trust these institutions is there something significant that it takes a breakaway group of politicians to act according to the principles that democracy is actually founded on that's the foundational princi a breakaway group of McDonald's restaurant are serving hamburgers think about it they're telling you they're letting you know they can't cope

million Americans are fully vaccinated   against the coronavirus, and many others 
are eagerly waiting for their shots. But among white evangelical Americans, 
interest in the vaccine isn't as widespread. John Yang speaks with one evangelical leader about 
why that is, and what can be done to change it. JOHN YANG: Judy, among religious groups, 
according to the Pew Research Center,   white evangelicals are least likely to say 
that they intend to get the COVID vaccine. In Pew's latest survey conducted in 
mid-February, 45 percent of white   evangelicals said they definitely or probably 
would not get vaccinated. That compares with   30 percent of all Americans and 33 percent of 
Black Christians -- Black Protestants, rather. According to Pew, about 17 percent of adult 
Americans identify as white evangelicals. The Reverend Russell Moore president 
of the Ethics and Religious Liberty   Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. Reverend Moore, thanks for joining us. First of all, let's get this out of 
way. Have you gotten the vaccine? REV. RUSSELL MOORE, President, Ethics 
and Religious Liberty Commission,   Southern Baptist Convention: 
Yes, I have had both shots. JOHN YANG: From what you can tell, this skepticism 
among -- that the polling is capturing among   people who identify as white evangelicals, does 
this have anything to do with religious beliefs? REV. RUSSELL MOORE: No, this doesn't have 
anything to do with religious beliefs. It's instead about the mistrust and distrust 
that's evident in American society right now.   And, plus, I think some of it has to do 
with the fact that we have been isolated   from one another in lots of ways for over a 
year. And much of the way that misinformation   and disinformation gets combated is with 
people in conversation with one another. And that's why lots of us are doing what we can 
to say, vaccination is not only something that's   acceptable for Christians; it's something we ought 
to thank God that we have the technology for,   because it's going to get us back to doing 
the things that we need to do quicker. JOHN YANG: We reached out to some 
evangelicals in our viewership   to ask them about their 
attitudes towards the vaccines. One person we heard from is Billy Bryan. 
He's 49 years old, a teacher in Memphis,   Tennessee. He said he's young and 
healthy and that, in his view,   what he sees as the potential risks of 
the vaccine outweigh the risks of COVID. Let's take a look at what he says. BILLY BRYAN, Tennessee: My real hesitancy, though, 
is, I just don't really want to see the government   or anybody force people to do something that those 
people feel like is not in their best interests. Again, if people are comfortable with 
it, I think the more the merrier.   But it does seem like a logical decision to old 
off, at least to me individually, at this time. JOHN YANG: How typical is that, is what he 
just had to say? And how do you respond to it? REV. RUSSELL MOORE: Well, I think we have to make   very clear the government isn't 
forcing people to get the vaccine. Instead, this is something that's 
in not only our own best interests,   but also in that of our neighbors. We have 
really good scientific data on the vaccines.   And I think some of the hesitancy that we saw 
in that clip may be overcome just as people   start to see their neighbors being vaccinated 
and to see the fact that this isn't scary. This is, in fact, something that's helpful, 
and helpful to protect the people who are the   most vulnerable around us. So it's 
not just about protecting oneself. JOHN YANG: The people we heard from 
also said -- and this is obviously   a small sample -- but they said that their 
pastors in their churches aren't encouraging   them to get the vaccine. They say it's 
up to them. It's a personal decision. Do you think pastors and churches 
should be encouraging it? REV. RUSSELL MOORE: Well, I think 
there are a lot of pasters who   are. They're doing vaccination 
drives in their congregations. They're helping people to understand 
what can be gained. So, for instance,   many evangelical churches have 
vacation Bible school every summer,   to say, we will be able to gathering together for 
vacation Bible school, to do mission trips, to do   youth community outreach, and so forth, 
and to minister to the elderly among us,   who are often the most isolated in assisted living 
facilities and nursing homes and other places. We want to get those grandmothers and 
grandfathers together with their grandchildren.   And so I think talking about the positive 
aspects of vaccination is the way to go,   rather than seeking to scold people. JOHN YANG: Is there -- for instance, when you 
got your vaccine, did you -- was there any   backlash or any negative reaction 
from friends and other pastors? REV. RUSSELL MOORE: Not from friends and 
other pastors. There's always going to be   some people online. And I think a lot of this is 
driven by social media, where   people are going to suggest, oh, well, 
this is part of some dark conspiracy,   or this is going to get someone sick. 
And we have adequate data on all of that. And that's one of the reasons why one of the 
things that I did early on was to do a Webinar   with Francis Collins, director of the National 
Institutes of Health, just going through every   conceivable sort of conspiracy theory and every 
conceivable sort of fear to counter those things. And so I think there are some people who are not   anti-vaccine. They just hear some of the rumbles 
going on around on social media, and they wonder,   is this all right? Is this safe? Many of 
them, I think, will eventually come around. JOHN YANG: Francis Collins, of course, a Christian 
himself, a very fervent Christian himself. REV. RUSSELL MOORE: Yes. JOHN YANG: Is -- I take it from what you're 
saying that a government push to try to   reach evangelical Christians 
could actually backfire. REV. RUSSELL MOORE: Well, it 
could if it's too heavy-handed. I think that the emphasis ought to be on what's 
possible, if we get vaccinated in large numbers,   the way we actually can get back to 
-- we disagree on so many things in   American life right now. And we're at 
each other's throats on so many things. But there are some things that we actually 
can agree on. And part of that is,   we want to be together again. We want to be 
able to get as close back to normal as we can.   And that's probably especially true for 
people who are religious communities,   because we believe we ought 
to be congregated together. And so I think emphasizing the 
positive is the best way to go. JOHN YANG: The Reverend Russell Moore of the 
Southern Baptist Convention, thank you very much. REV. RUSSELL MOORE: Thank you."

489,e7l7j2r6cFM,"If You Get The Moderna COVID Vaccine, This Will Happen To You","Ever since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, people have been waiting for a vaccine to get developed, and there are thankfully a few that are now available to us. They will all do the job of protecting you from coronavirus, obviously, but if you’re planning to get the vaccine developed by Moderna, you probably want to know what others have experienced.

Some people don’t get side effects at all, while some get them for a short while, and the good news is that there are ways to treat them. Let’s take a look at some things that will happen if you get the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19.

Read Full Article: https://www.thelist.com/375777/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-take-the-moderna-covid-19-vaccine/",2021-04-09,41312,319,292,UCJ7dtuZhjFSJvb_CZjWJkng," Thanks to science, we now have several COVID-19
vaccines available to us, including Moderna's vaccine. While this is extremely exciting news, you
likely have some questions about the shot. Here's what happens to you after you get the
Moderna vaccine. The whole point of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine
is that it gives you immunity against COVID-19, as noted by the CDC. But how exactly does it work? It starts with the mRNA in the shot, which
is basically a guide for your body's cells; it teaches them how to make a ""spike protein,""
which is what the coronavirus uses to infect you. Dr. Bethany Moore, a professor of internal
medicine, explained to Michigan Health, ""Once inside the cell, the mRNA from the vaccine
is taken up by your ribosomes and translated into many copies of the spike protein."" After that, your cells dissolve the mRNA and
the spike protein is released from the cell. Then, Moore says the immune system responds
further. ""Dendritic cells are patrolling and will come
in contact with the antigen that they haven't seen before and raise the alarm, travel to
a lymph node, find the right T and B cells and activate them."" And then, the hope is that those cells start
creating antibodies, eventually rendering you immune to COVID-19. If you experienced increased anxiety, depression,
or hopelessness during the coronavirus pandemic, you're most definitely not alone. According to Stanford University, we were
all more susceptible to mental health issues during that time. Fortunately, there's a bright, shining light
at the end of the tunnel, according to psychiatrist Dr. Manish Sapra. In an article he wrote for Northwell Health,
he said, ""The arrival of the COVID vaccine was a critical
step in the healing process for every single one of us. While it will take weeks for full protection
to take effect, and with herd immunity still far off, there is one immediate effect that
everyone can and should grasp on to now - hope."" We're talking about real, concrete, and serious
hope that things are on the precipice of changing. Sapra continued, ""Rather than just a wish, hope is a belief
that things will get better. The vaccine enables all of us to believe firmly
that we're going to get out of this, and that recovery is real."" Chances are you've probably heard people talking
about how they react to the Moderna vaccine against COVID-19. So what exactly can you personally expect? According to vaccine expert Dr. Katie Passaretti,
it's probably not as bad as you may imagine. She shared with WBTV's Good Question podcast, ""I felt fine after the shot but I did get
tired later in the day, and I think just typically when you get a shot, your arm gets sore. I just thought it was a little bit longer
than when I get a normal shot."" Given Passaretti's personal experience,you
can prepare for pretty much the same thing. She continued, ""The most common side effects are pain at
the site of injection. With all of the vaccines, especially with
the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, you can feel fatigued, have low-grade fevers, feel a little
achy and a little run down."" One thing that you may be seriously curious
about is why you need two shots of the Moderna vaccine against COVID-19, four weeks apart. Well, in order to help your body create the
strongest immunity possible, that second dose is needed to supplement the first. Be mindful, though, that you might feel worse
after your second shot than you did your first. Dr. Bethany Moore told Michigan Health, ""Because you already have antibodies on-board
from the first dose, you're going to get a little bit more robust immune response the
second time. At the same time, you are boosting the immune
response to be bigger, better, and faster and really locking in the memory of it."" While you may be tempted to skip your second
shot due to the side effects, don't do it! For as unpleasant as that immune response
is, that means your body is working to build an amazing defense against a seriously nasty
virus that's killed millions of people. Trust us, it's worth the pain. Speaking of unpleasant side effects and ways
to manage them, can you take NSAIDs after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine? While you may not feel like you need to after
the first dose, for some, that second shot really can be a doozy. To that end, is it safe to take pain relievers? The short answer is yes, you can take NSAIDs
after you get the Moderna vaccine, as noted by The New York Times. According to vaccine expert Dr. Paul Offit,
there's no harm in taking a pain reliever if you really need to, but you shouldn't take
it for a preventative reason or if you can get by without it. You'll want to avoid taking NSAIDs before
your shot, as there's a chance that might blunt the immune response. However, don't stress too much if you already
did. Dr. Offit says, ""You should feel reassured that you'll have
enough of an immune response that you'll be protected, especially for vaccines that are
this good."" For all of the chatter about how bad the side
effects of the Moderna vaccine against COVID-19 are, there are indeed some folks who won't
experience any of them. And while that certainly sounds pleasant,
does it mean the vaccine didn't work for you? According to immunologist Dr. Bali Pulendran,
the answer to that question is no, and he explained why using a metaphor while chatting
with Pioneer Press. ""The primary vaccination taught the easy stuff
to the immune system, like in primary school. Does that mean that the primary school education
wasn't really an education, because it didn't really cause you pain? No."" Pulendran went on to compare the second dose
to secondary school. ""It got into calculus and physics. But still, the immune system went through
it, and that was really great. In the end, you had the full education. That's exactly how vaccines work."" So don't worry if your vaccination process
was a breeze, and consider yourself lucky. If you've already received your Moderna COVID-19
vaccine, you know that after you take the shot, you have to wait for 15 to 30 minutes
before you're allowed to leave. Curious as to why that is? According to the CDC, there's a small chance
that you might have an anaphylactic reaction to the coronavirus vaccine. That's the same kind of reaction that people
who are allergic to bees have when they're stung by one, as noted by Healthline. Symptoms include everything from hives and
nausea to confusion and loss of consciousness - and even death. No wonder health professionals keep a close
eye on people post-vaccine! However, this kind of reaction can be treated
effectively with an EpiPen, and all vaccination sites are required to have the proper supplies
on hand. You're in good hands. This one might surprise you, but your reaction
to the Moderna vaccine against COVID-19 can vary due to your gender. According to The New York Times, women are
more likely than men to report and experience side effects of the coronavirus immunization. This is the case for other vaccines as well,
including the flu shot, the MMR vaccine, and hepatitis vaccines. The reasons for this have to do with women's
estrogen levels, which provoke an immune response post-vaccination, whereas testosterone has
the opposite effect. Additionally, a large portion of the genes
associated with immunity are on the X chromosome, and most women have two of them; the majority
of men only have one. That's also why women are more susceptible
to autoimmune disease. Women are also far more likely than men to
have an anaphylactic response to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, too. In fact, almost all of those occurrences happened
in women. Another factor that may affect whether you
exhibit side effects? Your age. ""Younger people may have a more robust immune
system, a stronger immune response, and that leads to more of the side effects."" In order for us to achieve herd immunity,
a significantly large portion of the population has to be vaccinated, according to the Mayo
Clinic. Only then will things really start getting
back to normal. To that end, it's important for as many adults
to get vaccinated as possible, which will in turn protect those who can't receive vaccines
against COVID-19. That includes people who are allergic to any
of the ingredients in the coronavirus immunization, as noted by the Cleveland Clinic. But if you just have garden variety allergies
like to pollen or pet dander, you'll probably be fine taking the COVID-19 shot. Of course, if you're not sure, the best thing
to do is talk to your doctor. One big question that COVID-19 survivors may
have is whether or not they should get the coronavirus immunization, including the Moderna
COVID-19 vaccine. After all, if you've already been sick, don't
you have the antibodies to protect yourself against a subsequent infection? Well, it's complicated. According to the CDC, you should still get
a COVID-19 vaccination if you've already had the coronavirus. Why? We still don't know how long the immunity
acquired from a COVID-19 infection lasts, and the vaccines have all proven to be effective. Why not get all the protection you can, right? The only bad news is that COVID-19 survivors
may have stronger immune responses from coronavirus immunizations, as noted by The New York Times. And if you have an exceptionally strong response
to the first shot, that could be an indicator that you had COVID-19 and didn't know it at
the time. So schedule a few days off from work if you
need it, as you might find yourself pretty wiped out. One of the biggest questions that concerned
folks might be wondering is this: do the coronavirus vaccines, including Modern's offering, actually
give you COVID-19? It's not an unreasonable assumption, given
that the vaccines have a dead form of the COVID-19 germ in them. That's how they help to build immunity. However, this is one of the biggest myths
out there about all of the COVID-19 immunizations. According to the CDC, none of the vaccines
available can give you a case of coronavirus, so put your fears about that to rest. As we've established, you may feel sick after
getting vaccinated, but that immune response is vastly different from a severe case of
COVID-19. Bear in mind that you aren't fully protected
from COVID-19 until two weeks after receiving your second shot of Moderna's vaccine. So, as noted by the Mayo Clinic, it's possible
that you can catch coronavirus just before or just after getting your shot. By now, you're probably aware that there are
three different COVID-19 vaccines on the U.S. market: Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson. So how does Moderna's shot stack up against
the other two? Is it the best one that you can get? According to STAT, the Moderna vaccine was
proven to be 94.1 percent effective at protecting your body from the coronavirus. That's pretty close to the 95 percent that
the Pfizer vaccine accomplished, and the 66 percent efficacy of the one-dose Johnson & Johnson
vaccine. Pretty heartening numbers all around! In short: ""The good news is that the Moderna and Pfizer
mRNA vaccines are very similar in that they're both effective and safe."" Bear in mind, however, that it's not like
you can pick and choose what brand of the COVID-19 vaccine you'll receive. Essentially, you'll be presented with what's
available depending on where you are, so you'd be best to just accept whatever option you
get. If you've been lucky enough to get your first
or even second shot of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, you're no doubt full of hope that
things are finally getting better. But you also might be wondering how long this
round of shots will be effective. While there's not a ton of data out there
yet, infectious disease expert Joel Ernst has an idea. He told Pioneer Press, ""Right now it looks like the 'half life' of
the antibodies after vaccination are at least a year, and probably longer than that."" It's also possible that you'll need subsequent
doses of Moderna's coronavirus immunization, as noted by Ernst. ""If needed, vaccine 'boosters' could help
in two ways. They can recharge the immune response against
the original virus. They can also help fend off a new viral variant
that could render existing vaccines ineffective."" Check out one of our newest videos right here! Plus, even more List videos about your favorite

#GMB #PiersMorgan #SusannaReid",2020-11-11,135658,667,7,UCq18eeL7D9Vd8DhjMcLh9QQ, the first of 40 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine could be rolled out as early as next month across the uk but health secretary matt hancock says immunization won't be compulsory the vaccine could prevent 90 of people getting covered and given the devastating effect of the virus should vaccination be compulsory for all according to a twitter poll almost 36 percent say it should be 64 disagree with forced vaccination in a yougov poll we found 66 percent will be willing to have the vaccine 14 wouldn't and 24 20 were unsure well we're joined now by glenn de shields who is a vaccine trial volunteer from texas and also by journalist eve pollard who says it should be against the law not to take the vaccine as it's the only way to get the world back to normal former model coveted survivor linda lucadi says nobody should be forced to take it and is adamant she won't and dr gabriel scally professor in public health at bristol university as well um and dr hillary is here of course as well but first glenn were you a guinea pig in the pfizer trial yes yes that was a gimmick so you were either glenn as i understand it you were either in the control group or in the vaccinated group and i'm not sure whether you know which one you were in you can tell um the the placebo was a saltwater shot which provoked basically no response from your body um i was i would compare it to a mild hangover i guess are the the uh side effects i had in uh injection site pain that lasted probably about two or three days um i talked to a lot of my doctors uh second dose i had similar response uh and i did take an antibody test after that second dose and i do have antibodies now and i've tested for coronavirus multiple times and always have been negative and glenn glenn for those you know obviously it's very exciting news for the world and it's thanks to actually to people like you who've helped us get to the stage so thank you very much for your public service and to all those who've been taking part in the trials but for those who may be wary of having the vaccine what would your message be get it get it as quick as you can get it this is the only way to end it a vaccine being produced doesn't do us any good everybody getting vaccinated ends it so i would tell everybody my piece of advice would be get it done and get it done as soon as they allow you to get it and the worst that happened to you having been injected with the vaccine was you felt like you had a bit of a hangover correct i had a headache and i was fatigued that was the only thing 24 hours sounds like a normal wednesday to me glenn people are concerned about longer term side effects but currently you haven't experienced anything negative nothing i'm two months uh after the last dose and uh nothing i'm as good as ever and i don't have the corona violence glenn it's great to talk to you thank you for joining us staying up so late because he's sent a really important message there and you're quite right you can have a vaccine if people don't take it pointless uh really appreciate you joining us it's good to eat pollard eve you feel strongly the vaccine should be mandatory for people obviously that's quite a controversial position many people say well i don't want to be forced to do anything why do you feel that nobody wants to be forced to do anything like being in lockdown by being i look at shops and i think if it's too crowded i'm not going in there um it's common sense the way we got rid of polio the way we got rid of whooping cough is it was it's not mandatory but it more or less is because people had them at the time when people would accept them pregnant women now get an injection for whooping cough so their baby never gets it um if we don't do it there'll be a football match or there'll be a music festival or something and it will rise again so number one we'll all be in lockdown because we'll be terrified of getting it number two foreign countries won't let us in it's common sense we've been so lucky they've discovered a vaccine they've worked their brains out since this covid19 you know got into our world if we don't all have it it'll come back and it'll haunt us and there'll be little flare-ups here and there and people will avoid certain places and avoid certain towns it's got to be mandatory professor scully you're an expert in uh public health um i mean evolve makes a very good point you know there are some things at the moment which are mandatory lockdown's mandatory wearing masks in enclosed spaces is mandatory um if everybody had the vaccine we could emerge from all of it couldn't we well we don't yet know how good the vaccine is at stopping the transmission of the virus we know it stops people getting symptoms but they may still get affected and may transmit the virus so we don't know yet how protective it is but i know of no country in the world that actually uh makes vaccination mandatory in the citizens places like the states in schools for example in a lot of the us your children have to be vaccinated before they can go to a public school and that's one thing but forcing people to have a needle stuck into them and an and a solution injected into them it's not the way we do things we get rid of these uh diseases because we see it as a collective responsibility and we do it voluntarily it's like blood donation it's one of these things we do and we do it to protect the small proportion of people who for whatever medical reason good medical reason can't have the vaccination and we should be relying on that community effort this time around as well okay linda lussady i'm quite surprised by your position because you were so ill with kobe you thought you were dying at one stage you were so ill you feel strongly that you're not going to have the vaccine and you don't think people should i mean the analogy i would give is when we get in a car you have to have regulations to protect your safety like wearing a seat belt it and we all do that it's mandated it's done to stop us dying what is the ideological difference between that and taking a vaccine well i'm not against people having the vaccine and i'm sure the majority of people will have the vaccine my concern is that not enough testing has been done i mean i know you had a scientist chris smith on the other day and he was actually saying that people that had coveted this vaccination may not you know may have side effects that uh derogatory to the person and as most of the nation aren't sure if they've had it or not um a lot of people might become ill because of it i do think the majority of people will have it you know will have the vaccine and i'm really excited that there is one but i don't feel that there's been enough research so far for people like me to have their vaccine well that's a crucial point let's go to dr hillary the question mark is people know it takes years to get a vaccine normally and for many things we've never got a vaccine we still don't have one for hiv for example after 30 years of trying how is it we've got so fast to a vaccine and why should we trust it well it's been carried out on 50 000 people and in six different countries and all the data suggests that it's very effective 90 effective and with a very good safety profile uh covid19 is a serious illness it kills people uh and this vaccine looks like a really good candidate amongst many other candidates for helping to protect not just the individual but the population at large professor scalia are you convinced about um the safety of it considering the short time scale now i think there are lots of people i mean there are certain anti-vaxxers who are concerned about it so let's put that to one side but there are people who are very supportive like linda lucadi who know exactly what covid does to you but very supportive of vaccinations but might have concerns about the accelerated speed of this particular product well it is very important that the vaccine goes through properly all the stages you know as dr hilly said it's gone through the trials it has a profile of minor side effects no major problems it has to go through the regulators yet and be approved and and that's the safety thing really but when you look at the uh the symptoms of covet 19 and the deaths from covet 19 and long covet and the possibility that there will be even more um disease emerging in the future the vaccine looks a really really good bet and the difference between this and and seat belts is no one's forcing you to drive a car if you don't want to wear seat belts you don't have to drive a car it's a completely different matter forcing people to be injected and i i don't think that's the way we do things right you want to jump in finally yeah i think there's two important things to say firstly that you can't make this compulsory because uh if you vaccinate people against their wishes it's an assault on the patience never been done before against the lord can't do that what i prefer is encouragement persuasion and education if we can persuade people this is a valuable vaccine to have it protects the individual protects the nhs it protects society at large then i think we'll get somewhere i would say look if you don't want to have it fine but you're not allowed to fly because why should other countries take you if you haven't had the vaccine yeah well other countries and i would go further and say actually okay then you sign a waiver that if you don't have the vaccine and you get covered you don't get nhs treatment job done thanks to our panel really appreciate you all joining us this morning you

496,GaXJlDvZcjs,Andrew Bridgen and Fraser Myers clash in fiery debate on Covid vaccine harms,"There was a time in history when the term ""anti-vaxxer"" or the phrase ""gone down a rabbit hole"" were consigned mainly to websites dedicated to conspiracy theories.

But since the pandemic, an entire community of people who doubt the efficacy and safety of the covid-19 vaccine has emerged.

They point to data around vaccine harms to strengthen their calls for an inquiry into the role big Pharma played in the rollout.

But others argue that the millions who are vaccinated, and go about living their lives as normal, suggest that the extent of the adverse effects has been exaggerated. 

Spiked columnist Fraser Myers entered the argument with an article entitled ""the delusions of Andrew Bridgen"", referring to the MP who was expelled from the Conservative Party for what he called ‘raising concerns’ about vaccine safety.

The pair joined Andrew Doyle on GB News in a fiery debate.

data around vaccine harms to strengthen their calls for an inquiry into the role big Pharma has played during the rollout but others argue that the millions who are vaccinated and go about living their lives as normal suggest that the extent of the adverse effects has been exaggerated now earlier this week spiked columnist Fraser Myers entered the argument with an article entitled The delusions of Andrew bridgen referring to the MP who was expelled from the conservative party for what he called raising concerns about vaccine safety I'm absolutely delighted to welcome both Andrew bridge in and Fraser Myers to free speech Nation thank you both and uh thank you both ever so much for coming in particularly because I think it's very difficult it takes a lot of Integrity To Face your critics in the flesh but also to face those who you have criticized In the Flesh and I think it's really great that you're both here I'm going to come to you first phrase because you wrote the article um can you tell us a little bit about the article and why you felt you needed to write it yes I've been worried for a lot for a while about the rise of anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists and for a while at least it seemed as if this was just a thing on the internet you know maybe you could ignore it maybe it's a bit harmless just a lot of a fringe but a very vocal Fringe but now we have an MP among that ranks you know that's Andrew bridge and seeing right here um Andrew will say he's just raising concerns about vaccine safety he'll say he's just asking questions that others don't ask but actually you know a lot of what he says is really really indefensible so for instance he has compared the vaccine rollout to a crime against humanity uh possibly the worst since the Holocaust he has said that the pandemic is planned he said that the virus and the vaccine were developed in by the United States Department of of defense and that we can soon expect our politicians and medical officials to be arrested he said that the vaccine harms so bad that they are the cause of the majority of excess deaths in the UK now that would mean that they're more dangerous than covid more dangerous than the 7 million long um NHS waiting list now if those aren't vaccine anti-vaxx conspiracy theories then I don't know what is well let's ask Andrew bridgen himself what do you make of that specific specific allegations uh guilty as charged and I've got the science that will back all of that up um what would we know about the the vaccine rollout um that there's more yellow carved reports of harms from the novel experimental mRNA vaccines or the covid-19 vaccines then there has been for all conventional vaccines for the last 40 years figures from Florida um 1 600 increase in reports of vaccine side effects and the rollout of the covid-19 vaccines only a 400 increase in vaccination 400 doesn't go into 16 here it's just not how it's going to work so Andrew four times the year four times the problems with these vaccines they've never gone through phase three trials they are experimental and we were rolling them out to Children there's no children and healthy children uh young children that ever died of covert but there's a clear side effects from the vaccines why are we doing this Fraser is is it are these experimental uh no they're not experimental they're not gene therapy either which is like a common uh thing actually yeah they're not because they don't actually alter people's DNA so they're not classed as gene therapy they're not experimental because they have gone through clinical trials the phase three trials have concluded so it's just that you're not denying that that people have had adversive well all medicines have side effects and and no medicine is entirely 100 effective but what we're talking about here is you you know you you point so say for instance let's talk about the yellow card scheme for instance this is a way of people reporting the adverse reactions they've had from the vaccine now the implication from Andrew is that this is a crime against humanity that these people are practically at death's door actually the vast majority of these reports are to do with people having sore arms people feeling dizzy people feeling nauseous not the kind of thing that is going to have long-term adverse Health impacts so Andrew grossly exaggerated do you take Fraser's point that sometimes these things are conflated you know the harms that are lesser and the harmful okay so they're just normal drugs like all the others and they've been fully tested in that case why do the vaccine manufacturers acquire full immunity from the harms that their products may cause before they'll release them India is very shortly going to be the largest population in the world the biggest market for for drugs in the world um Pfizer have never rolled out any of their vaccine their experimental vaccines in India because the Indian government won't give them immune from prosecution for the Harms these are not new drugs that they've been now rolled out for over two years billions and billions of doses have gone out but they still require that immune from prosecution how can they be safe Fraser well as you say yes they've been being rolled out over the past two years and we just haven't seen anything like the scale of farms that you're talking about and and conversely we have seen that they have saved lives I mean back in 2021 uh when the rollout was you know getting underway you could see how these vaccines completely severed the the link between covert cases and covert deaths I mean it was just undeniable so I find it really really disturbing that someone can take something as brilliant as these vaccines you know this is incredible human scientific achievement and basically trash them as evil as part of some kind of plot I don't know whether you think it's to make money let's be fair to you Andrew because I think you should address that directly do you believe that it is a plot that the vaccines I think I think people have profited from from these immensely um yes yes I do but my degree is in biological biology biochemistry genetics and a bit of virology I mean what are your qualifications in science to make the did you read any of the 32 papers I posted when I gave my first speech in December 12th last year on the 13th of December that was all backed up with 32 scientific papers not a breath of it from the mainstream media because they couldn't take it apart the science was unarguable at that time the government wanted to vaccinate babies they'd pull back from that to only the over 50s and the immunocompromised and after my speech on the 17th of March when I showed the number needed to vaccinate with a booster to keep one person out of Hospital which in I think the 40 to 49 year olds was 932 000 with one in 800 having an adverse event 1100 people in hospital keep one person out infected with Kobe that's huge cost to the taxpayer then they pushed it to only the over 75s if if what I was talking about wasn't scientifically approval why did the government I suppose people are interested in you know obviously we can talk about the statistics in the various studies and that's very important that we have open discussions about that I think some of the concerns that have been raised and what probably just called Free Speech Nations I'm raising concerns legitimate concerns and growing concerns by the public and if you can't do that in Parliament where can you but I suppose it's the it's the idea am I suggesting though that when you said it's when it's the plot element the idea that it's it's a kind of well you're changing the terrain of the argument constantly yeah you know you're saying it's like effectively comparing it's the Holocaust to other places in other places on the James telling poll podcast you said that the you know the mandatory vaccinations for nurses was like the Nazis you know how many scientists that's against the Nuremberg convention it's not to say that these are a bit Andrew do you think do you think that the land just leaving aside the actual substance of the argument but the language the idea of invoking the Nazism smoking the Holocaust that that's a legitimate criticism isn't it to say that maybe that's not a sensible I was recruiting a paper from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem but you agree a Jewish you equated that approvingly you didn't quote it to say oh my god look look look at this it can't have been there because I'll let you into a secret Andrew I've never had the codes to my own Twitter my tweets are all moderated by my staff and have been for the last 12 years and that tweet was moderated approved and posted by my conservative Association chairman right so I was still throwing out the conservative party well you know I'm not trying to I think everyone should have complete free speech in terms of what they say that's not what I'm saying all I was suggesting is I think what Fraser's article was saying is that some of some of the rhetoric might not help the cause that you yourself are advancing I think that's I think there's a lot of willful blindness out there um the the fact is Big Pharma is a huge huge lobbying power in 86 of the mhra the medicines and Healthcare regulator agency which authorizes these medicines is funded by a big Pharma the The Joint Committee on vaccine Mission and immunization in their personal Declarations of interest that declared over a billion pounds of investments in big Pharma this we've had our Regulators captured uh and that's that's not healthy Fraser you can understand why some people are skeptical about all of this you know because there haven't been answers to all of the questions that people wanted I think that you know we lived through a really terrible period during the covert lockdowns I think there were a lot of terrible terrible mistakes I completely opposed the lockdown I thought it was a mad kind of authoritarian um experiment essentially um and I think that has yeah people you know often people don't see [ __ ] up where they're you know or they see conspiracy where there's [ __ ] up yes and people are you can you know the only problem with saying it's [ __ ] up not conspiracy what you've got to bear in mind is that all the governments Across the Western World the so-called democracies and others made exactly the same [ __ ] up at exactly the same time on exactly the same issue well they followed each other and they were kind of panicked into these decisions and as someone who is critical of the lockdown and as someone who desperately does not want this thing to happen again you know for someone like Andrew to essentially it's you know spells these are conspirations isn't the best thing we could do is find out who paid for and developed the kobit 19 virus in which labs and hold them criminally to account because that was that was not a natural virus I mean the spike protein a big chunk of it has come out of HIV and four of the amino acids which is 12 base pairs of mRNA in the spike protein the American government have got a patent on it's not in any of the coronavirus virus in the world why can't we find out where it's come from and who's funded it and hold them criminal into account to make sure everyone gets a message so you don't do this again to us it's really important for people to realize that what Andrew says sounds scientific it's kind of pseudo-scientific it's you know listing all the listing all these papers misrepresenting the data and you know essentially it's just it is a conspiracy theory it has no basis in reality there's nothing on the papers well you can send me as many papers as you like but you know a lot of these are completely they're completely outlier but Andrew in terms of vaccine safety and things like let's try and bring it down to something specific because you mentioned Andrew that you want to follow the money and you want to find out who's been funding what what America's involvement and you did tweet to say that you had heard that the vaccine and the virus were developed by the dod at Fort debt trick yep do you stand by that because you didn't provide them the Tweet any evidence but I I traveled out under my my own powers at Christmas and New Year and spent the whole time in Washington speaking to scientists and elected representatives over there and they confirmed everything about that but do you understand why people are concerned about that because when you tweet something that's so alarmist and extreme but there's no evidence there for people to see four of the amino acids in the spike protein the American government had a patent on and they gave it in 2014 to Modern but you suggest that the VA the virus originated at Fort Detrick that can't be right um I think I think a lot of the work was done there before it was shipped out by Anthony fauci to Wuhan and he funded the final the final research what I don't know is whether it was released by accident or on purpose I don't know how we never find that out I'm happy Andrew to discredit himself live by saying all this rubbish it's just you need to you know wake up a little bit this is not real you've fallen down a real rabbit hole here and it's you know it's very worrying that you're a member of parliament I think it's quite scary that you know British public are being represented by Anthony funded it funded it that's all come out in Congressional and Senate hearings under oath in America that you watch the hearings it's all there the the former head of the CDC said that uh that's what happened at Anthony fauci funded it but that doesn't that sorry they've not confirmed that the virus was made by America by the department he took it from him he took it from America and and did the research in Wu you haven't like I would love to see the evidence of the virus being created at Fort debt trip because it sounds like a variation of an old conspiracy theory about AIDS being funded or created at Fort Detrick that was an old conspiracy theory it's not a conspiracy theorist the the Barack Obama eleven days before he handed over to Trump made gain of function research legal in America again why would he do that so the thing why would you do that take a grain of Truth where it's like we you know perhaps the virus leaked from a lab for instance it could have been made in a lab and then you extrapolate it to say that there is a conspiracy do you think it was made was it made in a level or not no there are there are side effects of covid and then take that to say it's killing millions of side effects to the vaccine then say if I want to give the people we could talk about this forever I want to give you a final word Andrew on that do you have anything else to come back to Fraser on well it doesn't matter how long it takes the truth will come come out um it will come out who's funded this eventually and it will come out about the side effects from the facts unfortunately we know we at last week's excess death figures for I think second week of March 22 above the five-year average 2540 excess deaths they're not statistics they're real people and it's going to continue unfortunately and we need we can't have a debate in Parliament about the excess deaths how can that be why can't we have a debate about excess deaths oh we absolutely should have a debate but I think you know the truth is not going to come out the the vaccines are causing it we don't even talk about it I don't think we're going to agree here but I do appreciate you both coming on to have such a robust and open conversation about it so thank you to Andrew bridge and Fraser Myers

#covid #medicine #research",2024-03-11,19695,2014,615,UCSxeKmlI8XLrI1eMaqqM-kg, hi good evening I'm Dr Philip McMillan thank you for joining me I've been following the covid story since early 2020 my focus has always been around autoimmunity and so I look at it through a different Paradigm so whenever I speak rarely am I going to be following the narrative so if you expect the narrative this is not the place to come so before I start I'll be looking at this very unusual case of a patient who took over 200 vaccines this is the paper in the lcet and I'll be tying this critically to why it is that I think that the boosted keep on getting reinfected and I'll be using the understanding about IGA antibodies to try and make sense of what is going on so before I start I'd just like to remind remind everyone that if you are interested in courses in more information please look at the links below and that's where we try and share as much as we can about what we see from a different angle so join us on this journey research Journey um be open be interested and I'm sure you'll find valuable information so let's get back to this case here this gentleman in Germany took 27 covid vaccines and what's interesting about this is this has been almost a promotion that goodness safe and effective and I'm thinking this is like the worst example you could ever use to it just doesn't make any sense so this is Gaby that was talking about this hyper vaccinated gentleman and they were focused on what happens when you receive hundreds of doses of the same vaccine and as I said quite a number of people are saying wow this just shows how safe it is but I'm thinking we don't know what are the longer term implications please don't imagine that this is ever a good thing but they did indicate from the paper current Research indicates that a three-d dose vaccination coupled with regular topup vaccines for the vulnerable groups remains a favored approach there is no indication that more vaccines are required so that's what they have said from the paper from the people who had done the paper but as I said if you as long as you're not following a narrative and you actually are trying to understand the science you know where to unpick the data this is why I've said don't tell me what I need to know just give me the data let me interpret it and try and make sense of it and so this is what I'll be quickly doing here so that you can understand so again let's go back to the paper and in this case what they have was a gentleman in Germany who for whatever reason he probably was extremely scared from the um from the the the information going out about the pandemic he was 62 years old he deliberately and for private rece reasons received 217 vaccines against Saras kov 2 within a period of 29 months that's incredible I mean for one I don't even know how it was possible that he got that many without people noticing you know when you have an you can't even get vitamin some kind of of normal therapeutic from the pharmacy because you would need a prescription it just shows you how far the system was pushing this where there was no concern about people who took too much I guarantee you he won't be the only one there'll be many of them out there what are the implications what does it mean longterm we have no no idea and just thinking that it should kill somebody within a few months or a few years of taking it doesn't make any sense that's not how disease works but let's get back to what I think is very important here as I said I unpicked the data and so in order to understand what I've been unpicking you have to look at the supplementary data so this is the supplementary data from the paper this is the lanet and you can see here they then add additional information for people to be able to make sense of it so that's the bit that I was interested in the supplementary appendix and it then rolls down it gives you limitations supplementary methods and so on and it gives you a bit more information about the individual as well as what they were studying and how they were sampling it so this document is often times very very important and it's a critical part of understand understanding what is going on so why is it that I have got here in this blue section this is likely to be the explanation as to why the boosted keep getting infected why would I say that it's because one of the really simple questions is that if you understand how the immune system works the First wall that any virus or bacteria or fungus has to get through is the mucosa layer it is very sophisticated it's not just random it's only when it penetrates that mucosa layer that you can then get infection so this is how the immune system works this is an example of how you have um here this is the mucosal barrier these are the cells and they are producing mucus on top of it to try and block it's a physical barrier to prevent bacteria these here in brown are bacteria from getting in to be able to get through this wall this wall is very important and on this side here I've put a few viruses here this is a virus these are bacteria and what you have to notice here this blue thing that looks like a bone represents secretory IGA and this is what the immune system produces in the mucosal barrier because it defends the body even before the micro M microbe gets in or the virus and you can see here this is a very sophisticated system it gets the antigens this t- cell is then stimulated it differentiates into more te- cells these te- cells then stimulate the B cells the B cells then become plasma secreting B cells to produce IGA they then move along and then they produce the IGA the IGA is then pushed out into the mucus and this is how the body will fight infection right at the front these are your pawns almost right at the front line if you play chess so these are your foot soldiers when you look at old moves they are the ones going first to defend the castle really important part of the immune system and what it will do is in this picture here it will then bind to the virus in terms of sasov 2 this is the virus here this represents the IGA coming it binds to it it then prevents the virus from entering it then gets picked up by other immune cells or it gets flushed out with the mucus you blow your nose or whatever and you get rid of virus so this is an integral part of the mucosal immune system so my question was always why are we seeing the boosted continually getting infected well because they were so busy looking at the benefits of over boosting somebody with 217 vaccines they did an important piece of data they looked at the control group that's a group of people who had three vaccines and they were comparing it to the person who had 217 what were the differences so this is now where it comes down to the data I've taken this from the supplementary data and if you are interested you can look at it but here is what it showing so in Black here represents the antibody level in the control group probably the average and you can see here that they had um between 10 to the 1 and 10 to the two times an anti-spike IGM in serum okay that's in the bloodstream you can see here that his IGM after 2117 doses was just a little bit higher but IGM is the early antibod so maybe that makes sense when you then go on now this is the anti-spike IGA so some of the IGA that is produced in the mucosa alining also gets in the serum and you can see here really interestingly the control group didn't have any not detected he had some again between 10 to the 1 and 10 to the 2 now this is the bit that I'd always predicted that was very interesting to me now look at this here this is Spike specific antibodies in saliva okay IA and technically therefore mucosa in the mucus in the mucosa lining for the control group none detected for IG but for the person who had taken 217 or at the time 215 his levels were significantly higher between 1.2 to 1.4 and this is probably why he didn't get covid infection because this remained High in his saliva for such a long period of time but as I said the answer that's really important is this in the control group who had three doses they had no IGG in their saliva no IG he didn't have it either and no IGA so what it indicates here is that for this person with the high IG in the saliva it means therefore that once his serum antibody level Falls he will have no antibodies in the saliva and most likely therefore in the mucosa it is no wonder then that we see these repeated infections the immune system is is no longer functioning as normal this is what I'm saying so think about this just look at this here and get get your head around this they're no longer producing IGA all that's happening is the mucus they're unable to fight at the front they have no soldiers there on the ground no wonder the virus is able to penetrate and this then causes recurrent infection listen as I said for those who are for following a narrative you'll take a look at that and say he didn't die from 217 vaccines that's great for those who are interested in the science this is very significant it has highlighted some really important points that we need to reflect on how then do we protect the vaccinated cohort who have been boosted who are not having an adequate mucosal response to the virus especially Omicron as it continues to spread what do we do down the line is it that they're suddenly going to start producing these antibodies we don't know but I think that ignoring these patterns or not even reflecting on them only focusing on what appears to be a narrative is it's very dangerous we are in very serious times the virus continues to circulate what are we going to do it's a risk to everybody around in highly vaccinated regions so again as I said if you're interested in more information that doesn't follow a narrative please click on the links below there's a lot more that we have to cover in this period of time so have a great evening and I look forward to sharing some more information with you in the near future thank [Music] you [Music]
