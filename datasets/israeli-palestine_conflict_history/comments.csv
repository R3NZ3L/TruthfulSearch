0,R0ftmf_Uv9A,No matter how many times these information gets thrown to our eyes. The ignorant will remain put a blind eye to the oppressed which is sad.
1,R0ftmf_Uv9A,"*To learn who RULES over you, simply find out who you are NOT allowed to CRITICIZE.*"
2,R0ftmf_Uv9A,"Say that part again: Jewish , Christian’s and Muslims were living peacefully till some Europeans came and then you make people refugees and take their land  also if you were trying to come live in someone’s house for any reason at least bring a plan that shares equally or give the owner 70 and take 30"
3,R0ftmf_Uv9A,Let peace prevail.
4,R0ftmf_Uv9A,Why start at 1946?
5,R0ftmf_Uv9A,"Thank's Ireland, for being consistent n vocal to supporting our Palestinian brothers🙏🙏, we from Indonesia really appreciate this🙏🙏"
6,R0ftmf_Uv9A,"This is not a  conflict, this is occupation."
7,R0ftmf_Uv9A,So sad. They were living in peace and now suffering for 7 decades 😢
8,R0ftmf_Uv9A,"What’s interesting and perhaps often missed is that Jews and Arabs were living peacefully together for many years in the Middle East before the State of Israel was created. 

Jews in the Middle East did not suffer problems with discrimination, however Jews in Europe did. It was the European Jews who agitated for the creation of the State of Israel, in which both Arabs as well as non-European Jews are considered inferior to the European Jews. We keep saying Israel is a Jewish state. It would be more accurate to say that it’s a “European Jewish” state, in which all who are not of European Jewish descent are discriminated against, in one way or another."
9,R0ftmf_Uv9A,What happened the video was removed and put again!!
10,Bno1m1zhIWs,Who else is here trying to understand what’s going on right now
11,Bno1m1zhIWs,Insane how the HISTORY channel of all places actually educated people about actual History and in a notably unbiased fashion.
12,Bno1m1zhIWs,"Finally. An objective concise summary with no religious,political,or racial agenda. Well done History channel."
13,Bno1m1zhIWs,Thank you for this excellent breakdown of the history. So many have never heard the total story. Your summation of the multigenerational conflict was well presented.
14,Bno1m1zhIWs,The best and most concise clip on explaining this conflict I have ever seen.  And in only six minutes.
15,Bno1m1zhIWs,This is the first video which has actually explained things thoroughly! Best way to understand a problem is go back to the original roots of the situation. Thank you for the insight.
16,Bno1m1zhIWs,Great Britain has caused so many problems through out history
17,Bno1m1zhIWs,"Here watching this in 2023... It's sad how it's just like a broken record at this point. So many innocent people dying just because of where they were born.... all over land, random religious beliefs and man made borders. I wish we could all just get along and share this gift of a planet together."
18,Bno1m1zhIWs,"I read a complete history once, like 800+ pages worth. But it’s such a complex and polarising history that relatively small/ brief events have had long lasting impact.
So absolutely I’m here for the refresh, like almost everyone."
19,Bno1m1zhIWs,WOW Insane how the HISTORY channel of all places actually educated people about actual History and in a notably unbiased fashion. Nice!
20,0anQIEeLonA,"Cool finally someone telling both sides of the story , the true history and in unbiased way. Nice video worth sharing"
21,0anQIEeLonA,An excellent presentation of how the Israel-Palestine conflict began. Very well written in a chronological order in simple English. Hope millions will watch this video. I expect more of this to come in the future. Good luck to you Priyanka.
22,0anQIEeLonA,"I've done some basic research on this subject over the years, but so much of what was presented in this video is new to me...I applaud the creators for giving such a concise and focused account, sharing each side's POV, giving us a much clearer view on the past and present situation 👏🏾👍🏾"
23,0anQIEeLonA,"As a Palestinian, I have always felt some bias from Indian media against us. But I have to be fair, you have done a good job summarizing the history of the conflict. Thanks"
24,0anQIEeLonA,"From someone who's a history buff, thank you for this unbiased reporting of history."
25,0anQIEeLonA,Thank you for explaining the reasons for this war from both sides so clearly and factual. I appreciate the history lesson.

That sent chills down my spine."
33,iRYZjOuUnlU,Would I be wrong in saying that England kind of botched this entire thing and kind of gets let off the hook for creating a lot of this conflict?
34,iRYZjOuUnlU,*”Unless something drastic happens - whatever comes next will be much worst”* famous last words and oh boy were you right 🥺🥺
35,iRYZjOuUnlU,What a great video. A lot of people my age blindly support one side or the other without actually knowing anything about the history at all

edit: In order to not ruin anyone's day, I want to clarify that both  the Israeli military and Hamas are in the wrong here. What I was trying to say with that quote was that Israel had no right to do what they did in Gaza and the West bank"
39,iRYZjOuUnlU,"My father was born in Haifa, which was then British Palestine, in 1944.  When he was 4 years old, my grandparents took him to England on holiday only to be refused back due to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.  So they had to settle and set up their life in the UK.  My grandparents were once part of the aristocracy and they ended up living on a council estate in Portsmouth.  It's strange to think that I am a product of war; I would not exist if that war had not broken out."
40,E4iygQ--7dk,"Another thing, when britain received he mandate over the region, it divided palestina into two part, the eastern part was given to the Hashemite family from Saudi arabia in exchange for their support in the first world war. This is how the state of jordan was created, which is actually part of palestina. Most of the Jordanians are palastinian."
41,E4iygQ--7dk,"A Brief History of the name Palestine and its derivative Adjective Palestinian:

 1.	Palestine is Judea, the Roman name for ‘Land of the Jews’ when the Roman Emperor Hadrian re-named this land as Palestina in 135 CE. Since then, it was never an Islamic State. [‘In the 2nd century CE, the Romans crushed the Jewish revolt and Judea was renamed Syria Palestina’ – Jewish Virtual Libr.]

2.	The Pre-Islamic Arabs were in the Roman armies and witnessed both Jerusalem’s destruction and the name change of Judea. [Flavius Josephus Wars, Book V, Ch 13, 4]. As well, the Quran mentions Israel as the land of the Jews. Thereby, the Muslim people would be fully aware Palestine referred to the Jews for 2,000 years.

3.	The historical archives of the Persians, Greeks, Romans, British, French and Americans refer to Palestine as the ‘historical homeland of the Jews’, not of the Muslim peoples. America’s early Presidents initiated Israel’s return prior to Britain and Herzl: “Restoring the Jews to their national home in Palestine is a noble dream. My emancipated hope is the restoring of the Jews to their nation home in Palestine” - President Abraham Lincoln to Canadian Zionist Wentworth Monk; 1863. 

4.	The term Palestine was introduced in the Hebrew Bible from the term Plishtim [‘Invaders’]. The Muslims disdained the name Palestine, as they do the term ‘Zionists’ today. In 1947, the Arabs virtually begged of Britain not to use this name for the land. Thereby, the usurping of this name in the 1960’s is not credible as a mark of land ownership, because it was not one of historical usage by the Arabs. 

5.	 A host of Islamic scholars and historians decried and rejected Muslims as Palestinians.: “Allah Gave the Land of Israel to the Jews. The al-Aqsa Mosque was built on top of Solomon’s Temple.” - Eleventh century historian Muhammad Ibn Ahmad al-Maqdisi and fourteenth century Iranian religious scholar Hamdallah al-Mustawfi // “There is no such thing as ‘Palestine’ in history, absolutely not.” - Arab-American historian and Princeton University Professor, Philip Hitti, testifying before the Anglo-American Committee in 1946] 

6.	A host of Jewish organizations and Institutions were called by the prefix of Palestine or Palestinian in the 20th century, including ‘The Jewish Palestine Brigade’ in Britain’s WW2 Military Forces; The [Jewish] Palestine Symphony Orchestra; Today’s Jerusalem Post media was called “The Palestine Post”. 

7.	 There are no Arab Muslim Palestinians on record prior to the 20th century; the land was referred only as the homeland of the Jews. It is validated by a host of archives by many nations, and some one million Archaeological relics. Thereby, the nativity claim can only apply to Jews. In fact, there was never a time of no Jews in Palestine the past 2,000 years, as evidenced by the Crusaders, Islamic invasions and the previous Ottomans. 

8.	Generally, real natives do not usurp the name of other natives, especially one they disdained. [“There is a propaganda war going on now with regard to the term ‘Palestine.’ It is specifically employed to avoid the use of the name Israel, and must be considered an anti-Israel term.” - Dr. Thomas McCall, the Senior Theologian of Levitt Ministry, quoting Zola Levitt.] 

9.	 The previous Islamic Ottoman rulers of Arabia declared Palestine as the homeland of the Jews. - “Who can challenge the rights of the Jews in Palestine? Good Lord, historically it is really your country” - Ottoman Mayor and scholar Yusuf Diya al-Khalidi; Jerusalem, 1899. 

10.	 Judea’s original, previous name was Israel in 1002 BCE, established under King David; and again in 1947 when this country was re-established by the UN. ‘Israel’ is mentioned in the Quran as one belonging to the Jews. [Joshua J. Mark , Ancient History Encyl.) 

11.	 All Religious Scriptures acknowledge Palestine as the ‘Land of Israel’; ‘Land of Judea’; and ‘Land of the Jews’ – including the Hebrew Bible [1 Samuel 13:19]; The New Testaments [ ‘And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.’ - Matt. 2:21]; The Quran - [Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:20-21.]; and the Dead Sea Scrolls. 

12.	 The Original Philistines converted to the Hebrew Belief and became Israelites. The term Palestine is derived from the Philistines, a Greek Island people who invaded Canaan some 4,000 years ago. The Philistines converted to the Hebrew belief under a peace offer by King David, and held prominent positions in David’s army. [“They (the Philistines) met with a severe defeat, however, early in the reign of David (2 Samuel 5:20), he succeeded in reducing them to a state of vassalage (2 Samuel 8:1). In the year of the fall of Samaria (721 B.C.) they became vassals of Sargon. After the time of the Assyrians the Philistines cease to be mentioned by this name. In the ebb and flow of warring nations over this land it is more than probable that they were gradually absorbed and lost their identity. - [The Catholic Encyl.). / The Philistine cities lost their independence to Assyria, and revolts in following years were all crushed. [Myers 1997, p. 313.] / The theory of the “Lost Ten Tribes” calls for (1) all inhabitants of the Northern Kingdom of Hoshea to be deported by Shalmaneser and Sargon, 722-718 B.C [Hearyhim, Weebly, Armstrongism] / They (the Canaanites) were indeed assimilated into the Israelite nation. When the Assyrians overran the Kingdom of Israel, they did not leave any Canaanite aside, as they had all become Israelites by that time. Therefore, the only people that can trace back a lineage to the ancient Canaanites are the Jews. The Canaanites did not exist any longer after the 8th century b.c.e. and they were not annihilated but assimilated into the Jewish people. - [The True Identity of the So-called Palestinians, imninalu] / The Bible describes the Philistines as remaining “subdued” during David’s reign [Philistine; New World Enycl.]/ Josephus, Antiquities, Book 11, Ch.1] & [Esdras 13:39] Q. How then did the Muslims become Palestinians, an adjective of Palestine, in the 1960’s, and have been using this name as the antithesis of Judea and Israel¬¬¬? A. The Palestinian Name Deception: Those in the West who manoeuvred this name upon Muslims did so to mock, if not desecrate, the history, belief and culture of the Muslim people. Thereby it should be overturned by honourable Muslims."
42,E4iygQ--7dk,Your 1967 Map is wrong this was not occupied land.
43,E4iygQ--7dk,Well it seems that the creator of this video skipped a few HISTORY lessons.
44,E4iygQ--7dk,"🤣THAT IS NOT a map of Palestine In 1946 LOL ""Palestine"" the country or well ""the state of palestine"" didnt even exist yet. In fact in 46 Israel didnt even exist lol. It was founded in 2 years later, and the state of palestine over 40 years later. That ENTIRE area was British Mandate Palestine, which wasnt even a country first of all and then named it after the roman name of Syria Palestine, which the romans had renamed from ""Roman Province of Judea"", after beating the jewish revolt and expelling jews from their land, they renamed it after the jews historical enemies, The philistines (which have NOTHING to do with Palestine or modern day Palestenians) SO NO, that is NOT a map of ""Palestine in 46.. I mean if within the first 3 seconds you cant be unbiased, and historically accurate why even bother tackling this incredibly complex subject?"
45,E4iygQ--7dk,History starts from canaan period not 1946
46,E4iygQ--7dk,Very bias and unprofessional narrative. You should be ashamed of yourself.
47,E4iygQ--7dk,"* and the muslims and christians were living next to each other * Who were the first in  State of Isreal ? . The Christians ,The Ottarmans or Muslims"
48,E4iygQ--7dk,Looks like a rat nibbling cheese
49,E4iygQ--7dk,"A lot of lies. first of oll  during the ottoman rule, the entire area that is now syria, jordan and israel was called syria palestina, and there were no borders. Second thing the arabs who are now called palestinian, before the establishment of Israel was called themselves arab not palestinian they considered themselves part of big syria."
50,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,What do you think of the conflict going on right now?
51,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,the history of the two seem very different depending on who’s telling the story.
52,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,"So much hurt and pain. Both Arabs and Jews have been on that land. I remember when I was a grade school girl our graduation from 8th grade. We had watched the movie Exodus and selected a song from that to sing during our ceremony. I still remember the words “This land is mine God gave this land to me.”

Hearts and minds need to change toward each other. All believe in the God of Abraham, we are brothers. My prayers and the prayers of my spiritual group are holding that whole area in a bright golden light of gold bringing wisdom, intelligence, and love to the entire Middle East.

Now that I am almost 80 I pray I may see the peace I sang for so long ago."
53,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,As someone who has some Jewish ancestry my best friend living there and having cousins all throughout Israel and knowing some good honest Palestinian Americans it’s just sad
54,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,We want peace! No more war
55,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,"If you zoom out for a moment and just look at the two people you must state that whatever noble and/or religious goal they thought they had when they took up the fight as invader or occupant, it has surely long since outweighed any rational basis for building a future and/or living in peace by committing murder and genocide in the process. That is what happens when a seemingly righteous religious or national cause becomes fanatism, even terrorism, and bigotry of the worst kind."
56,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,"""When a foreigner resides with you in your land, you must not oppress him. You must treat the foreigner living among you as native-born and love him as yourself, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God."" Leviticus 19:34"
57,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,"Some reading for people interested in knowing more about the issue:

Anonymous Soldiers: The Struggle for Israel, 1917-1947 by Bruce Hoffman;

58,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,"I think ti is time to find a proper solution - understanding, peace, respect , and acception of each other"
59,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,Good conclusive video
60,6foH3Zc82ZQ,it's unbelievable that nobody mentions or blames the British for setting up the region for failure.
61,6foH3Zc82ZQ,"Watching a documentary that presents the formation of modern Israel in such a grim light is personally jarring for me. I had long held the view of Israel as a sanctuary for a people who had suffered immeasurable atrocities. To suddenly be confronted with the idea that its foundation is marred by acts of violence, terrorism, and potentially even genocide against Palestinians shakes the core of what I thought I knew. It's like experiencing a form of betrayal, where a narrative I held to be virtuous is revealed to have dark undertones. It's not just an intellectual exercise in reassessing history; it's a gut punch that makes me question the stories we're told and the stories we choose to believe. It's a painful reckoning with complexity in a world that's easier to navigate in black and white."
62,6foH3Zc82ZQ,"This is the reason us Irish 🇨🇮, proudly support the Palestinians and their cause but most people around the world fail to understand that or what this conflict is all about 😢."
63,6foH3Zc82ZQ,never let a british guy near a map and ask him to draw borders
64,6foH3Zc82ZQ,"This sounds similar to how British split India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Once they understood they couldn't trouble anymore actively,  they left a passive trouble as a separation gift. The entire Indian Subcontinent is still enjoying that gift!"
65,6foH3Zc82ZQ,"That first Israeli soldier laughing about how he didn't count how many Palestinians he killed and that he had a 250 bullet clip.... Imagine if a former Nazi soldier gave an interview like that about their conduct during WW2. 

They'd be hauled off to the World Court and hanged.

This guy.... Gets to hang out in polite society and live out his life in relative peace. 

Humans are insane.

EDIT: It's insane to me how many people out there give cover to a holocaust being perpetuated upon a people, by another group of people who should f++king know better after they suffered a holocaust. 

There are Israeli politicians literally calling for another Nakba."
66,6foH3Zc82ZQ,free palestine
67,6foH3Zc82ZQ,I'm blown away by the Jewish solder laughing when he was asked how many Palestinians he had killed. No loss of life should ever be met by laughter.  This has truly troubled me
68,6foH3Zc82ZQ,"As I say, you don't have to be a Muslim to feel the pain, you just have to be a human"
69,6foH3Zc82ZQ,"What blows my mind is that after experiencing all the atrocities and persecution in Europe, Jewish people went and did pretty much the same thing to Palestinians."

100,kI_spMxp6t8,What right did UK have to sign off someone’s land?
101,kI_spMxp6t8,"I don't know... the whole ""We're God's chosen people"" thing doesn't sound that much different than Hitler declaring the Germans to be the master race to me."
102,kI_spMxp6t8,"Think of a scenario: someone came into your house as a guest and you let them stay. But within a few days he said that he's also the owner of the house, and after a few more days he kicked you out of YOUR OWN HOUSE.

The same thing happened with the people of Palestine, they were the house owner and now Israel forcefully trying to kick them out of their own lands."
103,kI_spMxp6t8,As a uk citizen I agree with you. We have done so much damage over the decades.
104,kI_spMxp6t8,"My father was born in Haifa, which was then British Palestine, in 1944.  To a British father and Palestinian mother.  When he was 4 years old, my grandparents took him to England on holiday (to see family) only to be refused back due to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.  So they had to settle and set up their life in the UK.  My grandmother was once part of the aristocracy and she ended up living on a council estate in Portsmouth and became working class.  It's strange to think that I am a product of war; I would not exist if that war had not broken out."
105,kI_spMxp6t8,What right did America and Britain have to sign off another man's land to another people? This is the root cause of the conflict in the Middle East.
106,kI_spMxp6t8,They escaped a genocide only to commit one. The irony in this is is outragious. There should be a common ground for this dissaster.
107,kI_spMxp6t8,I’m glad many people are learning more about this.  I pray for justice for the Palestinians!
108,kI_spMxp6t8,I want to see more information on this topic but it does seem to be a major issue. I must admit that I agree with the people of Palestine. Israel seems to be more evil in their actions to steal the land of Palestine. I think this situation should have been treated differently and all of this violence will not happen.

114,sR0DsXH0bT4,I cannot even imagine how the common people are facing the problems. They all are innocent. This is just heartbreaking
115,sR0DsXH0bT4,You're absolutely correct. So many people take the wrong stance in this and might even get triggered If I show them this video. We must also know the full picture of this complicated situation to correctly place our judgement. Its absolutely terrible that innocent civillians are getting killed amidst this war between HAMAS and the Israeli military. I pray for the innocent people and chilren that have to go through such atrocities every day and wish peace upon those who have passed
116,sR0DsXH0bT4,Imagine being born into a war and growing up in it and then dying in it. Without having a choice. Just imagine that.
117,sR0DsXH0bT4,"Thank you for making such a complicated situation easier to understand. I have been avoiding learning about it because it was so complicated, confusing and overwhelming, but after your video I feel like I understand it a tiny bit."
118,sR0DsXH0bT4,"Simple & clear narration. Especially, the analogy comparing India & Pakistan, was even better. Thanks Keerthi."
119,sR0DsXH0bT4,"WOW, amazing video! This conflict has really been bothering me lately as I am majoring in Social Sciences and it's something that comes up relatively often. Politics is a massive element of the course. There has been so much misinformation regarding this conflict it's been so hard to understand what is right and what is wrong. Finally, after months of researching, your video allowed me to finish my report. Before watching your video my report was sitting at 5000 words but thanks to your video, I was able to write 3000 more words! Writing this report has been the best experience I've had at university so far and I just wanted to thank you for helping me achieve this."
120,RW105kjNtho,"The world would bend toward justice if discussion and criticism of Israel didn't automatically get deemed ""antisemitic."" It's entirely possible to question Israel and not hate Jewish people."

122,RW105kjNtho,"Great job timeline, but terrible that they have to censor videos that show historical moments because You Tube is afraid to let people see how brutal times were."
123,RW105kjNtho,Thank you for having this treasure trove of interviews and perspectives to release at such a confusing and disheartening point in our time.
124,RW105kjNtho,"Great verbal conveyance of history.  HOWEVER, NOTE TO YOUTUBE:  The images were filmed and photographed to ACCURATELY DOCUMENT THE REALITIES OF GIVEN EVENTS.  Digitizing out death & destruction that actually occurred, denies the depth and complete truth of a story and history, itself.  It may also support the efforts of those who would wish those realities softened and dismissed as never having had happened."
125,RW105kjNtho,This series came out a long long time ago. What’s really sad is that people are just now watching this. It’s not perfect but it definitely a start
126,RW105kjNtho,Dang Timeline quick wit it
127,RW105kjNtho,"Now it's starting to make sense
Thank you
This really was a no nonsense, matter of fact, very frank documentary."
128,RW105kjNtho,Now this is the kind of documentary I appreciate.
129,RW105kjNtho,Thank you for sharing this documentary! It's eye-opening to see the intricate historical roots of the ongoing conflict. Understanding history helps us grasp the present complexities. 🌍 It's crucial for all of us to advocate for peace and work towards a better future for everyone in the region. 💫
130,zE8GCX1w3ys,I’ve been trying to figure this conflict out. The problem is every video has a different narrative.
131,zE8GCX1w3ys,"Historical fact; The Romans changed the name of Judea to Syria Palaestinia in 135 AD after the Bar Kokhva Revolt, which is sometimes called the Third Jewish-Roman War. At the same time, the Romans expelled most Jews from the province. The purpose was to destroy the cultural identity of the province, and spread the Jews throughout the empire in order to prevent another revolt."
132,zE8GCX1w3ys,You left out the part where 2/3 of the area was given to create Jordan.
133,zE8GCX1w3ys,Absolutely wrote his own history of this situation please people do your research and make your own decisions
134,zE8GCX1w3ys,"Very informative, but you missed out the bit where the surrounding Arab countries jointly began a war against Israel in 1948, a day after Israel’s independence, which was what resulted in the Palestinians having to flee. Israel didn’t arbitrarily decide to drive the Palestinians out of their land. 

Or was that not a deliberate omission… 🤔"
135,zE8GCX1w3ys,What about the 3000 years before the first world war? And you failed to mention the Balfour agreement.
136,zE8GCX1w3ys,"There’s an old Indian proverb:
If you see 2 fish in a pond fighting...a British just walked by."
137,zE8GCX1w3ys,"Up until 4:00 , his complaint would be with the British and the UN.
Immediately after that, there is no mention of Arab nations attacking Israel.
So are all of the other historical sources wrong, or is he merely choosing to omit any facts that might support Israel?"
138,zE8GCX1w3ys,"I appreciate that this video provides a few details that I had never heard before.  However, you mention ""arbitrary arrests"" and the construction of walls without mentioning the suicide attacks that precipitated them.  This is a critical mistake that calls your intentions into question.  How can I trust these new details if you leave out such obvious ones?"
139,zE8GCX1w3ys,"He only talks about the history starting from ww1 the history starts more then 10,000 years before ww1"
140,F1H1SA0F_wY,"I will never forget what my highschool history teacher said, ""history is written by the winners..."" therefore its onesided. I stand with humanity and the right to survive. I stand with the innocents and civilians on both sides; the people who want peace. Corrupt governments and extremist groups are damaging in so many ways. Neither side will stop until everyone is dead in a wasteland. This is devastating."
141,F1H1SA0F_wY,After doing research on this subject i find it hard to side with one side or the other. Both have done terrible things to each other and it blows my mind how people so far removed from this conflict can be so confident in the side they support. This is an extremely complicated matter.
142,F1H1SA0F_wY,"I think that creating a homeland for Jews after the atrocities of the Holocaust during WW2 was in theory a good one. An idea that was well-intentioned. However, in tangible and practical terms Palestinians were displaced from their homes and have had to suffer in order to create this homeland. I'm not sure it was right to create suffering for one group of people in an attempt to to alleviate the suffering of another. It was well-intentioned I believe, but I do not understand how it was ever thought that it could work. Was there not even a consideration that it might cause resentment by the Palestinians? (I am NOT by the way, saying that extreme violence commiting war crimes or taking hostages  is the answer! I am in no way condoning violence or war of any kind). I am simply saying that it seems naive to think that it would not have caused problems between the Jewish people/ Israelis and The Muslim/ Palestinian people, to believe that everyone would just live in harmony..."
143,F1H1SA0F_wY,"For someone who had no idea or context on what has been happening, I'm grateful for this video. Thanks"
144,F1H1SA0F_wY,This is probably the most informative explanation of current situation than any other news media. Thank you!
145,F1H1SA0F_wY,I pray that we can just live in peace and harmony one day
146,F1H1SA0F_wY,"It's quite shocking and shameful that they say the world is full of educators, entrepreneurs, humanitarians, leaders, explorers, innovators, visionaries, politicians, political scientists, professors, philanthropists, scholars, rich people, rich countries, and religious leaders, yet no one has been able to provide a permanent solution to this problem."
147,F1H1SA0F_wY,"One thing I never see explained in these videos, and perhaps the most significant part of why this conflict has persisted (and probably will for generations), is the religious side to this conflict which crucial to understand: that Jews and Muslims of Palestine both believe the area we know as Jerusalem was given to them by the God/Allah as their ""promised land / Zion"".  For muslims, it is the place where Muhammad ascended to heaven. Back in the 19th century when politics and religion were very intertwined, leaders made political decisions from religious standpoints, leading to this conflict in the first place. Understanding the religious emotions of the conflict is step one."
148,F1H1SA0F_wY,Thank you for clearing the air. I had no idea what the situation was until now
149,F1H1SA0F_wY,"As long as people keep focusing on differences, there will be war. Instead of seeing ourselves as American or Iranian or whatever, we should see ourselves as humans. We are all one big human family and everyone's internal dialogue is much more similar than we could imagine. Hamas needs to stop the violence and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank needs to end. Either everyone becomes a citizen of Israel with the same rights or the illegal colonies are given back to Palestine so they can have their own state. I think that saying that Israel is a country for the Jews is a fascist/racist statement. Imagine starting a new country and saying it's a country for white people for example. People would go crazy and rightly so. We should aim to make everyone feel welcome and valued in every country on earth. I don't understand the obsession with dividing ourselves."

152,OdENyo4HvX4,"You could argue that Churchill was a product of his time, but at his core he was a ghastly, ignorant, evil, and extremely racist individual."
153,OdENyo4HvX4,"The more and more I learn about Winston Churchill, the more evil he is. When you’re younger all anyone says is how great he was in Ww2 and never elaborates. I wonder why"
154,OdENyo4HvX4,"ive made a playlist of videos trying to understand the conflict in Isreal, this video is by far the easiest to understand, most detailed, and most compassionate and empathetic video of all the ones ive seen. Thank you so much for your help 🍉"
155,OdENyo4HvX4,What I appreciate about this video is a feeling like you're encouraging people to investigate for themselves but planting sign-posts along the way like a good guide.  It's like teaching people how to study history and you're guiding them to do that for themselves well.
156,OdENyo4HvX4,"Trying to offer a truly nuanced approach to this conflict is like trying to thread the eye of a needle by moonlight.  Well done, Then & Now. Thank you for the work that you do."
157,OdENyo4HvX4,That Churchill quote is bone-chilling.
158,OdENyo4HvX4,23:08 - Churchill sounding a lot like Adolph with this one.

172,i5UkjhqY4io,Very balanced and informative video. Well done.
173,i5UkjhqY4io,The number of people actually being civil in the comments should be your sign that you did an absolutely fantastic job.
174,i5UkjhqY4io,"I'm so glad this comment section is full of people with the ability to communicate in function ways like actual adults should, regardless of your standing on the conflict, this video is INCREDIBLY well made and grounded in fact (like always) and im so glad it is civil down here"
175,i5UkjhqY4io,"Great video. Mistake though at 2:30, the mandate for Palestine included Jordan as well... Only later were they spilt off as a separate entity and independent."
176,i5UkjhqY4io,Amazing video! I knew a lot of this already but I did learn some new things. He always does a fantastic job of being evenhanded when reporting on any subject and this one is a very difficult subject to tackle. Kudos!
177,i5UkjhqY4io,It's crazy how many conflicts in the past century are fully or at least partially from the treaties at the end of WW1.
178,i5UkjhqY4io,Always nice to see a new AH episode popping up. I am amazing by the sheer amount of content you guys are able to produce. Keep up the great work AH and team.
179,i5UkjhqY4io,"Thanks for making this video. It helps to provide context for ongoing situation in Israel & Gaza without being too overwhelming. I wish for peace in both Israel and Palestine, and hopefully they can co-exist peacefully in long run."
180,HXe9iZQpJ1M,"Moving the embassy is controversial, breaking with decades of official US policy — and it comes at a particularly tumultuous time for Israel and the region. Read more on Vox.com: http://bit.ly/2k3pFIE"
181,HXe9iZQpJ1M,"It is kind of ironic (but not really) that it is one of the holiest cities in the world, but there is much aggression and violence there."
182,HXe9iZQpJ1M,I love how Christian Palestinians are completely absent from this narrative which has simply been reduced to Jews vs Muslims....
183,HXe9iZQpJ1M,"""Violence is not new in the Holy City."" *Such irony.*"
184,HXe9iZQpJ1M,"Israel: Jerusalem is mine!
Palestine: No it's mine!
Britain: *Pretentiously eating popcorn*"
185,HXe9iZQpJ1M,"Really good job in making a relatively detailed video that's still very neutral. It's still going to be controversial by nature, but unbiased coverage is what we need."
186,HXe9iZQpJ1M,This is a good time to come back to this.
187,HXe9iZQpJ1M,*Politically and religiously aggressive comment*
188,HXe9iZQpJ1M,"I see a lot of people calling anyone who values Jerusalem idiot here in the comments. I might not be religious, but if the city I grew up in and learned culture from was being torn apart by two different groups with exclusionary ideologies, I would be upset as well. It's not just about it being a holy place, it's also about it being a place of culture and belonging. There's nothing productive about belittling their struggles because your values are removed from theirs."
189,HXe9iZQpJ1M,"*Wishful Thinking*
It would be great if Jerusalem was like the Vatican. If it was just an independent city state which allowed anyone to come and worship."

192,GR-embMmMQc,I have learned so much from this video in 12 minutes than all the analysis of the conflict presented by major news channels. A big thank you.
193,GR-embMmMQc,"Lady, you just taught me stuff in less than 13 mins which my entire school and college syllabus could not. Thank you"

211,MknerYjob0w,"The world ended apartheid in South Africa through a massive boycott, but if you call for the boycott of Israel, you’re denounced as antisemitic, it’s absurd"
212,MknerYjob0w,"I had no idea this was going on.  As a South African that lived through apartheid, this is unacceptable.  How is Israel allowed to get away with this?"
213,MknerYjob0w,As a black American I had no idea the Palestinians were being subject to these mistreatment. This is just wrong on so many levels
214,MknerYjob0w,It’s sad that a lot of people are only finding out about this now (including myself). It shows how the sufferings of Palestinians are being buried.
215,MknerYjob0w,"Yes. My mother, who is a white, American, Christian, was married to a Palestinian man and lived in Bethany/Al-Eizariya for two years. She had to go through checkpoints and show her papers (just like Jews did in the ghettos imposed by Nazis); she was forbidden to enter certain parks and public places because they were ""for Israelis only"", but Israelis would go to spaces reserved for Palestinians and would stand around and laugh and jeer at them. IDF had tried to enter her house for no reason, she was twice detained at the airport for no reason, on one occasion the armed guard told her if you try to leave I'll shoot you. She was holding my infant sister. She has seen IDF fire at Palestinian ambulances, and tells me that Israelis frequently harrassed Palestinians in the street. The Israeli government took her father-in-laws olive grove, building a wall behind his own yard blocking him off from his trees that had been in his family for generations and forbidding him from harvesting them."
216,MknerYjob0w,"20 years ago I spent 3 miserable months in the Westbank during the 2nd Intifada. Took only 3 minutes for me to understand Israel is an apartheid state. 
Only the stubbornly ignorant or pretending to be claim otherwise."
217,MknerYjob0w,"“You take my water, burn my olive trees, destroy my house, take my job, steal my land, imprison my father, kill my mother, bombard my country, starve us all, humiliate us all, but I am to blame because I shot a rocket back.”  Noam Chomsky"
218,MknerYjob0w,"By the way, America is not just complicit in this apartheid, America is 100% an accomplice in this apartheid."
219,MknerYjob0w,It is absolutely insane how this Apartheid has been allowed to continue for so long. Palestinians are people! They are humans! They deserve dignity and respect just like everyone on this planet!
220,Azs7As3MYFU,"For more background, view the additional media at https://ryanmcbeth.substack.com

The conflict is essentially one of homeland.  British Mandate Palestine promised Israel to both the Arabs and the Jews if they agreed to fight against the Ottoman Turks during World War I.  Israel's subsequent war of Independence created a refugee crisis that is still ongoing to this day.

221,Azs7As3MYFU,"If there's any place on Earth where the phrase, ""and the plot thickens"", is appropriate, it's the Israeli -Palestinian border."
222,Azs7As3MYFU,"Everyone tiptoes around this conflict. For years and years I had no idea about the specifics. I just knew it was a sensitive subject. Most people just say, ""It's complex."" That was usually enough to discourage me from placing any effort into learning about it. Thank you for a clear and concise summary."
223,Azs7As3MYFU,Thank you. I have been reading articles on this for a week now trying to get my head around things so I can understand what is going on and why. You’ve explained it perfectly in 5mins.
224,Azs7As3MYFU,Your point about historical tribal conflicts over territory reminds me of a conversation I once had with a colleague (of Mexican descent) about the Arab-Israeli conflict. I remarked that nobody calls the American Southwest “the occupied territories.”  He promptly replied: “I do!” 😂
225,Azs7As3MYFU,Thank you for this. This is the first time in my 40 years that ive actually understood the situation. Its definitely a messy one.

It's universally considered even-handed/fair and gives very specific details about every event at the root of the animosity. Be warned though, it's very long."
244,lv1SpwwJEW8,"My heart goes out to all the victims on both sides. Regardless of politics or one sided media, I think we can all agree that killing innocent children, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and grandparents isn't something to be taken lightly, no matter what the nationality or the viewpoint. Let's focus on saving the people, instead of their leaders."
245,lv1SpwwJEW8,Gotta love how the video conveniently skipped talking about Egypt AT ALL despite being the only other country with a border crossing with gaza and a big factor in many of the issues discussed.
246,lv1SpwwJEW8,"Whew. ""If this didn't happen, then something else would've happened because the status quo was unsustainable."" It's the first time I've truly understood that sentiment. Curious if a 2 state solution will ever be possible.  Just so sad🙏🏾"
247,lv1SpwwJEW8,Take a shot whenever you hear “British occupation” in a history video. You’ll never be sober.
248,lv1SpwwJEW8,"for anyone interested, there's a book called ""The 100 Years' War on Palestine"" by Rashid Khalidi which delves deep into the complex history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the late 19th century to the present day and breaks down the political, social, and cultural developments that have shaped the conflict such as the Balfour Declaration, the Nakba (Palestinian exodus in 1948), and the Oslo Accords"
249,lv1SpwwJEW8,I just can’t believe all the horrible things that were happening in the world as I sat in school learning “history”
250,oIWqTIFRlYU,British rule was the root of this problem.
251,oIWqTIFRlYU,"I think you forgot to talk about Britain asking the arabs and jews for help to fight the Turks (Othomon empire who was ruling Jerusalem) in world war one in return for land. I think that false promise to both sides for the same land was the root of the problem. The british did the same thing in other parts of the world, e.x. Pakistan -India, etc

It was colonials basically causes the problems now with simple short term solutions in the past."
252,oIWqTIFRlYU,"So basically the British promised both Jews and Palestinians the same land? Britain told Arabs help us take down the Ottoman and this land is yours, then told Jews help us take out the Arabs and it’s yours…then just handed the issue to the UN?"
253,oIWqTIFRlYU,"How can one people, promise a second people the land of a third people"
254,oIWqTIFRlYU,"In 1914, Britain made a promise to the Arabs. If they help the Allies split the Ottomans, Britain will help the Arabs, including the Palestinians, to establish their own state.
In 1916, Britain also promised France to run Palestine together.
In 1917, in order to win the support of the Jews, Britain promised to establish a Jewish national home in Palestine. This is the Balfour Declaration."
255,oIWqTIFRlYU,"Thanks for helping to explain how the initial conflicts began.  I had some knowledge, but I didn't know it started so early."
256,oIWqTIFRlYU,Must be really horrible to live in countries that just keep going round in circles. This has been going on for decades and will just as likely still be ruining lives at the end of this century too.
257,oIWqTIFRlYU,"The funniest thing is seeing self-righteous Western audiences morally deliberate over this conflict from the luxury of their web browser, deciding who's ""right"" and who's ""wrong"", as if they're the universe's moral authority."
258,oIWqTIFRlYU,"I definitely appreciate this attempt to try and CLARIFY the 👉start👈 of this conflict. Unfortunately, so many OTHER media outlets tend to intentionally try to OBSCURE this information (as if it was ""complex"").🤷🏽‍♀️
.
However, I feel as though it is HIGHLY CRUCIAL to mention that in order for Britain to defeat the Ottoman Empire they asked the Arabs living in that region (Palestine) to fight on behalf of Allied Powers & they would be granted statehood for the formal country of Palestine.
.
For whatever reason, so many prominent media outlets seem to conveniently omit that major detail and just simply mention the Balfour Declaration as the ""start"" or the end of WWII....but Britain's pledge to Arabs actually came FIRST before 1917! 
.
As a result, it would paint a clearer picture of the resentment."
259,oIWqTIFRlYU,"This is sad, for innocent people."
260,m19F4IHTVGc,Who else is trying to know whats happening  between Israel and Gaza as of now??
261,m19F4IHTVGc,Is it just me or most of us here are trying to understand the complex history of the current war in order to explain to our friends and family that wont stop asking us to tell them about it. You did a great job with this video I must say. I'm not surprised it has almost 8million views
262,m19F4IHTVGc,that ticking time bomb statement at the end was so true considering recent events. My heart goes out to all innocent civilians who are experiencing tragedy.
263,m19F4IHTVGc,For those confused by the “six day war” because the narrator is saying “sixty day war” - it was the Six day war. Lasted 6 days.
264,m19F4IHTVGc,I finally have a grasp on why there has been so much conflict in the region!  Thank you for being so informative!
265,m19F4IHTVGc,"I was working in Lebanon in 71. My partner and I got out with support from one of our customers in Cyprus. Before leaving, we could see the rocket fire from where we were staying. Lebanon used to be the resort area of almost the world. The damage we saw was pitiful. They called Lebanese rot. This presentation brings back a lot of memories."
266,m19F4IHTVGc,I am 43 yrs old and this is the first time I've heard a brief description and yet almost complete break down of the Israeli and Palestinian war without hearing ANY bias for either side. Just the facts. THANK YOU!
267,m19F4IHTVGc,"This is by far the best overview I have seen in 11mins flat.  GREAT JOB.  non bias, just great information.  thanks."
268,m19F4IHTVGc,Good video. Helpful. Clear and concise without dumbing down a very complicated conflict.
269,m19F4IHTVGc,Thank you for this information. Im Latino and appreciate any information that helps us all try to better understand the background to this horrific event. Why as human beings we can’t understand peace is disheartening. Power means nothing if everyone is dead 🙏🏽
270,cfkUE5Q0K04,"This documentary didn't mention about the history of the region during ww1, which is important. Prior to ww1, the whole region was ruled under ottoman empire. Then, between 1914~1917, Britain asked the arabs, who had been living under the ottoman rule in this region, to fight against the ottoman empire. Britain agreed to create a unified-arab-kingdom (from Syria in north, to Yemen in south) basically most of western middle east, if Britain&arabs won. Well, the arabs agreed, and the British-arab coalition fought and won against the ottomans.
But instead of keeping the agreement of a unified-arab-kingdom, Britain, created many different arab countries (as can be seen today), and then, gave part of Palestine to the Jewish people. All of these events occurred by 1917. 
Known as the British duplicity, of course this created a messy situation there after for both sides."
271,cfkUE5Q0K04,Thank you for all your hard work to make this sort of  content available.  I appreciate you!
272,cfkUE5Q0K04,"For people who only have surface level tiktok knowledge of this conflict, even those of us who have forgotten the nuances that subject matter scholars can bring to the forefront, this historical account is an important part to understanding the issues surrounding the conflict."
273,cfkUE5Q0K04,It's super refreshing to get an older perspective on these issues
274,cfkUE5Q0K04,I am appalled and saddened that 40 years after this documentary the conflict still continues and innocent lives are ended in the most horrific ways.
275,cfkUE5Q0K04,"I’ve watched your film archives for a while and I had to do a double take at the view count! It’s good that you maintained this informative and well made content for young viewers today that want to be informed, instead of just seeing a headline."
276,cfkUE5Q0K04,"I remember hearing about this since grade school (was born in 1975). What I have heard, in tiny bits and pieces as an adult are the communities where Christians, Muslims, and Jews live side by side, NOT ONLY IN PEACE but as brothers and sisters, defending each other. We need to hear more of these stories!!!"

282,NeZ4yXyzUG0,I wish he was still sharing his thoughts and insights with us through news. I wish he was talking about this right now and opening people's minds with his points of view. I miss him
283,NeZ4yXyzUG0,"Very few people can be so bold to say what you said and at the same time be so humble to think the way you do. Unfortunately, because we need more people like you Trevor."

285,NeZ4yXyzUG0,"A long time ago we listened to politician's and laughed at comedians, today we listen to comedian's and laugh at politician's 👍🏼"
286,NeZ4yXyzUG0,"That was beautifully and compassionately said. Thank you, Trevor, for having the courage to state your opinion and to express this question."
287,NeZ4yXyzUG0,"Trevor is unlike any comedian i know  , he puts efforts in building his opinions and perspectives around things while making making sense of it all at the same time , the fact that he can be clear , direct and considerate each time he talks makes my respect for him grow , Trevor you're a legend"

289,IDj0ghd7xMs,"Whoever’s here from war being declared in October 2023, this is all just so heartbreaking. Praying for the civilians. Human life should take precedence over political agendas. Praying for those families.."
290,IDj0ghd7xMs,"The conflict will be way less complicated to you if you study the history, needs and concerns on both sides of the conflict. But that's a problem. For some weird reason, everybody seems to choose a position and either become violently anti-Israel or obnoxiously anti-Palestine. It is those who want 100% recognition and zero concessions –those who don't really even want to move forward– who say it's a complicated never ending story. Because that serves their purpose."
291,IDj0ghd7xMs,"It's settler colonialism, that's all it is."
292,IDj0ghd7xMs,"""…it’s basically impossible to predict what’s going to happen next…"" I can help you there Bethan, the gratuitous suffering of Palestinians will continue."
293,IDj0ghd7xMs,"""I own this land cause one of my ancestors lived here more than 2000 years ago"" indeed a VERY egotistical complicated conflict."
294,IDj0ghd7xMs,I have a feeling religion plays a huge role in all this unnecessary conflict
295,IDj0ghd7xMs,"Thank you, this was very informative"
296,IDj0ghd7xMs,"""Why the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is so complicated""

It isn't complicated. And it isn't a ""conflict"". This was best expressed by Michael Brooks: ""It's not a complex issue that's the big thing. It's super simple. There's one group that has enormous power, it's the most powerful country in the Middle East, it's backed by the United States, it acts on another population of people with total impunity, is never held accountable for anything. So, there's no symmetry in the relationship, period."""
297,IDj0ghd7xMs,finally someone well educated on the topic. This conflict is way more complicated than what people make it look like and picking a side is rather unfair to both.
298,IDj0ghd7xMs,"It would be cool if all parties agreed to simply unite because the war is destroying the land and its resources. If this continues there will be nothing left, regardless of 'who wins'."
299,Lb3v8M8dzic,"Truly appreciate the in depth, clear, and concisely articulated analysis and education for the public."
300,Lb3v8M8dzic,"I used to always be pro Israel because I believed Jews have a right to have their own homeland and were just defending it. I now know this is untrue. My sincerest best wishes to the people of Palestine, may God smile upon you all."
301,Lb3v8M8dzic,Thank you for this. Really helped explain the WHY behind what’s going on right now. And also what is completely missing from current MSM reporting
302,Lb3v8M8dzic,Thank you for this report. It's helped me a lot to begin to make sense of War between Palestine and Israel. I am praying for all the innocent people being affected on both sides of the border.
303,Lb3v8M8dzic,"This was so helpful to people like me who are watching from far away.  Trying to understand how they got to this place.  It is very complicated, and has happened over years and years.  I like that you stay neutral so we can understand both sides. I really like Sandra's voice and her manner of presentation."
304,Lb3v8M8dzic,"Learning of the current Gaza war has led me in need of much education. Finding your video at this time makes it even more vital to hear a  complex issue presented clearly: you make sense of Jerusalem's centrality to three major religions. But how is it possible that such steps, leading to the most egregious attacks on  prayer in what should be a safe and respected religious site at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, should pass us by?  And how is one surprised that one day an eruption occurs, when freedom to pray and work and be is near buried?"
305,Lb3v8M8dzic,"The Israeli and Hamas conflict underscores the tragic consequences that can arise when religious differences lead to violence and division. In the pursuit of lasting peace, it's essential to transcend religious divides and prioritize the well-being of all people, regardless of their beliefs. Embracing secular values, such as human rights, equality, and diplomacy, can pave the way for a more peaceful and inclusive future where conflicts are resolved through dialogue and cooperation rather than religious affiliations. Art, as a powerful medium, can guide our morality by fostering empathy, promoting tolerance, and inspiring us to envision a world where humanity's shared values and aspirations unite us rather than divide us. Literature, in particular, has the unique ability to create open-minded perspectives by exposing us to diverse viewpoints, cultures, and ideas, which can ultimately lead to greater understanding and empathy among individuals and communities. Curiosity, not a belief in a deity, is the key to a fulfilling and meaningful life, driving us to explore, learn, and connect with the world around us in our shared human journey towards peace and enlightenment."
306,Lb3v8M8dzic,Thank you. This is so informative and the presenter is excellent with a very good delivery of the information. Excellent keep up the good work.

320,K5tcwIicICg,"Do people understand that this is what political science and historical studies actually do all the time, as best they can? Rational argument, differentiated, detached analysis, correction of viewpoints based on new data and new relevant interpretations? There are far too few people like Ian Bremmer who transport this knowledge into the public sphere, which instead is being swamped by the social media toxicity he refers to. Thanks, Big Think!"

322,K5tcwIicICg,This was the most pragmatic and responsible examination of the situation I can recently remember.

327,K5tcwIicICg,What an excellent interview!!! Thank you to Mr. Bremmer for so articulately explaining the geopolitics here!! His ability to articulate such complex topics is absolutely brilliant!!
328,K5tcwIicICg,"Thank you so much Ian! You are one of the sanest most balanced experts. You are so correct. It is so divisive. My son and I are both Reform Jews and even we have been disagreeing, (civilly of course) on some of the events of the last four weeks. I however have more time at sixty-three than he does at thirty to read more, listen more and watch more on this current crisis. Still, it was very difficult for me to accept that the IDF actually bombed and killed thousands of Gazan civilians. It goes against everything the Jewish people as a whole, religious and non-religious hold as their standard of ethics. As horrified, terrified and outraged as I am over October 7th, I am equally horrified and outraged at the agony of innocent Palestinian civilians, half of them children. Your clear but broad explanation of these events along with your historical framework really helped me understand it is okay to feel conflicted. I can't help but feel compassion for all of the victims anymore than I can help feeling righteous indignation against Hamas and Netanyahu and his cronies. The world needs to stand with ALL of the victims and hold Hamas and Netanyahu accountable for their actions or inactions. To all of the Palestinian-Hamas supporters around the world and any radical extremist Jews, ask yourself, "" Do you really want peace? Do you really want a better world?"" Then don't take sides based on their nationality or religion: Support what you KNOW is moral and compassionate and hold accountable ALL of the perpetrators and instigators of this horrendous war equally."

366,ZDvdJJZhN08,"This was an effective video. The demonstrations happening in Canada seem to be lacking in historical accuracy when demonstrators talk about Israel and Gaza. Anyone seeing this video can delve further into the history books for confirmation. IMO the very best thing the people of Gaza could do for their immediate and future prospects would be to get rid of the terrorists ruining Gaza and the West Bank. It is awful to see young children suffering during a war not of their making, thanks to Hamas. Israeli people have a right to defend themselves, and I say people because there are Jews and Arabs living in Israel. The events of the Hamas violent and gruesome attack on Israel on October 7th were horrific and a true indication of how Hamas values life. 🇨🇦"

369,CGxr06nDW1M,"I am an Irish Catholic, the troubles in both the south and north of Ireland created much division between Catholics and Protestants and Republicans and Unionsts. Much hatred and atrocities committed by both sides in the conflict. If the Irish can establish peace so too can the Israelis and Palestinians.

375,CGxr06nDW1M,"Please add the part where the Roman empire changed the name of the area from Judea to Palestine. If they had not done that, the people in the Gaza Stripe would be called ""Judeans""."
376,CGxr06nDW1M,"3000 years? Nope. The Palestinians are not Philistines, they are Arabs. They may have adopted their name from the one the Romans gave to the region that in turn came from the Philistines but they can't claim to be either ethnically or culturally Philistines."
377,CGxr06nDW1M,When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace.
378,CGxr06nDW1M,"Both sides are children of the same God, and are human beings. Can we all just agree to treat each other as such and get along, regardless of skin color and religion? People are hurting on all sides and need compassion, help, and love."

For hundreds of years, me and my family tree (dads side) had owned this land, and once it was flourishing with livestock, a market place, plants and trees for any fruit/veggie you could think of, a good university nearby, a mosque, a comfortably sized home, etc. Until Israeli settlers, dare I say unrightfully stole the land we’d been making for so long and claimed it as theirs. We now own 1/5th of the plants we used to and the other livestock, market place and house are now occupied by Israeli settlers completely not under our control. I now live in America but my grandparents unfortunately couldn’t afford to go to America so they illegally snuck outside the refugee camp we’d been out into and into Jordan. They were deported to Kuwait and that’s where my parents were born. My grandparents didn’t have enough money to go to America or stay in Kuwait so they moved back to a small, shady apartment in Jordan where they live now. It could’ve all been so different though. Better even."

401,k1iMr0NzFf0,"Excellent video, but there is a small error at 45:30, when you speak about the situation in Europe, and that Hitler gained absolut power after the death of the German President Erich Ludendorf.  Which is of course wrong, the last president of the Weimar era was the former General Paul von Hindenburg. Who during WWI, together with Ludendorf, had defeated the Russians at the Battle of Tannenberg, and during the latter part of the war had been the de facto rulers of Germany.

After the war they parted ways. Living for a short stint in Sweden, Ludendorf returned to Germany and got embroiled in various right wing groups, and gravitated towards NSDAP. After taking part in Hitler's failed Beerhall Putsch in 1923, he would later brake with Hitler and the NSDAP.  Forming his own party and - together with his wife - delve deep into Germanic mysticism and esoterism, and at the early part of the 1930, he managed to revive his relation with Hindenburg."

Negotiations were begun in November 1915, and the final agreement took its name from the chief negotiators from Britain and France, Sir Mark Sykes and François Georges-Picot.

Even if they've reached a ceasefire agreement, a splinter group that really hates the other party would emerge and strike the other one, regardless of collateral damage. The other party would strike back causing collateral damage as well, fanning the flames again, combine that with other factors, like who gets certain pieces of territories of interests to them and that cycle would continue."

511,0aM7RjXE1xo,"History Lesson, you the media keep calling this the West Bank? Your Graphic Map is not correct.
It didn’t become the West Bank until 1948 when Jordan attacked the Jews.
For 4,000 years before that it was called Judea and Samaria, Israel was split in Two. That is the Holy Land of the indigenous people of Israel. Israel was destroyed by the Assyrians in 722 B.C.E.
Judah and Jerusalem fell to the Babylonian Empire and was destroyed in 586 B.C.E.

War and Empires determined Borders, over 4,000 years ago, so what is different today, the Jewish Nation has survived that long and is only defending what was their original Borders.
What do you think France under Napoleon, Germany under Hitler, and Britain did under various Kings and Queens did? Fought Wars to establish Borders. Today Wars are still fought to determine who owns what. Human history is that of Conflict, that is the one Constant that keeps Wars going.
My Ancestors were Vikings, who do you think shaped the various nations of Europe, why do you think War and Peace has survived for so long, it’s human pastime, a Game of Thrones.
The modern Borders were drawn by the West, without regard to the history of the various indigenous people, and you wonder why you still have Wars today?"
512,0aM7RjXE1xo,And she said the Palestinians were there before? Is this a joke??

530,REWfM4gVtow,This is more information than you will ever get from American news channels. Thank you
531,REWfM4gVtow,"So Qatar gives terror group Hamas $360 Million in unaccounted Aid each year. It is worthy of noting Qatar hosts no Palestinian Refugees though, in fact they expelled all Palestinians in 1993, even those working in the Qatari Government, and successful businessmen. They have an interesting way of supporting Palestine."
532,REWfM4gVtow,I'm pleasantly surprised by this YouTube channel i just discovered . You get like info that you won't hear in the Western Media and i absolutely love it . And i love how this Lady present the news . Good job Firstpost

534,REWfM4gVtow,"What's happening between Israel and Palestine right now is absolutely disgusting and heartbreaking. No matter what there are innocent people caught in the middle and the more I see news reported on it, the more tears come to my eyes."
535,REWfM4gVtow,"She gives you the back story, this was how I started listening to WION because of how she presents news, she really does allow you inside knowledge, and give you indept information.
You listen to PS presenting news, and you take away so much, and you come back for more, because you know you will always be enlighted, and informed."
536,REWfM4gVtow,I miss American media being so unbiased and real with a news stories. Thank you for this information
537,REWfM4gVtow,"The best news channel in India. In fact she's the most unbiased anchor, (not perfectly as no one can be). States clearly, no unnecessary and dramatic bg music, Her well acquainted knowledge and efforts are more than enough to stand out. She's doing for us a national service."
538,REWfM4gVtow,"If i saw her reading the news, i will never scroll back or forth for other news.. Cause she's the only trusted news reader as for me... #Palki Sharma 🙏🏻"
539,53KolEoTyz0,Very well explained
540,53KolEoTyz0,So why are they fighting?
541,53KolEoTyz0,As soon as I heard his accent I was like ‘yeah this guy gets it’ lol
542,53KolEoTyz0,Too much hate in the world  especially fighting and killing over territory.  Isn't the earth all of our home?
543,53KolEoTyz0,Succinctly explained .
544,53KolEoTyz0,facts vs alternative facts lies obfuscation excuse making careful omission
545,53KolEoTyz0,Understandable english
546,53KolEoTyz0,Free Palestine
547,53KolEoTyz0,it is not conflict. it simply one of the worst occupation in the world
548,53KolEoTyz0,"Tidak perlu membantu Israel itu, dia telah tamak dengan harta dunia,bahkan dia telah mendustakan Tuhannya yang menjadikannya hujud."

550,r21iN7JYu2Y,"I don’t care what religion or side you’re on, watching a grieving mother talk to her deceased sons in a graveyard, while her surviving daughter stands nearby, is beyond heartbreaking."
551,r21iN7JYu2Y,I never almost cry but instantly started tearing up when that father was holding his child dead in his arms and screaming. Rest in Peace to those innocents and children who passed on both sides.
552,r21iN7JYu2Y,At first I felt like this video was gonna be pretty biased and one-sided. However at the end it really seems like she was very sided with the civilians who are the real people being hurt here. I appreciated that. She grilled leaders on both side. 10/10 great interviews and reporting.
553,r21iN7JYu2Y,That father screaming to the sky and asking why! The pain and grief in that moment is something I am going to pray for his well being and happiness.
554,r21iN7JYu2Y,"Thank you for continuing to make this information free and digestible. It's so important to understand what's going on in our world, and so few media outlets take the time to tell a whole story anymore. Just what's happening RIGHT NOW. I am praying for all sides, for the innocent people and families who never asked to live this way. It's truly heartbreaking 💔 🙏🏼 I can't imagine having to explain all of this to your babies and still attempt to sleep at night."
555,r21iN7JYu2Y,Always appreciate that Vice news asks tough questions to both sides and dives deeper than mainstream media
556,r21iN7JYu2Y,How does somebody go to both sides of a bitter conflict and ask tough questions on both sides? This is incredible journalism.
557,r21iN7JYu2Y,"The man who lost his children broke my heart. He was so shocked he couldn't even cry, just scream."
558,r21iN7JYu2Y,It doesn’t matter what side you’re on but seeing children who has nothing to do with this conflict die is heartbreaking

Please sir come up with more such videos which are germane to our exam"
568,xTcP1R8BFBQ,This is the first video whr i am commenting regarding this topic.. this man deserve a like.
569,kUMYT6tozEg,That was so nice to see the Arab and Jewish children playing and learning together. May God bless them
570,kUMYT6tozEg,"""We don t have to agree,  but we have to listen"" . How beautiful is that ❣️"
571,kUMYT6tozEg,I don't agree with many things said by both sides but wow what a great job in keeping it neutral and truly hearing from both sides and not just cherry picking. This is what journalism should look like.
572,kUMYT6tozEg,"23:11 His music needs to be widely spread and promoted. There are plenty of talent agencies who could help get him as widely recognized as his tremendous talent and wisdom deserves. It’s inspiring, and a good message that I think we all need to hear. Beautiful ❤"
573,kUMYT6tozEg,"I can see that the artist is really hurt living in Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He seemed really tired and pained and i felt it.
I hope and pray that the peace will descend in the land, and the people will learn to share the present and future together."
574,kUMYT6tozEg,Thank you for mking this documentary. So neutral and fair on both the Palestinians and Israelis. 🙏 ❤ It is indeed a complex solution.
575,kUMYT6tozEg,The greatest deception in human history is the phrase “we can disagree and still live in peace” Human mind doesn’t work that way!
576,kUMYT6tozEg,"Praying for the Peace  of Jerusalem.  God bless Jerusalem and all who dwell within her. Let there be peace ,  love and tranquility.  Amen !"

578,kUMYT6tozEg,"I enjoyed listening and learning about the people's journey together in this torn part of the world, especially the children and their shared academic experience; this is awesome as a new paradigm shift in understanding each other through the nuance of youth, education, and the future."
579,ECscKICzsJ0,The YouTube algorithm has an interesting sense of humor.
580,ECscKICzsJ0,I was two and a half minutes into this before I realised it was made eight years ago. It’s comforting to know some things in life are timeless.
581,ECscKICzsJ0,"I thought The Onion was supposed to make satire, this is just actual history"
582,ECscKICzsJ0,”Global leaders worked tirelessly to engineer a conflict so intractable that it could last indefinitely” I see no lies here
583,ECscKICzsJ0,Yet another example of when comedians do a better job of journalism than journalists.
584,ECscKICzsJ0,This is the calmest comment section about Israel/Palestine I've come across this week.
585,ECscKICzsJ0,This is where I get my up-to-date information on the Israeli Palestinian conflict
586,ECscKICzsJ0,We have reached peak absurdity when the Onion gives the only accurate fair and balanced synopsis of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.
587,ECscKICzsJ0,Give it another 10 years and this video will still be just as accurate.
588,ECscKICzsJ0,"No matter what’s in the news, there’s a decade old onion video about it doing a better job at explaining it that any documentary."
589,W5hBL94EFMQ,Never ask the UN to ever draw borders again.
590,W5hBL94EFMQ,"If you give a mouse a cookie, it’s going to ask for a glass of milk."
591,W5hBL94EFMQ,And when Palestinians fight back they cry out in anger but when Israelis murder Palestinian civilians they say “It’s war what do you expect”
592,W5hBL94EFMQ,When the oppressed becomes the oppressor
593,W5hBL94EFMQ,Who needs history when you can make your own reality
594,W5hBL94EFMQ,Cant believe vox went into this narrative without presenting all the facts.
595,W5hBL94EFMQ,Cycles of violence & hatred are supposed to be broken not continued.
596,W5hBL94EFMQ,Free Palestine 🇵🇸
597,W5hBL94EFMQ,Left out the part where Israel said yes to the devision deal and the Palestinians said no because they wanted the whole country (this happens like 2 more times).
598,W5hBL94EFMQ,Y'all decided not to tell 99% of the story
599,qR5TCBBhihY,iran@iraq..she said like Almost same😶
600,qR5TCBBhihY,"Iran has motives, thats all you need to know."
601,qR5TCBBhihY,See Papal Bull of 1430 .  Self explanatory !
602,qR5TCBBhihY,"Israel was not not formed in 1948. Israel returned officially to its ancestral land in 1948. The Quran mentioned the Jews in many passages confirming their existence even before the advent of Islam. The Bible has over 3000 years of historical records of Israel inhabiting that Land. It’s this distortion of the facts that have made peace between the Jews and Arabs inhabiting the space impossible. A simple solution would have been a two state coexistence worked out by the parties themselves without any external interference. Let the Arabs and the Jews sit down together, use historical facts from their Holy Books, historical facts of the last millennium and the realities of today to chisel out a coexistence plan. They should work at it until they reach an agreement even if it takes a century"
603,QUCeQt8zg5o,Thanks for watching everyone. Tell us what you think in the comments below.
604,QUCeQt8zg5o,"I'm someone who was born and raised in the United Arab Emirates. In the 90s I was living in a neighborhood which had Palestinians who were teaching Mathematics, Science and Literature at UAE government schools. Now I'm connecting the dots as this documentary shows 50% of Palestinian youth were literate by 1948. This documentary makes sense"
605,QUCeQt8zg5o,"Here in Greece, our parliament voted to recognize the Palestinian state back in 2015. All parties agreed for the first time to something, but no government since then upheld that decision. Now government and media, are trying to deform the truth about the heroic Palestinians, but we the people of Greece, are standing with them. Fredom to Palestine."
606,QUCeQt8zg5o,"After witnessing Palestinian protests over the years I assumed they were just fanatics. But this last week I decided that when two parties are involved, there are 2 stories to tell. Over the past few days I’ve watched documentaries like yours which convinced me I had misjudged the Palestinian cause. This is a case of injustice which began long ago and caused a lot of suffering. The shameful behavior of the Allies to conspire against them proves once again how self-serving interests overcome what is judicious. I will support the Palestinian people."
607,QUCeQt8zg5o,"""What happened in 1948 is too brutal to talk about. It's indescribable.""  My eyes were filled with tears as I looked at him.  OMG, words are not enough to describe what they had to endure during those moments.  Yeah, it's ""indescribable."" 😣"
608,QUCeQt8zg5o,"As a Bulgarian I'm grateful for all the documentation and evidence that has been preserved, helping us make sense of the past and not forget how things used to be. In all honesty, I don't understand how anyone could ever believe that the region was ""a land without people"", some underdeveloped desert. One doesn't need to have studied too much about history or how human civilisation develops to have one look at the map and know that this was a cultural and commercial centre. Thank you for your work!"
609,QUCeQt8zg5o,"This was a great documentary, it showed how Palestinian was a hustling and bustling country full of life culture, and well educated people, A special thanks for AL JAZEERA DOCUMENTARY and all the journalists who prepare this memoriable for the history of PALESTINE."
610,QUCeQt8zg5o,I can relate as a  South African whose prople were displaced in their land of birth. Forced to luve in a 13% of the land and more than 80% of our rich land stolen by the colonizers . It for this reason that I support the Liberation of the Palestinian people.  Thank you Aljazeera for sharing.
611,QUCeQt8zg5o,"I have never been this much interested or educated about Palestine and its people. Reading more and more about it makes me really sad, I can't believe I've been unaware of the sufferings that Palestinians have been going through for years. Thank you for such an informative video! I pray and hope Palestine will be free from the occupation and its people will finally be fully happy in their own homeland. I also hope that the war in Gaza will stop very soon, insha'Allah 🤲"
612,QUCeQt8zg5o,"I hope that in my lifetime, I see the Palestinian peoples returned their land and that their hearts rejoice in joy and peace. Seeing the beautiful world they had, I can only imagine that they once lived happily. We, the rest of the world, must stand and fight with them until their history is told more accurately and to end the apartheid and constant war waged against them."
613,nERZr_d343w,"Found mistake: They weren't called Palestinians in 1947. Simply Arabs or Palestinian Arabs (Because Palestinians weren't just Arabs. They were in fact the Zionists). The partition did not say ""Israel/Palestine"" state; Palestine was the land that was divided. The division was ""Arab State / Jewish State"". Arabs did not identify themselves as Palestinians until the 1960's."
614,nERZr_d343w,"The partition of the West Bank in areas A, B and C seems impossible to work out and was bound to fail.
If the West Bank was given 100% to Palestinian control and governance, the peace would have worked out.
The obstacle is and remains the settlements and right wing settlers."
615,nERZr_d343w,Missing alot of important points.
616,nERZr_d343w,"If I set up a tent in a person’s backyard and tell him it is land of my ancestors…what will happen? He’ll try to push me out. If now in defense I kill him saying “Hey, I just defended my land”…how can we say that is ok? It’s unbelievable"
617,nERZr_d343w,Sad
618,nERZr_d343w,"The accord tried to ignore a fundamental right enshrined in international law: the right of return of every Palestinian refugees who fled or otherwise left their homes during the Zionist invasion. That right is passed to the descendants as well. No politician can arbitrarily remove or simply ignore that right which every person in the world can exercise in similar circumstances. 
Using another example: If a thief steals your car, the thief must return it to you. No excuses."
619,nERZr_d343w,1978-1992
620,nERZr_d343w,It's a shame this didn't work although the idea that the West Bank wasn't going to be given fully to Palestinian control might have something do with the objections to it.
621,nERZr_d343w,Do the Israeli settlements violate the zones set out in the Oslo accords?
622,nERZr_d343w,I LOVE NAEJ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
623,VZ4ruk3KO48,"Very nice independent, unbiased journalism by the BBC as always..
Yes, I am being sarcastic"
624,VZ4ruk3KO48,"As someone who comes from a Polish family, too much h8 in this world. Innocent people are dying for no reason, my heart goes out to both sides who lost their loved ones in this terrible conflict. My grandparents survived World War II and we should be teaching peace and love."
625,VZ4ruk3KO48,It is unfortunate that the conflict due to differences in ideology developed into war rather than dialogue.
626,VZ4ruk3KO48,"I am from India and I am a Hindu, I urge our Arab Muslims and Israeli Jews to not to fight and solve issues by table talk. In 21st century we cannot afford this kind of barbarism happening in name of territorial conflict. We human hardly live 70 to 80 years in this planet and we should work together to make our life better instead of launching war in name of countries and religion. I think we are not primitive like our ancestors and we are way more smarter and educated, so we are capable to solve our problems through dialogues."
627,VZ4ruk3KO48,"Next time God promises the same land to two groups, I suggest a notarized written contract."
628,VZ4ruk3KO48,"If you want to learn about the background of the conflict, don’t use BBC lol"
629,VZ4ruk3KO48,Just like how the US missed the 2001 attacks.
630,VZ4ruk3KO48,Putting gravy into a whoopee cushion takes an amusung prank to a whole new level of authenticity.
631,VZ4ruk3KO48,"The thing about Isreal and Palestine which feels different… is that they are going at it now at this point in time - when there’s already been so much happening. It feels like if anything big were to happen, it would happen now. And they have such a long drawn out history of fighting each other…which means there’s energy/emotion over many years and possible momentum as well. Which could spark and escalate into something larger. 

And heck… if WWIII were to start… it would be fitting that it would start with two places that think they are holy and sacred because of religion and Jesus. 

And I just found out yesterday, that the Baha’i faith believe that  WWIII will start from a small country. (Can’t get any smaller than this…) 

And of course, Isreal has nuclear weapons… and Palestine has its connections with its ally, Iran (which also has nuclear weapons)."
632,VZ4ruk3KO48,The international community has inadequately failed to deal with this for 75 years of course it was going to lead to something like this.
633,0MMBVEQbF8Y,Hamas signed it's own death warrant

637,aEdGcej-6D0,"This is for those who thinks it started on oct 7th, especially piers…."
638,aEdGcej-6D0,"Imagine thinking it's okay to toss your garbage down where you know people walk? Or letting your kids throw stones at other children. I still can't wrap my head around the fact that Jews, who survived the holocaust would go and treat Palestinians in ways similar to how the Jews were treated by the Nazis. Like...did they not learn that all people deserve to be treated well? How do you go from being bullied to being the bully? Shouldn't that have taught you compassion and respect for human dignity?"
639,aEdGcej-6D0,This is legit like a horror movie; imagine living through it everyday.
640,aEdGcej-6D0,"My blood is boiling after hearing the words from this Settler. Thank u for sharing the truth with us so everyone can see this madness with their own eyes. I pray for my Palestinian brothers and sister, may god give u your freedom back.  🙏🏾"
641,aEdGcej-6D0,I am half Jewish and I have always wanted to understand what is going on in Israel but it has seemed hard to get objective information.  But in your film I can see with my own eyes. I am not afraid to find out the truth and I thank you for your video.  I think the only way to find peace is to see the truth and make things better.  Sending love to you and your father.
642,aEdGcej-6D0,"It was heartbreaking hearing Salwa's father telling her to be strong, while she, A CHILD, was being arrested for existing as a Palestinian"
643,aEdGcej-6D0,"As a South African born under an apartheid system, I understand the dehumanization effects of apartheid and its segregation laws, especially when all your rights are stripped away from you and the oppressors see nothing wrong with treating you like a sub-human. When we say Israel is an apartheid state, we know exactly what we are talking about. An apartheid state is formed with human rights violation at its core, it does not deserve any support, in fact, it deserves a world condemnation."
644,aEdGcej-6D0,"When the girl talks about her brother saying ""look how nice their toys are. Let's go play with them"", my heart sinks. It makes me think of my kids in that situation. It makes me want to shower them with toys so they can have a normal childhood"
645,aEdGcej-6D0,"I am a local elected Councillor here in the UK. I am also a journalist. 
Your film was insightful you and your team and the former Israeli soldiers who assisted you are very brave. Your film showed us the everyday life under occupation. 
The Palestinian people and children are subjected to incredible cruelty, under a barbaric regime. 
If there is anything I can do to voice or help from the UK, feel free to get in touch. My prayers are with you and the Palestinian people. LBC news reported 76% of the British people want a ceasefire. The protests in the UK are getting bigger weekly and social media has tipped the scales as far as balanced reporting goes. Mainstream media looks like a joke, when brilliant speakers hold them to account and address bias. The voices are getting louder, Free Free Palestine!! 
✌️🇵🇸"
646,eTMRMX7Pw5U,"1:10 Lol UK ""abstained"" from voting. Didn't want to get involved with the mess it made."
647,eTMRMX7Pw5U,"There's a mistake in this video at 1:25.  That frame shows a picture of bodies lined up in rows and the voice over and CC indicate it is Deir Yassin.  While the massacre at Deir Yassin was very real and documented even by Zionist forces, an uncontestable event, the photo shown is not from Deir Yassin.  That image is a reproduction of a photo taken by the Army Signal Corps of a German concentration camp called Dachau.  This image is widely misused like this, unfortunately this misuse has been used by Nakba deniers to undermine the truth."
648,eTMRMX7Pw5U,Why can't people tell this story without massive bias and omission?
649,eTMRMX7Pw5U,you faild to mention that the arabs rejected the partition plan and started the war and lost in a convinsing way
650,eTMRMX7Pw5U,"Quite inaccurate at times. On the one hand, how can you explain a 100-year old conflict in 5 mins, but on the other, how can there be so much inaccuracy in just 5 mins? Jordan wasn't gifted the West Bank, it invaded and occupied as a durect threat to the fledgling Jewish state. Ben Gurion announced the Stae of Israel on 14 May 1948, the local Arabs promptly attacked on 15 May and in nearly all cases got driven back despite superior manpower and weaponry. The list goes on."
651,eTMRMX7Pw5U,If you go to war you risk losing everything
652,eTMRMX7Pw5U,"when people talk about this war, they never mention what the Arab aims were. They stated that 'they would 'drive the Jews in the sea.' Even if you think they never actually would have done this, you have to admit that the Israelis had every right to be anxious. People also never talk about how Arabs were treating Jews in other Arab nations during this war. I'm not well read but I've heard that genocide occurred to Jews. Not to mention that Jordanians destroyed Jewish religious sites in Jerusalem. It seems as though people want to victims the arabs and blame west and Israel but Arabs seem to have a very bad track record with Jews and Christians during the 20th century. Look at genocide of 2 million Christians during WW1. There needs to be more balance."
653,eTMRMX7Pw5U,"I’m looking for stories of Egyptians who were in the 1948 war. I doubt any veterans are still alive (but let me know if I’m wrong!), but their families and friends have stories and memories which should be shared."
654,eTMRMX7Pw5U,What book are those excerpts from during the part of the video that discusses the tensions between Jordan and Egypt?
655,eTMRMX7Pw5U,"""With an official arab state nowhere in sight""
It grades the arabs, not the jews...."

I may be wrong but Israeli intel has never missed anything like this before and I find it hard to believe they would miss this even with all the internal political struggles."
658,r_e1ytlC5Vo,"My eyes filled with tears after seeing pain and sufferings of people of Israel and Palestine, amid of war between political powers and extremists , ...

Peaceful dialogue and engagement with elected officials can be a way to express your concern and demand action. It's also essential to stay informed about any government initiatives or policies related to protests.
672,IiLJPkHFkYI,"As a christian I feel bad for both Palestinians and Israelis so many innocent lives lost on both sides I truly hope they can find peace with each other. War is a horrible thing and it only cause death and destruction. My thoughts and prayers are with all the families and friends of the Palestinians, Israelis and the tourists who lost their lives in these horrible attacks."
673,IiLJPkHFkYI,"At this point, this is not just between Palestine and Israel. Each side represents something and whichever side you're on, it reflects your values and how you see the world, humanity and everything in it. We're in the stage where we have to raise our state of awareness so we can't be manipulated on what to believe in. I'm sure we all have our reasons why we side with one and not the other. I think this is just start and more chaos will come."
674,IiLJPkHFkYI,We need more love in this world. I my thoughts are with the innocent civilians of Palestine and Israel. I pray that one day this can all be resolved. Please remember you share bloodlines from thousands of years ago.
675,IiLJPkHFkYI,"""A house divided against itself cannot stand"" -Abraham Lincoln"
676,-rBGgIaO69c,"As a Muslim, I am praying for the innocent civilians in both Palestine and Israel. I can't believe that in the 21st century, people are still fighting like pagans instead of resolving their conflicts by talking and finding a middle ground. We haven't learned anything from history..At the end of the day, the only people suffering will be the innocent kids and widows who had nothing to do with the politics and the power games of the politicians...There are no winners in wars.. The UN should sit together and find a solution for the conflict between Israel and Palestine."
677,-rBGgIaO69c,"This is extremely disturbing on both ends. I feel bad for the elderly, the men and the children in Palestine and Israel that have fallen victims to crimes committed against them. It’s extremely scary and concerning and I hope this comes to a swift end"
678,-rBGgIaO69c,Disagreeing with Israeli policy and the Israeli government does NOT make you anti-Semitic.  Government and religion are not the same thing.  Stop calling people racist for not agreeing with your point of view!  There's a lot of built up rage in Gaza for the way Israeli's treat them.  There are two sides to this story!  At the same time Hamas' brutal tactics makes them equally at fault.  But I understand where their anger is coming from.
679,-rBGgIaO69c,"“If you're not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.” ~ Malcolm X"
680,-rBGgIaO69c,My deepest condolences to the families who lost their lives in this conflict.
681,-rBGgIaO69c,Appreciate the educational points about the history. It helps us to understand all of the decades long devastating issues.
682,-rBGgIaO69c,"As I have commented before, the situation in Gaza, Palestine and Israel always manages to achieve the impossible - it gets even worse.  And you can be sure that the situation will get even worse than it is now.  In 10 years time - if people are still around by then - 
I am certain I shall make exactly this same comment.  People will never change their nature, even to save themselves."
683,-rBGgIaO69c,Wow! That was a head scratcher 🤯
684,-rBGgIaO69c,It is high time to understand the basic wrongs of each side that are becoming a cause of atrocities. Blaming the other side will not result in peace. Evil generates further evil. We need a wise decision from both sides and at the international level to stop the human plight.
685,-rBGgIaO69c,Very well explained and educational.  I really appreciated the questions asked and the clear & neutral answers!

714,8IIbLFGkurw,"❤❤❤Jeremiah 31:1-40 “At that TIME,” declares YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱, “I🇮🇱 will be GOD🇮🇱 to all families of ISRAEL 🇮🇱, and they🇮🇱 will be My 🇮🇱 people.” Thus says YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱: “The people 🇮🇱 surviving the sword found grace in the wilderness— where I🇮🇱 gave ISRAEL 🇮🇱 rest.” From afar YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱 appeared to me🇮🇱. “Yes, I🇮🇱 have loved you 🇮🇱 with an EVERLASTING LOVE. Therefore I🇮🇱 have drawn you 🇮🇱 with lovingkindness. Again I🇮🇱 will build you🇮🇱, so you🇮🇱 will be rebuilt, virgin ISRAEL 🇮🇱 ! Again you 🇮🇱 will take up your🇮🇱 tambourines as ornaments, and go out to dances of merrymakers. Again you 🇮🇱 will plant vineyards on the HILLS🇮🇱 of SAMARIA🇮🇱 — planters will plant and use them. For there will be a DAY when WATCHMEN will call out in the HILL COUNTRY of EPHRAIM🇮🇱, ‘Arise, let us go up to ZION🇮🇱 , to YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱 our GOD🇮🇱.’” For thus says YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱: “SING aloud with joy for JACOB🇮🇱! Shout with the CHIEF of the NATIONS! PROCLAIM, give PRAISE, and say: ‘YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱, save Your🇮🇱 people🇮🇱, the REMNANT🇮🇱 of ISRAEL 🇮🇱 !’ BEHOLD, I🇮🇱 will bring them🇮🇱 from the north country, and I🇮🇱 will gather them🇮🇱 from the ends of the earth— among them 🇮🇱 the blind and the lame, the pregnant together with she who is in labor with child. A great throng🇮🇱 will return here. With weeping and supplications they🇮🇱 will come. I🇮🇱 will bring them🇮🇱, leading them🇮🇱 to walk by streams of water on a straight path where they🇮🇱 will not stumble. For I🇮🇱 am ISRAEL’s🇮🇱  FATHER, and EPHRAIM🇮🇱 is My🇮🇱 firstborn. Hear the WORD🇮🇱 of YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱, O NATIONS, and declare it in the DISTANT ISLANDS, and say: ‘He🇮🇱 who scattered ISRAEL 🇮🇱 will gather and watch over him🇮🇱, as a shepherd does his flock.’ For YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱 has ransomed JACOB🇮🇱. He🇮🇱 redeemed him🇮🇱 from the hand of one stronger than he🇮🇱. They🇮🇱 will come and sing on ZION’S🇮🇱  height, radiant over the bounty of YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱— over the grain, the wine, the oil, and the young of the flock. Their life🇮🇱 will be like a watered garden, and they🇮🇱 will never languish again. Then will the virgin🇮🇱 rejoice in the dance, both young men🇮🇱 and old men🇮🇱 together. For I🇮🇱 will turn their🇮🇱 mourning into joy, and I🇮🇱 will comfort them🇮🇱, and make them🇮🇱 rejoice out of their🇮🇱 sorrow. I🇮🇱 will fill the soul of the kohanim🇮🇱 with fatness and My🇮🇱 people🇮🇱 will be satisfied with My🇮🇱 goodness.” It is a declaration of YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱. Thus says YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱: “A voice is heard in Ramah🇮🇱 —lamentation and bitter weeping— Rachel🇮🇱 weeping for her🇮🇱 children🇮🇱, refusing to be comforted for her🇮🇱 children🇮🇱, because they🇮🇱 are no more.” Thus says YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱: “Restrain your🇮🇱 voice from weeping and your🇮🇱 eyes from tears. For your🇮🇱 work🇮🇱 will be rewarded” —it is declaration of YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱— “when they🇮🇱 will return from the land of the enemy. So there is hope🇮🇱 for your🇮🇱 future” —it is declaration of YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱— “when your🇮🇱 children🇮🇱 will return to their🇮🇱 own territory🇮🇱. I🇮🇱 indeed heard EPHRAIM🇮🇱 grieving: ‘You🇮🇱 have disciplined me🇮🇱— I🇮🇱 was disciplined like an untrained calf. Restore me🇮🇱, and I🇮🇱 will return, for YOU 🇮🇱 are YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱 my GOD🇮🇱. For after I🇮🇱 returned, I🇮🇱 repented, and after that I🇮🇱 was instructed, I🇮🇱 struck my🇮🇱 thigh— I🇮🇱 was ashamed and also humiliated, for I🇮🇱 bore the disgrace of my🇮🇱 youth.’ “Is EPHRAIM 🇮🇱 a precious son to Me🇮🇱? Is he a delightful child🇮🇱? For as often as I🇮🇱 spoke against him🇮🇱, I🇮🇱 still certainly remember him🇮🇱. Therefore My🇮🇱 heart yearns for him🇮🇱. I🇮🇱 will surely have compassion on him🇮🇱.” It is a declaration of YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱. Erect road markers, set up signposts! Set your🇮🇱 heart toward the highway, the way by which you🇮🇱 traveled! Return, O virgin ISRAEL🇮🇱, return to your🇮🇱 cities🇮🇱. How long will you🇮🇱 waver, O backsliding daughter? For YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱 has created a new thing on earth: a woman surrounds a man. Thus says YE_HO_VAH-TZVA'OT🇮🇱, the GOD🇮🇱 of ISRAEL 🇮🇱: “Yet again will they🇮🇱 use this expression in the LAND🇮🇱 of JUDAH🇮🇱 and in its CITIES🇮🇱, when I🇮🇱 will return them🇮🇱 from exile: “‘YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱 bless you🇮🇱, O dwelling🇮🇱 of RIGHTEOUSNESS, O mountain🇮🇱 of HOLINESS.’ “JUDAH🇮🇱 and ALL its cities🇮🇱 will dwell there together—the farmer and those who go about with flocks. For I🇮🇱 will satisfy the weary soul🇮🇱, and every languishing soul🇮🇱 will refresh.” At this point I🇮🇱 awoke, and looked around, and my🇮🇱 sleep was sweet to me🇮🇱. “BEHOLD, DAYS are coming”—it is a declaration of YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱 —“when I🇮🇱 will sow the house of ISRAEL 🇮🇱 and the house of JUDAH🇮🇱 with the seed of man and with the seed of beast. Now just as I🇮🇱 have watched over them🇮🇱 to uproot and to pull down, to overthrow, to destroy, and to bring disaster, then I🇮🇱 will watch over them🇮🇱 to BUILD 🇮🇱 and to PLANT 🇮🇱,” says YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱. “In those DAYS they🇮🇱 will no longer say: ‘The fathers🇮🇱 have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s🇮🇱 teeth are blunted.’ Rather each will die for his own🇮🇱 iniquity: if anyone eats the sour grapes, his🇮🇱 own teeth will be blunted.” “BEHOLD, days🇮🇱 are coming” —it is a declaration of YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱 — “when I🇮🇱 will make a NEW COVENANT🇮🇱 with the HOUSE of ISRAEL 🇮🇱 and with the HOUSE of JUDAH🇮🇱 — not like the covenant I🇮🇱 made with their🇮🇱 fathers in the day I🇮🇱 took them🇮🇱 by the hand to bring them🇮🇱 out of the land of EGYPT 🇪🇬. For they🇮🇱 broke My🇮🇱 covenant, though I🇮🇱 was a husband to them🇮🇱.” It is a declaration of YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱. “But, this is the COVENANT I🇮🇱 will make with the house of ISRAEL 🇮🇱 those days” —it is a declaration of YE_HO_VAH— “I🇮🇱 will put My🇮🇱 TORAH🇮🇱 within them🇮🇱. Yes, I🇮🇱 will write it on their🇮🇱 heart. I🇮🇱 will be their GOD🇮🇱 and they🇮🇱 will be My🇮🇱 people🇮🇱. No longer will each teach his🇮🇱 neighbor or each his🇮🇱 brother, saying: ‘Know YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱,’ for they🇮🇱 will all🇮🇱 know Me🇮🇱, from the least of them🇮🇱 to the greatest.” It is a declaration of YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱. “For I🇮🇱 will forgive their🇮🇱 iniquity, their🇮🇱 sin I🇮🇱 will remember NO more.” Thus says YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱, who gives the sun as a light by day and the fixed order of the moon and the stars as a light by night, who stirs up the sea so its waves roar, YE_HO_VAH-TZVA'OT🇮🇱 is His🇮🇱 NAME: “Only if this fixed order departs from before Me🇮🇱” —it is a declaration of YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱 — “then also might ISRAEL’s🇮🇱 offspring cease from being a nation🇮🇱 before Me🇮🇱—for all time.” Thus says YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱: “Only if heaven above can be measured and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then also I🇮🇱 will cast off the offspring of ISRAEL 🇮🇱 —for all they🇮🇱 have done.” It is a declaration of YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱. “BEHOLD, days are coming”—it is a declaration of YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱 —“when the CITY 🇮🇱 will be rebuilt for YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱, from the tower of Hananel🇮🇱 to the Corner Gate🇮🇱. The measuring line will go out farther, straight to the Gareb Hill🇮🇱, then turn to Goah🇮🇱. Then the whole valley—the dead bodies and the ashes🇮🇱, and all the fields up to the Kidron Valley 🇮🇱to the corner of the Horse Gate🇮🇱 toward the east—will be holy to YE_HO_VAH🇮🇱. It will never be uprooted or thrown down again—forever.”

728,KjhMAMAPgeM,What I feel truly sorry is people who haven't lived life outside of constant conflict and war. You are only given one life and it was wasted for reasons beyond your control.

Not a word about Nasser closing of Tiran straits, which he knew to be a casus belli for Israel.
On the other hand, not a word about the 70,000 Egyptian soldiers stuck on the quagmire of the Yemen war, which the Egyptians could not use against Israel.
I'm not sure about the description of this war as a ""non-war"", or a goose chase. Israel had 776 killed and 4500 wounded, for a very small population."

776,xv_-B6uwpuU,Have you ever asked yourself if the Palastinians even want a two state solution? The first rule of negotiation is to underatand what each side desires
777,xv_-B6uwpuU,Saudi Arabia has repeatedly stated its affirmation that there must be a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital as a solution to the decades-long Arab-Israeli conflict.
778,xv_-B6uwpuU,Spoiler alert: No
779,xv_-B6uwpuU,"In alleys and streets, the voices rise,
Echoes of resistance, touching the skies,
From every corner, young and old,
Palestine’s story, bravely told.
 
Stone against might, hand in hand,
On this sacred, cherished land,
From dawn to dusk, they remain firm,
With every chant, their spirits affirm.

 In the heart of conflict, love remains,
Through the struggles, through the pains,
For in each echo, hope persists,
In the land where resistance exists."
780,xv_-B6uwpuU,"Don’t poke a bear with a stick, or better yet don’t poke a bear without a back up…"
781,xv_-B6uwpuU,"Four stages of repentance.  Stage 1, you realize that you done wrong.  Stage 2 there are feelings of guilt about your sins. Stage 3 you renounce your sin or turn away from it. Stage 4, you're restored that when repentance takes place"
782,xv_-B6uwpuU,"It's possible,  but Pali needs to agree to it"
783,xv_-B6uwpuU,Saudi Arabia was the country that presented the Arab Peace Initiative in 2002. What the statement indicated does not deviate from any attempt since then to give peace a chance.
784,xv_-B6uwpuU,"The land is so big, why cant both stay together in peace."
785,xv_-B6uwpuU,"Yes of course, il faut juste arrêter de se battre."

798,veMFCFyOwFI,"""Two countries always seem to be involved. Saudi Arabia and Iran.""

Of course, as an American website, Vox would never say the US is always involved as well"
799,veMFCFyOwFI,"as a middle eastern, i can comfirn its not so cold here..."
800,veMFCFyOwFI,"We need an update on this, and more specifically on the events in Afghanistan"
801,veMFCFyOwFI,6 years later this episode deserves a part 2
802,veMFCFyOwFI,"Country: *Has oil *

USA : Hey guys, wanna buy some democracy?"
803,veMFCFyOwFI,The conflict is so complicated that I sometime get confused and come again and again to watch this video.
804,veMFCFyOwFI,"I lost my cousin in this horrible war he didn’t actually wanted to go to fight, he was going to get married but he’s uncle told him to go imagine how the uncle feels every time he remembers him hope this ends soon."
805,veMFCFyOwFI,A complex yet somehow straight forward summary. It would be appreciated if you came out with an updated version of this conflict. Thank you!
806,0vwkfJb7FEc,"Being British, I cannot agree more with this old Iraqi saying : if two fish fight in the Tigris, the British are behind it."
807,0vwkfJb7FEc,"politics aside, I like seeing the borders move over time in all these vids; it really helps."
808,0vwkfJb7FEc,"4:50 - Israel did not withdraw from Sinai due to pressure of the Oil Embargo. It was the Egyptian President Anwar Al-Sadat who decided to announce a peace initiative and visited Israel. The following negotiations under the hospices of US President Jimmy Carter led to a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel. As a result Israel withdrew from Sinai and returned it to Egypt which paved the way to normalization and diplomatic ties between the two countries. This was the first peace agreement in the Israeli-Arab conflict and has since been in effect until this day. The peace makers, Mr. Anwar Al-Sadat and the Israeli P.M. Menachem Begin received in 1978 the Nobel Peace Prize."
809,0vwkfJb7FEc,"Thank you! This history is something we can go and reference today, as tragedies are continuing, and attempt to understand the extensive history behind what’s happening."
810,0vwkfJb7FEc,He is summing up one of the most complex situations of the previous century in less than 9 minutes. Of course things are going to be left out
811,0vwkfJb7FEc,Awesome map/year/narration combo. I never knew this progression on the history of the world. Thanks so much🙏
812,0vwkfJb7FEc,"The arab and jews: preparing for war against each other*

UK: Adios"
813,0vwkfJb7FEc,I haven’t read the comments yet but I’m sure everyone has an open mind and is accepting of everyone no matter their differences 😁😁😁
814,0vwkfJb7FEc,I pray for the peace and prosperity of ALL those living in that region.
815,0vwkfJb7FEc,"For completeness, you forgot the 1956 Sinai War, during which Israel conquered the Sinai peninsula for the first time and was forced to give it back immediately."
816,Hzntl-YJe04,"I'm a bit disappointed that the technologies of desalination were not mentioned, and how much the countries of the Middle East are turning to desalinating water from their seas and more water-saving technologies and practices than relying on the hydrologic cycle (rainwater, snowmelt, and groundwater) for human consumption."
817,Hzntl-YJe04,Glad they talked about water footprint. I’m lucky to live where water is available I hope some peaceful solutions can work out.
818,Hzntl-YJe04,This series is so great! I wish I'd known back in high school that geography could be so interesting
819,Hzntl-YJe04,"I'm always very proud of Crash Course for approaching difficult subjects with nuance and kindness. It's difficult to talk about issues that are contentious politically and it is impossible to be without bias, but I think that it *is* possible to talk about such things with kindness and consideration. While it is a tall order, I would encourage commenters to remember DFTBA."
820,Hzntl-YJe04,One of the facets of the conflict unknown to many.
821,Hzntl-YJe04,"6:09 - I know this is a heavy topic but I found the mention of snow kinda funny - this area gets an average of about 1 snow day a year, and even that only happens in the most mountainous parts."
822,Hzntl-YJe04,"This comment section might be this show's first flamewar! Yay! 🎉🎉🎉 Truly, this is the moment when Geography joined the Crash Course family 😌"
823,Hzntl-YJe04,"A great video, thanks for the info."
824,Hzntl-YJe04,"An interesting education, many thanks Allie with best wishes for you & the Channel."
825,B7FvF7DBI9s,“The Brits started it” is basically the history version of “Once upon a time”
826,B7FvF7DBI9s,'The brits started it' 😂😂😂 Got me rolling
827,B7FvF7DBI9s,First mistake was filling in the gap between the 2 lads taking a leak.
828,B7FvF7DBI9s,The biggest injustice in this sketch is they didn't let him take a piss in peace 😂
829,B7FvF7DBI9s,"All we are saying 
Is give piss a chance."
830,B7FvF7DBI9s,"""Peace in Northern Ireland was only achieved by the laying down of Arms."" Whoa. Kept that quiet Arms. A powerful man!"
831,B7FvF7DBI9s,The title seemed risky but I was pleasantly surprised by the end of it! Funny but full of compassion
832,B7FvF7DBI9s,"Oh wow! Hats off to you for picking that topic, getting your point across, and even making it funny in under 2 minutes!"
833,B7FvF7DBI9s,this is a beautiful example of how comedy can be made about any topic aslong as you approach it right
834,B7FvF7DBI9s,"As a half Irish half Jew who gets sucked into this conversation at least once a week, I support this skit. Well done lads 👏"
835,kbPnF8Hvj0I,I had no idea Israeli settlers were Americans. Says a lot about how they treat Palestinians there.
836,kbPnF8Hvj0I,The nerve of a foreign people flying half way across the world to kick out indigenous people from their homes for another foreign people. This is crazy
837,kbPnF8Hvj0I,"Is it just me or is watching those smug racists smiling while mistreating that family really, really frustrating? It makes the world seem so depressing. I've seen that type of smile before and every time that I do it's because someone is being bullied."
838,kbPnF8Hvj0I,"So sad, I’m so sorry for all the Palestinians who are suffering under Israel’s harsh regime. Everyone deserves peace dignity and respect."
839,kbPnF8Hvj0I,Thank you for exposing the utter arrogance of  American Jews and Israeli settlers to audiences like myself who once were ignorant to the plight of Palestinans. The Truth is knowledge and knowledge is power.  Keep up the good work.
840,kbPnF8Hvj0I,I am quickly losing respect for certain groups of people. Never thought I would feel like this 😢
841,kbPnF8Hvj0I,"Thank you for posting about what Palestinians go through, May Allah always protect them and ease their hardships! ❤️🇵🇸"
842,kbPnF8Hvj0I,"After years of being brainwashed, thank you Aj+ for showing me and most people like me in the rest of the world who is the real trouble makers and who we stand with and support moving forward."
843,kbPnF8Hvj0I,Imagine being an American Tourist and kicking people out of their homeland that you are just visiitng lol
844,kbPnF8Hvj0I,It’s time to revoke them as American citizens!!!!
845,O454c_qs5kI,"If you take the time to learn the history behind all this, in my opinion, the reason why there’s conflict between Israel & Palestine , it’s because of the British back during pre world war 1 to world war 2. The British made a lot of bad deals between the 2-nations which led to a big mess where it is today. Now England is just hiding in the shadow hoping no one brings up their old history presence in the Middle East."
846,O454c_qs5kI,"This is OK for a quick crash course, but it kind of conveniently left out a few things. Nothing on settlers? Nothing on the blockade of Gaza? It makes it seem like a two-sided territorial dispute without much characterization of what each territory is like other than ""densely populated."""
847,O454c_qs5kI,"I never thought Fox News would be the best source of information on a topic, but here I am"
848,O454c_qs5kI,Why are all these companies telling me to stand with Israel? No
849,O454c_qs5kI,"Good presentation and generally historically correct. What is missing in the conversation is the current apartheid mindset. For some 20 years Israel has segregated the Palestinians in two reservations (Gaza and the West Bank). In an effort to quell hatred of Israel and attacks - the Palestinians in these reservations face embargos and live in hopeless poverty.  Uprisings (intifada) happen regularly due the poor conditions in these reservations. These current acts of inexcusable terrorism by Hamas will bring even more oppression and misery to the Palestinians. That said, there will be no peace until both sides are willing to talk and compromise. As long as both sides see war as the only solution there will be only war."
850,O454c_qs5kI,So you focused on “Jewish being persecuted and fleeing Europe” but not “Palestinian forced out of their home en masse.” Let’s be objective here shall we?
851,O454c_qs5kI,"A nice attempt to explain what's going on ??
But some of the real important questions need to be answered?
Why did England want to create a State of Israel ??"
852,O454c_qs5kI,I am not a Fox fan but I see somewhat balanced news and comments. Great job gentleman
853,O454c_qs5kI,This might be the most comprehensive and intelligent explanation of anything I’ve ever seen on Fox News.
854,O454c_qs5kI,"The U.S. needs to stay out of it and fix our own issues. Then, we can (and should) help."
855,2CVoPLea5_Q,"As a Westerner, this is why in addition to western media outlets, it is important to tune in to non-western reporting like Al Jazeera to get an accurate summary of both sides of the story. That way, you will be best-informed when drawing your own conclusions."
856,2CVoPLea5_Q,"The families and children of Gaza bear the heavy burden of unrelenting pain as they endure the harsh realities of conflict. They suffer the anguish of losing loved ones to violence, their homes reduced to rubble, and their dreams shattered by the relentless cycle of strife. The echoes of explosions reverberate through their lives, leaving scars that run deeper than physical wounds. Amidst this turmoil, they grapple with fear, insecurity, and the trauma of an uncertain future. Their innocence is stolen by the harshness of the world they inhabit, and yet, they persevere with remarkable strength, seeking a glimmer of hope in the midst of the darkness that surrounds them"
857,2CVoPLea5_Q,"Hammas knew what they are doing, including consequences. Israel also knows what they are doing and consequences. Anyone else talking about this,possibly can’t influence their choices."
858,2CVoPLea5_Q,"Nothing is right with any of this... however- murder, rape and kidnapping is not the answer to any problem. You cant not kill people and say its justified."
859,2CVoPLea5_Q,"If you treat people like animals, you don't get to decide what kinda animals they become, lions or lambs."
860,2CVoPLea5_Q,They always seem to forget there's an Egyptians border for Gazan citizens too... but even Egypt blockades gaza because of hamas
861,2CVoPLea5_Q,Israel should remember history will repeat itself
862,2CVoPLea5_Q,"I try to be as neutral as possible on this issue, but only fools could not have predicted that after Hamas fighters entered Israel en masse and started kidnapping and murdering civilians living there. Israel will respond in a very harsh way. In addition, the attack by the Militants of a concert where young people were having fun will lead to public opinion in other countries turning away from Polestyn."
863,2CVoPLea5_Q,"Our prayers go out, and we pray for peace.🙌🙏🙌"
864,2CVoPLea5_Q,"On one hand, we have Hamas labeled as a terrorist group, while on the other, Israel is called a terrorist state. It's a peculiar kind of balance, don't you think?"
865,Y7a5Yww8mMc,"Correction - you said Palestinians ‘left’ their homes in 1948-
They were hunted down, killed, thrown out of their homes and  forcibly exiled.

Before 1946, Palestinians made up 96 % of the population.

Persecution, marginalisation, forced evictions, expulsions, - has lead to Palestinians being a minority in their own country."
866,Y7a5Yww8mMc,"Palestinians have a right to life🙏
Living in an open air prison for 16 years and being slowly suffocated to death slowly is evil. 
The religion that talks of being a mensch lives like the devil, I wouldn’t want that type in my country - maybe the world is waking up to what these people are really like…"
867,Y7a5Yww8mMc,I believe Buckingham palace is my home. . . Think I will move in.
868,Y7a5Yww8mMc,"From may 14 1948 to 2023 is over 5k year of history, you learn something new every day 🎉"
869,Y7a5Yww8mMc,"ITV clearly getting money from ""someone""... smh... You guys have barely covered the pain of Palestinians but quickly created all this propaganda in favour of Ees-ra-el with sad music and all..."
870,Y7a5Yww8mMc,I hope that the deceased will please restrain themselves 🙏
871,Y7a5Yww8mMc,Originated by British
872,Y7a5Yww8mMc,Such a biased report 😮
873,Y7a5Yww8mMc,Pls see Papal Bull of 1430 !
874,Y7a5Yww8mMc,Origin !? Don't you mean ORANGES ?
875,cGZE6Yh0X6M,This is the kind of stuff we need. Empowerment through knowledge
876,cGZE6Yh0X6M,Came across you on George Galloway's show (as I did with many other great people before). Thank you for everything you do Mohammed!
877,cGZE6Yh0X6M,"My grandfather (who was from a Jewish family told me most of this) 
I can't believe how many people don't know the basics of the ethnic history, politics, etc."
878,cGZE6Yh0X6M,I never realized how bad the Palestine people have it. This was a real eye opener
879,cGZE6Yh0X6M,"As a Jew I decided to force myself to listen to this historical conflict from a different perspective, thank you for this video 🙏🏽"
880,cGZE6Yh0X6M,This is by far the best youtube video content I have ever watched since the beginning of time! Thank you both for such a comprehensive accumulation of events in its true format with no toxic biases. May Allah reward both of you for the great work you bring the community and the world.
881,cGZE6Yh0X6M,As a Ugandan muslim I am greatfull that they didn't settle in Uganda . I am also sad to have  come to that realization after the the killings of many innocent Palestinians mostly children 😢😢😢😢
882,cGZE6Yh0X6M,This video is highly needed and welcomed. History is very important yet overlooked.
883,cGZE6Yh0X6M,Brother Hijab cooked hard with this one. Thank you bro 🔥🔥
884,cGZE6Yh0X6M,Much respect to Mohammed for using his platform to educate the audience about this complex issue. 👏👏 This is much needed.
885,wQmBsbt9blg,"As a Muslim, I want to request everyone on this platform to try to tell others around you that we need to respect human life and reject any ideology that supports the killing of innocent civilians. In this era of fake news, we need to be more careful because it is becoming increasingly dangerous everyday...  with rising polarisation around us, we need to reject hate and help people around us... 😢"
886,wQmBsbt9blg,"He's right about people becoming radicalised because of lack of peaceful economic opportunities, and how that's happening in the West, too. There's an old African proverb: """"The child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth""."
887,wQmBsbt9blg,"Social media has done nothing but cause me stress, full of hate, extremely polarised and tonnes of misinformation that nobody questions. This is exactly what i needed to see a well balanced and insightful view. Thank you and keep up the good work."
888,wQmBsbt9blg,He is so well - read and balanced. Such a pleasure to listen to such people. Gives me so much clarity on the situation. Thanks.
889,wQmBsbt9blg,I have been seriously avoiding clicking on anything that advertises that it’s going to cause any emotion in me. All week. I was rewarded by being served this interview in my feed. So grateful. Will rewatch and recommend to thoughtful people. Thank you.
890,wQmBsbt9blg,"Honest clarity, competence and rationality make this conversation measured and constructive. Thank you"
891,wQmBsbt9blg,Nice to hear a level headed intelligent person discussing the topic.
892,wQmBsbt9blg,"I'm so glad I came across this brilliant, insightful man. I hope we hear more from him."
893,wQmBsbt9blg,Mr. Bremmer just opened our eyes to all that has and is going on. Before this I believe most of our eyes were closed  to what really was happening and how it had and is presently playing out. Please no more mistakes. THANK YOU.
894,wQmBsbt9blg,A lot more than 1.1 million people need to listen to this. Thank you for this interview
895,H7FML0wzJ6A,I admit i am not the most knowledgeable on the Palestine-Israel conflict but I found it very interesting that is actually illegal to acknowledge the “Nakba” in Israel while also letting Israelis have all there rights but Palestinians aren’t given those same rights and live under martial law most of the time. I’ve been doing research recently and another thing I noticed is how the media shows every atrocity committed by Hammas yet the atrocities committed by Israel’s IDF are not shown also the death of innocent Palestinians is barely shown yet a single Israeli death or casualty is shown everywhere.
896,H7FML0wzJ6A,"Imagine that you are living in your land in peace...and someone comes and takes your land, demolishes your house, and steals what your ancestors earned in the past just because his religion tells him that this is your land...which religion accepts this crime?"
897,H7FML0wzJ6A,The least the world can do is learn and understand the plight of the Palestinian people and their decades-long struggle for freedom.
898,H7FML0wzJ6A,Rewatching this as a reminder of todays event in the middle east... People please learn ur history!
899,H7FML0wzJ6A,A 2nd Nakba is happening in Gaza right now as we speak!!! May Allah protect the Palestinian people and give victory to them
900,H7FML0wzJ6A,Everything the British touch has turned into chaos until today.
901,H7FML0wzJ6A,I've watched this series a bunch of times. This video series needs to be shown and viewed now more than ever!
902,H7FML0wzJ6A,One of the best documentaries on the history of Palestine. Historical documents and photographs are worth thousands of words
903,H7FML0wzJ6A,What a tragic story of human suffering
904,H7FML0wzJ6A,Am 71 i was always thought that Palestinians were the bad guys ty for enlighten me

907,ffRfIfGgjmw,"As a human i stand with humanity.
But things aren't that simple as you explained 😞"
908,ffRfIfGgjmw,"Dhruv, i watch each and every video of yours trusting that you and your team tries the best to get authentic and true information for us BUT this time i am really DISAPPOINTED that you have neglected what torture Israelis have been doing to Palestinians since a lot of years now. Gaza has just returned what they have been getting since a lot of years. I hope you see this message and know what the people of gaza have been through. People idealise you and trust you for authentic information, its your responsibility to please highlight the side of gaza too"
909,ffRfIfGgjmw,Those who are saying i stand with humanity i wanna ask them one question where did you go when kasmiri pandits were suffering from same situation
910,ffRfIfGgjmw,"We came across many videos where the Israeli forces targeted hospitals and refugee camps and many people  lost their lives especially children, this is not self defence it's clearly a genocide and infact innocent Palestinians are always tortured by the Israeli forces, it was heart breaking to watch how Israeli militants treated the elderly, women and children. I just wish for peace. May the almighty create ease for our brothers and sisters . I stand with humanity 🕊️🕊️"
911,ffRfIfGgjmw,Dhruv you should also talk about what is happening  right now in Gaza?
912,ffRfIfGgjmw,"*Jab tak majloom kamjor pr julm* *hota rha sab sakht dil chup dekhte rhe.*
*Jab jalim pe julm hua to sab ko* *insaniyat yaad a gayi* 🙂🙂"
913,ffRfIfGgjmw,"Many people are making videos and taking sides on the Israel-Palestine issue. They're reacting because Hamas attacked Israel, but there's concern that they didn't speak out when Israel conducted attacks. Good job, Dhruv. However, it's important to show the whole picture, including what happened before."
914,ffRfIfGgjmw,"To anybody reading this, I pray that whatever you constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind may clarity replace peace. And calmness fill your life.🌼"

925,7Jyc-LzXqk0,"This is the longest video I've ever published to YouTube, and I still feel like it's barely scratching the surface. The entire history behind this conflict is profoundly deep and complicated, so if you'd like to watch another 1-hour documentary covering all of the previous wars and conflicts between Israel and Hamas that led up to what's happening today, I encourage you to watch this video next on Nebula - https://nebula.tv/videos/reallifelore-modern-conflicts-israel-and-gaza-before-2023.

926,7Jyc-LzXqk0,"It would be really great to add subtitles in global languages like French, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, Spanish etc. for larger audiences to understand. My friends would watch this video but their English is not enough for this."
927,7Jyc-LzXqk0,Thank you for providing so much of the lost context that is plaguing media and social media. It's just a terrible situation nobody wants to properly deal with.
928,7Jyc-LzXqk0,Thank you for stitching together all these threads into a coherent narrative explaining this ongoing conflict and the geopolitical history and current policies behind it. I knew some of this from reading articles but you helped me understand how all of it fits together. Great job! Sadly you won’t learn much from American news.
929,7Jyc-LzXqk0,"As a Syrian citizen who is attempting really hard to stay objective and trying -again- really hard to tell the story in a non-biased way, I honestly think this is the most accurate video narrating the complexity of the middle-east as of now. I don't agree with the channel that this is barely scratching the surface. This is what I'm showing my friends when asked about the context. Foreign friends, Syrian friends, and whoever asks for context. You have no idea how easier this video made my life. I honestly, wholeheartedly, thank you."
930,7Jyc-LzXqk0,Really great video. I was scared to watch a heavily one-sided video but you mention a lot of topics and threads that keep it very interesting to watch.
931,7Jyc-LzXqk0,if you think i’m gonna watch a 1 hour long reallifelore video then you would be absolutely correct
932,7Jyc-LzXqk0,"This is the most comprehensive (though not the largest) and probably most balanced explaination of the Arab Israeli conflict that I have watched. This video should be getting WAY more views. As others have mentioned, it is hard to see why the algorithm is not pushing the video more."
933,7Jyc-LzXqk0,"I believe there's an important aspect you missed by not mentioning the Emirate of Transjordan, which is the part of Palestine occupied by Jordan. It's a topic that often goes unnoticed or undiscussed, and I find it puzzling"
934,7Jyc-LzXqk0,"This video was amazing, thanks for diving into the history, I'll go check out the nebula drop"
935,aBswCrpLSao,"This is complete human rights violation, totally disgusting, no one can stand this kind of oppression"
936,aBswCrpLSao,"This is insane, inhumane and terrifying. And what's even more insane is how the whole world slept on this all these years."
937,aBswCrpLSao,"How the hell can those soldiers invade the house of the Arab family, without being invited. Prisoners in their own home. Those settlers have to be removed!!!!! What happened to the rights of the Palestinians. They let the settlements grow and grow, they were supposed to be stopped from the beginning. This is so unjust!"
938,aBswCrpLSao,Wow.. I can’t imagine to loose your home and being humiliated. Thank you for replaying this. I hope more people will watch this to truly understand.
939,aBswCrpLSao,"I'm shocked how humans could treat each other this way....No matter what religion you are or where you live we should all be treated with respect and be able to live in peace..I live in California...I'm Mexican and born in the U.S...In the area I live I have friends that are Muslim, Jewish, African American, Philippino, Americans and Chinese..And we are all neighbors and help each other...I wish the whole world could live this way...We are all human beings and we all deserve freedom and peace"
940,aBswCrpLSao,"We express our gratitude to 60 Minute for organizing and presenting this program, which sheds light on the hardships endured by Palestinians. This platform provides an opportunity for people to gain insight into the challenges faced by this community. It is important to address the mistreatment they endure, as well as the complex issues surrounding terrorism."
941,aBswCrpLSao,Omg man asked to go to his city in his country 16times refused 16 times and he’s a powerful person imagine a normal poor family they have no chance
942,aBswCrpLSao,"Respect to the entire 60 minutes team for posting this video on this sensitive time, which sheds light on very important side of the conflict"
943,aBswCrpLSao,I hope more people clueless about what been going on for years watches this. This is the reality.
944,aBswCrpLSao,"Growing up in a diverse part of Houston TX, I never had any hate towards my Arab brothers, but I must admit that western Media had me thinking Israel was innocent. These recent atrocities are horrible, but I'm glad they have shed so much light on the truth and I have made it my mission to get the truth out and open other's eyes like mine were. Peace be upon my Palestinian people. Thank you for being strong, we won't stop fighting for you!"

947,K2zbN3AuHG8,"John, I know there's a very small chance you will ever read this, but I want you to know that seeing you back in the commander seat has brought me a deep nostalgic primordial happiness that few other things in this world ever could. Please keep being the incredible honorable lovable individual you are. *I don't have words to describe how much of an impact you had on my life and to see you back. So happy it's indescribable!*"

950,K2zbN3AuHG8,"The ""don't stay up all night"" line is incredible 😅"
951,K2zbN3AuHG8,Brilliant!! I love the idea of METO! ❤
952,K2zbN3AuHG8,wow. he's back. presenting the Daily Show. I'm not in the US; didn;t see this coming
953,K2zbN3AuHG8,"That pastor talking about an army of 200 million reminds me of ""what year did Fire Lord Sozin defeat the Airbender army?"""
954,K2zbN3AuHG8,Long live humanity!
955,a34zpFaoBoM,Doesn’t anyone find it strange that the most sophisticated intelligence agency in the world didn’t notice 100s of militants and 1000s of rockets being put in place just over the fence. This is either the biggest failure in military intelligence or it was allowed intentionally. Which is worse
956,a34zpFaoBoM,"On both sides, can we all agree this interviewer asked some terribly meaningless questions? “Do you think the enemy was bad? Do you think people helping the enemy should knock that off? Do you agree with people who agree with you?” 

Read the guys bio before you ask him book jacket questions. From that “interview” we learned nothing in depth. 

Most Predictable Interview of the Year Award winner here."
957,a34zpFaoBoM,"i laughed every time they say ""'Kremlin controlled media"""" as if our news arent the same XD"
958,a34zpFaoBoM,"The moment ,as an American, you’d rather hear from Putin instead of Biden 😂"
959,a34zpFaoBoM,I love how they really want us to believe they knew nothing about this 😂 I’m a stay at home mother and even I can see what’s going on here.
960,a34zpFaoBoM,I notice that alot of news stations are sending correspondents to israel but none to Gaza. If they belive what Israel is saying about their campaign in the Gaza strip the should go there and report the news. We know why theyre not.
961,a34zpFaoBoM,"Damn this reminds me of that Lenin quote ""There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen""."
962,a34zpFaoBoM,"I think there's a very fine line between a terrorist and a freedom fighter. As the adage goes, one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. Case in point, the late Nelson Mandela who opposed the oppressive apartheid regime of South Africa. Now the apartheid regime, as oppressors often do, frequently labelled Nelson Mandela as a terrorist, but to the rest of the World, he was a freedom fighter, who by the way said that South Africa can never be truly free until Palestine is free. So I think that as long as Hamas and the Palestinians continue to view Israel as an occupier and oppressor, they will continue to engage in what they believe is freedom fighting. 

What can Israel do to change this perception? Perhaps they can start to show more humanity and compassion to the Palestinian people. They can give them equal rights etc. Understand one thing, Palestine is extremely popular in the World and continuing to defy and deny it's existence is making Israel, and by extension, Jewish people, hugely unpopular in the rest of the World."
963,a34zpFaoBoM,He has no sympathy because he knows the history and the atrocities that got us all to this point.
964,a34zpFaoBoM,"The issue that people don't seem to understand is how this extermination was actually started and the reasons behind it. Though it's easy to point fingers and blame, society must begin to address the double standards that provoke such attacks to even begin and who it is that conducted the initial strike. The constant atrocities committed against Palestinians since 1948 have always been suppressed by Western media, though even the slightest form of retaliation in any form has always been seen as ""an act of terrorism."" Now before one can quickly choose a side, you must first understand that Hamas is not innocent in the slightest and does not follow the complex guidelines of war as ruled in the Quran though journalists must begin to stray from the demand of condemnation as it further enforces the double standards put in place. This inequity is supported by the shaming of Hamas as it suggests that while one side must be condemned, the other can run free of judgment, avoiding condemnation for the duration of their inhumane acts of violence towards the entirety of the localized Palestinian population. Universally, the expectation to condemn Hamas seems non-complex, though it proves to be the opposite in nearly every scenario when reflecting on the never-ending acts of the Israeli government. In no way does the Muslim or Arab population accept the actions of Hamas, though the barbaric response by Israel is not a response of self-defense but rather revenge. The redundancy in biased media coverage and the sympathetically neglectful approach from journalists toward Palestinian supporters comes at the cost of misinformation and provoking anger among the Muslim community, ultimately displaying them in a pessimistic manner. Overall, the action of blaming one party for the start of this conflict is harmful to not only the victims but in finding justice for those affected by said conflict. Neither side is innocent, though the extreme response and disregard for humanity by Israel has found its way to prevail even in this society, and their constant facade of innocence and victim must be overlooked. Finally, people must find sympathy for the dark history of Palestinian treatment by Israel as it's paramount to understanding the true reasons behind the merciless genocide being carried out against the Palestinians.  May the lost lives of all innocent souls be granted peace at last."

971,wZBE5j2kIgY,"Mind blowing narration ! With excellent graphics! I heard lallantop as well for this topic, but your narration was just SUPERB ! You gave the insight of this war from A to Z.  Thanks for sharing this, and good job research !"
972,wZBE5j2kIgY,We Stand against Oppression of Hamas & Palestinians on innocent Israeli 🇮🇱 Civilians. We Wholeheartedly Support Israel 🇮🇱 💙 ✊🏼
973,wZBE5j2kIgY,Well explained!👌🏻 Best video I have seen till date on Israel-Palestine. You've earned a subscriber here. 🤗
974,wZBE5j2kIgY,It is very sad and heart wrenching to see what is happening between Israel and Palestine. Both the parties should broker peace. History is replete with instances that even if one faction wins the war the price it would pay for it in terms of human loss is not worth it.
975,_Jj8vne0ca0,"Thank you so much to YouTube for making it possible to produce this important episode of Middle Ground. We want to say thank you to our participants but also to our audience for always enabling respectful and meaningful conversation in our comments. We know this discussion does not address all aspects or perspectives of this very deep and historical conflict, but we did our best to represent as many perspectives as we could.  For those of you that don’t know, Jubilee's philosophy for Middle Ground is to bring people together and have an open dialogue in order to develop a deeper sense of understanding and empathy. We hope you all enjoy :) If you felt as moved as we did by the conversation, please share the video to as many people as you can!"
976,_Jj8vne0ca0,"Arab (the Palestinian guy) saying, ""i hope we all live long and in peace"" not knowing what's gonna happen 4 years later (which is now) is heartbreaking. I hope they are all alive."
977,_Jj8vne0ca0,The Israeli guy... people like him are the reason this conflict will go on forever.
978,_Jj8vne0ca0,"The Palestinian guy, with all the pain in his eyes, he genuinely wants and needs peace."
979,_Jj8vne0ca0,"That Israeli guy is getting under my skin, kudos to the Palestinians because I’m sorry I could never sit in front of someone like that."
980,_Jj8vne0ca0,"I am neither Palestinian nor Israeli but I simply cannot imagine the amount of strength of character it would take to retain my composure being told my country was ""not your land"" by a comrade of the cell that murdered my little sister or my father."
981,_Jj8vne0ca0,"The fact that Hannah and Arab had family members murdered by IDF and had to sit in front of two IDF soldiers to find ""a middle ground"" isn't only ridiculous, it's inhumane"
982,_Jj8vne0ca0,"The Palestinian guy ""Arab"" had a lot to say, he wanted to say more but the language failed him but I felt his words."
983,_Jj8vne0ca0,The amount of entitlement it takes to look somebody in the face of somebody who basically said “I can track my family back 9 generations and they were still in Palestine” and say “that’s cool I can track mine back only 7 compared to your 9 and they were in turkey… But anyways that’s still not your land it’s mine” is SO INSANE.
984,_Jj8vne0ca0,I love the young lady who’s isreal she straight up said no it’s not our land. It’s everyone’s land . Have some goddamn empathy
985,W72zK9huR5g,I bet western media won’t show this… thats shameless
986,W72zK9huR5g,"This is the most childish army i have ever seen, who in their right mind supports this?!?!"
987,W72zK9huR5g,Shame on Israel for such brutal acts
988,W72zK9huR5g,Now they've shown their true colours. More so than ever. I feel so helpless right now.
989,W72zK9huR5g,Coward IDF....you only dare to toture those who can't fight you back. Free Palestine🇵🇸
990,W72zK9huR5g,Shame on Israel
991,W72zK9huR5g,These people are th most cruel I have never seen.
992,W72zK9huR5g,They claim that the Palestinians are terrorists 😂
993,W72zK9huR5g,"They call Palestine ""terrorists"" but look at this video

Edit: I JUST STARTED A WAR IN THE COMMENTS😭😭😭

Edit 2: I actually used to be Pro-Israeli but after I saw all of the videos of Gaza, I decided to support Palestine"
994,W72zK9huR5g,That is why the world is turning away from supporting Israel...
995,L_P1nbNPH3M,Just imagine living like that for 75 years
996,L_P1nbNPH3M,Children in Palestine took this as a daily routine
997,L_P1nbNPH3M,crazy that 2 million people are living like this man 24/7 right now as we speak.
998,L_P1nbNPH3M,"Mother to son : 

If you don't stop lying, you will grow up to be a CNN reporter"
999,L_P1nbNPH3M,Imagine living like that for 76 YEARS?
1000,L_P1nbNPH3M,"Run away and seek shelter: ❎️
Sit there and record yourself: ✅️"
1001,L_P1nbNPH3M,Imagine having the time to film yourself.
1002,L_P1nbNPH3M,Western Media so biased 😂
1003,L_P1nbNPH3M,"Now go interview a kid who lost all her family members, all except few of her siblings, and she has to become, a mum, a father, a sister, a grand ma, grand pa, aunt, uncle, cousin. A home while they have no where to hide, no food, no water, no safety."
1004,L_P1nbNPH3M,Palestian felt that everyday.

1007,7T6hu3OaLXI,Thanks for yur brief info.... Really appreciate yur effort yo acknowledge us❤❤
1008,7T6hu3OaLXI,💯% accurate information of past and guidance on the current situation better than abhi and niyu's content no hateful not one sided salute to you man great work 👍🏻
1009,7T6hu3OaLXI,"One of the best videos on this topic
Really very well explained Sir"
1010,7T6hu3OaLXI,"Moral: Differences in religious beliefs often lead to conflicts. Instead of adhering to texts from ancient times and believing something that you do not know. I wish for, Humanity to be the Universal Religion with only one fundamental principle: Respect for All Individuals."
1011,7T6hu3OaLXI,"As an Indian Christian🇮🇳 I stand with the TRUTH(BIBLE). 
🙏I pray for both Isreal🇮🇱 and Palestine🇵🇸 people especially those who have not accepted Jesus Christ to accept Him into their  hearts because JESUS CHRIST✝️ is the only solution to all the problems in this world."
1012,7T6hu3OaLXI,"Really interesting history..love you ❤ your chanel...Good luck 
From Uk"
1013,7T6hu3OaLXI,EVERY CHRISTIAN KNOWS THE FUTURE OF THIS WORLD ❤
1014,7T6hu3OaLXI,Very well explained. Also the speaker has an impactful voice. Many thanks
1015,sZAneAxW7j0,Here because of the recent bombings. Praying for everyone caught in the cross fire 🙏🏽🙏🏽
1016,sZAneAxW7j0,"""We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.""
 
 Martin Luther King, Jr"
1017,sZAneAxW7j0,"Innocent people should not be tortured, harrassed or killed as an act of vengeance."
1018,sZAneAxW7j0,"9 years later, it has escalated further. Innocent civilians paying the highest price on both sides. Break the cycle of hate. Let it end with you. Not because the enemy deserves it, but because your children do. Peace to all 🙏🙏"
1019,sZAneAxW7j0,"The trouble with this subject is that nobody agrees or wants to agree on the history of the area. As long as that's the case, there'll never be peace over there. I know that's an easy and essentially neutral position I've taken there but to actually voice a direct opinion on this subject is to light metaphorical fuse wire."
1020,sZAneAxW7j0,An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
1021,sZAneAxW7j0,After 9 years… this happened again 😢
1022,sZAneAxW7j0,"without the iron dome, Israel would probably have way more casualties. If 100's missiles were launched every year (possibly more), thousands of people would've died. But at the same time, Israel would've killed way more Palestinians in retaliation. This conflict is really sad"
1023,sZAneAxW7j0,Honestly this is my first deep look into this horrible and contradictory war. Praying for the innocent ❤
1024,sZAneAxW7j0,"Nice time to recommend this, Susan"
1025,YgfmcByKhOY,"Daniel and Abhijit are a fab combo.. too bad Abhijit had leave midway through this highly intelligent and insightful conversation.. As a history buff myself, I have a fair inkling of what's actually what in the Middle East.. As a Hindu, whose grandparents had to flee Bangladesh, or East Bengal, during the Partition, of course nothing about this issue comes as a surprise. What Israel and India need to do is create an effective counter narrative media to break the stronghold of ""leftist-liberal"" propagandists. Podcasts like this are a great way to create that counter narrative, but the MSM space has to be captured."
1026,YgfmcByKhOY,Excellent informative discussion... we want more of dan and abhijeet
1027,YgfmcByKhOY,I'm a Guyanese And Proud Supporter of Israel 🚩🇮🇳🇬🇾🇸🇷
1028,YgfmcByKhOY,Thanks Dan and Abhijeet. Terrific episode.
1029,YgfmcByKhOY,"I don't understand the hypocrisy of muslims...
Palestine belongs to muslims historically but somehow Kashmir belongs to Pakistan."
1030,YgfmcByKhOY,"This is actually a thing that I have always wondered about. When people keep showing images of kids in Gaza and Kashmir dying, I always wonder what were kids doing in these situations? Why were kids throwing stones at the army? Why were kids holding guns? And then, whenever I see protests in Europe, I always see people bringing their young kids, some even carrying babies to these protests. That tells a lot."
1031,YgfmcByKhOY,Wish Hindus could have such clarity on their historical enemies
1032,YgfmcByKhOY,Daniel bhai you should come to The Jaipur Dialogues.. Sanjay ji there would elaborate with you how fundamentalism in islam is the real culprit & how to directly counter them
1033,YgfmcByKhOY,Probably the best podcast on this topic
1034,YgfmcByKhOY,Daniel is pure sheer brilliance
1035,WDCkMkLvc-E,"OHH!!!  I am totally impressed with your discussion...so briefly so accurately 😱😱... subscribe done 👍👍 i will taste all of your videos from today, promised,keep on 🙏🙏, it was so confusing us to  understand the conflict of Israel and philistines.....thank you so much broo 👏👏❤❤"

1044,WDCkMkLvc-E,"All humans are equal, what separates them is geography and thought processes."
1045,aPI5TmdVZCk,"In my study of the Bible, I knew this relationship and in fact I always used to say that the war in that part of the world is between brothers!"
1046,aPI5TmdVZCk,Informative… thanks for sharing your wisdom I’ll keep following you.
1047,aPI5TmdVZCk,Very informative 🙏 please i want hear more part 2 🙏 god bless you
1048,aPI5TmdVZCk,"Absolutely correct... all  is accurate.  Ilove this documentary clips ❤
God Bless you.  Watching from Hong Kong."
1049,aPI5TmdVZCk,Wow thk you for that info feed me more plz ! Thk you for making this channel!❤🎉out in Trinidad 🇹🇹 👏 🎉❤
1050,aPI5TmdVZCk,A perfect narrative of the facts in complete accordance with the Holy Bible. It’s a complex problem that started thousands of years and made much more complicated with religious divisions. Brave hearts on both sides are required to come together and agree on a 2-state solution which will benefit millions of people living in perpetual fear and poor economic conditions. May God bless them to take the first courageous step towards establishing lasting peace in the region.
1051,aPI5TmdVZCk,"Very informative, thanks for sharing, I wish God interveins and bring back peace to the two brothers, am tired of seeing the killing of young and old."
1052,aPI5TmdVZCk,Very informative and interesting. Thank you for sharing 🙏

1086,W4gDfSNMRx4,History didn't start at October 7th
1087,W4gDfSNMRx4,"People living in independent countries, would not be able to understand the pain they were experiencing. They lost their childhoods, families, and many things in their lives to defend their homeland. They are forced to become adults and not be afraid of death from an early age.

If they could choose, they would want to live the same life as people in other countries live without having to hold a weapon."
1088,W4gDfSNMRx4,"I feel even more guilty to the people in Gaza (and now west bank) because I didn't quite outspoken about their situation since years ago. I didn't even care to dig deeper about the what was framed as complication in Gaza. My apology to Palestinians and all the casualties, alive or martyred.

1097,q2209nFlQLo,Thank you for taking the time to explain all these different influences and situations that are happening. Very informative.
1098,q2209nFlQLo,"It's a extremely horrific situation all around and what is more sad about all of this is that people who had nothing to do with any of this at all, are the ones facing the blunt of this conflict that they didn't asked for and are feeling incredibly helpless in this time, it's just awful man absolutely awful."
1099,q2209nFlQLo,"Yes Patrick, it's weird as hell to me too that so many of the Israeli protocols failed on that day! Reminds me of how so many things went wrong back on 9/11. None of those things would have happened on any other ordinary days. Very suspicious. Thank you for the history and your thoughts."
1100,q2209nFlQLo,"This ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict has about 51% of traders thinking it's a good time to invest in stocks, mutual funds, and other equity-based investments, despite Treasury yields and other safer cash-like investments paying big. I’m thinking of investing $400k into my stock portfolio but unsure about it"

1106,d5slJTFa-u8,"Random thought: Couldn't Egypt open its border to Gaza as a temporary refugee escape path from the war? Qatar, Saudi Arabia, etc. could all help fund such an operation.

These Muslim countries condemned Israel...but I haven't heard any of them actually do anything to help save Palestinian lives in Gaza."
1107,d5slJTFa-u8,Huge respect to journalists who put their lives on the line to report news.

1109,d5slJTFa-u8,"Deep condolence and sorry for innocent people (both Israeli and Palestinian) died in the conflict war between Israel and Palestine. Attack by Hamas should be condemned and cannot be justified. Capturing of Elderly people, Children and Woman, making them a hostage and using them for an advantage in the War is really shameful on the part of Hamas.

1139,EhbLy11U8x4,I'm not really sure. Maybe if we send them pallets of cash again. They'll tell us what they're spending their money on?

1141,EhbLy11U8x4,زنده باد ایران ☀️🦁🇮🇷
1142,EhbLy11U8x4,Better question would be what role does US weapons and funding play in all this🤔
1143,EhbLy11U8x4,and it’s definitely not weird that MSNBC won’t cover the Ukraine war like this.

1161,S3NV5taFoWc,"Even if Gaza is completely closed for good, there is still a 2 state solution since the Golan Heights and the Westbank remain."
1162,S3NV5taFoWc,Your explanation seems to gloss over the fact that the Palestinians turned down every previous plan for a two-state solution.
1163,S3NV5taFoWc,Very good and funny videos bring a great sense of entertainment!

1177,hXtzera0mkY,"""and then the king divided the land in twain"""
1178,hXtzera0mkY,Watching these Israel Palestine conflict videos I have come to the conclusion that Israel should control the land they currently occupy if it’s morally or politically correct is up for debate but that’s war. You take the land and protect it. If the Palestinians don’t like it they should leave the area with the assistance of the UN. I don’t see a peaceful solution here in favor of Palestinians I’m sorry but throwing yourselves against a military power isn’t going to help unless you win in war.

1194,htNfs-UeNvQ,"In 1921 May, the Jewish Communist and Socialist parties clashed with fists in Jaffa. Palestinian Arabs decided to add weapons to the fight, killing and pillaging.

It’s easier for human beings to be compassionate than war , this is what all 3 religions in Jerusalem has discovered for mankind and now that place , the Holy places in Jerusalem are giving the most negative messages to the world. It has gone fundamentally wrong and I have one blame , the internet is undermining the indigenous peace that has formed in that part of the World and has taught the world for thousands of years . There is a resonance that was discovered, whether it be under Roman Violence domination or anything that is similar to the Roman violence domination , that resonance is still there if people choose it , or if they want to choose to be cavemen , from thousands of years prior to that , they will fail , because the basic resonance of the Earth has fundamentally moved on from those times , written in your old book !"

1200,htNfs-UeNvQ,It feels as if this guy is deflecting and that he doesnt understand the conflict :S
1201,htNfs-UeNvQ,"It's funny how he did not mention what part the Germans, French, British, and Turks played in what has led up to today's mess.   I watched a documentary and a well known British man in the documentary acknowledged the shameful role the Brits played in the past.  There were several countries in the past seeking power and control in middle east.   Nor does this man describe how many Palestinians have died at the hands of Israel people.  Nor the unfair treatment the Palestinians have been subjected to over the years.  Palestinians and Israelite's come from the loins of Abraham.  They are brothers and should live in peace with one another, but people need to watch factual documentaries which details how they both have been lied to and deceived over the years and how other countries in the past were seeking control not just of the region, but of the vast assets in the middle east."

1252,km-ciyqmAus,So basically he opposes them having their own state. He wants to give them limited rights that Israeli's control. And he wonders why they keep getting attacked. You dont get to decide what another state thats supposed to be independent gets as a people.

1269,6Wj_j9aLxF4,"The events of the 1948 war of Jerusalem, which would lead to the founding of Israel, had been immortalized through the photographs of two war photographers, British and Palestinian. 

John Philip, the British photographer, was one of the first photojournalists in the world on the war in Jerusalem. His camera documents the Jews' perspective, the evacuation of thousands of Jews from the Old City of Jerusalem. Philip captures, for Life Magazine, the destruction of the Jewish Quarter of the Old City. 

Meanwhile, Ali Zaarour was one of the few photographers who took photos of the Palestinian side of the story. His photos had never been seen before his grandson discovered them and undertook a tremendous task to illustrate the catastrophe that this war was also for the Palestinians. The Naqba, the catastrophe and the darkest day, where 750,000 Palestinians lost their homes and became refugees."

1283,TJ2U-cjneNg,You'd also rush the food and water trucks when you're starving and dehydrated. Anyone would.
1284,TJ2U-cjneNg,Now we can understand why Aaron Bushnell has to that.  This is what he saw every day.
1285,TJ2U-cjneNg,Lord bless the innocent people 🙏
1286,TJ2U-cjneNg,If you told me this was footage from a zombie apocalypse movie I would believe it.
1287,TJ2U-cjneNg,That footage is deeply disturbing. So heartbreaking to see innocent folks tragically impacted by the turmoil. It's crucial that a peaceful solution is found.
1288,TJ2U-cjneNg,This is terrifying 💔🙏
1289,VpVvPNLY6hg,Move the settlements out.
1290,VpVvPNLY6hg,"Dr. Mustafa Barghouti is a great representative of the Palestinian people. As a Palestinian, I hope that he will represent us as our future leader. He is also a very endearing person."
1291,VpVvPNLY6hg,It is clear there is no intention from Israel to solve things unless they are forced through international pressure and sanctions. US is the biggest enabler of the impunity enjoyed by Israel 😊
1292,VpVvPNLY6hg,The people in the settlements will have to leave and the buildings turned over to Palestine.
1293,VpVvPNLY6hg,The Palestinian deserve to live like  a human being 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢May Allah shower his mercy upon you all my beloved Palestinian people ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
1294,VpVvPNLY6hg,"Absolutely remove 800k ""illegal"" settlers, they are illegal as she said. Absolutely remove any israel control....I do appreciate that she says as an American jew, it is not for her to say, that should be the position of all Jewish Americans"
1295,VpVvPNLY6hg,"it's impossible as long as US, UK, and EU supports Israel"
1296,VpVvPNLY6hg,Once Natenyahu goes to the ICC to face his punishment then the new government should work on a two state resolution
1297,VpVvPNLY6hg,"Two (2) states solution should be FAIR in order to work
= there must be a UN contingent forces and guarantor of peace in the boundaries of Palestine territory and Israel. 
= Gaza should have a territorial sea, including exploration of any resources therein not to be  controlled by any states but the state of Palestine.
= Gaza access to the sea and air should be free from intrusion of Israeli forces or government."
1298,VpVvPNLY6hg,I personally would not welcome Isrealies near me. I don't expect the Palestinians to welcome living next to them after all they've done either.

1304,9wWer4c3htI,"It's really very simple: Whatever Israel and the IDF accuses Hamas of doing, is what they have been doing!"
1305,9wWer4c3htI,The mainstream media has lost its credibility. I've unsubscribed from all of them. Kudos to Alhazeerah and these rising independent media coverages.
1306,9wWer4c3htI,"Look at the irony, these people were tortured like this once and the very people has given them shelter they're doing the exact thing to them. They've not learned from history."
1307,9wWer4c3htI,"As one father said, "" thanks, Israel and the western Media for showing the world who you are and what you do"
1308,9wWer4c3htI,The silver lining in this horror is that the world at large is experiencing in real time the very heart and hypocrisy of the Jewish state and its enablers...this will never be forgotten

1330,NgVXIBj905w,When one side of a fight is forced to destroy proofs to defend its narrative you know on which side to stand.
1331,NgVXIBj905w,"I live in Trinidad 🇹🇹, I'm accustomed to the multireligious traditions of Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, Sikh and Buddhist buildings, people and hearing the various prayers. All I can say, if my people can share an island, and your people can share a nation, perhaps Muslims and Jews can share the site. Is not the site large enough for a Mosque and a Temple as they are all Abraham's children. To share is better than fighting."
1332,NgVXIBj905w,I find it very strange that the Muslims holy book doesn't even mention the word city of Israel.
1333,NgVXIBj905w,I learned a lot here - specifically the role of that rock in Jewish tradition - and the excellence of your presenting skills (Mr. Narrator) is an honor to the Nations.

Murtaza's logic is unbelievably reasonable; Yair provides a very logical counterweight as well. I was in Damascus watching an israeli airstrike unfold before my eyes as the sky turned sunset-orange at 9 pm on a winter night. I was shaking and in tears a few hours ago, and now after this conversation I'm like yeah, the METO thing could actually work. Thank you all for making me feel like this is not an impossible case again. Thank you; you have no idea how much more comfortable with being at a warzone this makes me feel. Appreciation."

Kudos to Murtaza Hussain and Yair Rosemberg for showing the world that there are no boundaries to friendship and goodwill. Also for showing that the only magic in great journalism is honesty and integrity.
1409,wznD7uCEcLk,There is something so comedic about the fact that the best news you will get about the nuance of Israel Palestine foreign policy is from a tv channel called Comedy Central.

1413,wznD7uCEcLk,"I am grateful to the Comedy Central network for allowing this platform at all. Newscasters and reporters on major networks often face massive restrictions on their topics. Also, it must be said, few on camera reporters have the brilliance of Jon Stewart in breaking down complicated issues in ways that guide his audience into understanding them, while also offering them a choice to learn new and broader ways of thinking. I am so glad Jon is back at the helm of the Daily Show. Thank you to anyone and all who are responsible for that!"

Above all, it is the soldier who yearns most fervently for peace, for it is they who endure the gravest injuries and carry the enduring scars of conflict within their souls._

1451,To410lvuo30,"Jabotinsky, the radical Lehi (The Irgun) and later the Likud party of Begin, Shamir, Sharon, Netanyahu... first came to power in 1977. From 1948 to 1977, Israel was essentially a socialist, labor government. Since 1977, it privatized much (but not all) of its economy and the ruling party now switches between Likud and Left (formerly Labor) with configurations of coalition parties."

1458,QkblP7cxMAI,Israel has a right to defend itself from women and children
1459,QkblP7cxMAI,They have drone footage. Release all of it. Show us the truth if you're so certain of what happened. I want to see the whole thing and then we'll decide what the truth is.
1460,QkblP7cxMAI,This is completely insane. How is this allowed to happen? These people are not treated like human beings. Even ants have more dignity.
1461,QkblP7cxMAI,I am speechless and feel sick 😢 God help these people and help bring those Israel military responsible under arrest for war crimes..we in the UK and America are complicent in this murder as we supplied the weapons!

1467,CmJ9Y9mzRdk,This sounds more like ethnic cleansing not eviction
1468,CmJ9Y9mzRdk,"It's very important to understand that being anti-zionis or being critical of Israel does not equate to being antisemite, lumping all Jewish people into one ideology and one way of thinking is antisemitic. And something that not many people are aware of is that, Arab people are also Semites"
1469,CmJ9Y9mzRdk,Enough already!  No more arms or money to Israel! Full stop!
1470,CmJ9Y9mzRdk,"Thank you for candor. We need to keep the pressure on Biden to do something. Gaza is being decimated. I don't understand how anyone could think these attacks on civilians are ok.

1482,trEgxKWpviU,Thank you for making this video. As a Filipino we opened our doors to many Jews back then when no country wanted to accept them. They lived in an island and were treated well they even helped the community as well. This video is heart breaking on both sides and does put light in the current situation. Thank you.

1486,0BasXaiHiiI,My family comes from France. Does that mean I can roll up in Paris bulldoze the Eiffel Tower and build my house there?
1487,0BasXaiHiiI,"Very interesting. However, several studies using genetic tests show that the Palestinians have also lived in the area for thousands of years and they share the same genes with the bronze age people (Canaanaites) who lived in the region thousands of years ago. Also, it is possible that Palestinians today include Jews who converted to Christianity and Islam over the ages,"
1488,0BasXaiHiiI,I have a coin from 1939 from Palestine... It's awesome how it's written both in Arabic and Hebrew... Shame that people would prefer to fight than be together...
1489,0BasXaiHiiI,"When asked about Israel and Palestine, Israeli advocates go as far back as 3000 years ago to make you forget about what’s happening now 😂"
1490,0BasXaiHiiI,"Many Palestinians and Jews are actually genetically related. Of course not all of them, but many are related as modern Palestinians are a mixture of ancient Israelis, Greco-Roman and Arabs."
1491,0BasXaiHiiI,"and thus the conflict between ""this is my ancestors land"" vs ""this is my land now"" goes on ...."
1492,0BasXaiHiiI,Will there be a sequel video to what happened after 1948?
1493,0BasXaiHiiI,"Eh, where is the part about the weird pre world war II statement called 'The Balfourt Decleration'? 

'The Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 during the First World War announcing its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine, then an Ottoman region with a small minority Jewish population. The declaration was contained in a letter dated 2 November 1917 from the United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Lord Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, for transmission to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. The text of the declaration was published in the press on 9 November 1917. '"
1494,0BasXaiHiiI,"Pretty well researched, but you failed to mention that Cassius Dio in his works on Roman History admitted that Palestina is Judea.  Good catch on palaistís meaning wresler in Greek."

European Jews were gently expelled from British soil. then forced to take the land of Palestine as a place for European Jews with various beautiful scenarios. It would be better for the Israeli Zionists to return to British soil, asking for some land to build a country there or to the land of the USA which has such a large area. live a comfortable life there. If England and the USA don't want to accept European Jews or Israeli Zionists, what does that mean? please translate it yourself. It's just difficult to live in Palestine, which is full of discomfort. let the Palestinian people be independent, manage their own land or the territory of their own country. let's live in peace, no more colonialism, because it always has a bad impact on world life. is this statement wrong???"

But at the end of the day as long as extremists exist on both sides to derail peace in their chase of their own all or nothing goals and ambitions, peace will never be possible. 
In conclusion, people on both sides will continue to die and suffer because extremists on both sides take up an all or nothing attitude. It is perhaps the saddest situation of the 20th and 21st centuries."

1614,Tz7JJcO-rWw,"I’ve searched and completed multiple pieces of research on this topic. Once you and understand what happened, it’s not hard to side with Palestinians. This is Britains fault and they should be the one cleaning up this mess."
1615,Tz7JJcO-rWw,"And now Britain seems to have forgotten about this declaration, behaving as if they have nothing to do with the problems in the region. What an embarrassment to humanity they are. 😂"
1616,Tz7JJcO-rWw,"Fascinating account, well put together video. 

One must not forget either, that In the First World War (1914–1918) the British sided with the Arabs to fight against the Ottoman Empire of that time. The Ottoman Turks lost that war and both Britain and France alongside the US had a meeting in Paris in 1919 where it would be decided what the fate of Turkey's lands would become in the Middle East.

The Arabs had been reassured that if they fought against the Turks, they would be given their own empire and land on which  they could rule and govern. This promise was BROKEN however, by the British at the so called 'Peace Conference'. The subsequent Arab lands ended up in the control of both Britain and France and would remain so up until they believed the Arabs were ready to rule them themselves.

To get to the depth of this period of history, one must understand the involvement of Jews in all of this. You see, the history of the Jewish people stretches back a very long time and that is not surprising as its one of the oldest Abrahamic faiths extending its origins to even before Bibical times.  When the Roman empire was reigning supreme and controlling large swathes of territory stretching from Europe to the Middle East, the Jews lived in and around a region what is now commonly called Palestine.  They were driven out of there by the Romans around 70AD and as a result Jews would migrate around the world and settle down where they could. This would happen over the course of around two millennia.

Eventually at the end of 19th Century, a man named Theodor Herzl, an Austro-Hungarian Jewish lawyer and Political activist became the pioneer and founded of what we refer to as 'The Zionist Movement'. 

The idea behind the Zionist movement was simply to establish a Jewish homeland, with Zion meaning 'promised land'.  It just so happened that this 'promised land' would be smack bang in the middle of modern day Palestine. Theodor Herzl advocated and staunchly believed that it was the place God intended the Jews to live.

Sometime around 1917, Lord Balfour, a British Government Ministor promised that the British Government would assist the Jews in establishing a homeland in Palestine. This became known to the world as 'The Balfour Declaration'. 

Ultimately what this did was put Britain in a complicated situation since this very same land was initially promised to be handed back to the Arabs, land which it must be noted never belonged to the British, the French and certainly not to USA."
1617,Tz7JJcO-rWw,"i still find it hard to understand how, why and where the british gets the gall to believe that they have power to declare something, especially one that affects the lives of a nation. why do the europeans in general feel that they're entitled to ""own"" the rest of the world and its resources? makes me wonder how the world would have been if the europeans did not exist."
1618,Tz7JJcO-rWw,Can you talk about who the Rothschilds are and why the Declaration was addressed to them??? 🤔🙄😬🤭🤫🤐
1619,Tz7JJcO-rWw,Explained in best ever possible way - Thank You
1620,Tz7JJcO-rWw,The Jews also promised to bring USA into ww2 if Britain gave Palestine to them.
1621,Tz7JJcO-rWw,"Great video. ""Why the mid-east bleeds"" by Ted Pike is a great watch too. Very telling!"
1622,Tz7JJcO-rWw,Good video but really annoying and distracting music.  Why don't people think we can listen to something without a noisy background??
1623,Tz7JJcO-rWw,"At that time the British Foreign secretary was seen as the most powerful person in the world, basically in charge of the British empire."
1624,CoFjbnvkmQ0,More information on how to get involved here: https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2022/02/israels-system-of-apartheid/
1625,CoFjbnvkmQ0,Why is this shadow banned? Why is it age restricted?!!! The whole world needs to see this. Enough Censorship.
1626,CoFjbnvkmQ0,"They have only scratched the surface, but it is good that they are finally acknowledging it.  Too bad the media is so dedicated to covering this kind of stuff up when it comes to west-friendly nations."
1627,CoFjbnvkmQ0,"And of course any criticism on Israel is immediately reframed as anti-semetism. While Palestinians suffer, the Israeli state is playing identity politics."
1628,CoFjbnvkmQ0,Finally it is recognised as it is. It is cruel apartheid.
1629,CoFjbnvkmQ0,I’m Palestinian and I’m so emotional and moved just to see an organization like yours recognize the atrocities and human rights violations occurring against my people since the inception of the theocratic ethno-national apartheid state that is Israel. Thank you for reporting the truth! Free Palestine! 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
1630,CoFjbnvkmQ0,why is this age restricted? This is something you should watch as a young individual in history class. This is a definition if Apartheid.
1631,CoFjbnvkmQ0,Stand against the lobbyist in  your country
1632,CoFjbnvkmQ0,Thank you for speaking out. Israel still keeps trying to shut down criticism of their actions by throwing the term “anti semitism” around… When they’ve literally made it impossible for non ethnic Jewish people to apply for Israeli citizenship.
1633,CoFjbnvkmQ0,"Kudos to Amnesty International for finally siding with the truth, despite being a conservative institute. Side with history as it is unfolding."

1644,KPLhQNlaOnw,norman finkilstein also challenged ben.  called him a liar and criminal.  and said that ben only likes to argue with students in second trimester.
1645,KPLhQNlaOnw,Ben has never been in any sort of violence to understand war. Now he's a keyboard warrior.
1646,KPLhQNlaOnw,Ben needs to understand the majority of the people don’t want war. Lobbyist do.
1647,KPLhQNlaOnw,"""Self proclaimed toxic masculinity king"" bruh the propaganda is insane"
1648,KPLhQNlaOnw,"""Self proclaimed toxic masculinity"" I bet my tongue, Tate never proclaimed himself  as that ."
1649,KPLhQNlaOnw,🚩Andrew Tate never said “Self proclaimed toxic masculinity”. He was being sarcastic and making fun of people saying that about him. The Hill obviously has made that mistake. 🤢🤮😑
1650,KPLhQNlaOnw,Ben Shapiro the type to remind the teacher about homework...
1651,KPLhQNlaOnw,"It's a beautiful thing to see American Conservatives ask ""well why should we give Israel money when we have x problems at home """
1652,KPLhQNlaOnw,I can’t stand Tate but I’m all for his views on this. Ben is a joke regardless of topic 😂😂
1653,KPLhQNlaOnw,Tate is 1000 percent right about the little grabbler.
1654,ZfNbxVa3YLo,Man..piers started by saying that Hamas beheaded babies in a village but he denied that he ever said this while interviewing the guy with the Palestinian wife
1655,ZfNbxVa3YLo,"Ain't no way Piers tries to convince us he's neutural in other interviews. He's a completely different person here, no interruptions, letting ben speak as he please"
1656,ZfNbxVa3YLo,"I know this interview was a while back. But I just finished the Andrew Tate interview Piers did, and you can tell a whole different side of journalism and professionalism when you compare the two. No interruptions and even let’s Ben finish a sentence, take a breath, and wait for Ben to get ready before asking another question. Just crazy the interaction. Prayers for all."
1657,ZfNbxVa3YLo,"""Piers Morgan *_vs_* Ben Shapiro."" Riiiiiight. 😂"
1658,ZfNbxVa3YLo,Piers in his most behaved episode.
1659,ZfNbxVa3YLo,"“I know what America is,” Netanyahu said. “America is a thing you can move very easily, move it in the right direction. They won’t get in the way.”"
1660,ZfNbxVa3YLo,"15 seconds in, he said the lie about babies being beheaded . Yet he told Bassem yesterday he never said that. Outrageous."
1661,ZfNbxVa3YLo,Pierce did mentioned “ decapitated  babies in some villages” and strongly denied it on the other interview.
1662,ZfNbxVa3YLo,17:50 Bassem quotes exactly what he said
1663,ZfNbxVa3YLo,"The headline ""Piers Morgan vs Ben Shapiro"" is totally wrong. It should rightfully be ""Piers Morgan and Ben Shapiro"", because they are on the same side."

It's like where I used to work, two guys got into a verbal dispute and ""in order to protect himself"" one of them punched the other guy... only, he punched him first, he was the only person who threw a punch, and he punched twice."
1691,dy56Q1a0Flc,"It always amazes me how western media seems to focus on minor insignificant issues like ""trans in which bathroom"" and ""this celebrity said the n-word 15 years ago"" 

while simultaneously ignoring real large-scale suffering and exploitation happening right next to their noses. Humanity is in shambles."
1692,dy56Q1a0Flc,"My dad was 13 years old and lived in Gaza when the 67 war happened. He can speak in great detail when the Egyptians left and the Israelis took over. His dad, aka my grandfather had his village hit by Haganah and managed to escape into Gaza where other family members lived. My dad and other family members would always say he was very stoic and would press the Israelis during the occupation and escaped death many times. One day my dad asked his dad why he didn't stay and fight during the Nakba, then my grandad had tears running down his face and all he said was ""You have no idea"". My dad said it was the only time he ever seen him cry. It always made my mind spin and wonder what exactly happened that day, how bad it truly was."

1740,tLv6u3kb-ds,"This presentation was very informative, thank you!  The Catholic bishops have asked the faithful for a day of prayer and fasting on Tuesday, for peace. 🙏🙏🙏"
1741,tLv6u3kb-ds,A Catholic take is what I've been waiting for in decades.
1742,tLv6u3kb-ds,"Thank you very much for this presentation.  This is my first time to see your site.  I am a Filipino Catholic.  Very much confused about all this violence in the Middle East.  I have been trying to understand this situation, from the historical point. I would love to have more views on these."
1743,tLv6u3kb-ds,"Thank you for this video. I am very confused as a Catholic about this situation.  I have heard stories on both sides. Some from other Catholic sites that seem to be so filled with hatred over this. Your video is the one constructive video I have seen so far that lays out the history in a very informative and easy to understand way. Seeing as you come from a Jewish background, you seem to be in a much better position to give an unbiased assessment. Your video has helped me understand things in regards to the Israel side that I did not know before or quite frankly heard the complete opposite. I intend to listen again as there is much to digest. I am so happy to have just come upon your channel! God bless you, sir!"
1744,l_c3QVjjmwc,"Moshe Dayan was asked if the IDF was the world's best army. ""No way to know,"" he replied. ""We only fight Arabs."""
1745,l_c3QVjjmwc,"The IDF actually had about 450,000 reservists wanting to take part in this war, but had to turn some of them away since they decided they only need 300,000. people kept insisting they want to help"
1746,l_c3QVjjmwc,"When you look at the technology they utilize, it makes it even harder to understand how Hamas breached their border using some tractors and motorcycles. Even if Israel intelligence didn't see this coming, I don't understand how Hamas was able to physically ingress so far into Israel."
1747,l_c3QVjjmwc,"The reason why our army is the best is because we don’t have a choice but win.. we fight for our survival. We all, in Israel, pray for peace!!"
1748,l_c3QVjjmwc,"Here are some more unstated reasons for the IDF's success.
1. Everyone who is conscripted starts off as a private. No one begins as an officer. All the generals started as privates.
2. One can only move up in rank based solely on merit. All soldiers are taught to think independently to solve situational challenges and think ""outside the box"".
3. Rank is secondary. All officers are encouraged to listen to subordinates for other ideas. The old concept of ""4 heads are better than one"".
4. Because the IDF conscripts from the entire eligible population, it has the ability to discern the various skills and talents of their recruits and place them in those forces that best match their intelligence and skill sets.
5. Officers always lead first in a fight. That's why their officer casualty rate is higher than other armies.
6. They have to win because they have no other choice."
1749,l_c3QVjjmwc,Loved the scriptwriting and in-depth information in this video. Great work!
1750,l_c3QVjjmwc,"Respect. We had Israelis here in Australia, women and men, jumping on planes to go back and volunteer to protect their home land the day after the Hamas atrocities. That from the heart devotion to their country is something other countries should take note of."
1751,l_c3QVjjmwc,Note that they are not even professional soldiers. All citizens are trained to respond and are in a rota to defend their country. Its incredible 😎👍💪
1752,l_c3QVjjmwc,"Finally giving Israel her due. Israel isn't fighting for her Image, Isreal is fighting for her life. That is the difference."
1753,l_c3QVjjmwc,Do they have plasma rifles in the 40 watt range?
1754,CBRhhw5Afoc,5 years since this video and it's still the same situation 💔
1755,CBRhhw5Afoc,That was dope. I feel like the crowd didn’t appreciate this as much as they should’ve.
1756,CBRhhw5Afoc,Commenting on this so that more people can see this. Praying for peace and truth always. 🙏🏼 🤍
1757,CBRhhw5Afoc,Oh. My. God. This. Honestly this the the best palestinian related comedy I have ever experienced. Such great pun and jokes full of courage and pain. My first time hearing your comedy and I'm a fan. Thank you for doing this. You are hilarious and authentic.
1758,CBRhhw5Afoc,"""Why are you settling""
😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂"
1759,CBRhhw5Afoc,I think it’s healthy and good to take a serious and complicated topic like Israel/ Palestine and crack a few jokes about it. It can ease the tension on a difficult debate.
1760,CBRhhw5Afoc,"I watched this a year ago and I found it again, it's still too funny. ""This can not be real"", ""No this Isreal"". LMAO"
1761,CBRhhw5Afoc,This is the tenth time I'm watching it and the fear the beard line still has me choking. Also the rocks and land part 😂
1762,CBRhhw5Afoc,So many punch lines to people who have human values.
1763,CBRhhw5Afoc,I hope that you and the Israeli Woman are still together cause we need more people like you!!

France: Sounds legit"
1765,IQcmfxO-to0,"As an Israeli who has studied extended history, I have to say that this is the most objective video I have seen about the conflict, telling the honest facts in a neutral way without taking sides and mixing narratives"
1766,IQcmfxO-to0,"Story telling & editing are all really good! Most importantly, it states just facts without prejudice."

1768,IQcmfxO-to0,"You know when I saw the Hebrew writing I thought this was going to be incredibly biased, but you actually tell the events of which that unfolded and do it from a neutral standpoint with jokes. Great job"
1769,IQcmfxO-to0,"so what did we learn in this video?
all the situation is Brittan's fault"
1770,IQcmfxO-to0,"Nobody:

1771,IQcmfxO-to0,"Oh yes, the holy land, land of controversy all over the world"
1772,IQcmfxO-to0,Incredible explanation. It connects alot with things I read in the internet regarding this controversy . Your effort is much appreciated and I hope you get your deserved recognition!

1774,8f6XZedkO-Y,"Beeped the sui**** word because of YouTube's restrictions. 

I could not cover the entire conflict in one video. For the history of the conflict:

Vox has made amazing videos in English on the conflict:

1775,8f6XZedkO-Y,"Bhai as an Indian who is a descendant of a Jewish grandmother who escaped the holocaust and married an Indian Hindu soldier, India has been so kind to the Jewish people, For Thousands of years the Jews were prosecuted for being Jewish but for the past 2000 years the Jewish people have never faced persecution in India. Your coverage as with many things is so accurate. I appreciate your balanced take from both sides. The ground operation will be like the war in fallujah, traps, leading soldiers into choke points, it will be terrifying."
1776,8f6XZedkO-Y,"Ever since the start of this conflict I’ve consumed a fuck ton of content on this topic. Yours has been one of the most informative one, especially about the popularity of hamas, elections and ground offensive of israel.

Unfortunate part about all these events is that innocent civilians are bearing the brunt of terrorists’ actions"
1777,8f6XZedkO-Y,"As a Human being,I stand with the innocent people of Israel and Palestine. Hope this type of conflict end soon and our mother Earth smile with peace 😢❤"
1778,8f6XZedkO-Y,"Mohak, you're the kind of person that teaches people things without making them feel dumb for not knowing them already.A huge thumbs up to my most favourite content creator on YouTube currently ♥️👍"
1779,8f6XZedkO-Y,"A bitter truth is that wherever there is war or conflict in anywhere, the common man and the poor always suffer losses
I'm only with humanity ❤"
1780,8f6XZedkO-Y,"I think you are missing a few points here. Afghanistan is huge compared to Gaza. It's distance from the US is large as well. Logistics are much different compared to Israel and Gaza. Also it has been a decade since 2014 ,if Hamas has learned more about a ground invasion, so has Israel. The relative improvement in technology is vastly superior for the Israelis."
1781,8f6XZedkO-Y,"I was genuinely waiting for your video, so many youtubers have already uploaded videos about this topic but I want to learn it from you 😄"
1782,8f6XZedkO-Y,"Wonderful job, Mohak. And thank you for the video. Sometimes, I need to rewatch the video for a second time to process the information, it's almost like taking a history or politcs course, which I am happy and glad to take in this form from you. It teaches how complicated are issues in middle east, and as you said, it is easy to post something random on social media, but takes time and effort and good resources like yours to form a meaningful understanding.

Also, could you go little back into the history and make a video explaining how the divide between Israel and Palastine came about in the first place? Thanks again, Mohak, for doing a great job as always."
1783,8f6XZedkO-Y,"Why bcci video has been deleted? It's showing copyright issue .. I watched it yesterday and I shared the video to my frndz , now they can't able to watch it"
1784,ma6rSidgIQ4,"For years I understood the US strategic interest in Israel was  to have a base in the middle east to protect the strategic Oil assets in the region. Question. If Saudi  Arabia Iran  Syria Iraq  and  other major energy producers in the region align with China and Russia, why on earth will we be supporting  Israel?  In a petrodollar world, the region is the ""Fort Knox"" of the Petro dollar. ""Tradition?""    Once they start selling Oil for Rubles Yuan and Rupees, we will see some changes here."
1785,ma6rSidgIQ4,"Wion should be reporting,- not offering opinions or taking sides"
1786,ma6rSidgIQ4,"I still cannot understand why, If the people go into a place to worship, why can't they stay as long they want and leave whenever they're ready. Why should police be involved,? unless there's a violent disturbance or some crime. Something here not making sense to me"
1787,ma6rSidgIQ4,Just a footnote- a soldier hearing fireworks go off they will assume they are bullets. I know I would.
1788,ma6rSidgIQ4,This is a start of something awful. When will we ever  learn
1789,ma6rSidgIQ4,You are doing a good job by making appear what you say in a written form
1790,ma6rSidgIQ4,"""Let's remember how it all started 2 days ago""
No lady,  this didn't ""start 2 days ago""
It started in 1948."
1791,ma6rSidgIQ4,"So, she says at 4:10 that there is no ""evidence"" that they had ""fire arms"" while they show an image of multiple 25-count  boxes of expended mortars. Those are lethal projectiles. How would you take it if someone lit that and shot it at you? It gives the police the right to use real bullets against you, but instead they chose to use rubber bullets and stun grenades to show mercy and restraint for the worshippers. They had every right to shoot and kill the people who shot those mortars at them. You're complaining because they got their asses beat afterwards? They could've been dead! Shows that your narrative is pro-muslim and they can do no wrong. They knew they had a timeframe, and other people have the right to worship there as well. They chose to barricade themselves in there to deny others their right to worship. Sounds kind of like the current state of America, where the trans people and alphabet brigade can do no wrong. Why does the media side with the sadistic instead of the 80% of common people who just want truth to reign and to live life righteously."
1792,ma6rSidgIQ4,Prayers
1793,ma6rSidgIQ4,Let’s assume the soldiers were correct stone and fireworks were taken inside the mosque. Nothing would have happened if soldiers wouldn’t storm the mosque as they have done in the past years. Stone and fireworks were to protect them in their thoughts.

1804,8S8U0iL6G90,The Iron Dome is pretty impressive.
1805,8S8U0iL6G90,Can you imagine trying to live life day-to-day looking up in the sky seeing a missile headed your way before you get off work ? Crazy
1806,8S8U0iL6G90,It's crazy how close they are. It's like one side of a city fighting the other side.
1807,8S8U0iL6G90,"Putting aside the impressive technology, living in such an urban populated place while seeing those missile attack above is mind blowing. We are very far from the war region in our country but I can’t imagine this kind of action happening in my home city."
1808,8S8U0iL6G90,"This is surreal. Like watching Star Wars, but reality, with real live people down range."
1809,8S8U0iL6G90,What a defence system 😮😮
1810,8S8U0iL6G90,"So insane how those people that live there have to constantly live with that going on all the time and the scary part is that nobody knows where the rockets will hit when they get past the defense systems , everyone always has to run for their lives every single time they hear the air raid sirens activate."
1811,8S8U0iL6G90,The rocket at 0:25 behind the cranes careening around is the most insane thing to see
1812,8S8U0iL6G90,The iron dome is truly an engineering marvel
1813,8S8U0iL6G90,"Wow that's crazy
Its like missiles running into an invisible wall if you ignore the iron domes trails"
1814,INCXqWzH5vk,I didn't realize this was from 2 years ago. Glad we made such progress that every word of this is still 100% accurate and relevant.

1830,bRapCqhfUfc,"Covenant With Abraham concerning THE LAND OF ISRAEL.
Genesis 15-17
The location of Israel’s boundaries recorded by God.

Genesis 15:18
In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates.  [with Sarah’s child, Isaac]

God promised Hagar that Ishmael would be blessed too. His land boundaries and blessing are recorded in Genesis 17.

The lands of Israel are comparatively small,  compared to what Ishmael inherited. To this day we are living in we still see war between Abraham’s sons.  Even tho each inheritance was recorded in the Torah.
I wrote this for those who don’t understand why we see conflict every day on media."
1831,bRapCqhfUfc,Stop the violence and hate
1832,bRapCqhfUfc,Isn't religion wonderful....
1833,bRapCqhfUfc,"Israel is a major military power, equipped with the most sophisticated US weapons. The death of any civilians on both sides is abhorrent, however, people must recognise that the imbalance of power between Israel and Palestine is astronomical. Also, Israel is the occupying power and therefore, under international humanitarian law, it has a duty to ensure the welfare of those under its occupation... Instead, as per human rights groups, it has engaged in an unrelenting campaign of settler colonialism, frequent use of excessive force and ethnic cleansing. I guess Israel will continue to operate with impunity as it has unwavering US support... I believe the US's use of statements such as Israel has a 'right to defend itself', whilst completely ignoring the Palestinian right to self-determination further dehumanises the Palestinians and enables Israel to continue to commit war crimes without fear of reproach."

I praise your courage and your love for life and justice.
You have helped me to be able to cope better and with insight from a person who knows very well the other side when it comes to the truth about Palestine.
In my eyes you are soldier of  truth and of moral high ground,brave to stand tall even though evil and blind,stone hearts attack with falsehood and plain arrogance matched with ignorance.
May you be blessed and protected with the righteous path.

O believers! Stand firm for justice as witnesses for Allah even if it is against yourselves, your parents, or close relatives. Be they rich or poor, Allah is best to ensure their interests.

1871,nUfWTHbCS78,Thank you Norman for dedicating your life to this work. I know you said in a recent video that you became pessimistic about your work and starting thinking that there was no solution to this tragic situation. I am so glad that you found the inspiration and strength to share your expertise on this topic and to advocate for the lives of these long oppressed people. In my eyes you are one of the greatest heroes in America and I am so grateful that we can continue learning from you.
1872,nUfWTHbCS78,Goddamn!  I respect Dr. Finkelstein!!  I learned so much in this 40 minutes and feel like i finally have a history in a nutshell which I was looking for.  I have taken notes too and will research all the things he mentioned so I can better understand this history.
