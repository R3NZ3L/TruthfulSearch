nation in the world, and it didn't officially
exist until 1948. But many people associate
Israel with its ongoing conflict with Palestine. A violent dispute over
land, political control, and resources. To understand why, we have to
look back a few thousand years. Both Jews and Muslims have
strong religious and cultural ties to the region
dating back about 4,000 years to Abraham
considered the father of the two religions. According to the Old Testament,
God told Abraham and his people to settle in a
land called Canaan, which is in the approximate
region of modern day Israel. In 1,000 BCE King
Saul established the Israelite monarchy, which
continued under King David and his son, Solomon who
built the first Jewish temple in Jerusalem. This historical legacy became
part of the Jewish claim to the land of Israel. The land would continue
to be conquered and ruled by various groups, including
Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Egyptians,
Fatimids, Seljuks, Crusaders, Mamluks,
and the Ottomans, who called the region Palestine. It would become
home to many sites considered sacred by Jews,
Muslims, and Christians alike. During these
transitions Jews were forced to flee the area
creating a diaspora, dispersion of people from their homeland. But in Europe, the Jewish
diaspora also faced oppression and persecution. So in the 1880s
many Jewish people started emigrating back to
the promised land in Ottoman controlled Palestine. By 1914 there were more than
75,000 Jews in the area. After World War I, Great Britain
took control of modern day Israel, Palestine, and
Jordan from the Ottomans. In 1922 the League of Nations
approved a British declaration that promised a national
home for the Jewish people in Palestine, but it would
be more than two decades before that promise
was fulfilled. In 1939 World War II broke out. More than 6 million Jews were
murdered in the Holocaust with millions more displaced. In 1947 after the war was
over, the United Nations decided to partition
Palestine into two countries, the Jewish
state of Israel and the Arab state of Palestine. Israel agreed to the partition
and borders were drawn for two states, but many Arab residents
thought the partition unfairly favored the Jewish population. Violence soon broke out. On May 14th, 1948
the state of Israel was established With
David Ben-Gurion as it's prime minister. Almost immediately
the Arab League, a group of surrounding
Arab countries, rejected the partition
and attacked. Israel fought back and
after more than nine months of conflict, it's
armed forces occupied much of the land
designated to become the Arab state of Palestine. Egypt took control
of the Gaza Strip. Jordan, then called Transjordan,
took control of the West Bank. The original plan for a
Palestinian state was scrapped. This historic event was a
victory for many Jewish people, but approximately 720,000
Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes, many taking
refuge in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. This war would be
remembered in Hebrew as the War of Independence and
in Arabic as The Catastrophe. Tension between Jews and
Arab Muslims in the region would continue for decades. Fighting between Israel
and its Arab neighbors continued on and off
for the next 60 years. In 1964 the Palestine
Liberation Organization formed to consolidate
the power of many small Palestinian groups. In the 1967 six-day war
Israel defeated the armies of Egypt, Syria, and
Jordan, and gained control of significant territory. In 1987 following an incident
with the Israeli defense forces that left four
Palestinian refugees dead, Palestinian militia
led a violent uprising known as the First Intifada that
resulted in hundreds of deaths. After the First Intifada
Israel and the PLO created a timetable for
peace, the Oslo Accords. Further peace talks in
2000 proved unsuccessful when agreements
could not be reached on issues like the
status of Jerusalem, the rights of refugees, and
increased Jewish settlements in Palestinian lands. Later that year
Ariel Sharon, who would become Israel's
prime minister, visited the Temple Mount,
home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. An act many Palestinians
found offensive. Violent protests,
riots, attacks, and suicide bombings broke out. This period of violence
called the Second Intifada lasted nearly five
years and marked the end of any peace that had
come from the Oslo Accords. The violence ended in 2005
when Israel withdrew from Gaza. In 2006, a militant Sunni
Islamist group, Hamas, won the Palestinian
legislative elections. Many countries consider Hamas
a terrorist group because of their methods, such as
carrying out suicide bombings, and calling for the
destruction of Israel. Hamas and Israel continued
to clash violently. In 2017, Hamas called
for the formation of a Palestinian state
using the 1967 borders, but it did not formally
recognize Israel as a state. So Israel did not accept. Today, Palestine continues
to fight for statehood. The conflict is
further complicated by Israelis who continue
to settle in the West Bank. Several countries
have pushed for peace agreements in recent
years, and many suggest a two state solution. Though a peaceful solution
has yet to be achieved, the region remains a
place of significance for people of many ethnic
and religious backgrounds."

war in a region that has seen more Wars than any other in history using a massive barrage of thousands of rockets and using technology and aggressive tactics they broke through the heavily protected border into Israel they hit military targets what stunned Israel and shocked the world was their attack against civilians in communities and at a music festival where thousands had gathered the body count is still Rising but thousands were killed Hamas took more than 150 people both civilians and soldiers hostage including foreigners visiting Israel also people of at least 36 nationalities are dead or missing Hamas locked in one of the world's most impoverished regions has never hidden its militant intentions but so far it has also been careful enough never to overestimate its ability against one of the world's most feared militaries why did it attack now the answer is a complex mix of history geography religion people power and politics we are here to simplify it for you my name is Priyanka Sharma and this is gravitas Plus for more than a thousand years across Christian Europe Jews have been persecuted for their alleged role in the crucifixion of Jesus Christ the God and the prophet of Christianity they were consigned to ghettos in many European Empires and countries they were banned from owning property and fac discriminatory laws they were economically marginalized and socially Outcast by the late 19th century a lingering aspiration for a Jewish homeland in which A persecuted people could find security and safety began to grow into an effective political movement the Jewish leaders identified their old habitat with their holy city of Jerusalem as the epicenter as the new Promised Land the stretch of land located between Lebanon Syria trans Jordan and Egypt this was once home to the king Kingdom of ancient Israel and the kingdom of Judah it was a land from which they had been often driven out and often returned their history includes the memory of Jewish people and slave by the Pharaohs of Egypt and their return under the leadership of Moses Jews were first driven out from the Kingdom of Israel around 7:32 BC by the Neo Assyrian Empire then from the kingdom of Juda during the Babylonian captivity in 597 BC the Roman Empire was their next Overlord in' 66c the judian population rebelled against the Roman Empire a brave Uprising that was crushed with unsentimental ferocity by the Romans culminating in the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE in 132 CE there was the bar Koka Revolt Simon baroka was a Jewish military leader under him the Jews of Juda rebelled against the Roman Empire the fighting went on for 4 years at the end of which the Jews were forbidden access to Jerusalem the Romans renamed the region Syria palestinia the Jewish people spread across a wide diaspora unable to find their Center of political Gravity the rise of Arab empires brought the region under the rule of Damascus and Baghdad for a while Christian Crusaders conquered Jerusalem under the Arabs under Saladin restored their own rule in 1516 the ottoman Turks occupied Palestine during this long period the land was peopled by those described logically as Palestinians most of whom had become Muslim but not all there were strong Christian populations in Palestine cut to the late 19th century the presence of Palestinians did not diminish the dream of a Jewish State the Zionist movement was launched Jews began lobbying Western powers to facilitate a mass immigration of Jews to Palestine the Russian Empire was the largest home for the Jewish diaspora in 1905 after the failure of the first Russian Revolution against Zars many Jews from Eastern Europe and Russia began moving to Palestine then under ottoman rule the settlers use Hebrew as their spoken language the Ottomans defeated by the British French Italian Alliance in the first world war collapsed in 1918 the region was occupied by Britain and France under a secret wartime Arrangement devised by two officials syes and Pico in 1916 Britain took over Palestine Britain owed a debt to Jewish leaders who had helped during the first world war particularly in finance in 1917 then British foreign secretary Arthur balur wrote to Lionel Walter rild he was one of the most prominent leaders of the British Jewish community in which he promised The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people it is also said that the British government will facilitate the achievement of this object this became known as the balfa Declaration the French had their own reasons for facilitating the creation of a Jewish homeland in 1799 Napoleon had issued a proclamation he offered Palestine as a Homeland for for Jews under France's protection Napoleon wanted Jewish help in his invasion of Egypt the Jewish state did not materialize under France the British French agreement on a potential Jewish homeland remained a promise between the two World Wars of the 20th century but the idea kept Gathering momentum the Muslim and Christian Arabs who obviously would be displaced from a territory that they had inhabited for centuries opposed the Bal for declaration the British could not totally ignore them for they had held the British against the Ottomans in the first world war as well so the British limited Jewish immigration trying to appease both sides by the 193s Arabs and Jewish settlers had begun fighting openly in Palestine the tragedy of Jews and Judaism reached an unbelievable apotheosis during the second world war when the German Nazis under Hitler designed a horrific unimaginable plan to kill every Jew in their domain in what is now known as the Holocaust Jews were was sent to concentration camps where they were enslaved starved and gassed to death it was beyond belief that human beings could sing to such depraved barbarism at the end of the second world war the urge to create a Homeland for Jews acquired a moral momentum when Jewish settlers discovered that the British were still reluctant to leave from Jerusalem they attacked the British soldiers and authorities the matter went to the newly created United Nations in 1947 the year India got independence the UN voted to Partition Palestine the United Nations adopted the resolution 181 according to it there was to be an Arab State and a separate Jewish State Palestinians rejected the resolution they mainly pointed two things one Jews were allotted nearly 56% of Palestine despite making up just 33% of the population in Palestine two Jews were being allocated the fertile coastal region until then Jews own 6% of the Palestinian land this un map changed the reality soon Jews began occupying the land designated to them the Palestinians fought but without much success by May 1948 Jews were in control of all of the land promised to them also some Arab territories on the 14th of May 1948 Israel became a country it was the first Jewish state in 2,000 years at its Helm was Prime Minister David benuron Tel aviv's airport is now named after him Palestinians lament the creation of his ra as a nakba or catastrophe that resulted in their dispossession this was the start of endless fighting a day after the creation of Israel Egypt Jordan Syria Lebanon and Iraq invaded Israel the first Arab Israeli War broke out the Israelis fought off the Arabs it also seized key territories in 1949 the UN brokered ceasefires Israel was given permanent control of these territories more than 700,000 Palestinians left Israel and Israel became a Jewish majority country in 1956 Focus shifted to this water body in particular the Suz Canal it is vital to trade as it connects the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea in 1956 Egyptian president Gamal abder Naser nationalized a Suz canal in response Israel invaded Egypt Britain and France followed US and Soviet Union brokered a peace deal but peace was shortlived in June of 1967 Israel carried out preemptive strikes on Egyptian and Syrian Air Forces this sparked a six- day war at the end of it Israel captured the saai peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt from Jordan it took the West Bank and East Jerusalem and Goen Heights from Syria the Israel Palestine conflict took center stage in the 1972 Munich Olympic attack extremists from the Black September group raided an Olympic Village dorm they killed two Israeli athletes took nine others hostage all of whom died eventually in 1973 Syria and Egypt launched a surprise twoof front War it was yam Kapur day the Arab forces gain ground in a victory which Egypt celebrates as historic it recovered the whole of saai America intervened to stop the war and lay the framework for an accord between the principal Nations Egypt and Israel in 1978 Egypt and Syria signed the cam David Accords this led to the 1979 Egypt Israel peace treaty but all the while the question of Palestinian self-determination remained unresolved in 1987 Palestinians living in the West Bank in Gaza Strip rose up against the Israeli government it was the first intifada intifada meaning shaking off in 1993 Oso one Accords were signed between Israeli Prime Minister yit zag Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization of PLO the negotiator that is mmud Abbas it was the first direct Palestinian Israeli peace agreement and it set up a framework for the Palestinian self-governance in West Bank and Gaza

was founded in 1987 it won the election in 2006 Western governments have branded Hamas a terrorist organization Hamas orchestrated what is being called a Pearl Harbor moment in West Asia Israel is calling it its own 9/11 one that has killed the most number of Jews since the Holocaust there is no black and white in this conflict both Israelis and Palestinians see the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea as their own this land is sacred to Christian too Israelis signed the belf for declaration as Israel's right to exist the Palestinians regard it as the start of their dispossession here is something one often forgets about this declaration it also mentioned that it was quote unquote clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may Prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine the B for Declaration was signed in 1917 but between 1915 and 1916 a set of 10 letters were exchanged between the British and Mecca's Amir these letters known as the McMahan Hussein correspondence speak about the idea of an independent Arab state is this conflict a British Legacy something to think about here's something else why does a sustainable solution evade the region despite years of diplomacy issues remain number one the two-states solution Hamas rejects it Israel says a Palestinian state must be demilitarized number two Jerusalem Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of their state Israel says Jerusalem should remain its Eternal Capital three refugees before this war more than 5.6 million Palestinian

One of the biggest myths about the Israel-Palestine conflict is that it's been going on for centuries, that this is all about ancient religious hatreds.

In fact, while religion is involved, the conflict is mostly about two groups of people who claim the same land. And it really only goes back about a century, to the early 1900s. At its heart, it is a conflict between two self-determination movements — the Jewish Zionist project and the Palestinian nationalist project — that lay claim to the same territory.

conflict is that it's been going on for centuries, that this is all about ancient religious hatreds. In fact, while religion is involved, the conflict
is mostly about two groups of people who claim the same land. And it really only goes back about a century,
to the early 1900s. Around then, the region
along the eastern Mediterranean we now call Israel-Palestine had been under Ottoman rule
for centuries. It was religiously diverse, including mostly
Muslims and Christians but also a small number of Jews, who lived generally in peace. And it was changing in two important ways. First, more people in the region were developing
a sense of being not just ethnic Arabs but Palestinians, a distinct
national identity. At the same time, not so far away in Europe,
more Jews were joining a movement called Zionism, which said that Judaism was not just a religion
but a nationality, one that deserved a nation of its own. And after centuries of persecution, many believed
a Jewish state was their only way of safety. And they saw their historic homeland in the Middle
East as their best hope for establishing it. In the first decades of the 20th century, tens of thousands of European Jews moved there. After World War One, the Ottoman Empire collapsed,
and the British and French Empires carved up the Middle East, with the British taking
control of a region it called the British Mandate for Palestine. At first, the British allowed Jewish immigration. But as more Jews arrived, settling into farming
communes, tension between Jews and Arabs grew. Both sides committed acts of violence. And by the 1930s, the British began limiting Jewish
immigration.  In response,  Jewish militias formed to fight both the local Arabs and to resist British rule. Then came the Holocaust, leading many more
Jews to flee Europe for British Palestine, and galvanizing much of the world in support
of a Jewish state. In 1947, as sectarian violence between Arabs and Jews there grew, the United Nations approved a plan
to divide British Palestine into two separate states: one for Jews, Israel, and one for
Arabs, Palestine. The city of Jerusalem, where Jews, Muslims, and Christians all have have holy sites, it was to become a special international zone.   The plan was meant to give Jews a state, to
establish Palestinian independence, and to end the sectarian violence that the British
could no longer control. The Jews accepted the plan and declared independence as Israel. But Arabs throughout the region saw the UN plan as just more European colonialism trying to steal their land. Many of the Arab states, who had just recently
won independence themselves, declared war on Israel in an effort to establish a unified Arab Palestine where all of British Palestine had been. The new state of Israel won the war. But in
the process, they pushed well past their borders under the UN plan, taking the western half
of Jerusalem and much of the land that was to have been part of Palestine. They also expelled huge numbers of Palestinians
from their homes, creating a massive refugee population whose descendants today number
about 7 million. At the end of the war, Israel controlled all
of the territory except for Gaza, which Egypt controlled, and the West Bank, named because
it's west of the Jordan River, which Jordan controlled. This was the beginning of the decades-long
Arab-Israeli conflict. During this period, many Jews in Arab-majority
countries fled or were expelled, arriving in Israel. Then something happened that transformed the
conflict. In 1967, Israel and the neighboring Arab states fought another war. When it ended, Israel had seized the Golan
Heights from Syria, the West Bank from Jordan, and both Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula from
Egypt. Israel was now occupying the Palestinian territories,
including all of Jerusalem and its holy sites. This left Israel responsible for governing
the Palestinians – a people it had fought for decades. In 1978 Israel and Egypt signed the US-brokered
Camp David Accords and shortly after that, Israel gave Sanai back to Egypt as part of
a peace treaty. At the time this was hugely controversial
in the Arab world. Egypt President Anwar Sadat was assassinated
in part because of outrage against it. But it marked the beginning of the end of
the wider Arab-Israeli conflict. Over the next few decades, the other Arab
states gradually made peace with Israel, even if they never signed formal peace treaties. But Israel's military was still occupying
the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza, and this was when the conflict became
an Israeli-Palestinian struggle. The Palestinian Liberation Organization, which
had formed in the 1960s to seek a Palestinian state, fought against Israel, including through
acts of terrorism. Initially, the PLO claimed all of what had
been British Palestine, meaning it wanted to end the state of Israel entirely. Fighting between Israel and the PLO went on
for years, even including a 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon to kick the group out of Beirut. The PLO later said it would accept dividing
the land between Israel and Palestine, but the conflict continued. As all of this was happening, something dramatic
was changing in the Israel-occupied Palestinian territories: Israelis were moving in. These people are called settlers, and they
made their homes in the West Bank and Gaza whether Palestinians wanted them or not. Some moved for religious reasons, some because
they want to claim the land for Israel, and some just because housing is cheap — and
often subsidized by the Israeli government. Some settlements are cities with thousands
of people; others are small communities deep into the West Bank The settlers are followed by soldiers to guard
them, and the growing settlements force Palestinians off of their land and divide communities. Short-term, they make the occupation much
more painful for Palestinians. Long-term, by dividing up Palestinian land,
they make it much more difficult for the Palestinians to ever have an independent state. Today there are several hundred thousand settlers
in occupied territory even though the international community considers them illegal. By the late 1980s, Palestinian frustration
exploded into the Intifada,  which is the the Arabic word for uprising. It began with mostly protests and boycotts
but soon became violent, and Israel responded with heavy force. A couple hundred Israelis and over a thousand
Palestinians died in the first Intifada. Around the same time, a group of Palestinians
in Gaza, who consider the PLO too secular and too compromise-minded, created Hamas, a violent
extremist group dedicated to Israel's destruction. By the early 1990s, it's clear that Israelis
and Palestinians have to make peace, and leaders from both sides sign the Oslo Accords. This is meant to be the big, first step toward
Israel maybe someday withdrawing from the Palestinian territories, and allowing an independent Palestine. The Oslo Accords establish the Palestinian
Authority, allowing Palestinians a little bit of freedom to govern themselves in certain areas. Hard-liners on both sides opposed the Oslo
accords. Members of Hamas launch suicide bombings to try to sabotage the process. The Israeli right protests peace talks, with
ralliers calling Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin a traitor and a Nazi. Not long after Rabin signs the second round
of Oslo Accords, a far-right Israeli shoots him to death in Tel Aviv. This violence showed how the extremists on
both sides can use violence to derail peace, and keep a permanent conflict going as they
seek the other side's total destruction. That's a dynamic that's been around ever since. Negotiations meant to hammer out the final
details on peace drag on for years, and a big Camp David Summit in 2000 comes up empty. Palestinians come to believe that peace isn't coming, and rise up in a Second
Intifada, this one much more violent than the first. By the time it wound down a few years later, about 1,000
Israelis and 3,200 Palestinians had died. The Second Intifada really changes the conflict.
Israelis become much more skeptical that Palestinians will ever accept peace, or that it's even worth trying. Israeli politics shift right, and the country
builds walls and checkpoints to control Palestinians' movements. They're not really trying to solve the conflict
anymore, just manage it. The Palestinians are left feeling like negotiating
didn't work and violence didn't work, that they're stuck under an ever-growing occupation
with no future as a people. That year, Israel withdraws from Gaza. Hamas
gains power but splits from the Palestinian Authority in a short civil war, dividing Gaza
from the West Bank. Israel puts Gaza under a suffocating blockade,
and unemployment rises to 40%. This is the state of the conflict as we know
it today. It’s relatively new, and it’s
unbearable for Palestinians. In the West Bank, more and more settlements
are smothering Palestinians, who often respond with protests and sometimes with violence,
though most just want normal lives. In Gaza, Hamas and other violent groups have
periodic wars with Israel. The fighting overwhelmingly kills Palestinians,
including lots of civilians. In Israel itself, most people have become
apathetic, and for the most part the occupation keeps the conflict relatively removed from
their daily lives, with moments of brief but horrible violence. There's little political will for peace. No one really knows where the conflict goes
from here. Maybe a Third Intifada. Maybe the Palestinian
Authority collapses. But everyone agrees that things, as they are now, can't 
last much longer -- that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians is too unstable to last, and that, unless something dramatic changes, whatever comes next will be much worse."

In which John Green teaches you about the conflict in Israel and Palestine. This conflict is often cast as a long-term beef going back thousands of years, rooted in a clash between religions. Well, that's not quite true. What is true is that the conflict is immensely complicated, and just about everyone in the world has an opinion about it. John is going to try to get the facts across in under 13 minutes.

Yeah, yeah big ask, Mr. Green, I mean, that fight goes back thousands and thousands of years. Except, thousands of years ago... there wasn't an Islam yet, so, yeah, no. Also, let me submit that very little of this conflict between Israel and Palestine over the last several decades has been about, like, theological differences between Islam and Judaism. No one's arguing about whether the most important prophets descended from Abraham's son Isaac, or his son Ishmael, right? It's not about whether to fast during Yom Kippur or Ramadan. It's about land. Portraying the conflict as eternal or as religious makes it feel intractable in a way that frankly, it isn't. So instead, let's begin as most historians do in the late 19th century. And instead of talking about religion, let's follow the lead of historians like James Gelvin and discuss competing nationalisms. [Theme Music] Ok, so in the late 19th century, the Ottoman Empire ruled over what we now know as Palestine. The population there, according to Ottoman records from 1878, was 87% Muslim, 10% Christian and 3% Jewish. Everybody spoke Arabic as the daily language, and in Jerusalem the religious populations were roughly equal. To give you a sense of life in Ottoman Palestine, an Arab Orthodox Christian musician named Wasif Jawhariyyeh grew up in Jerusalem in the first decade of the 20th century learning the Quran in school and celebrating both Passover and Eid with his Jewish and Muslim neighbors. Ottoman Palestine was, in short, a place in which people of different religious faiths lived peacefully together. Alright, let's go to the Thought Bubble. The late 19th century was the Golden Age of nationalism in Europe, and no place was crazier than the Hapsburg Austro-Hungarian Empire in which at least 10 different nations all wanted their own state. And in that hyper-nationalistic empire lived a Jewish journalist named Theodor Herzl who had hoped that Jews could assimilate into European nations but soon became convinced that the Jewish people needed to leave Europe and settle in their own state. The concept of Jewish nationalism came to be known as Zionism. It's important to keep in mind that most Zionists were secular Jews, so they imagined Israel as a state for Jews more than a Jewish state. In 1917, the British government, hoping to gain the support of Jewish people, issued the Balfour Declaration, promising, quote, ""The establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people,"" a bold promise considering that Palestine was still technically Ottoman, as they hadn't yet lost World War One. Of course, they would soon, but it turned out that the British were overpromisers when it came to Palestine, because a year before the Balfour Declaration, the British had secretly promised the French that they would divide up the Arab territories and the Brits would keep Palestine. Furthermore, in 1915, other British officials had promised the ruler of Mecca, Sharif Hussein, that he would rule over an Arab state including Palestine if he led an Arab revolt against Ottoman rule,
which Hussein promptly did, so basically the Brits had promised Palestine to the Meccans, to themselves, and to the Zionists. What could go wrong? Thanks, Thought Bubble. So shortly after the end of the war, the British established a colony in Palestine with the idea that they'd rule until the Palestinians were ready to govern themselves, at which point the people living in Palestine were like, ""Well, now seems good,"" and the British were like, ""Yeah, but maybe not just yet."" Meanwhile, the British established separate institutions for Christians, Jews, and Muslims, making it difficult for Palestinian Christians and Muslims to cooperate and easier for the British to, quote, ""divide and rule"" the inhabitants of Palestine. Again, what could go wrong? Meanwhile, the British did attempt to honor the Balfour Declaration's promise to, quote, ""facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions."" Between 1920 and 1939, the Jewish population of Palestine increased by over 320,000 people. In fact, by 1938, Jews were just under 30% of the population of Palestine. And the growing Jewish population focused on purchasing land from absentee non-Palestinian Arab landowners and then evicting Palestinian farmers who were living and working there. By controlling both the land and the labor, they hoped to establish a more secure community within Palestine, but of course, these practices heightened tensions between Jewish people and Arab Palestinians between the 1920s and the 1930s. Along the way, Palestinian Arabs began to think of themselves as the Palestinian nation, and that growing sense of nationalism erupted in 1936, when the Palestinians revolted against the British. With the help of Jewish militias, the British brutally suppressed the Palestinian revolt, but in the aftermath, the British issued a white paper, limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine, and calling for the establishment of a joint Arab and Jewish state in Palestine within ten years. This managed to leave no one happy. The Zionists were angry at Britain for limiting Jewish immigration at a time when Jews particularly needed to leave Europe, and the Arab Palestinians were unhappy about the prospect of waiting ten years for a state. And then came World War II, which was actually quite a peaceful time in Palestine. But then it ended, and tensions resumed, and the British realized that colonies like Palestine were far more trouble than they were worth, so they handed the issue of Palestine over to the newly created United Nations. They were like, ""Oh hey there, United Nations! For your first problem..."" So in November of 1947, the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into separate Palestinian and Jewish states. The Partition Plan called for two states roughly equal in size, but the borders looked like a jigsaw puzzle. I mean, you do not look at this map and think, ""Yeah, that's gonna work!"" Sure enough, it didn't, and soon after the plan was announced, the cleverly named 1948 Arab-Israeli War broke out, with Israel on the one side and the Palestinians and many Arab states on the other. The Israelis won, and when an armistice was signed in 1949, Israel occupied a third more land than they would have had under the UN proposal. Meanwhile, Jordan controlled and later annexed the West Bank and the old city of Jerusalem, and Egypt controlled the Gaza strip. Over 700,000 Palestinians fled their homes and became refugees in the surrounding Arab countries. To Israelis, this was was the beginning of their nation; to the Palestinians, it was the nakba, the catastrophe, as they became stateless. Over the next 18 years, nothing changed territorially, and then, in 1967, Israel and several Arab states went to war again. It was called the Six-Days War because -- get this -- it lasted six days. Israel won, and then gained control over the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Heights. So the 1947 proposal looked like this; by 1967, things looked like this. Then the UN passed Resolution 242 - man, they are good at naming resolutions! - which outlined a basic framework for achieving peace, including Israel withdrawing from the territory acquired in the war, and all participants recognizing the rights of both a Palestinian and an Israeli state to exist. This of course did not happen. After the war, the broader Israeli-Arab conflict morphed into a more specific Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and this is a nice moment to note that not all Muslims are Arabs, not all Arabs are Palestinians, and not all Palestinians are Muslims. Like, there's a significant Christian minority of Palestinians, for instance. Palestinian is a word used to describe the ethnic identity of those who have historically lived in Palestine. There were, for instance, lots of Christians in the Palestinian Liberation Organization, or PLO, formed in 1964 and led by Yasser Arafat. The PLO oversaw guerrilla groups that attacked civilians, but also used nonviolent approaches to try to achieve a Palestinian state, and meanwhile, the Israeli government began to establish Jewish settlements in what had been Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. There are now over 350,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, and over 200,000 in East Jerusalem, and these settlements are illegal, according to international law, but Israel counters by saying that they aren't really illegal because Palestine isn't really a state. By the late 1980s, Palestinians launched the first intifada, which literally means ""shaking off."" And this began with, like, boycotts of Israeli products and services and refusing to pay Israeli taxes, but when the Israeli armed forces cracked down on protesters, violence ensued. And the first intifada also saw the founding of Hamas, which launched the first suicide bombing against Israel in 1993. Hamas gained support partly because of its militancy, but mostly because of its social welfare projects in Gaza. It built and staffed schools, mosques, and clinics. The most important legacy of the First Intifada was the emergence of peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis. This led to the Oslo Accords,
and the peace process, based on our old friend, United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. But there were a lot of issues to resolve - I mean, putting aside the question of, like, how to make two states that don't look like a jigsaw puzzle, there was the question of the Jewish settlement, and the right for Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to Palestine. Water rights, which are a big deal in that part of the world, and so on. It's very complicated! So then came the Clinton talks. Oh, it's time for the Open Letter! But first, let's see what's inside of the globe. Oh, look! It's a collection of philandering American presidents. An Open Letter to Bill Clinton: Hey, Bill, so your talks probably came closer than any other time in recent history to an actual peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was willing to give up more land currently claimed by Israel than at any other time in the past; even Yasser Arafat was surprised. Although not all the questions got addressed, you were definitely closing in on something. But in the end, it didn't happen, and since then, not to criticize you, things have gotten kind of worse and worse and worse. Worst of all, that was your big legacy moment. Now all you've got is the conflict in Northern Ireland getting resolved while you were president. In short, it could have been amazing, but instead it was kind of... neeeeh. Kind of like your presidency, actually! At least you always have those vodkas-soaked hugs with Boris Yeltsin to look back on. Best Wishes, John Green. So the Clinton talks failed; Ehud Barak's government was undermined, and then, in September of 2000, Prime Minister candidate Ariel Sharon led a group of 1,000 armed guards to the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. To Muslims, this is known as the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and it's the third-holiest site in Islam, behind only the Kaaba in Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. And it's the holiest site in Judaism, so in short, it's a pretty touchy place to march to with a thousand armed guards. So the events sparked a massive protest, which eventually led to the much more violent Second Intifada, in which more than three thousand Palestinians and one thousand Israelis were eventually killed. In 2002, the Israelis, claiming to act in defense of civilians, began construction of a wall around the West Bank, but instead of following the borders established after the 1967 War, the barrier was built to include many Israeli settlements on the Israeli side. To Israelis, that was about self-defense; to Palestinians, it was an illegal land grab. Then, in 2005, Yasser Arafat died, and in an election shortly thereafter, Hamas won a majority of the parliamentary seats. Since then, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have sort of divided how to govern Palestine, and it's also sort of been poorly governed. In the past ten years, Hamas has frequently launched rocket attacks into Israel; Israel has responded with extended and extremely violent invasions of Palestinian territory that have seen thousands of Palestinians killed, many of them militants, but also many not. Both parties claim to be responding to the provocations of the other, but much of the conflict reflects the consistent failure on all sides to understand the legitimacy of the other's narrative. To Palestine, the Palestinian people have been denied a state not just since the formation of Israel, but also for decades before that, and now they live under what amounts to a military occupation. And that's all true. To Israel, the Jewish people clearly need a homeland, which the United Nations established. And they certainly aren't the first nation state to consolidate and increase their territory via military victory. And they need to protect their nation against the many active threats made against them by their neighbors. That's also true! It's important to understand the internal logic of these competing nationalist visions. For both Zionists and Palestinian national visions to eventually work, it's necessary to understand the right of each to exist and the legitimacy of each's historical narrative. But these problems aren't thousands of years old, and they aren't intractable. They emerged in the British Mandatory Period. But let's hope that by understanding this isn't an endless religious war, that we might be closer to seeing its end. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

6,E4iygQ--7dk,The History of Palestine Occupation,"The renewed hostilities between Hamas and Israel have once again sparked international concern. The humanitarian situation in besieged Gaza will become ""unmanageable very quickly"" Fabrizio Carboni, a senior official with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said even as the death toll due to Israeli bombardment in the enclave rose to over 1,300. 

At least ""1,354 citizens have been martyred and 6,049 suffered various injuries"", the ministry said, updating an earlier death toll of around 1,200 that was announced at dawn on Thursday. 

At least 1,300 Israelis have also been killed since a surprise attack by the Palestinian group Hamas early on Saturday that involved dozens of fighters who infiltrated Israeli towns, the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation (KAN) said. 

More than 3,300 Israelis have been injured in the unprecedented assault, with over 350 seriously injured. The latest outbreak of violence followed an attack against Israel by Hamas on October 7 prompting air strikes on Gaza by the Israeli security forces. 

Hamas said its action was in retaliation for the storming of the Al Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem and Israeli settlers’ growing violence against Palestinians. 

However, the Israel-Palestine conflict did not erupt overnight. Here’s a brief history

seems tensions are as high now as they ever were here's how Israelis and Palestinians got to where they are today even more Bloodshed in the late 19th century the Jewish communities of Europe faced widespread intolerance in Western Europe their peers discriminated against them and viewed them as socially inferior and in Eastern Europe Jews were often the victims of violent pams which were attacks by mobs that left many dead and wounded this anti-semitic attitude pushed European Jewish intellectuals and political activists to agitate for a solution to the growing Prejudice and this movement eventually became known as Zionism early Zionist thinkers like Theodore herel and Leon pinsker wrote tracks discussing solutions to combat anti-Semitism and they began to engage many of their peers herel and pinsker argued that the answer to the question of the Jews discrimination in Europe was the creation of a separate Jewish homeland where Jews could live in Peace and Freedom from the beginning the zionists were split on how to incorporate Judaism and Many religious Jews rejected and actively rallied against Zionism some of the earliest Zionist leaders saw the movement as more secular than religious arguing the Jewish Community was a dispersed nation and not just a religion beginning in the 1880s various Jewish groups began to encourage immigration to Palestine to escape the increasingly nasty Russian pagam in 1884 pinsker organized a conference in kavit Poland to merge these groups and the zionists together as the lovers of Zion and in 1897 the zionists officially named Palestine as the place for the Jewish homeland unfortunately no one told the Palestinian Arabs in 1878 before Zionist immigration began Palestine was overwhelmingly Arab according to the 1878 ottoman census there were only roughly 25,000 Jews compared with the more than 400,000 Arabs who made up over 85% of the population the initial Zionist immigration to Palestine occurred in several waves the first of which began in 1882 and saw the first Jews make it to Palestine from Russia by 1914 the Jewish population had more than doubled since 1878 to 60,000 but the Arab population had also increased to 731 th000 much of the land the zionists settled on was purchased by large Zionist and Jewish organizations like the Jewish National Fund which they bought from from absentee land owners and not the Arab peasantry themselves the land Acquisitions quickly brought the zionists into conflict with the Arab residents who were often working the land when it was sold and were subsequently kicked out in addition to tensions over land Zionism began to conflict with the burgeoning Arab nationalist movement among the Palestinians which sought to unite the larger Arab worlds together they saw the zionists and a Jewish State as impediments to that goal and relations between the two groups deteriorated quickly not yet a wash with violence this was probably the most peaceful time in the entire Israeli Palestinian conflict prior to World War I Palestine was officially part of the Ottoman Empire however by the end of the War the British had overtaken the Ottomans which they achieved with the help of the Arab people through the Arab Revolt yet at the same time the British cabinet began to drift into the Zionist political orbit as prominent zionists made inroads with British politicians by 1917 the zionists actions began to bear fruit and on November 2nd 1917 the British issued the now famous Balor declaration the Declaration was named after its author Arthur balfor the British foreign secretary who wrote his Majesty's government views with favor The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people while the letter also promised safeguards for the non-jewish communities in Palestine the Arabs officially rejected the Declaration the letter public published on November 2nd 1917 led to the creation of the state of Israel when the war ended Palestine entered the League of Nations mandate system which was created to help govern former ottoman territories until they formed sustainable governments of their own Britain officially gained control of mandatory Palestine in 1923 and it was clear the British prioritized creating a Jewish rather than an Arab State the formal mandate included the language of the Balor declaration and it recognized a Jewish agency to speak for the zionists while the Palestinian Arab executive was afforded no such Acceptance in addition many British officials were Pro Zionist and harbored racist feelings towards the Palestinian Arabs already the odds seem to be against the Palestinians and favoring the zionists from 1922 to 1936 the Jewish population in Palestine increased by over 300,000 to almost 30% of its total bringing zionists and Arabs into closer contact and leading to increased tensions in 1929 disturbances in Jerusalem at the Wailing Wall led to the deaths of 133 Jews and 116 Arabs however no appreciable change in British policy followed as they ignored recommendations to limit Zionist immigration with tensions brewing and the British seemingly favoring the zionists it was only a matter of time before the Powder Keg erupted unhappy with their ineffective leadership and increasing Zionist immigration the Arabs staged a large scale strike and Revolt from 1936 to 1939 disturbances began in April when Arabs murdered a Jewish bus passenger and soon a local strike morphed into a nationwide Palestinian movement there were violent attacks on both sides leaving 1,000 Arabs and 80 Jews dead within 6 months from October 1936 until July 1937 the strike was on hold along with the violence and the British sent in an investigative commission yet when the commission recommended a SE separate Jewish and Palestinian State both sides rejected it during the renewed Revolt Palestinians murdered Jewish settlers and began terrorizing the countryside with armed bands hoping to end the Zionist experiment in their Homeland the Revolt conclusively failed and the British Army and Zionist paramilitaries finally put down the disorder in March 1939 by then there were already 5,600 dead a little over half of whom were Arab Palestine was crumbling at the seams following the ARA Revolt of 1936 to 1939 Palestine was in complete shambles during the uprising the British dissolved the Palestinian leadership and deported most of its members leaving much of the movement in the hands of Rebel bands and the peasantry the Revolt had failed in its primary goal of removing the British and their support for the zionists claims to occupation but the British did moderate their policies towards Palestine afterward after the uprising the British announced the white paper which was a complete break from their previous policies it repudiated the idea that Palestine was meant to be a Jewish State restricted Jewish immigration to 15,000 a year and stopped certain land transfers from Arabs to Jews the British issued the white paper just as the Holocaust was beginning leaving the Jewish Community incredibly upset and disenchanted when fighting broke out in the Middle East during the second world war however it was zionists and not Arabs who fought alongside the British while the Zionist paramilitaries gained Munitions and valuable combat experience fighting with the BR British the Arabs were afforded no such opportunity after the war the zionists were determined to remove the British from authority over Palestine and declare independence they lashed out violently through acts of sabotage and Terror such as the bombing of the british's HQ at the King David hotel in 1946 which killed 41 once again Palestine was engulfed in turmoil and bloodshed by 1947 palestine's situation had deteriorated completely and the British needed an exit by then the League of Nations was defunct and had been replaced by the United Nations in February the British presented the Palestine question to the UN however reaching a satisfying answer was far from Easy by the end of 1946 the population stood at roughly 1.84 million inhabitants with only 33% being Jewish and 58% being Muslim Arab in addition even after Decades of land transfers the zionists only controlled 6% of the land in Palestine while on the ground the Arabs seem to have the stronger position at the UN it was a different story The zionists effectively mobilized influential American supporters to pressure un delegates to vote favorably for them in contrast the Palestinian leadership had been in Exile since the failure of the Arab Revolt leaving them largely without close representation on behalf of the Palestinians spoke the leaders of the surrounding Arab states but they were more concerned with appearing to care rather than actually creating a Palestinian state in November 1947 the UN issued resolution 181 but it was a solution beset with problems un 181 recommended Palestine be partitioned into both Jewish and Arab states which was anathema to the Palestinians who controlled most of the land that was earmarked for the zionists assured by the surrounding Arab states that they would back them militarily the Palestinians rejected un1 181 out of hand while the zionists supported it in late 1947 as the British withdrew and the United Nations stood by Palestine devolved into hellish violence within 24 hours of the un's announcement of their partition plan Arabs began attacking and shooting at Jews in hia and Tel Aviv and fighting soon erupted between them both sides targeted civilians including bombing public areas no one was safe many of the Zionist paramilitaries were experienced and well-coordinated and they were far superior in combat compared to the less organized Palestinian resistance by the spring of 1948 8 things had largely shifted to the zionists punctuated by atrocities against civilians like the shocking Zionist massacre at Deer yine which left over 100 Arab villagers dead the Palestinian resistance began to crumble on May 15th 1948 Israel formally declared independence though this hardly ended the Bloodshed instead the Arab countries of Egypt Syria Lebanon Iraq and trans Jordan invaded Israel intending to evict the zionists in favor of the Palestinian Arabs however the Israelis had a numerical superiority of forces and a strong determination to win and they threw back the invading armies in a stunning Victory they were a highly prepared uh highly dedicated well-armed fighting force when it was all over in July 1949 Israel controlled almost all of the territory designated for themselves and Palestine according to un1 181 except for the Gaza Strip near Egypt and the West Bank including Old Jerusalem known in Israel as the war of independence the Palestinians have a different name Al nakba or the catastrophy perhaps the worst Legacy resulting from the Palestinian Wars was the giant Refugee crisis left in its wake amidst the violence many Palestinian Arabs fled Israel to the nearby Arab countries of Syria Lebanon and trans Jordan as well as the Egyptian Gaza Strip it's widely estimated that at least 750,000 Palestinians were left displaced by the fighting Israel and the Palestinians were unable to agree on terms to readmit the refugees and as a result none were Israeli settlers quickly moved into former Palestinian homes and Villages now bereft of their former owners while the Palestinians languished and Scattered and squalid refugee camps even while the fighting was still ongoing thousands of refugees illegally made their way back into Israel often looking to reclaim pieces of their former lives like clothing or crops they had been attending to when the war broke out in 1956 when the Suz crisis broke out in Egypt things again turned dark in Gaza the Israelis invaded Egypt on October 29th and within days there were reports of several massacres of Palestinians in Gaza by 1964 the Palestinian situation was increasingly destitute but that year sparked a small Beacon of Hope for Palestinian Unity the creation of the Palestinian Liberation Organization or PLO the PLO was the first organization run by Palestinians for the benefit of their people and it offered them a semblance of optimism on June 5th 1967 Israel went to war with three neighboring aggressor states which would be known as the six- day war by the war's end on June 11th 1967 Israel had destroyed the Egyptian Syrian and trans Jordan armies and had gained the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza the West Bank and Jerusalem and even the Golden Heights from Syria in short it was a cataclysmic change for the Palestinians it meant even more displacement and hopelessness amidst the fighting around 380,000 refugees fled camps in the West Bank Gaza and Goen Heights to the surrounding Arab states in addition now occupying these areas Israel absorbed 1.5 million Palestinian refugees into their borders it was hardly a stable situation politically the collapse of the Arab armies during the fighting completely disenchanted the Palestinians with the wider Arab leadership after nearly two decades they were no closer to reclaiming their pre 1948 homes and the failures in June seemed to underscore the impossibility of them ever returning to make matters worse the Israelis began to create settlements in their newly conquered areas from Syria and in East Jerusalem in the West Bank at times evicting Arabs to make way for Israeli settlers this angered the Palestinians and caused International outrage late in 1967 the United Nations passed resolution 242 calling for Israel to leave the territories however ambiguous language allowed Israel to claim legal basis for the occupation which still exists today following the Six-Day War and the start of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories things declined even further for the Palestinian refugees the actions of many in the Israeli government like prime minister golden mayair who refused to acknowledge their existence only angered the Palestinians further feeling ignored on the world stage and confined to filthy and FedEd refugee camps a small minority of Palestinians began to violently lash out so of the worst attacks were the load airport massacre in 1972 which left 25 dead and 72 wounded and the kirat Shona Massacre in 1974 when Arab gunmen killed 18 including many women and children both of these attacks were carried out by the popular front for the liberation of Palestine the pflp a terrorist group based in Palestine at the 1972 Munich Olympics the Palestinian Affiliated terrorist group Black September kidnapped several members of the Israeli Olympic team team and in the ensuing struggle all 11 Israelis died at their hands causing International outrage in 1973 Israel was once again thrust into combat against its neighbors during the yam Kipper or Ramadan War which ended with important political consequences the Egyptians apparently have taken control of at least a portion of the East Bank of the suaz Israel defeated the Egyptians and syrians in the fighting and by the end of the fighting Israel was firmly aligned with the United States once again the Palestinians found themselves left out in the cold and the attacks by terrorist groups continued by the late 1970s the conflict in Israel was again beginning to bleed into the surrounding Arab states and in particular Lebanon and Egypt Lebanon was already in turmoil from an ongoing Civil War and it became a Haven for many militant PLO members following the 1967 6-day war by 1978 the pl's presence in Lebanon was becoming untenable for Israel as they launched deadly crossb border attacks in March a terrorist assault killed more than 40 people in Israel and left at least 70 wounded in response the Israeli Defense Forces or IDF invaded Lebanon which resulted in more than 300 PLO deaths and 12200 civilian deaths this caused 100,000 more civilians to flee in panic later that year the Egyptians Israelis and American President Jimmy Carter held peace negotiations at Camp David to discuss the future of the Sinai occupation but the PLO was not invited in 1979 the negotiations led to the camp David Accord and while Israel agreed to leave Sinai but not Gaza the question of the Palestinians was unaddressed leaving them completely ignored in 1982 the IDF once again entered Lebanon following the attempted assassination of an Israeli Diplomat in London they evicted 11,000 PLO from Beirut before leaving the city though they maintained a presence in southern Lebanon for years to come this again removed the Palestinian leader ERS ship from the Palestinian community and did nothing to quell the overall chaos and tension by 1987 the Palestinians had endured 20 years of occupation and 40 Years of displacement they were becoming increasingly marginalized and subjugated under Israeli occupation as the Israeli Defense Forces controlled and restricted nearly every aspect of their lives the Palestinians were also upset over the increased number of Israeli settlers moving into occupied territories and Israel's oppression of Palestinian political activists in late 1987 the Palestinians discontent finally boiled to the surface in what is known as the first inapa when IDF soldiers shot Palestinian protesters following a car accident in December both the West Bank and Gaza erupted with violence at the heart of the Palestinian struggle was a desire for National self-determination meaning the creation of a Palestinian State the inapa lasted until 1992 gradually becoming more and more violent at first the Palestinians through rocks and Molotov cocktails but soon guns and explosives entered the pictures as the idf's reprisals intensified which included shutting off water and electricity and destroying private property by 1991 there were more than 1,000 dead Palestinians over 37,000 more wounded and another 35,000 to 40,000 had been arrested politically the inata dramatically changed the territories a new militant terrorist group called Hamas formed in 1988 with the explicit purpose of replacing an Israeli state with a Palestinian one and they started carrying out attacks against civilians and IDF soldiers within the territories the Palestinian struggle had entered a new and much more violent phase and showed little progress for peace the first inapa had exposed deep Rifts within Israel not just from a refugee perspective but also among Israelis themselves the widespread violence and huge toll on the Palestinians put their plight front and center to the Israelis and some of them began to openly sympathize with the Palestinians this new attitude along with the election of a more socially liberal labor party combined to create the atmosphere for the first ever comprehensive Israeli Palestinian peace talks the peace process began with the 1991 Madrid conference which the US had pushed for as a solution to the conflict the Israelis met with a joint Jordanian Palestinian delegation in Madrid and public talks continued for a few years but they were not very productive however SE secret negotiations directly between the Palestinian Liberation Organization and Israel commenced and those eventually led to the Oslo one Accords in 1993 in September 1993 Israel the PLO the US and Russia officially signed the first of the Oslo Accords with Oslo 1 For the First Time The PLO and Israelis mutually recognized each other as legitimate Representatives the PLO agreed to publicly renounce terrorism and the Accords also laid out a plan for for future Palestinian self-government though not a full State in 1995 the Oslo 2 Accords were signed which gave the Palestinians slightly more autonomy and control and called for Israeli forces to withdraw from some occupied areas internationally expectations could not have been higher for peace in the Middle East but all parties would soon be sadly shaken to reality at first there was widespread optimism and hope that Oslo could lead to a stable framework for peace but both sides worked to undermine the Accords with tragic efficiency from the Palestinian perspective the Accords did little to alleviate their harsh living conditions their already precarious economic situation still declined the illegal settlements continued the new Palestinian Authority or PA was seen as corrupt and the goal of an actual State seemed just as far away in addition militant terrorist groups like Hamas actively worked to destroy the Accords through numerous terrorist attacks against the Israeli public from the Israeli perspective the Oslo Accords were supposed to guarantee peace from terrorism but Hamas shattered any illusion the PLO or PA could enforce peace measures and stop the bombings in addition the militant and terroristic factions of the Israelis committed their own atrocities such as when an Israeli settler killed 29 Palestinians at a mosque and hibron in 1994 or when they assassinated their own prime minister yitzak Rabin in 1995 in 1996 the Israelis elected Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister which was a symbolic end to the peace process started in Madrid as Netanyahu stopped implementing the Oslo agreements and began increasing the pace of settlements the US tried to salvage the peace process through the 1998 y River Accords but these two conclusively failed when the Oslo Accords collapsed in the late 1990s after years of acrimony many people likely felt that the Israeli Palestinian peace process was dead the peace talks briefly restarted in 2000 at Camp David but no Accord was ultimately reached with tensions already high over the breakdown of the peace process the actions of conservative Israeli politician Ariel Chiron in September 2000 set off a new wave of violence Chiron took 1,000 supporters and marched on the Temple mount in Jerusalem which also contains the sacred aloa mosque Chiron wanted to demonstrate Israeli power but his rhetoric and actions severely angered the Palestinians leading to Stone throwing and demonstrations in response the IDF began shooting and killing demonstrators and the aloa inata was underway peace talks later in the year once again broke down due to violence on the ground and in 2001 the Israelis elected Chiron as the new prime minister compared with the first the aloa inapa was much more violent and characterized by intensive bombing campaigns by Islamic terrorists Additionally the aloa inapa was also much less widespread and less organized among the Palestinians and it was also more costly by the summer of 2003 24 Palestinians and 780 Israelis died in the chaos after the violence of the aloa inata claimed thousands of lives the Israelis began new tactics in the occupied territories in 2005 the Israelis began disengagement or removing the illegal Jewish settlers from Palestinian territory by August the Gaza settlements were no more but the West Bank settlements were untouched even worse for the West Bank the Israelis began building massive barriers to separate the Jewish settlement from the Palestinians areas additionally they built them on Palestinian rather than Israeli land reducing the Palestinians territory even further in the 2006 West Bank elections the terrorist organization Hamas won a stunning Victory taking control for the first time in March 2006 Hamas formally took over the Palestinian Authority ushering in a new era for the West Bank with hamas's refusal to even recognize Israel's right to exist any potential peace talks between the Israelis and the PA were non-starters that summer Hamas and their political Rivals Al fatah began open Warfare in the West Bank characterized by rocket fire and explosive grenades Hamas was in control of Gaza by the following summer Rockets also made their way into Israel and Hamas launched raids that ended with the kidnapping of an Israeli soldier beginning in 2007 due to security concerns over Hamas Israel instituted a complete blockade of Gaza extending over the land sea and air from the moment Hamas took over the Palestinian Authority in 2006 and gained control of Gaza in 2007 it was obvious they were on a crash course with Israel in March 2008 Hamas sent hundreds of missiles over the Gaza border into Israel and the Israelis responded with a two-day assault that killed 116 Palestinians the Israelis launched a massive invasion of Gaza on January 3rrd 2009 after smashing Hamas with air strikes the week prior Israel claimed the attack was in response to Hamas continuing to fire Rockets into Israel and on the day of the invasion Hamas launched another 70 Rockets killing at least four after 3 weeks of warfare the death toll was 1200 Palestinians compared with just 13 Israelis and the Israelis called for a ceasefire Israel remained in Gaza until January 21st 2009 when they withdrew to the Gaza perimeter reports emerged that the Israelis had used white phosphorus during the fighting which could have constituted a war crime if used against civilians by the end more than 1300 Palestinians had died no one's coming to help us not able to stop ground it's very from 2012 to 2018 Gaza was permeated by sporadic violence between Hamas and Israel and thousands of civilians were caught up in the Bloodshed in November 2012 Israel re-entered Gaza for 8 days in response to more Hamas rocket fire into Israel resulting in over 150 dead Palestinians and five dead Israelis before a ceasefire could take effect in July 2014 Israel was back in Gaza this time after Israeli teenagers had been abducted and killed by Hamas in the West Bank the Israelis withdrew after another 1,881 Palestinians and 67 Israelis died in 2018 Gaza City was again a flame and a wash with violence as the Israelis killed at least 170 Palestinians between March and November with Hamas retaliating with rocket fire it was an endless cycle of violence and the civilians felt the brunt of the pain in the West Bank which was not under Hamas control things were also deteriorating the refugee crisis was as bad as ever and by 2021 the United Nations estimated there were at least 871 th000 registered refugees in the West Bank in addition Israeli settlements expanded causing the UN to issue resolution 2334 in 2016 designating them illegal When Donald Trump became the president of the United States in 200 17 it came after he extensively talked up Israel in his campaign in late 2017 Trump acknowledged Jerusalem as the capital and began working to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem which served to Anchor the Palestinians in 2020 Trump helped broker the Abraham Accords which called for Israel and the United Arab Emirates to establish normalized relations while also getting Israel to suspend annexing the occupied West Bank however Trump's actions did little to stop the viol on the ground in Gaza and the West Bank and the killings continued in May 2021 the Israelis evicted six families from a Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem which brought waves of protests in response to the protests Israel invaded killing 20 and leaving more than 300 injured the year 2022 was even more violent and in March Palestinian attacks killed 11 Israelis by the end of the year after numerous Israeli reprisals 166 Palestinians were dead in the West Bank alone much like 2022 ended for the occupied territories 2023 began largely the same way with Israeli raids into the West Bank by January 26th 2023 30 Palestinians were already dead following raids into Janine in search of Islamic Jihad terrorist group members that day Palestinians in Gaza fired rockets at Israel in retaliation and on January 27th a Palestinian gunman shot and killed seven Israeli settlers outside a synagogue near a West Bank Israeli settlement by June the Israelis were using helicopter gunships during their Janine raids resulting in even more Palestinian deaths as of June 19th 2023 the death toll for the year was already 130 Palestinians and 25 Israelis setting it up to be one of the worst years on record for both sides still nobody could have predicted what came next as the next escalation of the Israeli Palestinian conflict would be one of the most devastating in history the 2023 Hamas attacks on October 7th 2023 the Hamas terrorist organization viciously attacked Israel in one of the worst provocations in the history of the Israeli Palestinian conflict Hamas sent a barrage of rockets over the Gaza border into Israel and carried out a devastating ground attack throughout the southern part of the country within a day there were already 700 dead Israelis and the fighting was only beginning in response to the attack the Israelis immediately declared war on Hamas and began a counter offensive which claimed the lives of at least 1,500 and wounded more than 6,600 Palestinians in Gaza by October 13th in addition the Israelis also shut off the power and restricted supplies of food and Medicine by then the Israeli death toll had climbed to over 1,200 people with more than 3,000 wounded innocent people murdered wounded entire families taken hostage by Hamas some of hamas's most Sinister plans included taking hostages thought to be around one 150 many of these hostages were taken from the Nova Music Festival that was underway when the attack was launched and excruciating footage showed the militants murdering innocent civilians as they fled for their lives the true Devastation of the 2023 Hamas Terror attacks won't be known for years but it was the worst flare up in [Music] decades"

His Majesty's government view with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement
of this object. When Balfour wrote of his government's intent  to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine, 90% of the people living there were not Jewish. Just 31 years later, most of them were gone. This is the story of the British promise that led to the destruction of Palestine  and the creation of the State of Israel. Let's start with the obvious question: Why were the British making promises
about other people's countries? Short answer? Empire is one hell of a drug. This was World War I,  and the British were making lots of promises. In addition to promising 
a Jewish homeland in Palestine, They promised Arab leaders independence if they rose up against Britain's enemy, 
the Ottoman Empire. The Arabs did. Hollywood even made a movie about it. - Arabia's for the Arabs now. - That's what I've told them anyway. That's what they think. That's why they're fighting. Oh, surely. A month after Balfour's letter, British troops took Palestine, ending 400 years of Ottoman rule. The people who lived
there were Arabs, mostly Muslims, but they were Christian and Jewish minorities too. There was also a tiny number of European Jews who in the late 1800s had started 
building small colonies there. At a time when many Jews were suffering
horrific persecution in Europe, they felt Palestine could be an escape. The idea of building up a Jewish presence
in Palestine became known as Zionism, but it stayed a fringe movement
among European Jews. Many of them felt they shouldn't have to leave
their countries to avoid persecution. But Zionism, as a political movement,
took a big step forward with an Austrian man called Theodor Herzl. And this guy is a very important name
in this story. In 1896, he published “Der Judenstaat” -  or in English, “The Jewish State.” In it, he said, the only way for Jews to avoid Europe's anti-Semitism was not just to leave, but to have their own country. And Herzl didn't just write. The next year he organized a conference
in Basel, Switzerland: The First Zionist Congress. The attendees agreed on a program which sought, among other things, to establish  a Jewish homeland in Palestine  and promote Jewish settlement in Palestine. From here on out, the Zionist movement became very active, setting up funds to promote Jewish immigration to Palestine, companies to buy land there, and recruiting representatives  to advocate for their cause with different governments. A few days after the conference, Herzl
wrote this in his diary. He was only off by one year.  Ok, so that is a lot of history, but it's important because the Zionist movement is a critical
part of the story going forward. Especially after it found a friend in
the British government where a lot of high ranking officials supported Zionism,
sometimes for unexpected reasons. Prime Minister Lloyd George, for example,
was a Christian zealot who believed gathering the Jewish people in Palestine
would bring Jesus Christ back to earth. Others, like Balfour,
believed that getting the Jewish people out of Europe and into their own country
would be a good thing. Herzl was pretty visionary when he wrote that the anti-Semitic nations will become our allies. Meanwhile, the Zionist assured Britain that their future country would be a reliable ally. So, that's the back story of how  European anti-Semitism, Zionism and British imperialism all led to the Balfour Declaration. This British promise to build  a homeland for Jews in Palestine. Now we're going to look at how Britain did that. World War I  had been a conflict between rival empires and the winners set up the League of Nations to distribute the losing side's 
territories between them. They called it the Mandate System -  putting territories once controlled by  by the Ottoman and German empires under the, until they became independent. Hm. Britain was given the mandate over Palestine, but the Palestinian people
were never asked what they wanted or what independence
would look like to them. Listen to what Balfour wrote to one of his colleagues. Instead, it was the Zionists
who were consulted about  what their vision for Palestine was. And so the mandate ended up incorporating
not just the Balfour Declaration, but several clauses requiring Britain
to ensure the establishment of a Jewish home in Palestine. British rule was very accommodating
to the Zionist project. The Jewish community in Palestine
grew with big waves of immigration. They had their own schools and factories
and even their own militia, the Haganah. And they were led
by the Polish-born David Ben-Gurion, the leader of their representative
body, the Jewish Agency. To the Palestinians, it was clear that Britain wasn't delivering 
them independence. It was delivering their country to other people. In 1936, they went on strike. British forces tried to break the strike  with arrests, torture, mass punishment 
and executions. Leaders were exiled, weapons
confiscated and houses blown up. Palestinian fighters attacked
British and Jewish targets,  while British and Haganah forces would carry out joint raids on Palestinian villages. Something had to change. The British government sent a commission
called the Peel Commission to figure it out,
but their proposed solution was typical: Just draw another British line on the map. Divide the country, give this part to the Jews
and this part to the Palestinians and make that part of 
Transjordan next door. Oh, and because the Palestinians 
were a majority in the country,   250,000 of them would have to 
be removed by force to make the Jewish state viable. Remember, these were the proposals
that were meant to calm things down. Spoiler: they didn't. Instead, the revolt continued until 1939,
by which time about 10% of Palestine's adult male population had either been
killed, injured, arrested or exiled. The British government really needed a solution -  so here comes another report. The commission is studying
the 20 year old Jewish settlements in British-mandated Palestine. The 1939 White Paper created a conflict between the British and the Zionists  for the first time, because it rejected partition and said the solution was for Palestine
to gain independence within 10 years, with everyone
living there sharing it together. Crucially,
it also imposed severe limits on Jewish land purchases and immigration. To the Zionists, this felt like a betrayal. In response, some set off bombs across the
country, killing dozens of Palestinians. But soon everyone was distracted by something much bigger. More than 60 million
people were killed in World War II, including 6 million Jews murdered 
in Nazi death camps. Jewish survivors fled Europe with a large number of them
trying to find safety in Palestine, despite the British limit on Jewish
immigration. This set off a more direct confrontation
between the Zionists and the British, with Palestinians often targeted as well. The Zionists knew two things: The Zionists knew two things: Militarily, they were stronger than the Palestinians and Britain was exhausted by World War II, so it wouldn't have the stomach
to keep fighting in Palestine. They were right. In 1947, after 30 years of occupation,
Britain announced it was quitting Palestine and asked the newly formed
United Nations to clean up its mess. Alright, 1947 and 1948
are the most pivotal years in this story. So let's take a look
at how things are lining up. During British rule,  Jews had gone from 10% to 30% of the population. and owned about 6% of the land. Under Ben-Gurion's leadership,
the Jewish Agency was pretty much functioning
as a government for the Jewish community, And the Zionist militias
had tens of thousands of soldiers, modern weapons and officers
who had already fought in World War II. On the other side, the Palestinians hadn't been allowed to develop
their own administration or military. But as they waited for the UN’s solution, they were still the majority all over the country. In November 1947, the UN - then only made up of a fraction
of the world's countries - voted to partition Palestine. This plan marks off 55% of the country  for a Jewish state. But the UN never explained   how it could be a Jewish state when half the people in its territory were Palestinian. To nobody’s surprise Palestinians -  and in fact all Arabs - rejected the UN’s plan. Ben-Gurion and the Zionist leadership accepted, but they saw an opportunity.
With the British on the way out, the Zionists knew they would have
the strongest military in Palestine. Their forces were instructed
to seize more territory than they'd been awarded by the UN
and to do what was necessary to reduce the number of Palestinians
in it. In cities like Haifa, the militias set off
car bombs in Palestinian neighborhoods. They attacked villages
and forced residents out. - Haganah troops have driven the Arabs out 
of the beleaguered city, taking many prisoners. After inspecting parts of western
Jerusalem that have been emptied
of Palestinians,  Ben-Gurion said: One of the events that helped speed up
these changes took place on April 9, 1948, when the village of Deir Yassin scene was attacked. A British government report to the United Nations describes the scene. 250 people were killed in circumstances
of great savagery. Women and children were stripped, lined up, photographed
and then slaughtered by automatic firing. The story of what happened at Deir Yassin set off panic all over the country. As news spread, people fled, fearing they would be next. Historians have recorded dozens
of similar massacres during this period. Each time they would result in
entire communities fleeing. By the time Britain ended its mandate 
on May 15th, 1948, 250,000 Palestinians had fled. The night before David Ben-Gurion
announced the founding of the State of Israel,  with himself as its first prime minister. He was standing under a giant 
portrait of Herzl, 51 years after Herzl had predicted
this very moment. The Zionist militias came together
as the newly formed Israel Defense Forces, but the fighting wasn't over. With the British out of the way, soldiers from several Arab
countries entered Palestine, but the Israeli army was better equipped,
better organized and,  unlike the Arab armies,  had a unified command and backing
from several European countries. Israeli forces pushed into places
that the UN had assigned to the Palestinian state, like the towns of Lydda and Ramleh. 50,000 people were forced to flee
from there, many on foot, in what became known as the
Lydda Death March. After being emptied, the towns were given
Hebrew names: Lod and Ramla. Like in many other empty
towns, the buildings and homes were taken over by the new Israeli state
and given to Jews. By the time the UN secured an armistice, three quarters of the Palestinian people
had become refugees. In Arabic, they call this the Nakba -  literally, the catastrophe. The new state of Israel made up 78%
of what had been Palestine. The remaining parts were annexed by Jordan
or taken over by Egypt. A year later, the UN passed a resolution calling for all Palestinian refugees to be allowed to return home. They never have been. Palestine had been erased. In the decades since, attempts to resolve this conflict
have again tried to partition the land. With each successive attempt,
the territory offered to Palestinians in their historic homeland shrinks
even more. Ironically, Israel is still struggling
to maintain the population advantage it gained in 1948
when it forced all those people out because in 1967,
it occupied the West Bank and Gaza, bringing all the Palestinians living
there under its rule. And so today,  the population of Jews and non-Jews  in this land is roughly equal. But those living under occupation
have no rights, no citizenship
and no prospect of independence. The Nakba era tactics of settlement, home
demolitions and expulsion are still used against them. Israel has taken the land but wants nothing to do with 
the millions under its rule. International, Israeli
and Palestinian human rights groups say this system is a form of apartheid. To see if that's an accurate 
description of Israel  more than 100 years after Balfour’s promise, watch this video here."

Watch 'Operation Thunderbolt: The Raid on Entebbe' here: https://youtu.be/SWhCg49zm64

The bitter struggle between Arab and Jew for control of the Holy Land has caused untold suffering in the Middle East for generations. It is often claimed that the crisis originated with Jewish emigration to Palestine and the foundation of the state of Israel. Yet the roots of the conflict are to be found much earlier – in British double-dealing during the First World War. This is a story of intrigue among rival empires; of misguided strategies; and of how conflicting promises to Arab and Jew created a legacy of bloodshed which determined the fate of the Middle East.

holy land has caused Untold suffering in the Middle East for Generations it is often claimed that the crisis originated with Jewish immigration to Palestine and the found ation of the state of Israel yet the roots of the conflict are to be found much earlier in British double dealing during the first world war this is a story of intrigue among rival empires of misguided strategies and of how conflicting promises to Arab and Jew created a legacy of Bloodshed which has determined the fate of the Middle East [Music] during the first World War the British the French and the Russians had these secret plans to carve up the Ottoman Empire because they believed that would balance out their Imperial Ambitions but tough luck for the Turks the Arabs and anyone else who got in the way certainly all the seeds were planted there then in the sense that it was the British who promised the Arabs Independence on the one hand and a Jewish homeland on the other and you could not simply reconcile one with the other the British scattered promises to anyone who might be of some use to them without thinking about the consequences so British duplicity British double dealing went a long way to perpetuate the conflict in Palestine at the end of the day when you're fighting a war you are very liberal in what you're offering in terms of a post-war settlement when you get down to the conference table when the war has ended and you have to start honoring your agreements you then have to decide what's in your interest or not and which saw the Middle East as a western flank for their power in India and that power nation in [Music] general the story of Britain's involvement in the Middle East and the ensuing struggle between Arab and Jew begins with her Colonial past at the beginning of the 20th century King Edward iith ruled over a vast Empire with interests in every part of the world India became increasingly important because uh it was the second pillar of British power in the world moving the Indian army about was extremely important in extending British interests and British influence across the globe and the sewi canal was of course the quick way to do that it's very important for the British geopolitical position to ensure the SE Canal remains safe and secure with this aim in mind Britain had become the only European power to establish a major foothold in the Middle East in the principalities around the Persian Gulf in Aiden and in Egypt Britain had annexed Egypt from turkey's Ottoman Empire in 1882 and by the time it was made a protectorate in 1914 Cairo had become the center of British power in the Middle East the presence of Imperial troops in the region was a vital strategic importance for the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Muhammad I was an alliance with Britain's much-feared rival Germany together with the ostroh Hungarian Empire these countries made up the Central Powers and pitted against them with the three allies Britain France and Russia from the ottoman Capital Constantinople in Turkey the sultan ruled over the last of the great Islamic Empires it been an almost terminal decline for decades yet the fate of the Ottoman Empire was to be sealed by the outbreak of the first world war in August [Music] 1914 in Europe Germany's rapid Advance was halted by Britain and France along the western front in the East Russia's war against Germany and Austria Hungary also reached Deadlock the powerful weapons of the Industrial Age were killing thousands of men in the trenches of every Army all of the leing powers expected the war to be over within a matter of months so in that sense all of them are surprised at the end of 1914 when not merely is the war going on but it shows every sign of being likely to go on for a very long time at that point they began to think about new ways of winning the war Britain's prime minister aswith felt that with the stalemate in Europe it was essential to widen the conflict together with foreign secretary Lord gray Minister for war Lord Kitchener and the first Lord of the admiralty Winston Churchill they masterminded a complex strategy to undermine the Central Powers this was a global war and the British saw the Middle East very much in a global context the traditional British preference for sideshows as people um unfavorably call it the indirect strategy the way of attacking the soft underbelly as church will call it of the enemy and the soft underbelly was seen to be turkey Britain's secret plan involved on the one hand a military diversion and on the other a devious use of diplomacy through bribery subversion and double dealing all these devices focused on the 's weakest link turkey's Ottoman Empire diplomacy in general has always had a secret Dimension to it whether but where discretion ends and conspiracy begins is an open question but during the period up to and during the first world war there was a particularly intense set of negotiations and discussions between the major Imperial powers between the French the Russians and the British in particular cutting in the Italians as well about what would they do when the war was over and when the Ottoman Empire broke up the British government hoped that by striking a deal Over The Spoils of War it would strengthen the alliance against the Central Powers amongst the Allies Russia had long sought access to the Mediterranean in a secret treaty of March 1915 Britain and France offered what was to the Zar a prize of vital geopolitical importance Constantinople it is that key Outlet into the wider world and into the Mediterranean and it is the one thing of course the British and the French have been attempting to prevent the Russians from achieving so this is a complete vatche this is this is the British the French and the Russians coming to an agreement over something which was up to this point almost inconceivable Italy's King Victoria Emanuel was another Target for bribery Britain France and Russia tried to tempt Italy a pro- German state to join the Allies in April 1915 a secret treaty offered Italy a substantial bit of Ottoman real estate in Anatolia again it's another power coming into the equation and being offered territorial advancement which in normal circumstances would have been quite inconceivable the bribe worked Italy joined the allies and declared war on the Central Powers in August 1915 but Britain's strategy to undermine the enemy via the Ottoman Empire also required subversion by using domestic opposition to weaken maybe even destroy it Britain exploited a new movement sweeping through the Empire nationalism nationalism in the sense of believing that there are peoples with a clear cultural identity and that these people should live independent that idea spread to the Middle East as to other parts of the world in the latter part of the 19th century so you had the beginnings in the Ottoman Empire of a Turkish nationalism this came to a head when The Young Turks took power in aoup in 1908 and started to impose their language and culture on the Arabs of the Empire but this only reawakened an interest amongst Arabs in their own [Music] [Music] Heritage a thousand years before Arabs had brought the technology and literature of the East to the West and their religion Islam had encompassed much of Asia North Africa and Southwestern Europe the idea of recovering that historic grander had remained in the consciousness of Arab intellectuals by the start of the first world war the antagonism between Arab and Turk had increased the very fact that the Turks were saying we want to have a unified empire meant the Arabs said wait a minute we're not part of this so all of this literary and nationalistic Revival then took a much more political form and therefore you got the emergence of Arab nationalism they had arrived at the conclusion that remaining in the Ottoman Empire was becoming hopeless that they couldn't actually share power with the Turks and they began thinking of having their own state by the the summer of 1915 British intelligence confirmed that the Arab nationalist movement was the Breakthrough the government was looking for Britain and her French Ally dispatched officers to sound out Arab leaders both the French and the British started you could say seducing various local Arab leaders that if you side with us we'll give you your Independence so why don't you leave the Ottomans and very people were tempted as a result if they they thought they could actually gain independence why not side with the Europeans against the Ottomans the idea was to tempt the Arabs into a revolt against their ottoman overlords and create a diversion which would tie down the Central Powers in the Middle East ironically the impetus for such a diversion had come not from London but from the Arab world in the hijaz in Western Arabia Sheriff Hussein its ruler was set on extending his political and geographical domain he believed he might be able to do it with the help of the British in turn the British were impressed by Sheriff Hussein's family credentials as custodians of the holy places of Islam they call themselves hashimites they call the family hashimites because that's the family or the tribe of the Prophet Muhammad they were the bani Hashim the sons of Hashim so he was Sharif Hussein was the leader of the hashimites he was the person responsible for Mecca and Medina and although he had worked with the Ottomans before the first world war once the first world war happened he saw this was his chance a chance too for the British who saw support for Sheriff Hussein as a way to threaten the Sultan's hold on the caliphate the political leadership of the Islamic world the British because they were fighting the Ottomans and the Ottomans were claiming to be the real representative of Islam they wanted a counterforce and the counterforce was represented by Sharif Hussein being a descendant of the Prophet but Sharif Hussein was speaking of liberating Arab lands building a new national state he wanted to be king of the Arabs not simply of Arabians and July 1915 Sheriff Hussein smuggled a message to the British High Commissioner in Cairo say Henry mcmah offering to raise a substantial Arab Force against the Ottomans in return for British support for Arab Independence in the ensuing secret correspondence between the two men Sheriff Hussein was given to understand that he could expect British support in achieving some of his Ambitions in the event of an ottoman defeat this letter of October the 26th 1915 outlined the main points of the arrangement the actual document itself is absolutely Riven with ambiguity there's no doubt about that the question is whether Hussein recognizes that my sense of Hussein is that he does recognize it in other words there is no wool being poured over his eyes because he's perfectly aware that if he's going to create a modern Arab Empire he's going to need some logistical economic development and that can only come from the outside world taking Britain's assurances of support at face value Hussein together with his sons fisel and Abdullah amassed a sizable Force the new Army was commanded by the young and charismatic fisel who had captured the imagination of the Arab masses in the Quest for Arab Independence yet even as husin and fisel mobilized their troops the British were preparing to sell them short back in London in the spring of 1916 Britain was negotiating with France about the future shape of the Middle East behind closed doors some Mark Sykes of the British foreign office had been meeting his French opposite number Francois George Pico Britain knew it was vital to offer the French a stake in The Spoils of the Ottoman Empire should they win the war there was an awareness on the British side that they had made such huge sacrifices that one couldn't just ignore um French Ambitions and the French were determined to have their historical piece of the Levant pouring over a map of the Levant syes and Pico personally Drew in the areas they wish to see under their control their secret deal amounted to the virtual carve up of the Middle East in area a for the French and area B for the British the imperialists intended to exercise power indirectly they would appoint advisers and take charge of the finances in their respective spheres of influence then there was the area colored blue which was to be directly controlled by France this included what was then known as great Assyria where the French traditionally had commercial and religious interests as for the area colored pink known as Iraq with its strategic ports Railways and oil this was to be under British rule the area colored yellow represented Palestine and was envisaged as an international Zone except for Hyer what the British wanted was the oil of Iraq and they concentrated on getting Iraq and getting away from Iraq to the Mediterranean in order to transport this oil so they got haa on the Palestinian coast and they got most of Iraq the Sy P agreement was a pretty shameful document and I wouldn't attempt to Def defended but it was drawn up by people who were sort of operating under the old kind of balance of per considerations in an imperial frame of mind unaware of these secret dealings behind their backs Hussein and fisel proclaimed Independence and in June 1916 attacked the Turkish troops the Arab revolt against the Ottomans had begun the Turkish Garrison at Mecca was soon overrun and the sea port at jida seized by 1917 Hussein and fil's forces had pushed North and engaged the ottoman Turks along the hijaz railway the British saw the Arab Revolt as part of its strategy for creating a military diversion against the Central Powers in a pinsa movement Britain had launched a campaign from the southwest to ensure control of the sez canal and the Levant and from the southeast it was fighting to secure the oil wells of Iraq all this to attack the Central Powers at their weakest point the Ottoman Empire the Arabs hitched their fortunes to the British they considered themselves to be fighting with the allies but at the same time they were not merged into the British army that they continued to act as an independent Army called the northern Army while the Arab Army Advanced northwards Britain's General aleni had crossed the sez canal and by the spring of 1917 his forces had reached the frontier of Palestine the war in Europe however was still not going well for Britain the attempted push through the German lines at the Som had produced little territorial gain and the cost in lives was colossal in London there had been a change of leadership the new prime minister Lord George felt that the Allied war effort needed a fresh impetus although America had so far been neutral in the war Lloyd George was convinced that could be changed he believed there was one powerful Group which might influence the American government Lloyd George thought that the American decision um whether to join or not would defend critically on public opinion and the Jewish support could tilt the scales in One Direction or or the other you've got to remember that the British foreign office greatly overestimate the political power of international jewry particularly the wealthy financial and Commercial uh Jewish Elites what is extraordinary about this situation is that here you have particularly the British seeing the Jewish world as one Collective monolithic entity and in that sense they start looking at the role of the Jews in the war as being something which might be important and from the point of view of the Allies something else quite remarkable this monolithic Collective entity is pro-german many Jews in the upper echelons of German Society did indeed have close connections to the Kaiser's foreign office a new Jewish nationalist movement Zionism had also been able to establish its headquarters in Berlin Zionism had originated in the 1880s after Theodore Herzel published a book espousing the virtues of a Jewish State this caused a sensation amongst Jewish intellectuals in Germany Austria and Russia who shared herzl's outrage at the escalation of anti-jewish [Music] sentiments the end of the 19th century saw the rise of anti-Semitism all over Europe in Austria in Germany in France but particularly in Eastern Europe in Poland and in Russia and the program against the Jews in Russia gave rise to the establishment ofion the lovers of Zion societies uh in a number of Russian cities who started to promote and to finance and to sponsor colonization immigration to Palestine Herzel came to the conclusion that the Jews were not safe anywhere in Europe and the only solution was for the Jews to have a state of their own over which they could exercise sovereignty and where they would not be a [Music] minority what had also given Zionism its appeal was the way in which it fitted in to Historic Jewish aspirations scattered throughout the world since the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in the first century ad many Jews had cherished the idea of returning one day to what their scriptures had told them was the promised land in fact there had already been a small community of indigenous Jews in Palestine but even when some European Jews established settlements throughout the late 19th century the whole Jewish Community by 1914 constituted barely 8% of the [Music] population the Zionist leader in Britain Heim vitman had been lobbying the government for a guarantee that in the event of an ottoman defeat it would support Jewish immigration to Palestine by early 1917 Lord George's view of Jews as globally influential convinced him that Zionism was another nationalist movement which should be coopted to the Allied cause in March Mark Sykes began negotiations with vitman there is a a be in the Bonnet of people like Mark Sykes that actually the Jews do ultimately look to each other and look to their own interest and if that interest as they are being told by vit man is what we really want is Palestine they're prepared to believe it they're prepared to go along with it as negotiations with vitman continued over the following months the war deteriorated rapidly for the [Music] Allies the German submarine campaign was seriously weakening Britain's Merchant Fleet and although America had entered the war on the Allied side President woodro Wilson was not yet willing to supply a significant number of troops Britain's latest attempt to keep up the pressure on the Western Front soon became bogged down in the muddy trenches of passionale as thousands of young men's lives were wasted in another fruitless campaign morale amongst the soldiers plummeted [Music] but the most serious threat to the Allied War Machine came from the East Russia was on the verge of collapse after massive defeats at the hands of the Germans the war weary country was disintegrating with food shortages strikes and demonstrations when the Zar was deposed in a revolution Britain and France became greatly alarmed the point is is that once Russia and its war effort begins to collapse essentially the Germans have won the first World War unless they bring the Americans in there's no way that the British and the French on their own are ever going to defeat Germany in October the British government received an intelligence report suggesting that Jews were a significant influence in the leadership of the Bolshevik party the new revolutionary movement emerging as the dominant force in Russia L George feared that these Communists would take Russia out of the war with the Americans still refusing to commit sufficient forces he knew it was time to act he instructed his foreign secretary Arthur balour to issue a pledge to capture the hearts and minds of the Jewish people his Majesty's government view with favor The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best Endeavors to facilitate the achievements of this object the balour Declaration was issued on November the 2nd 1917 just as British forces were occupying Palestine I would say that the B declaration has to be understood not as an idealistic gesture but it it has to be understood within the framework of British Imperial policy and Lloyd George was the main instigator of that uh declaration because he believed that it would serve Britain's interests but this was also the first time that any major European power had given official backing for the Zionist goal of making Palestine into a Jewish homeland yet Sheriff Hussein had understood that Palestine had been promised as part of his deal for Arab Independence anticipating Arab outrage at the prospect of a Jewish homeland in a largely Arab Province the balur Declaration had also stated that nothing shall be done which may Prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine the Declaration nonetheless appeared to indicate British support for Jewish immigration there were only a m 80,000 out of some like 700,000 people in Palestine who were Jews the in uh indigenous inhabitants of Palestine were referred to as non-jewish inhabitants and that that Palestine was being identified even at that stage as a Jewish land and all the others had no defined ident they were simply non-jewish the B Declaration was what it says a declaration it wasn't a treaty it wasn't a signed agreement it was a declaration in support of the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine in fact the only treaty Brit had signed in regard to Palestine was with the French the secret Sykes Pico agreement on November the 7th within a few days of the balour Declaration the Bolsheviks took power in Russia ly George hoped that it would have the desired effect of appeasing the Jews in the Communist leadership what is it that they supposedly so want as Jews Palestine now the whole argument is is totally illogical it's a nonsense argument because these particular people if one were to think of people like trosky or zenov or yaff some of the key Jewish leaders in the Russian Revolution the November Revolution these these people of course are internationalists there were 15 to 20 Jews in the higher echelons of the bolic party most of them were anti-zionist and after they came to power they um soon after they came to power they issued a declaration to say that Zionism is a capitalist Ploy a capitalist idea the wildly inaccurate intelligence report on which Lord George based his strategy was to have major implications for Britain within weeks Russia's new leaders did exactly the opposite of what he had expected not only did they out of the war they opened up the archives of the zaris foreign office and published The Secret treaties the very treaties Britain had engineered with her allies to carve up the Ottoman Empire and to which Russia had been privy that of course is a very great embarrassment to the Western allies because the Allies have been doing all sorts of deals behind the scenes in which they have handed out to each other large sections of the world meanwhile openly preaching that they are fighting the war in defense of democracy and of course also telling among others the Arabs that they are supporters of self-determination for the peoples of the Ottoman Empire publication of the secret treaties by the Bolsheviks certainly created an enormous suspicion in the Arab world and this meant that the Sharif Hussein and the others said wait a minute what's going on what a why are you not giving us independence and secondly why are you dividing us up into Zone a and Zone B and at that point of course the Arabs realized that not only with the had the British got their own particular interests for example in the ports of Palestine or in Iraq but that they had promised other things to the [Music] French air Arab confusion and suspicion General aleny entered Jerusalem on foot together with Sykes Pico and a number of other Allied notables his British Le forces had captured the holy city in December 1917 the leaders of the Arab Revolt however were nowhere to be seen fearing that Hussein and fisel might lose heart the British government forwarded a message to them reiterating British commitment to Arab Independence the Arab race will be given full opportunity of once again forming a nation in the world this can only be achieved by the Arabs themselves uniting and Great Britain and her allies will pursue a policy with this ultimate unity in view hsein stayed loyal to the Allied cause still prepared to accept Britain's word on Arab Independence although he spoke of settling accounts after the war from alam's point of view he continued to rely on Arab support in the war against the Ottomans but now that Jerusalem had been occupied by the British one party seized the initiative in April 1918 Haim vitman and the international Zionist commission traveled to Palestine to lay the foundation for a Hebrew University their Hope was that it would become the intellectual Hub of Zionism vman's visit however caused widespread alarm and indignation among the Arab population and when he and the chief Rabbi of Jerusalem met General aleny it looked as if Britain Was preparing to honor the Bal for declaration 6 months later alam's forces entered Damascus with their Ally fil's Northern army they had pushed the ottoman troops North through Palestine into Syria the Arab Revolt did contribute to the victory of the Allies first of all it protected the British flank in Palestine second it kept a number of Turkish and German troops preoccupied and third the the British could have never legitimized what they were doing unless they had the blessing of a particular Arab Force on the 3rd of October the people of Damascus flocked to fil's Victory Parade if he was to seize power he knew it was a great importance to make his presence felt and to be seen by the Arab people as their liberator later the same day however fisel met with General aleny at the Victoria Hotel in Damascus alanb warned him that his rule in Syria would be limited the British by that time knew that they were going to hand over Syria to the French so they couldn't actually accept Fel as a legitimate Ruler all they could do is is to pay him uh his salary and the expenses of his army and his administration undaunted by alen's warnings fisel assumed the title of governor of Damascus with the support of his father Sheriff Hussein he set about creating a power base for their goal of an independent Arab State on the 31 first of October the Ottomans were finally [Music] defeated and at 11:00 on the 11th of November 1918 the guns fell silent in Europe as the war with the Central Powers came to an [Music] end the peace conference at versailes began in January 1919 representatives of the vict notorious allies such as the French prime minister clo and the American president woodro Wilson gathered to sort out what was to be done with the former territories of the defeated Empires now the liberal use of promises by the British government had to be prioritized they did indeed make pledges to the Arabs but they also made pledges to the Jews and they also made pledges to the French and the Russians and everybody else and these people saw the world as an imperial world not only did they want to carve out the Middle East they wanted to carve up Russia they thought this was the last great moment in which the Imperial Powers would be able to sit down and grab what was going particularly since there was no one to stop them but Britain and her old Ally France were up against the American President woodro Wilson's vision of a new world order which promoted National self-determination once Independence it seemed to be a possibility that this principle of self-determination uh supported by the Americans was going to be offered to all those who were to be liberated from former Empires like the hapsburgs and the Ottomans what the Palestinians wanted was an independent state in fact fisel had come from Damascus to plead the Arab cause but the future of pal in the Middle East formed part of Britain's pledge to France in the Sykes Pico carve up in the event woodro Wilson's principles about self-determination were forgotten when it came to the people of the Middle East Britain and France were free to go ahead with their agreement but what of the promises Britain had made to the Jews regarding Palestine foreign secretary Arthur Baler in a confidential memo during the Versa peace talks with America France and Italy wrote the four Great powers are committed to Zionism and Zionism be it right or wrong good or bad is rooted in agong Traditions in present needs in future hopes of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land that might sound like a warm endorsement of Zionism yet further in the post-war memorandum balur hints at a much more cynical agenda so far as Palestine is concerned the powers have made no Declaration of policy which at least in letter they have not always intended to violate the Versa peace conference was concluded on June the 28th 199 19 with the creation of the League of Nations the first Global Institution for peace and security its Covenant provided that the Arab and other territories seeded by the defeated Ottoman Empire should be administered by mandates which meant in effect that Britain and France were given the authority to impose their rule over the Arab territories on November the 21st 1919 franois George Pico the co-architect of the Sykes Pico agreement and the French General guro arrived in beut and so began the imposition of the French mandate for Syria and Lebanon the British forces who had occupied the region since ounting the ottoman Turks during the last months of the war were handing over power to the French thus fulfilling their wartime pledge fisel who had been the governor of Damascus now for 16 months had been consolidating his position when he was proclaimed King by the Syrian National Congress the French were incensed and general guro sent in his troops by August the 7th 1920 fisel had been deposed and had to flee to Palestine the promises to Sharif Hussein and fisel of a single independent state were now a distant memory for the Europeans the whole issue of spheres of influence meant that what appeared what was at first appeared to be willingness to accept a single Arab state was in fact seriously diluted and then on top of that of course the very fact of there being a French area and a British area meant that in effect this was the seed of partition so you had both Independence was denied but also the unity of this area was denied the boundaries and governments of the middle eastern states that emerged bore the unmistakable imprint of the Sykes Pico agreement the French half of the previously ottoman province of great Assyria became the Mandate for Lebanon and Syria the other half became the British mandate for Trans Jordan and Palestine in the East the ottoman area of Mesopotamia which included the oil fields of mul was given to Britain as the Mandate for Iraq so this was basically the importance of the sypo agreement to divide what is called the Fertile Crescent between Iraq and Syria and let Britain get access to to the oil of the area and be able to exploit it in the future but British rule was initially rejected by the Iraqi people until fisel was installed as King in July 1921 Britain hoped The Limited Pate devolved to him would serve to bate the frustrated demands for Arab Independence but Sheriff Hussein expected more from the British he never gave up the idea that the British had promised him Independence not only in Arabia but in Syria and Iraq as well and he wanted the British to fulfill their promises Sheriff Hussein's dream of an Arab Kingdom ruled by the hashemites was only partially fulfilled for although his other son Abdullah became king of trans Jordan their old rival ibin saoud swept the hashemites out of hijaz when he conquered the whole of the Arabian pen pinula in Jerusalem an Administration was established by the British in the spring of 1920 there were no plans for devolving power in Palestine Palestine was a land sacred to three religions Jews were a small minority who had lived harmoniously with Christians and the much larger community of Muslims for hundreds of [Music] years but the Bal for declaration promising Jews a homeland in Palestine had been incorporated into the British mandate at Versailles Palestine was thus to be open for new European Jewish immigration with celebrations and parades in support of Zionist activities it seemed as if the British were going to honor their pledges to the Jews and ignore Palestinian hopes of Independence the Arabs had a strong case but very poor Advocates um the zionists had a case it wasn't as strong as that of the local Arabs but they had brilliant Advocates Zionism is one of the greatest Public Relation success stories of the 20th century and K vitman exemplified these traditional Jewish skills of advocacy and uh persuasion some of these skills were clearly in evidence when vitmen and various Zionist groups helped finance land purchases and the building of settlements for immigrant Jews at the same time political and security organiz izations were created to support the emerging Jewish homeland the Arab community in Palestine was incensed the Palestinians couldn't conceive their country being divided or given away to another Community uh which had nothing to do to the Middle East in the first place and was almost holy European at the time so to them it seemed absurd that 600 to 700,000 should give up their land their homes their Villages their towns and hand them over to a minority which was dispersed uh throughout Palestine and Palestine after all is named after its people who are the Palestinians in 1925 Arthur balur Tor the new Jewish settlements in Palestine although he was fated as a hero of the Zionist cause the immigration of European Jews was to have unforeseen consequences for British rule in Palestine I believe that the Balo Declaration was one of the most serious mistakes in British imperial history it uh committed Britain to uh support of Jewish nationalism in Palestine after the war and uh it did not uh produced any immediate benefits for Britain without the bord Declaration there could have been no genuine development of a Jewish National home and the follow through in 1948 where you get the creation of a state of Israel simply would not have happened it requires the umbrella of the British to be there in effect to support the emerging Jewish National home militarily at the bottom line the very fact that there are British troops British policemen there to protect the Jewish communities is ultimately Central to the situation it could not have been done in any other way [Music] throughout the 1930s and 40s the years of Nazi persecution and the Holocaust Jewish immigration to Palestine increased rapidly but what was seen by the Arabs as an alien incursion and the Jews as a fulfillment of historic rights led to polarization and violence in response to terrorist acts by Arabs Britain restricted the immigration but the policy only stimulated Jewish terrorism against this background Britain relinquished its mandate and the state of Israel was born in 1948 when the first of several Wars between the new state and its Arab neighbors began thousands of Palestinian Arabs fled their Homeland thus the Strategies employed by Britain to win the first world war inadvertently left a deep divide between Arab and Jew the most serious consequences of British policy during the war was the encouragement of Arab nationalism and Jewish nationalism and in the aftermath of the first world war Britain was left with this Legacy of of double dealing and of betrayal which was to haunt her for a long long time clearly it played a role in dividing the Arab world into different states in allowing the establishment of the state of Israel and in frustrating Arab desires but if what happened in syes Pico and everything else that happened in the first world war is used as an excuse for the problems of the Middle East now I think that would be a mistake but yes the roots of what we see to today certainly arose from the double dealing of the first world war and from the frustrated expectations of that [Music] time [Music]

It set out British support for the creation of a homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine. But when the Balfour declaration was signed the British had already promised Palestine to Arabs as an independent state and promised the French government that it would be an internationally administered zone – and even then, most of the land was still under Ottoman control.

So why did Britain make these three conflicting promises? How did it try to resolve them? And how did Britain’s strategy in the Middle East help to cause a century of conflict?

https://www.facebook.com/iwm.london",2024-02-07,82482,2401,378,UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA," This is the Balfour Declaration. Signed in 1917, 
It set out British support for the creation of a   homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine. It’s 
a famous document, a crucial piece of the puzzle   in understanding today’s conflicts in the middle 
east. But this it the beginning of the story.  In fact, when the Balfour declaration was signed 
the British had already promised this land to   Arabs as an independent state and promised 
the French government that it would be an   internationally administered zone – and even then, 
most of the land was still under Ottoman control.  So why did Britain make these three conflicting 
promises? How did it try to resolve them? And   how did Britain’s strategy in the Middle 
East help to cause a century of conflict? How's that is that okay? That's good yeah. Well at the turn in 20th century Britain's 
primary interest in the Middle East isn't oil,   we might think of oil, oil and the Middle East 
they always sort of go together especially now.   But what we're really looking at then is an 
imperial lifeline it's the Suez Canal. The   Suez Canal is the quickest route from the 
Empire, especially India the jewel in the   crown of the British Empire, to Britain. You don't 
have to go all the way around the horn of Africa. Britain had controlled Egypt since 
1882 and believed that the Sinai   Desert was enough of a buffer to defend 
the canal. But when the First World War   began in 1914 the Ottoman Empire 
took Germany's side. In February   1915 the Ottomans launched a surprise attack 
across the desert to attack the Suez Canal. It's easily beaten off by the British and Indian 
defenders, but the British are really worried that   the Ottomans are going to use Sinai as a launchpad 
for further attacks on the canal. There's then a   total mind change in British strategy back in 
London. There's stalemate on the Western Front,   the Russians are collapsing into revolution, 
and the idea now is to look for a quick victory   somewhere else away from France and Flanders. And 
Lloyd George thinks Palestine is where we can do   it. We can knock the Ottomans out of the war, but 
also the Suez Canal will be safe from any threat. The area Britain had set its sights on was 
a larger one than today's Israel/Palestine,   made up of different regions east and 
west of the River Jordan. There were   small Christian and Jewish populations, 
but the majority were Muslim Arabs.   After centuries of Ottoman rule many many 
Arabs now wanted a nation of their own. Nationalism is growing across the multinational 
empires of Europe during the late 19th and early   20th centuries and the Ottoman Empire is no 
stranger to this. The main reason for this   is in 1908 there's a revolution within Turkey 
to try to strengthen and modernise the Empire,   it's called the Young Turk Revolution. And what 
happens is some very nationalistic Turks take over   the government and are really into centralizing 
and pushing the idea of Turkish identity. And this   really starts to rile a lot of these Arab 
leaders and this is where we start to get   Pan-Arab nationalism coming up and the idea of one 
independent land for all of those Arab peoples. One of those leaders was Sharif Hussein 
of Mecca. In charge of the Islamic holy   cities of Mecca and Medina, he was held in high 
regard by the local people. The British decided   to use this to their advantage, promising him 
rulership over an independent Arab state if   he rebelled against Ottoman rule. Sure enough in 
1916 the revolt began with Hussein's sons Faisal   and Abdullah leading the fighting. As British 
and Commonwealth troops under General Allenby   advanced through Palestine. Arab militia with 
help from T. E. Lawrence distracted the Ottomans. This is a typical Arab head cloth and its 
accompanying agal which is the headband that   you keep the head cloth firmly on your head. And 
these were actually worn by an Arab who took part   in in that Arab Revolt up through the Hejaz and 
into Palestine and Syria towards the end of the   war. This comes from the regular forces of the 
Sharifian Army these men were former Ottoman   soldiers and they volunteered to fight for 
Arab Independence. And they were particularly   important because of their previous military 
training and skills with modern weapons such   as artillery and machine guns. So these men of the 
Arab forces, they attack lines of communication,   they blow up railways, they attack small 
garrisons, and that makes it very difficult for   the Ottomans to move troops and supplies around. 
And finally of course on the 1st of October 1918,   Faisal and the Arab army have the honor 
of taking the surrender of Damascus. But while the battle for Palestine was still 
raging, the British were doing secret backroom   deals elsewhere. Between November 1915 and 
January 1916 British and French diplomats   Mark Sykes and Francois George Picot carved 
up the Ottoman Empire into British and French   spheres of influence. The borders were largely 
arbitrary, with little regard for ethnicity or   religion of the local populations. France would 
receive modern day Syria and Lebanon as well as   parts of Turkey and Iraq while Britain claimed the 
rest of modern day Iraq and southern and eastern   Palestine. The remainder of the territory 
was to be under International control. What the British are really looking for is an 
extra large buffer zone again for the Suez Canal,   it's all about the Suez Canal. The idea of making 
Palestine an international area, is really because   the British don't want to give this to the 
French, but the French don't want the British   to have it. So it's a compromise and in fact this 
whole agreement is a compromise. It's a wartime   compromise between two countries that happen to 
be allies, but are both still big political and   imperial rivals and they will go back to being 
imperial rivals after the First World War. Having already made commitments to Arab 
nationalists and the French government,   in November 1917 the British made one more promise 
regarding the land in Palestine, this time to   Zionists seeking to set up a national Jewish 
State. Zionism was a social movement that began   in the 1800s. It was founded on the belief that 
Judaism was not only a religion but a nationality   and that Jewish people deserved a state like 
British or French people did. Due to historical   and religious ties to the region, Palestine became 
the desired location for this future Jewish state. So this armband or brassard was worn by a 
Palestinian Jewish volunteer with British forces   serving in that area of the Middle East during 
1918. Interestingly there were three battalions   of Jewish volunteers, one battalion of British, 
one of Americans, and one of Palestinian Jews.   The British volunteers weren't really interested 
in Zionism at all, they were more interested in   using that military service, service to the crown 
to assimilate into British society. It was really   the American volunteers and the local Jewish 
volunteers from Palestine who were really fired   up by Zionism and wanted to use this to defeat the 
Ottoman Empire and secure that Jewish homeland. So   what this object shows us and the story behind it 
is that although Zionism was a popular movement,   the majority of Jews were not Zionists 
and didn't want to move to Palestine. Jewish immigration to Palestine had been slowly 
increasing throughout the 1900s, mainly fueled   by brutal antisemitic and terrible pogroms in 
Russia. By 1914 the Jews in Palestine numbered   around 60,000 or 8% of the population. But for the 
British it was Zionists elsewhere that they were   concerned with. In an effort to win the support 
of Jewish communities in both Allied countries   like the United States, and enemy countries 
like Austria Hungary, the UK foreign secretary   signed the Balfour declaration. Vowing to set up a 
national home for the Jewish people in Palestine. So the Balfour for declaration is signed 
in late 1917, in fact just after Allenby's   victory at the Third Battle of Gaza and 
this map shows the situation just before   that battle. And it shows the confidence the 
British have that they are going to win the   war in the Middle East. Let's face it, on 
this map, they haven't taken all of this   territory yet but they're already looking 
at the postwar settlement in this area. There are people within the British cabinet, Prime 
Minister Lloyd George is one of them, who thinks   that having a Jewish homeland in Palestine is 
the right thing to do. But it's also politically   expedient. The British and French War efforts 
by this time are pretty much under pressure,   there's a manpower crisis, there's a crisis in 
raw materials. The Americans have joined the war   in April 1917 and we really need the Americans to 
to ramp up and get stuck into the war effort. So   the idea is by supporting this Zionist idea it 
will get Jewish financiers and industrialists   in America on side and they will put big pressure 
on the American government to keep them involved   in the First World War and fight for the Allied 
cause. This idea, this is an antisemitic idea   that the Jews control world finance and business 
across capitalist countries. And that idea takes   hold and is one of the reasons we think they 
can put pressure on the American government. The declaration was vague. It said that 
the homeland would be ""in Palestine"",   but didn't say where. It also vowed to 
protect ""civil and religious rights of   existing non-Jewish communities"" but made 
no mention of their political rights. For the British these conflicting promises 
were worth making to assure that they came   out on top in the world's first Total War. And 
they were effective, Britain and France were   victorious over the Central Powers in 1918. But 
now that the war was at an end, the British would   have to face the consequences. The choices they 
made would help to spark a century of conflict. Having captured Damascus in 1918, the British 
military left Faisal and his men in charge of   a military occupation zone, an area that 
Faisal declared the Arab Kingdom of Syria.   However the French were not happy. Hoping to 
maintain their influence in the region they   expelled Faisal in a short war. It was 
a crushing blow to the pan-Arab cause. Instead it was the victorious Allied Powers 
who drew the new borders of the Middle East   in a series of conferences from 1919 to 1923. 
With the formation of the League of Nations,   Britain and France took control under a series 
of mandates. These were intended to prepare   the local populations for independence. 
Initially France was given the mandates   for Syria and Lebanon while Britain was 
given the mandates for Mesopotamia and   Palestine. But after Faisal's defeat the 
British decided to split Palestine in two.   Faisal was given the crown of Mesopotamia and 
his brother Abdullah was given the crown of the   newly created Transjordan. The remainder 
of Palestine would be strictly British. So this 1924 map shows the Palestine that 
came into being after the First World War.   It is not part of a pan-Arab state, in 
fact there is no pan Arab state in this   region. Also it is not an internationally 
controlled area or an area in which the   French have any control at all. It is a 
British administered League of Nations   mandate. What this Mandate for Palestine 
does have however written into its statute   is the Balfour Declaration of a home 
for the Jewish people in Palestine. Jewish immigration to mandatory Palestine continue 
to grow. By 1931 there were 176,000 Jewish people   living there, making up 17% of the population. 
This led to increased tensions, riots, and   violence between the new arrivals and local Arabs, 
who, along with existing Christian populations,   were starting to see themselves not only as 
Arabs but as distinctly Palestinian people. What these new Jewish settlers bring 
in is lots of financial backing and   they start to buy up more and more land. 
So it's more of the fertile agricultural   land of Palestine which actually makes the 
Jewish population increasingly economically   dominant in the area. The British government 
gets very very worried about this. In 1930   the Colonial Secretary puts forward a white 
paper to drastically limit Jewish immigration   into the Palestine mandate. The following 
year 1931, pressure from Zionists within   the British government and also World Zionist 
leaders talks Ramsey McDonald in to dropping   the white paper. And from that moment there is 
no limit on Jewish immigration into Palestine. This reversal coincided with events elsewhere 
that would supercharge the conflict. In 1933   Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany and 
began instituting a wave of antisemitic   policies. This sent shock waves through the 
Jewish communities of Europe. However for   those seeking to flee options were few, with most 
governments maintaining strict limits on Jewish   immigration. For many Jews, Zionists or not, 
traveling to Palestine became the only option. By 1936 the Jewish contingent inside 
Mandatory Palestine had doubled to 28%   of the population. Now tensions began to 
escalate at an alarming rate what began as   a general strike among Palestinian Arabs in 
1936 devolved into violent attacks on Jewish   settlements and British military installations. 
This event became known as The Great Revolt. From this point really you can see 
Palestinian Arab nationalism as opposed   to pan-Arab nationalism. They're fighting 
against an issue, that Jewish homeland and   British control in the region, that no other 
mandate or any other has to fight against.   And they want their own Palestinian State, an 
independent country free from British control. The British response was to crush the revolt as 
quickly as possible with overwhelming strength.   They brought a surge of new troops, more 
men than were serving in India at the time,   and declared martial law in 1937. Favoring tactics 
of collective punishment they destroyed homes   and burned villages to the ground, they 
used aerial bombing even on urban areas,   and arrested killed or exiled Arab 
leaders fracturing their movement. In addition the British use Jewish auxiliary 
units to fight the Arabs during the revolt.   But this is a real turnaround from 1921 
when they disband the Jewish Legion. Now   in 1936/37 the British are so overstretched 
that they really don't care. They just need   boots on the ground to sort this situation 
out and to end this revolt as quickly as   possible. So by the end of the Arab Revolt 17% 
of the Arab male population are either killed,   wounded, imprisoned, or exiled. This 
really weakens the Arab cause in   Palestine just at the moment when the Jewish 
population is getting more and more power."

THE CENTER OF THREE RELIGIOUS FAITHS, THE AREA HAS BEEN CONQUERED, CONTESTED AND RULED BY VARIOUS EMPIRES ACROSS MILLENNIA.  JOHN YANG TAKES A LOOK AT THE MOST RECENT HISTORY OF CONFLICT AND CONQUEST, AND OF SUFFERING AND STRIFE THAT HAS LED THE REGION TO WHERE IT IS TODAY. JOHN: FROM ITS VERY FOUNDING, THE STATE OF ISRAEL HAS BEEN SHAPED BY MODERN WAR. AND ANCIENT NARRATIVES INSCRIBED OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS ABOUT WHO CONTROLS THE LAND BETWEEN THE RIVER JORDAN AND THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA.  >> SAUDI ARABIA. NO. SOVIET UNION. YES. UNITED KINGDOM, ABSTAINS. UNITED STATES, YES. JOHN: IN NOVEMBER 1947, IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE HOLOCAUST, THE UNITED NATIONS VOTED TO PARTITION WHAT WAS THEN THE BRITISH MANDATE OF PALESTINE INTO TWO INDEPENDENT STATES -- ONE JEWISH, ONE ARAB.  JERUSALEM, FOUGHT OVER FOR CENTURIES, WAS TO BE UNDER INTERNATIONAL ADMINISTRATION.  THE CITY IS CENTRAL TO THREE MAJOR RELIGIONS -- JUDAISM, CHRISTIANITY, AND ISLAM.  A SMALL AREA IS ONE OF THE MOST SACRED SITES FOR BOTH JEWS AND MUSLIMS -- THE WESTERN WALL, THE REMNANTS OF THE FIRST AND SECOND JEWISH TEMPLES. AND ABOVE IT, TEMPLE MOUNT, ALSO HALLOWED GROUND FOR MUSLIMS, WHO REFER TO IT AS AL HARAM AL-SHARIF, THE NOBLE SANCTUARY. IN 1948, ISRAEL DECLARED INDEPENDENCE, WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY THE FIRST OF WHAT WOULD BE MANY WARS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ITS ARAB NEIGHBORS.  HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ARABS WERE EVICTED. AN EVENT KNOWN IN THE ARAB WORLD AS THE NAKBA, ""THE CATASTROPHE."" MORE THAN HALF A MILLION FLED TO REFUGEE CAMPS IN THE WEST BANK, GAZA, JORDAN, LEBANON, AND SYRIA.  >> SOME WERE EXPELLED BY FORCE, SOME WERE TERRORIZED AND FLED.  JOHN: HISTORIAN YEZID SAYIGH WAS A PALESTINIAN NEGOTIATOR IN PEACE TALKS IN THE 1990'S.  >> THESE WERE THE PEOPLE WHO WENT FROM BEING FARMERS AND PEASANTS TO BEING REFUGEES TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON HANDOUTS.   JOHN: IN 1967, WITH STUNNING SPEED, ISRAEL DEFEATED A SURPRISE ATTACK BY EGYPT, JORDAN, AND SYRIA IN THE SIX-DAY WAR. SEIZING GAZA FROM EGYPT, THE GOLAN HEIGHTS FROM SYRIA, AND FROM JORDAN, THE WEST BANK AND THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN OF THREE FAITHS, EAST JERUSALEM. THOUSANDS OF ISRAELIS WOULD MOVE TO THOSE TERRITORIES AND SETTLE, VIOLATING INTERNATIONAL LAW SET BY THE UNITED NATIONS.  PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE GROUPS STEPPED UP TERROR ATTACKS. A TACTIC BACKED BY THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, OR PLO, WHICH STARTED TO REPRESENT PALESTINIANS ON THE WORLD STAGE IN THE MID-1960'S. THIS INCLUDED AIRLINER HIJACKINGS AND THE 1972 MUNICH OLYMPIC MASSACRE, A TERRORIST ATTACK THAT PLAYED OUT ON TELEVISION SCREENS ACROSS THE WORLD AND ENDED WITH THE DEATHS OF 11 ISRAELIS, ONE GERMAN POLICE OFFICER, AND FIVE PALESTINIAN GUNMEN.  THEN, IN DECEMBER 1987, A COMBINATION OF FACTORS LED TO LARGELY SPONTANEOUS PALESTINIAN PROTESTS, CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, AND VIOLENT ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAELI SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS. IT WAS THE FIRST PALESTINIAN INTIFADA, OR ""UPRISING."" THE ISRAELI MILITARY RESPONDED WITH BRUTAL FORCE, AND OUT OF THE FIRST INTIFADA EMERGED HAMAS. >> WHEN HAMAS EMERGED UNDER ISRAELI MILITARY OCCUPATION, THE ISRAELI APPROACH WAS TO TOLERATE IT. JOHN: YOSSI ALPHER IS A FORMER MOSSAD OFFICIAL AND FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE JAFFEE CENTER FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES AT TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY. >> IT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE STRICTLY RELIGIOUS, NOT POLITICAL. THAT ILLUSION DID NOT LAST LONG. IT WAS SEEN AS A KIND OF FOIL THAT ISRAEL COULD MANIPULATE AGAINST THE PLO.   JOHN: IN 1988, PLO LEADER YASSER ARAFAT RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST, BUT HAMAS HELD TO ITS BELIEF THAT ISRAEL SHOULD BE ELIMINATED. >> THEY WANTED TO APPEAR MORE MILITANT. IT'S HUGELY IRONIC THAT, OF COURSE, ISRAEL AT THAT TIME HAD AN INTEREST IN TOLERATING HAMAS, IF NOT ACTIVELY ENCOURAGING IT UNTIL, YOU KNOW, THE APPRENTICE TURNED ON THE SORCERER, SO TO SPEAK.  JOHN: IN 1989, ARAFAT SPOKE FROM EXILE IN TUNISIA WITH THE LATE JIM LEHRER.   >> YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT OUR LIVES ARE AS REFUGEES, AS HOMELESS, STATELESS. >> DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE CLOSE TO ACHIEVING THIS, ACHIEVING YOUR STATE? >> YES. >> HOW CLOSE, HOW MUCH TIME WILL IT TAKE? >> NOT MORE THAN A DISTANCE OF A STONE'S THROW. JOHN: A DISTANCE THAT, FOR PALESTINIANS, PROVED TOO FAR. THE INTIFADA LASTED ANOTHER FOUR YEARS. ALMOST 2000 WERE KILLED, WITH PALESTINIAN DEATHS OUTNUMBERING ISRAELI DEATHS THREE TO ONE.  HOPE FOR PEACE CAME IN 1993, WHEN THE PLO AND ISRAEL SIGNED THE FIRST OSLO ACCORDS, THE PRODUCT OF SECRET TALKS OVERSEEN BY THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT. BOTH SIDES COMMITTED TO NEGOTIATING AN END TO THE CONFLICT AND CHARTING A PATH TO PALESTINIAN SELF-RULE IN THE WEST BANK AND GAZA.  IT TRIGGERED A VIOLENT BACKLASH FROM RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS AMONG BOTH ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS, INCLUDING HAMAS.  >> I AM VERY SAD AND VERY SHOCKED. JOHN: AND IN 1995, A RIGHT-WING JEWISH EXTREMIST ASSASSINATED ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN. THE NEXT YEAR, BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, AN OUTSPOKEN CRITIC OF THE ACCORDS AND LEADER OF THE RIGHT-WING LIKUD PARTY, WAS ELECTED PRIME MINISTER.  >> NETANYAHU BASICALLY SAID OSLO IS A MISTAKE. THIS WAS THE POSITION OF THE SETTLERS, THE POSITION OF THE RIGHT WING. NETANYAHU VERY MUCH RODE TO POWER PRESENTING HIMSELF AS THE EXPERT ON TERRORISM. JOHN: BY 1999, LIKUD HAD BEEN DEFEATED AND NETANYAHU REPLACED AS PARTY LEADER BY ARIEL SHARON, A FORMER MILITARY COMMANDER. A YEAR LATER, SHARON LED A MARCH ON THE TEMPLE MOUNT TO ASSERT ISRAELI CLAIMS TO THE BITTERLY-CONTESTED SITE.  THE STREETS OF EAST JERUSALEM AND RAMALLAH IN THE WEST BANK ERUPTED IN VIOLENCE.  THE SECOND INTIFADA WAS UNDERWAY. FIVE YEARS OF PALESTINIAN SUICIDE BOMBERS DETONATING THEMSELVES IN ISRAELI BUSES AND CAFES.  SHARON, BY THEN PRIME MINISTER, ORDERED ISRAELI TROOPS INTO THE WEST BANK AND GAZA. THE SECOND INTIFADA'S DEATH TOLL SURPASSED 4300 PEOPLE. AGAIN, MORE PALESTINIANS THAN ISRAELIS. >> RATHER THAN IMMEDIATELY CLAMP DOWN IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE PEACE PROCESS, ARAFAT CYNICALLY THOUGHT THAT THE VIOLENCE WOULD ACT AS LEVERAGE. THIS IS A TOTAL MISREADING OF DYNAMICS ON THE ISRAELI SIDE, A TOTAL STRATEGIC MISTAKE.  THE SECOND INTIFADA KILLED ANY RESIDUAL READINESS ON THE PART OF THE ISRAELI PUBLIC TO BACK THE OSLO PROCESS AND TO CONTINUE TURNING OVER TERRITORIES. JOHN: ISRAEL BEGAN BUILDING A SECURITY WALL BETWEEN THE WEST BANK AND ISRAEL, AND RENEWED EXPANSION OF WEST BANK JEWISH SETTLEMENTS. IN LATE 2003, PRIME MINISTER SHARON PROPOSED UNILATERALLY PULLING ALL ISRAELI TROOPS FROM GAZA AND DISMANTLING THE SETTLEMENTS THERE. >> IT PAINS ME A LOT, BUT I'VE REACHED A DECISION AND I AM GOING TO CARRY IT OUT. JOHN: IN AUGUST 2005, SOME 8000 ISRAELI SETTLERS ABANDONED 21 SETTLEMENTS. ISRAEL GAVE UP ALL GOVERNING AUTHORITY INSIDE GAZA, BUT CONTINUED TO CONTROL ITS BORDERS. THE NEXT YEAR, HAMAS WON GAZA'S FIRST LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS IN A DECADE. FATAH, THE PARTY AFFILIATED WITH THE PLO, PLACED SECOND. TENSIONS AMONG PALESTINIAN FACTIONS WOULD GO FROM BAD TO WORSE. THE HAMAS LEADERS IN GAZA PRESSED THEIR HARD LINE TOWARD ISRAEL. >> ISRAEL IS OUR ENEMY WHO OCCUPIED OUR LAND AND KILLED OUR LEADERS AND DEMOLISHED OUR HOMES AND JAILED OUR SONS AND UPROOTED OUR TREES. WE WILL NEVER BE ITS ALLY. JOHN: HAMAS ROUTED FATAH FROM GAZA IN EARLY 2007, PUTTING CONTROL OF THE TERRITORIES UNDER DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS. GAZA RULED BY HAMAS, AND THE WEST BANK GOVERNED BY THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY. ISRAEL IMPOSED A BLOCKADE ON GAZA, LIMITING THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS AND PEOPLE IN AND OUT. IT WAS, IN PART, A RESPONSE TO CONTINUED HAMAS ATTACKS OUT OF THE GAZA STRIP. THE U.N. SAYS THE BLOCKADE HAS DEEPENED THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS FOR THE MORE THAN TWO MILLION PALESTINIANS LIVING THERE.  >> YOU CAN IMAGINE SOCIALLY, POLITICALLY, PERSONALLY, ETHICALLY WHAT THAT MEANT. AN IMMENSE POOL OF BITTERNESS AND RESENTMENT.  JOHN: FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS, TENSIONS HAVE SIMMERED BETWEEN PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS, OCCASIONALLY ERUPTING INTO A FULL BOIL. RECURRING ROCKET FIRE FROM GAZA INTO ISRAEL HAS LED TO A SERIES OF MAJOR ISRAELI AIR AND GROUND ASSAULTS ON GAZA.  MORE RECENTLY, THERE'S BEEN FRICTION OVER ISRAELI RESTRICTIONS BARRING YOUNG MUSLIM MEN FROM VISITING THE AL AQSA MOSQUE ON TEMPLE MOUNT, AND EARLIER THIS MONTH, OVER ISRAELI SETTLERS GATHERING AT THE MOSQUE FOR JEWISH PRAYERS. AND NOW, THE NEWEST, MOST-VIOLENT CHAPTER IS BEING WRITTEN IN THE BLOOD OF BOTH PEOPLES. ♪"

#Israel #Palestine #AJPlus",2023-10-12,915349,19866,4705,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg," on November 2nd 1917 Britain's foreign secretary Arthur balfor wrote a letter that would set off a conflict still being fought more than a 100 years later his Majesty's government view with favor The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best Endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object when Baler wrote of his government's intent to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine 90% of the people living there were not Jewish just 31 years later most of them were [Music] gone this is the story of the British promise that led to the destruction of Palestine and the creation of the state of Israel [Music] let's start with the obvious question why were the British making promises about other people's countries the short answer Empire is one hell of a drug this was World War I and the British were making lots of promises in addition to promising a Jewish homeland in Palestine they promised Arab leaders Independence if they rose up against Britain's enemy the Ottoman Empire the Arabs did Hollywood even made a movie about it Arabia's for the Arabs now that's what I've told them anyway that's what they think that's why they're fighting oh surely a month after bal's letter British troops took Palestine ending 400 years of Ottoman rule the people who lived there were Arabs mostly Muslims but they were Christian and Jewish minorities too there was also a tiny number of European Jews who in the late 1800s has started started building small colonies there at a time when many Jews were suffering horrific persecution in Europe they felt Palestine could be an escape the idea of building up a Jewish presence in Palestine became known as Zionism but it stayed a fringe movement among European Jews many of them felt they shouldn't have to leave their countries to avoid persecution but Zionism as a political movement took a big step forward with an Austrian man called Theodore Herzel and this guy is a very important name in this story in 1896 he published duden or in English the Jewish state in it he said the only way for Jews to avoid Europe's anti-Semitism was not just to leave but to have their own country and Herzel didn't just right the next year he organized a conference in basil Switzerland the first Zionist Congress the attendees agreed on a program which sought among other things to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine and promote Jewish settlement in Palestine from here on out the Zionist movement became very active setting up funds to promote Jewish immigration to Palestine companies to buy land there and recruiting representatives to advocate for their cause with different governments a few days after the conference Herzel wrote this in his diary at Basel I founded the Jewish state in 5 years perhaps and certainly in 50 years everyone will perceive it he was only off by one year okay so that is a lot of history but it's important because the Zionist movement is a critical part of the story going forward especially after it found a friend in the British government where a lot of high-ranking officials supported Zionism sometimes for unexpected reasons prime minister Lloyd George for example was a Christian Zealot who believed Gathering the Jewish people in Palestine would bring Jesus Christ back to Earth others like balur belied that getting the Jewish people out of Europe and into their own country would be a good thing Herzel was pretty Visionary when he wrote that the anti-semitic Nations will become our allies meanwhile the zionists assured Britain that their future country would be a reliable Ally so that's the backstory of how European anti-Semitism Zionism and British imperialism all led to the balur Declaration this British promise to build a Homeland for Jews in Palestine [Music] now we're going to look at how Britain did that World War I had been a conflict between rival Empires and the winners set up the League of Nations to distribute the losing SES territories between them they called it the mandate system putting territories once controlled by the Ottoman and German Empires under the quote tutelage of advanced Nations until they became independent H Britain was given the Mandate of over Palestine but the Palestinian people were never asked what they wanted or what Independence would look like to them listen to what Baler wrote to one of his colleagues for in Palestine we do not propose even to go through the form of Consulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the country instead it was the zionists who were consulted about what their vision for Palestine was and so the Mandate ended up incorporating not just the balford Declaration but several Clauses requiring Brit to ensure the establishment of a Jewish Home in Palestine British rule was very accommodating to the Zionist project the Jewish community in Palestine grew with big waves of immigration they had their own schools and factories and even their own militia the hag and they were led by the polish-born David benuron the leader of their representative body the Jewish agency to the Palestinians it was clear that Britain wasn't delivering them Independence it was delivering their country to other people in 1936 they went on strike British forces tried to break the strike with arrests torture Mass punishment and executions leaders were exiled weapons confiscated and houses blown up Palestinian Fighters attacked British and Jewish targets while British and Hagan forces would carry out joint raids on Palestinian Villages something had to change the British government sent a commission called the peel commission to figure it out but there proposed solution was typical just draw another British line on the map divide the country give this part to the Jews and this part to the Palestinians and make that part of trans Jordan next door oh and because the Palestinians were a majority in the country 250,000 of them would have to be removed by force to make the Jewish State viable remember these were the proposals that were meant to calm things down spoiler they didn't instead the Revolt continued until 1939 by which time about 10% of palestine's adult male population had either been killed injured arrested or exiled the British government really needed a solution so here comes another report the commission is studying the 20-year-old Jewish settlements in British mandated Palestine the 1939 white paper created a conflict between the British and the zionists for the first time because it rejected partition and said the solution was for Palestine to gain independence within 10 years with everyone living there sharing it together crucially it also imposed severe limits on Jewish land purchases and immigration to the zionists this felt like a betrayal in response some set off bombs across the country killing dozens of Palestinians but soon everyone was distracted by something much bigger more than 60 million people were killed in World War II including 6 million Jews murdered in Nazi death camps Jewish survivors fled Europe with a large number of them trying to find safety in Palestine despite the British limit on Jewish immigration this set off a more direct confrontation between the zionists and the British with Palestinians often targeted as well the zionists knew two things militarily they were stronger than the Palestinians and Britain was exhausted by World War II so it wouldn't have the stomach to keep fighting in Palestine they were right in 1947 after 30 years of occupation Britain announced it was quitting Palestine and asked the newly formed United Nations to clean up its mess all right 1947 and 1948 are the most pivotal years in this story so let's take a look at how things are lining up during British rule Jews had gone from 10% to 30% of the population and owned about 6% of the land under boran's leadership the Jewish agency was pretty much functioning as a government for the Jewish community and the Zionist militias had tens of thousands of soldiers modern weapons and officers who'd already fought in World War II on the other side the Palestinians hadn't been allowed to develop their own Administration or military but as they waited for the UN solution they were still the majority all over the country in November 1947 the UN then only made up of a fraction of the world's countries voted to partition Palestine this plan marked off 55% of the country for a Jewish state but the UN never explained how it could be a Jewish State when half the people in its territory were Palestinian to nobody's surprise Palestinians and in fact all Arabs rejected the un's plan Boron and the Zionist leadership accepted but they saw an opportunity with the British on the way out the zionists knew they would have the strongest military in Palestine their forces were instructed to seize more territory than they'd been awarded by the UN and to do what was necessary to reduce the number of Palestinians in it in cities like haa the militia set off car bombs in Palestinian neighborhoods they attacked Villages and forced residents out hagard troops have driven the Arabs out of The Bard City taking many prisoners after inspecting parts of Western Jerusalem that have been emptied of Palestinians Boron said in many Arab neighborhoods in the west you do not see even one Arab if we persist it is quite possible that in the next 6 or 8 months there will be considerable changes in the country and to our advantage one of the events that helped speed up these changes took place on April 9th 1948 when the village of dein was attacked a British government report to the United Nations describes the scene 250 people were killed in circumstances of great savagery women and children were stripped lined up photographed and then slaughtered by automatic firing the story of what happened at diasen set off Panic all over the country as news spread people fled fearing they would be next historians have recorded dozens of similar massacres during this period each time they would result in entire communities fleeing by the time Britain ended its mandate on May 15th 1948 250,000 Palestinians had fled the night before David Boron announced the founding of the state of Israel with himself as its first prime minister he was standing under a giant portrait of Herzel 51 years after Herzel had predicted this very moment the Zionist militias came together as the newly formed Israel Defense Forces but the fighting was wasn't over with the British out of the way soldiers from several Arab countries entered Palestine but the Israeli Army was better equipped better organized and unlike the Arab armies had a unified command and backing from several European countries Israeli forces pushed into places that the UN had assigned to the Palestinian State like the towns of LDA and RAM 50,000 people were forced to flee from there many on foot in what became known as the LD the death march after being emptied the towns were given Hebrew names L and ramla like in many other empty towns the buildings and homes were taken over by the new Israeli State and given to Jews by the time the UN secured an Armistice 3/4 of the Palestinian people had become refugees in Arabic they call this the neba literally the catastrophe the new state of Israel made up 78% of what had been Palestine the remaining parts were annexed by Jordan or taken over by Egypt Egypt a year later the UN passed a resolution calling for all Palestinian refugees to be allowed to return home they never have been Palestine had been erased in the decade since attempts to resolve this conflict have again tried to partition the land with each successive attempt the territory offered to Palestinians in their historic Homeland shrinks even more ironically Israel is still struggling to maintain the population Advantage it gained in 1948 when it forced all those people out because in 1967 it occupied the West Bank in Gaza bringing all the Palestinians living there under its Rule and so today the population of Jews and non-jews in this land is roughly equal but those living under occupation have no rights no citizenship and no Prospect of Independence the neba era tactics of settlement home demolitions and expulsion are still used against them no we want nak no Israel has taken the land but wants nothing to do with the millions under its rule International Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups say this system is a form of apartheid to see if that's an accurate description of Israel more than a 100 years after balor's promise

the history hit app the bitter struggle between Arab and Jew for control of the holy land has caused Untold suffering in the Middle East for Generations it is often claimed that the crisis originated with Jewish immigration to Palestine and the foundation of the state of Israel yet the roots of the conflict are to be found much earlier in British double dealing during the first world war this is a story of intrigue among rival empires of misguided strategies and of how conflicting promises to Arab and Jew created a legacy of Bloodshed which has determined the fate of the Middle [Music] East [Music] during the first World War the British the French and the Russians had these secret plans to carve up the Ottoman Empire because they believed that would balance out their Imperial Ambitions but tough luck for the Turks the Arabs and anyone else who got in the way certainly all the seeds were planted then in the sense that it was the British who promised the Arabs Independence on the one hand and a Jewish homeland on the other and you could not simply reconcile one with the other the British scattered promises to anyone who might be of some use to them without thinking about the consequences so British duplicity British double dealing went along with way to perpetuate the conflict in Palestine at the end of the day when you're fighting a war you are very liberal in what you're offering in terms of a post-war settlement when you get down to the conference table when the war has ended and you have to start honoring your agreements you then have to decide what's in your interest or not and but you saw the Middle East as a western flank for that power in India and that power in as in general the story of Britain's involvement in the Middle East and the ensuing struggle between Arab and Jew begins with her Colonial past at the beginning of the 20th century King Edward iith ruled over a vast Empire with interests in every part of the world India became increasingly important because uh it was the second pillar of British power in the world moving the Indian army about was extremely important in extending British interests and British influence across the globe and the SE Canal was of course the quick way to do that it's very important for the British geopolitical position to ensure the SE Canal remains safe and [Music] secure with this aim in mind Britain had become the only European power to establish a major foothold in the Middle East in the principalities around the Persian Gulf in Aiden and in Egypt Britain had annexed Egypt from turkey's Ottoman Empire in 1882 and by the time it was made a protectorate in 1914 Cairo had become the center of British power in the Middle East the presence of Imperial troops in the region was of vital strategic importance for the Ottoman Empire under Sultan muhamed I was in Alliance with Britain's much-feared rival Germany together with the austr Hungarian Empire these countries made up the

the great Islamic Empires it had been an almost terminal decline for decades yet the fate of the Ottoman Empire was to be sealed by the outbreak of the first world war in August [Music] 1914 in Europe Germany's rapid Advance was halted by Britain and France along the western front in the East Russia's war against Germany and Austria Hungary so reached [Music] deadlock the powerful weapons of the Industrial Age were killing thousands of men in the trenches of every Army all of the leading Powers expected the war to be over within a matter of months so in that sense all of them are surprised at the end of 1914 when not merely is the war going on but it shows every sign of being likely to go on for a very long time at that point they began to think about new ways of winning the war Britain's prime minister aswith felt that with the stalemate in Europe it was essential to widen the conflict together with foreign secretary Lord gray Minister for war Lord Kitchener and the first Lord of the admiralty Winston Churchill they masterminded a complex strategy to undermine the Central Powers this was a global war and the British saw the Middle East very much in a global context the traditional British preference for sidh shows as people um unfavorably call it the indirect strategy the way of attacking the soft underbelly as church WIll called it of the enemy and the soft underbelly was seen to be turkey Britain's secret plan involved on the one hand a military diversion and on the other a devious use of diplomacy through bribery subversion and double dealing all these devices focused on the enemy's weakest link turkey's Ottoman Empire diplomacy in general has always had a secret Dimension to it where but where discretion ends and conspiracy begins is an open question but during the period up to and during the first world war there was a particularly intense set of negotiations and discussions between the major Imperial powers between the French the Russians and the British in particular cut in the Italians as well about what would they do when the war was over and when the Ottoman Empire broke up the British government hoped that by striking a deal Over The Spoils of War it would strengthen the alliance against the Central [Music] Powers amongst the Allies Russia had long sought access to the Mediterranean in a secret treaty of March 1915 Britain and France offered what was to the zar a prize of vital geopolitical importance Constantinople it is that hey Outlet into the wider world and into the Mediterranean and it is the one thing of course the British and the French have been attempting to prevent the Russians from achieving so this is a complete Volta fche this is this is the British the French and the Russians coming to an agreement over something which was up to this point almost inconceivable Italy's King Victoria Emanuel was another Target for bribery Britain France and Russia tried to tempt Italy a pro- German state to join the Allies in April 1915 a secret treaty offered Italy a substantial bit of Ottoman real estate in Anatolia again it's another power coming into the equation and being offered territorial advancement which in Normal circumstances would have been quite inconceivable the bribe worked Italy joined the allies and declared war on the Central Powers in August 1915 but Britain's strategy to undermine the enemy via the Ottoman Empire also required subversion by using domestic opposition to weaken maybe even destroy it Britain exploited a new movement sweeping through the empire [Music] nationalism nationalism in the sense of believing that there are peoples with a clear cultural identity and that these people should have independent that idea spread to the Middle East as to other parts of the world in the latter part of the 19th century so you had the beginnings in the Ottoman Empire of a Turkish nationalism this came to a head when The Young Turks took power in a coup in 1908 and started to impose their language and culture on the Arabs of the empire but this only reawakened an interest amongst Arabs in their own [Music] Heritage a thousand years before Arabs had brought the technology and literature of the East to the west and their religion Islam had encompassed much of Asia North Africa and Southwestern Europe the idea of recovering that historic grander had remained in the consciousness of Arab intellectuals by the start of the first world war the antagonism between Arab and Turk had increased the very fact that the Turks were saying we want to have a unified empire meant the Arabs said wait a minute we're not part of this so all of this literary and nationalistic Revival then took a much more political form and therefore you got the emergence of Arab nationalism they had arrived at the conclusion that remaining in the Ottoman Empire was becoming hopeless that they couldn't actually share power with the Turks and they began thinking of having their own state by the summer of 1915 British intelligence confirmed that the Arab nationalist movement was the Breakthrough the government was looking for Britain and her French Ally dispatched officers to sound out Arab leaders both the French and the British started you could say seducing various local Arab leaders that if you side with us we'll give you your Independence so why don't you leave the Ottomans and various people were tempted as a result if they they thought they could actually gain independence why not side with the Europeans against the Ottomans the idea was to tempt the Arabs into a revolt against their ottoman overlords and create a diversion which would tie down the Central Powers in the Middle [Music] East ironically the impetus for such a diversion had come not from London but from the Arab world in the hijas in Western Arabia Sheriff Hussein its ruler was set on extending his political and geographical domain he believed he might be able to do it with the help of the British in turn the British were impressed by Sheriff Hussein's family credentials as custodians of the holy places of Islam they called themselves hashimites they're called the family hashimites because that's the family or the tribe of the Prophet Muhammad they were the bani Hashim the sons of Hashim so he was Sharif Hussein was the leader of the hashimites he was the person responsible for Mecca and Medina and although he had worked with the Ottomans before the first world war once the first world war happened he saw this was his chance a chance too for the British who saw support for Sheriff Hussein as a way to threaten the Sultan's hold on the caliphate the political leadership of the Islamic world the briti because they were fighting the Ottomans and the Ottomans were claiming to be the real representative of Islam they wanted a counterforce and the counterforce was represented by Sharif Hussein being a descendant of the Prophet but Sharif Hussein was speaking of liberating Arab lands building a new national state he wanted to be king of the Arabs not simply of Arabians in July 1915 Sheriff Hussein smuggled a message to the British High Commissioner in Cairo Sir Henry mcmah offering to raise a substantial Arab Force against the automans in return for British support for Arab Independence in the ensuing secret correspondence between the two men Sheriff Hussein was given to understand that he could expect British support in achieving some of his Ambitions in the event of an ottoman defeat this letter of October the 26th 1915 outlined the main point point of the arrangement the actual document itself is absolutely Riven with ambiguity there's no doubt about that the question is whether Hussein recognizes that my sense of Hussein is that he does recognize it in other words there is no wool being poured over his eyes because he's perfectly aware that if he's going to create a modern Arab Empire he's going to need some logistical Economic Development and that can only come from the outside world taking Britain's assurances of support at face value Hussein together with his sons fisel and Abdullah amassed a sizable Force the new Army was commanded by the young and charismatic fisel who had captured the imagination of the Arab masses in the Quest for Arab Independence yet even as Hussein and fisel mobilized their troops the British were preparing to sell them short back in London in the spring of 1916 Britain was negotiating with France about the future shape of the Middle East behind closed doors Sir Mark Sykes of the British foreign office had been meeting his French opposite number franois George Pico Britain knew it was vital to offer the French a stake in The Spoils of the Ottoman Empire should they win the war there was an awareness on the British side that they had made such huge sacrifices that one couldn't just ignore um French Ambitions and that French were determined to have their historical piece of the lant poor over a map of the Levant Sykes and Pico personally Drew in the areas they wish to see under their control their secret deal amounted to the virtual carve up of the Middle East in area a for the French and area B for the British the imperialists intended to exercise power indirectly they would appoint advisers and take charge of the finances in their respective spheres of influence then there was the area colored blue which was to be be directly controlled by France this included what was then known as greater Syria where the French traditionally had commercial and religious interests as for the area colored pink known as Iraq with its strategic ports Railways and oil this was to be under British rule the area colored yellow represented Palestine and was envisaged as an international Zone except for Hyer [Music] what the British wanted was the oil of Iraq and they concentrated on getting Iraq and getting away from Iraq to the Mediterranean in order to transport this oil so they got haa on the Palestinian coast and they got most of Iraq the syes Pico agreement was a pretty shameful document and and I wouldn't attempt to defend it but it was drawn up by people who were sort of operating under the old um kind of balance of power considerations in an imperial frame of [Music] mind unaware of these secret dealings behind their backs asan and fisel proclaimed Independence and in June 1916 attacked the Turkish troops the the Arab revolt against the Ottomans had begun the Turkish Garrison at Mecca was soon overrun and the sea port at jida seized by 1917 Hussein and fil's forces had pushed North and engaged the ottoman Turks along the hijaz railway the British saw the Arab Revolt as part of its Strat strategy for creating a military diversion against the Central Powers in a pinsa movement Britain had launched a campaign from the southwest to ensure control of the sez canal and the Levant and from the southeast it was fighting to secure the oil wells of Iraq all this to attack the Central Powers at their weakest point the Ottoman Empire the Arabs hitched their fortunes to the British they considered themselves to be fighting with the Allies but at the same time they were not merged into the British army that they continued to act as an independent Army called the northern Army while the Arab Army Advanced northwards Britain's General Allenby had crossed the sez canal and by the spring of of 1917 his forces had reached the frontier of [Music] Palestine the war in Europe however was still not going well for Britain the attempted push through the German lines at the Som had produced little territorial gain and the cost in lives was colossal in Lon there had been a change of leadership the new prime minister Lloyd George felt that the Allied war effort needed a fresh impetus although America had so far been neutral in the war Lloyd George was convinced that could be changed he believed there was one powerful Group which might influence the American government Lloyd George thought that the American decision um whether to join or not would defend critically on public opinion and the Jewish support could tilt the scales in One Direction or or the other you've got to remember that the British foreign office greatly overestimate the political power of International jewelry particularly the wealthy financial and Commercial uh Jewish Elites what is extraordinary about this situation is that here you have particularly the British seeing the Jewish world as one Collective monolithic entity and in that sense they start looking at the role of the Jews in the war as being something which might be important and from the point of view of the Allies something else quite remarkable this monolithic Collective entity is pro- German many Jews in the upper echelons of German Society did indeed have close connections to the Kaiser's foreign office a new Jewish nationalist movement Zionism had also being able to establish its headquarters in [Music] Berlin Zionism had originated in the 1880s after Theodore Herzel published a book espousing the virtues of a Jewish State this caused a sensation amongst Jewish intellectuals in Germany Austria and Russia who shared herzl's outrage at the escalation of anti-jewish [Music] sentiments the end of the 19th century saw the rise of anti-Semitism all over Europe in Austria in Germany in France but particularly in Eastern Europe in Poland and in Russia and the prgram against the Jews in Russia gave rise to the establishment ofion the lovers of Zion societies uh in a number of Russian cities who started to promote and to finance and to sponsor colonization immigration to Palestine [Music] Herzel came to the conclusion that the Jews were not safe anywhere in Europe and the only solution was for the Jews to have a state of their own over which they could exercise sovereignty and where they would not be a [Music] minority what had also so given Zionism its appeal was the way in which it fitted in to Historic Jewish aspirations scattered throughout the world since the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in the first century ad many Jews had cherished the idea of returning one day to what their scriptures had told them was the promised land in fact there had already been a small community of indigenous Jews in Palestine but even when some European Jews established settlements throughout the late 19th century the whole Jewish Community by 1914 constituted barely 8% of the [Music] population the Zionist leader in Britain Heim vitman had been lobbying the government for a guarantee that in the event of an ottoman defeat it would support Jewish immigration to Palestine by early 19177 Lloyd George's view of Jews as globally influential convinced him that Zionism was another nationalist movement which should be co-opted to the Allied cause in March Mark syes began negotiations with vitman there is a a be in the Bonnet of people like Mark Sykes but actually the Jews do ultimately look to each other and look to their own interest and if that interest as they are being told by vitman is what we really want is Palestine they're prepared to believe it they're prepared to go along with it as negotiations with vitman continued over the following months the war deteriorated rapidly for the [Music] Allies the German sub Marine campaign was seriously weakening Britain's Merchant Fleet and although America had entered the war on the Allied side President woodro Wilson was not yet willing to supply a significant number of troops Britain's latest attempt to keep up the pressure on the Western Front soon became bogged down in the muddy trenches of passionale as thousands of young men's lives were wasted in another fruitless campaign morale amongst the soldiers plummeted but the most serious threat to the Allied War Machine came from the East Russia was on the verge of collapse after massive defeats at the hands of the Germans the war weary country was disintegrating with food shortages strikes and demonstrations when the Zar was deposed in a revolution Britain and France became greatly alarmed the point is that once Russia and its war effort begins to collapse essentially the Germans have won the first World War unless they bring the Americans in there's no way that the British and the French on their own are ever going to defeat [Music] Germany in October the British government received an intelligence report suggesting that Jews were significant influence in the leadership of the Bolshevik party the new revolutionary movement emerging as the dominant force in Russia Lloyd George feared that these Communists would take Russia out of the war with the Americans still refusing to commit sufficient forces he knew it was time to act he instructed his foreign secretary Arthur balour to issue a pledge to capture the hearts and Minds minds of the Jewish people his Majesty's government view with favor The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best Endeavors to facilitate the achievements of this object the balour Declaration was issued on November the 2nd 1917 just as British forces were occupying Palestine I would say that the Balo declaration has to be understood not as an idealistic gesture but it has to be understood within the framework of British Imperial policy and Lloyd George was the main instigator of that uh declaration because he believed that it would serve Britain's interests but this was also the first time that any major European power had given official backing for the Zionist goal of making Palestine into a Jewish homeland yet Sheriff Hussein had understood that Palestine had been promised as part of his deal for Arab Independence anticipating Arab outrage at the prospect of a Jewish homeland in a largely Arab Province the Bal for declaration had also stated that nothing shall be done which may Prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine the Declaration nonetheless appear to indicate British support for Jewish immigration there were only a mere 80,000 out of some like 700,000 people in Palestine who were Jews the in uh indigenous inhabitants of Palestine were referred to as non-jewish inhabitants and that that Palestine was being identified even at that stage as a Jewish land and all the others had no defined identity they were simply non-jewish the baffo Declaration was what it says a declaration it wasn't a treaty it wasn't a signed agreement it was a declaration in support of the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine in fact the only treaty Britain had signed in regard to Palestine was with the French the secret Sykes Pico agreement on November the 7th within a few days of the balour Declaration the Bolsheviks took power in Russia ly George hoped that it would have the desired effect of appeasing the Jews in the Communist leadership what is it that they supposedly so want as Jews je Palestine now the whole argument is is totally illogical it's a nonsense argument because these particular people if one were to think of people like trosky or zinovev or yaff some of the key Jewish leaders in the Russian Revolution the November Revolution these these people of course are internationalists there were 15 to 20 Jews in the higher echelons of the Bolshevik party most of them were anti Zionist and after they came to power they um soon after they came to power they issued a declaration to say that Zionism is a capitalist Ploy a capitalist idea the wildly inaccurate intelligence report on which Lloyd George based his strategy was to have major implications for Britain within weeks Russia's new leaders did exactly the opposite of what he had expected not only did they pull out of the war they opened up the archives of the zaris foreign office and published The Secret treaties the very treaties Britain had engineered with her allies to carve up the Ottoman Empire and to which Russia had been privy that of course is a very great embarrassment to the Western allies because the Allies have been doing all sorts of deals behind the scenes in which they have handed out to each other large sections of the world meanwhile openly preaching that they are fighting the war in defense of democracy and of course also telling among others the Arabs that they are supporters of self-determination for the peoples of the Ottoman Empire publication of the secret treaties by the bolik certainly created an enormous suspicion in the Arab world and this meant that the Sharif Hussein and the others said wait a minute what's going on what a why are you not giving us independence and secondly why are you dividing us up into Zone a and Zone B and at that point of course the Arabs realized that not only were the had the British got their own particular interests for example in the ports of Palestine or in Iraq but that they had promised other things to the [Music] French aid Arab confusion and suspicion General aleny entered Jerusalem on foot together with Sykes Pico and a number of other Allied notables his British Le forces had captured the holy city in December 1917 the leaders of the Arab Revolt however were nowhere to be [Music] seen fearing that Hussein and fisel might lose heart the British government forwarded a message to them reiterating British commitment to Arab Independence the Arab race shall be given full opportunity of once again forming a nation in the world this can only be achieved by the Arabs themselves uniting and Great Britain and her allies will pursue a policy with this ultimate unity in view Hussein stayed loyal to the Allied cause still prepared to accept Britain's word on Arab Independence although he spoke of settling accounts after the war from alam's point of view he continued to rely on Arab support in the war against the Ottomans but now that Jerusalem had been occupied by the British one party seized the initiative in April 1918 Heim vitman and the international Zionist commissioner traveled to Palestine to lay the foundation for a Hebrew University their Hope was that it would become the intellectual Hub of Zionism vman's visit however caused widespread alarm and indignation among the Arab population and when he and the chief Rabbi of Jerusalem met General alanby it looked as if Britain Was preparing to honor the balfor Declaration 6 months later alam's forces entered Damascus with their Ally fil's Northern army they had pushed the ottoman troops North through Palestine into Syria the Arab Revolt did contribute to the victory of the allies first of all it protected the British flank in Palestine second it kept a number of Turkish and German troops preoccupied and third the the British could have never legitimized what they were doing unless they had the blessing of a particular Arab Force [Music] on the 3rd of October the people of Damascus flocked to fil's Victory Parade if he was to seize power he knew it was of great importance to make his presence felt and to be seen by the Arab people as their [Music] liberator later the same day however fisel met with General alanby at the Victoria Hotel in Damascus Allenby warned him that his rule in Syria would be [Music] limited the British by that time knew that they were going to hand over Syria to the French so they couldn't actually accept faad as a legitimate Ruler all they could do is to pay him uh his salary and the expenses of his army and his administration undaunted by alen's warnings fisel assumed the title of governor of Damascus with the support of his father Sheriff Hussein he set about creating a power base for their goal of an independent Arab state on the 31st of October the Ottomans were finally [Music] defeated and at 11:00 on the 11th of November 1918 the guns fell silent in Europe as the war with the Central Powers came to an [Music] end the peace conference at Versailles began in January 1919 representatives of the Victorious allies such as the French prime minister clo and the American president woodro Wilson gathered to sort out what was to be done with the former territories of the defeated Empires now the liberal use of promises by the British government had to be prioritized they did indeed make pledges to the Arabs but they also made pledges to the Jews and they also made pledges to the French and the Russians and everybody else and these people saw the world as an imperial world not only did they want to carve out the Middle East they wanted to carve up Russia they thought this was the last great moment in which the Imperial Powers would be able to sit down and grab what was going particularly since there was no one to stop them but Britain and her old Ally France were up against the American President woodro Wilson's vision of a new world order which promoted National self-determination Nation once Independence had seemed to be a possibility that this principle of self-determination uh supported by the Americans was going to be offered to all those who were to be liberated from former Empires like the hapsburgs and the Ottomans what the Palestinians wanted was an independent state in fact fisel had come from Damascus to plead the the Arab cause but the future of Palestine in the Middle East formed part of Britain's pledge to France in the syes Pico car up in the event woodro Wilson's principles about self-determination were forgotten when it came to the people of the Middle East Britain and France were free to go ahead with their agreement but what of the promises Britain had made to the Jews regarding Palestine foreign secretary Arthur Baler in a confidential memo during the Versa peace talks with America France and Italy wrote the four Great powers are committed to Zionism and Zionism be it right or wrong good or bad is rooted in agong Traditions in present leads in future hopes of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land that might sound like a warm endorsement of Zionism yet further in the post-war memorandum balur hints at a much more cynical agenda so far as Palestine is concerned the powers have made no Declaration of policy which at least in letter they have not always intended to [Music] violate the verai peace conference was concluded on June the 28th 1919 with the creation of the League of Nations the first Global Institution for peace and security its Covenant provided that the Arab and other territories seeded by the defeated Ottoman Empire should be administered by mandates which meant in effect that Britain and France were given the authority to impose their rule over the Arab [Music] territories on November the 21st 1919 franois George Pico the co-architect of the Sykes Pico agreement and the French General guro arrived in beut and so began the imposition of the French mandate for Syria and [Applause] Lebanon the British forces who had occupied the region since ounting the ottoman Turks during the last months of the war were handing over power to the French thus fulfilling their wartime pledge fisel who had been the governor of Damascus now for 16 months had been consolidating his position when he was proclaimed King by the Syrian National Congress the French were incensed and general guro sent in his troops by August the 7th 1920 fisel had been deposed and had to flee to [Music] Palestine the promises to Sharif Hussein and fisel of a single independent state were now a distant memory for the Europeans the whole issue of spheres of influence meant that what appeared what was at first appeared to be willingness to accept a single Arab state was in fact seriously diluted and then on top of that of course the very fact of there being at French area and a British area meant that in effect this was the seed of partition so you had both Independence was denied but also the unity of this area was denied the boundaries and governments of the middle eastern states that emerged bore the unmistakable imprint of the Sykes Pico agreement the French half of the previously ottoman province of great Assyria became the Mandate for Lebanon and Syria the other half became the British mandate for Trans Jordan and Palestine in the East the ottoman area of Mesopotamia which included the oil fields of mul was given to Britain as the Mandate for Iraq so this was basically the importance of the sapo agreement to divide what is called the Fertile Crescent between Iraq and Syria and let Britain get access to the oil of the area and be able to exploit it in the future but British rule was initially rejected by the Iraqi people until fisel was installed as King in July 1921 Britain hoped The Limited Pate devolved to him would serve to bate the frustrated demands for Arab Independence but Sheriff Hussein expected more from the British he never gave up the idea that the British had promised him Independence not only in Arabia but in Syria and Iraq as well and he wanted the British to fulfill their promises Sheriff Hussein's dream of an Arab Kingdom ruled by the hashemites was only partially fulfilled for although his other son Abdullah became king of trans Jordan their old rival ibin saoud swept the hash ites out of hijaz when he conquered the whole of the Arabian peninsula in Jerusalem an Administration was established by the British in the spring of 1920 there were no plans for devolving power in Palestine Palestine was a land sacred to three religions Jews were a small minority who had lived harmoniously with Christians and the much larger community of Muslims for hundreds of [Music] years but the balfor Declaration promising Jews a homeland in Palestine had been incorporated into the British mandate at Versailles Palestine was thus to be open for new European Jewish immigration with celebrations and parades in support of Zionist activities it seemed as if the British were going to honor their pledges to the Jews and ignore Palestinian hopes of Independence the Arabs had a strong case but very poor Advocates um the zionists had a case it wasn't as strong as that of the local Arabs but they had brilliant Advocates Zionism is one of the greatest Public Relation success stories of the 20th century and K vitman exemplified these traditional Jewish skills of advocacy and uh persuasion some of these skills were clearly in evidence when vitman and various Zionist groups helped finance land purchases and the building of settlements for immigrant Jews at the same time political and security organizations were created to support the emerging Jewish homeland the Arab community in Palestine was [Music] incensed the Palestinians couldn't conceive their country being divided or given away to another Community H which had nothing to do with the Middle East in the first place and was almost holy European at the time so to them it seemed absurd that 600 to 700,000 should give up their land their homes their Villages their towns and hand them over to a minority which was dispersed uh throughout Palestine and Palestine after all is named after Ser its people who are the Palestinians in 1925 Arthur balur tour the new Jewish settlements in Palestine although he was fated as a hero of the Zionist cause the immigration of European Jews was to have unforeseen consequences for British rule in Palestine I believe that the Balo declaration was one of the most serious mistakes in British imperial history it uh committed Britain to uh support of Jewish nationalism in Palestine after the war and uh it did not uh produce any immediate benefits for Britain without the Bala declaration there could have been no genuine development of a Jewish National home and the follow through in 1948 where you get the creation of a state of Israel simply would not have happened it requires the umbrella of the British to be there in effect to support the emerging Jewish National home militarily at the bottom line the very fact that there are British troops British policemen there to protect the Jewish communities is ultimately Central to the situation it could not have been done in any other [Music] way throughout the 1930s and 40s the years of Nazi persecution and the Holocaust Jewish immigration to Palestine increased rapidly but what was seen by the Arabs as an alien incursion and the Jews as a fulfillment of historic rights led to polarization and violence in response to ter terrorist acts by Arabs Britain restricted the immigration but the policy only stimulated Jewish terrorism against this background Britain relinquished its mandate and the state of Israel was born in 1948 when the first of several Wars between the new state and its Arab neighbors began thousands of Palestinian Arabs fled their [Music] Homeland thus the Strategies employed by Britain to win the first world war inadvertently left a deep divide between Arab and Jew the most serious consequences of British policy during the war was the encouragement of Arab nationalism and Jewish nationalism and in the aftermath of the first World War was left with this Legacy of double dealing and of betrayal which was to haunt her for a long long time clearly it played a role in dividing the Arab world into different states in allowing the establishment of the state of Israel and in frustrating Arab desires but if what happened in syes Pico and everything else that happened in the first world war is used as an excuse for the problems of the Middle East now I I think that would be a mistake but yes the roots of what we see today certainly arose from the double dealing of the first world war and from the frustrated expectations of that [Music] time"

like you to think. We’ve long been sold the narrative of a
tit for tat squirmish of rockets, a real-estate dispute or even a centuries old religious
feud. There’s so much more to the story of Palestine
- we all need to know. So, how did we get here? Let’s take it back to the beginning. It starts with the end of a World War, Muslims
fighting each other and a promise made by the West only a century ago. So here’s how the story begins… It’s 1916 and the first World War is raging
on. The Ottoman Empire is 617 years old at this
point and is on the brink of collapse. The British and the French had promised the
Arabs sovereignty and Arab leadership over the Arabian peninsula and the Levant if they
helped them defeat the Ottomans. And so the Arab’s said ‘Ok’… and so
they helped them defeat the Ottomans. Now I know what you’re thinking, ‘What’s
this got to do with Palestine and the creation of Israel?’Just trust me, we'll get there Okay, so when the British and the French won,
the Arabs wanted the land that was promised to them, but little did they know, the British
and the French had this little top secret meeting. And in this top secret meeting, it was planned
that the captured Ottoman province will be divided into areas of British and French control
and influence. The British would receive Palestine, Jordan
and Southern Iraq while the French would control southeastern Turkey, northern Iraq, Syria
and Lebanon. This was called the Sykes-picot agreement. But then the Arabs found out about this agreement
and they were shocked. They had been bamboozled and tricked. They thought that they were fighting a war
inorder to overthrow their non-Arab Muslim rulers, only to end up with, you guessed it,
European colonial rulers instead. Anyway, that’s a long story for another
video. Now that the British occupy Palestine, something
unusual is happening back in Europe. You see, The Zionist movement had grown increasingly
influential and lobbied hard to support the mass migration of Jews to Palestine and recognise
a Jewish claim to the Palestinian land. And in 1917, Britain, out of nowhere publicly
declared it’s intentions of establishing a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine. So the British just gifted Palestine, a country
which was made up of 90% Palestinians to European Zionists. They gave it just like you would give a box
of chocolates. Historians still debate till this day on how
or why the british gave Palestine to the Zionists. It's simply baffling. Now at this point, the Jewish population in
Palestine at the time was less than 10 percent. So when the British started to facilitate
the immigration of European Jews to Palestine from 1922 and 1935, the Jewish population
rose to 27 percent. With the British Mandate in full swing, mass
European Jewish immigration meant that more land would be seized and the native Palestinian
population grew increasingly worried. The Palestinians would demonstrate their concerns
to their British overlords but they wouldn’t have it. European Jewish settlement was on the rise. The British proposed a partition of Palestine
and even advised the forceful removal of the Arab population from their homes. And yes this was their plan to resolve the
issue. So the Palestinians naturally rejected and
revolted against the British. The revolts were crushed violently killing
thousands of Palestinians. But the Palestinians wouldn’t give up. They would continue their fight for independence
and the British were clearly fed up. So in 1947, the British decided to hand over
their responsibility for Palestine to the United Nations. So basically, they just said ‘Here, clean
our mess.’ And so the UN proposed this ridiculous proposal
where Palestine would be partitioned into a Jewish and Arab state. Remember, Jews in Palestine only constituted
one-third of the population - most of whom arrived from Europe a few years earlier yet
in the proposal they were allocated 55 percent of the land. Feeling like they got a bad deal, again, the
Arabs rejected the proposal and the Zionests accepted, however here’s the catch, the
Zionests didn’t agree to the proposed borders and even campaigned for more land. So they agreed to an Israeli state but didn’t
agree to the size of it so they can just choose it for themselves. By 1948, Zionest militia would storm and capture
Palestinian populated villages and cities leaving thousands of Palestinians homeless
and landless. The zionest wanted to seize and cleanse as
much land from Palestine before the British would officially withdraw their forces. And on the same day that they left, the Zionest
proclaimed the establishment of the new Israeli state. Overnight millions of Palestinians lost their
country. And what's even more bizarre, is that immediately
the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union recognised the new state
of Israel. And if it couldn't get any worse, May 15,
1948 was perhaps one the darkest days in Palestine’s history. They called it the Nakba, or the catastrophe. To lose your country, your identity and your
home just like that is something truly horrifying. But that wasn’t enough for those Palestinian
men, women and children. They had to be ethnically cleansed from their
lands and driven into near-total destruction. See, the creation of the state of Israel didn’t
just mean that 1.9 million Palestinians were forced out of their homes, didn’t just mean
that 78 percent of historic Palestine had been taken from it’s natives, didn’t just
mean that 530 villages and cities were destroyed and ethnically cleansed and didn’t just
mean the killing of 15,000 Palestinians in a series of mass atrocities. It means that it was the start of something
even more horrifying for the Palestinian people. It signalled over 70 years of occupation,
home demolitions, arbitrary arrests, displacements, Israeli expansion, military checkpoints, construction
of walls, discrimination, massacres and bombing of innocent men, women and children in their
own homes. So no, it's not complicated. The Palestinians are a people who have been
oppressed and have had their homes taken away from them and have been suffering ever since. This is how the events of the past shape the
conditions of today. This is why it is important to remember and
reflect on our history before it repeats itself again. Because Allah knows we don’t need it to
happen again in another part of the world. May Allah lift the pain and the struggles
from our Palestinian borthers and sisters. Ameen."

has so many components immigration national identity Empires and colonialism democracy religion and modernization terrorism victimization persecution and War the question of Palestine must still remain on the world's agenda even when focusing on the simplest building blocks of its very Beginnings we can see how more more than anything subtle emphases differences between well-intentioned observers matters because of this I've carefully selected three main sources and drawn on many others the first and one I recommend the most is a very readable textbook called Arabs and Israelis conflict and peacemaking in the Middle East it's by three Scholars Abdul monum sedali Shai fieldman and khil shikaki and it pays careful attention attention to different historical narratives before analyzing them as even-handedly as possible then Palestinian American historian Rashid khalid's the Hundred Years War on Palestine is from a Palestinian perspective while Israeli writer Arisha vit my promised land is from an Israeli one their politics their strategies and tactics different they were together only in their vow to eradicate Israel and to return to of course even referring to a perspective as Israeli or Palestinian is an enormous oversimplification ignoring the vast differences there will always be within and between groups I've also drawn on a few historians who've been labeled Israeli new historians this loose group have challenged a traditional historical narrative in Israel that has been dominant this is something will come to in a bit the literature on this is vast intellectual humility is required so I'll only focus here on the origins only saying what I've read in these books I'll also return to a note briefly on how and why I've approached this in the way that I have at the end towards the end of the 19th century outbreaks of violence against Jews called pogroms increased across Eastern Europe in most countries Jews were second class citizens they couldn't own land vote had different and varying legal rights and were marginalized lived in ghettos and often randomly blamed for disruptions and targeted and murdered this was coming to a head in the last two decades of the 19th century in 1881 in Russia Jewish communities were attacked after Zar Alexander II was assassinated and one of the conspirators incidentally had Jewish ancestry a wave of pograms resulted but this was just one of many many instances in what we now call mova in 1903 49 Jews were killed and many more injured raped and their homes attacked the New York Times reported that the local police made no attempt to check the reign of terror at Sunset the streets were piled with corpses and wounded those who could make their escape fled in Terror and the city is now practically deserted of Jews in 1894 France's only Jewish Army C Alfred draus was accused of spying for Germany and wrongly prosecuted for treason in a widely publicized trial there were anti-semitic riots across the country eugenic theories about Superior races and blood and soil were also on the rise even in countries where Jews had rights like the US and Britain anti-Semitism was increasing both will have fascist parties and both will have outbreaks of violence so in 1897 seeing the writing on the wall the austr Hungarian Jewish journalist Theodore Herzel wrote a pamphlet the Jewish State arguing that the Jewish people needed a national home to avoid continual persecution he encouraged Jewish Europeans to buy land in Palestine but also considered Argentina the book resulted in the first Zionist Congress that same year Herzel was more than preent writing half a century before the Holocaust many Jews fearing for their lives left their homes in Eastern Europe most went to America some elsewhere and a few started moving to Palestine it's important to remember that this is a relatively borderless period traveling was very different and Palestine had been administered by the decaying Ottoman Empire for centuries it was home to a small number of Jews who lived peacefully with the vast majority of Arabs mainly Muslims with a few Christians this was a very different period from today Empires were the norm but often in Decline borders always changing and ideologies becoming powerful and the idea of nation states that a the people had the right to self-determine to govern themselves was on the rise in 1800 the population of the area was 2% Jewish some 6,700 by 1890 42,000 Jews had moved there while the Arab population was around half a million and by 1922 the Jewish population had doubled to 83,000 towards the end of the 19th century Jewish settlers began buying land from absent Urban Arab landlords leading to the displacement of the Arab peasants who had worked the land until then as a result 500 Arabs signed a letter of complaint to the Ottomans about this in 1891 in his book my Promised Land Arisha vit describes the complex and sometimes contradictory motivations of the young Zionist movement at the end of the 19th century for some fleeing violence it's a matter of life and death for others like his own British Jewish great-grandfather it's a comp Le Lex Choice One comprised of solidarity with those fleeing persecution yes but also a romantic idea of the holy land and a modern idea too of a new thriving modern technological future that could be built in a land that was widely and falsely seen to be empty as judaic studies Professor David Novak has written the modern Zionism that emerged in the late 19th century was clearly a secular nationalist movement however it also had deep religious and historical roots to draw on as well that it was the Jewish ancestral Homeland The Exodus from Egypt to the promised land and later Exiles and returns to it was hotly debated but Zionism was never unified many many disagreed religious and secular alike and those who did agree or became sists did so for many reasons shave points out that travelers from places like Britain didn't see Palestine for what it was they saw empty desert they saw a few bwin tribes they saw possibility they didn't see the Palestinian Villages and towns or maybe he says they chose to ignore them the zionists and The Travelers also saw poverty dirt huts and Tiny villages they believed or said they believed as many colonists also claim it's important to note that the indigenous population would benefit from prosperous Jewish capital education technology and ideas and it's true that many did drawing on his grandfather's Diaries chevit asks why his grandfather did not see after all he was served by Arab stors Arab staff at hotels Arab villagers carried his luggage he was led by Arab guides and Horsemen and was shown Arab cities shave uses a word blindness they were too focused on a romantic ideal of the area and a tragic oppression they were fleeing from shereit writes between memory and dream there is no here and now not everyone was blind though at the beginning of the the 20th century one Zionist author Israel's anguil gave a speech in New York that reported that Palestine wasn't empty that they would have to quote drive out by sword the tribes in possession as our forefathers did this was heresy no one wanted to hear it he was ignored by the Zionist movement and so between 1890 and 1913 around 880,000 immigrated in the short period between World War I and World War II the same number again and this snowall with the rise of Nazism in the 1930s between 1933 and 1940 a quarter of a million fled Germany in 1935 alone 60,000 moved to Palestine more than the entire Jewish population in 1917 with this came millions in capital and investment the building up of settlements Villages and towns it continued to grow this huge demographic movement coincided with the most important shift of power in the region the defeat of the Ottoman Empire during World War I and subsequent British control during the first world war zionists in Palestine provided valuable information to Britain formed spy networks and volunteered to fight at the same time a coalition of Arabs supported Ed Britain by rising up against the Ottomans in the great Arab Revolt in return they were promised an independent Arab state by the British but Britain made several contradictory promises in quick succession in 197 the balfor Declaration a memo between foreign secretary Lord balur and Lord Rothchild committed the British government to a home for the Jewish people in Palestine the Bal for declaration neglected to mention the word Arab once who comprised 94% of the population it read his Majesty's government view with favor The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best Endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may Prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine all the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country here lies the roots of the conflict the contradictory promise when the promised land became twice promised in the words of historian aish reporting this news in Palestine was banned by the British but another contradictory promise came instead after the defeat of the Ottomans the British and French divided the area into spheres of influence under the Sykes Pico agreement in 19 1916 leaving Palestine as a British mandate under British control this was the famous line in the sand drawn by people who had little knowledge of the area in a private 1919 memo only published 30 years later Lord balur admitted that in Palestine we do not propose even to go through the form of Consulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the country the four Great powers are committed to Zionism Zionism be it right or wrong good or bad is rooted in agong Traditions in present needs in future hopes of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land the British mandate gave the Jewish agency in Palestine status as a public body to help run the country and Jewish communities and leaders started forming institutions for self-defense and governance which the British slowly recognized essentially becoming a government in Waiting as a result outbreaks of violence began to increase in the 1920s getting progressively worse in 1929 hundreds of Jews and Arabs were killed and hundreds more wounded at the Western Wall in Jerusalem tensions Rose resulting in a series of massacres of Jews by Arabs one of which in Hebron led to the the death of almost 70 Jews and the injuring of many more in response to the violence the British declared a state of emergency they proposed a legislative Council that would be comprised of six nominated British and four nominated Jewish members and 12 elected members including two Christians two Jews and eight Muslims but seeing themselves as outnumbered on a council in a country in which they were the clear majority Palestinian an rejected the proposal another was proposed that was slightly fairer to the Palestinians but this time it was rejected by the zionists and by British Parliament during the largest wave of immigration as the Nazis came to power Palestinians called for a general strike demanding an end to Jewish migration and the sale of land to zionists by absentee Urban landlords which continued to dispossess peasants in 19 1936 an Arab Revolt started when Arab gunmen shot three Jews setting off a series of attacks and counterattacks leading to the deaths of around 450 Jews and 101 British the British response was Swift and brutal 5,000 Arabs were killed by the British violence continued into 1937 and many were imprisoned and exiled 10% of the Arab population were killed injured imprisoned or exiled khedi puts the figure higher he wrote that it was a bloody war waged against the country's majority which left 14 to 177% of the adult male Arab population killed wounded imprisoned or exiled zahed Ali fieldman and shikaki write that it was disastrous for the Palestinians in one instance an 81-year-old Rebel leader was executed after being fined with a single bullet the British tied Palestinian prisoners to the front of their cars to prevent ambushes and homes were destroyed many were tortured and beaten including at least one woman however as a result of the unrest in 1937 a British government report recommended two states for the first time but the Arab State wouldn't be Palestinian it was to be mer merged with trans Jordan in 1939 British government policy put forward in a white paper decided to cool for a single jointly administered Palestine and limited Jewish immigration and land sales the Holocaust changed all of this and even more disastrous for the Palestinians was their leadership's decision to side with Hitler in 1941 as he had told them that the Nazis had no plans to occupy Arab land as the true extent of the Holocaust became clearer the plight of European Jews became more urgent in the eyes of European and US policy makers it's crucial to remember the extent of the horror 6 million Jews industrially murdered after the war there were a quarter of a million Jews living in refugee camps in Germany alone Britain was bankrupt and pulling out of many of its former colonies Syria Lebanon Jordan and Egypt all of the countries surrounding Palestine gained their independence and an Arab League was formed by them more plans were proposed including the Morris andrady Plan in 1946 calling for two separate autonomous Arab and Israel regions under British defense which was again rejected by both zionists and Palestinians a un plan in 1947 proposed 43% of the area going to Palestinians despite them comprising 2/3 of the population this was rejected by the Arab higher committee who called for a 3-day general strike the newly independent or quasi independent at least surrounding Arab states were becoming increasingly hostile to Zionist ISM and sensitive to the plight of the Palestinians but they also saw potential potential to either increase their own territory or to gain power for themselves in the region they were self-interested Egypt saw itself as a new Ottoman Empire King Abdullah of trans Jordan saw Palestine as part of trans Jordan he thought that Victory would be secured in quote no more than 10 days and the USSR seeing the potential of a state of Israel as a socialist Ally provided weapons to the zionists seeing themselves as decisively outnumbered and outgunned with no tanks Navy or aircraft as the Arab countries to varying degrees did benguan secured a deal with Czechoslovakia for $28 Million worth of weapons and ammunition increasing their supply of weapons by 25% and ammunition by 1,000% in 1968 benan remembered that the Czech weapons truly saved the state of Israel without these weapons we would have not remained Alive by now it was essentially a state of civil war with continued attacks and counterattacks and in early 1948 knowing the British would leave Arab countries were preparing to invade and Je je State institutions in Waiting were preparing a plan of Defense there were of course already many Jewish settlements outside of the proposed un partition boundaries and of course many Palestinian ones within Zionist leadership prepared for what was called Plan D which included quote self-defense against Invasion by regular or semi-regular forces and freedom of military and economic activity within the Border orders of the Hebrew State and in Jewish settlements outside its borders and all of this was exasperated by British bankruptcy and a Hardline Zionist militant group called anuran who bombed the British mandate headquarters killing 92 people and were involved in many murders and skirmishes and brutalities with the Palestinians in the worst in April of 1948 urgen killed between 100 250 men women and children in a village near Jerusalem despite a non-aggression pact being agreed between them so on the 15th of May 1948 the British left the day before David benguan declared the establishment of a new state of Israel the day after a coalition of Arab forces from Egypt Jordan Syria Lebanon and Iraq invaded for the most part Israel captured or defended the areas allotted to them by the 1947 un plan as well as many areas outside of it hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced to flee their homes Palestinians Now call it the nabar the catastrophe and the result of the war was the Gaza Strip under Egypt's control the West Bank contested but under the control of trans Jordan's forces to be annexed in 1950 and anywhere between 400,000 and a million Palestinians displaced there is complexity and this is only a small fraction of this story but it's impossible to ignore that the knar was a catastrophe power differentials foreign influence Empire failures to compromise perpetration of atrocities the loss of homes and land that would never be returned to the Palestinians were left divided outnumbered and kept Weak by Britain zionists America the USSR and its surrounding Arab neighbors journalist Arthur kler famously said that one nation solemnly promised to a second Nation the country of a third and while British prime minister Neville Chamberlain had tried to limit immigration to Palestine he was replaced by Winston Churchill one of the biggest supporters of Zionism in British public life in 1937 Churchill said of Palestine that I do not agree that the dog in a Manger has the final right to the manger even though he may have Lain there for a very long time I do not admit that right I do not admit for instance that a great wrong has been done to the red Indians of America or the black people of Australia I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race a higher grade race a more worldly wise race to put it that way has come in and taken their place in response to the UN planning to partition Palestine in 1947 several Arab countries warned or even threatened violence against Jews in their own countries and expulsion in 1950 51 Iraq withdrew Jews Iraqi nationality and property rights anti-Semitism in Yemen led to the migration of 50,000 Jews between 1949 and 1950 and there were attacks on Jews in Tripoli before the war in 1945 whether the threats from spokespeople of Arab countries and the punitive policies and the attitudes began before the war or as a result of it is a matter of debate what becomes clear though or unclear is that moral and ethical answers depend on the minui of often unanswerable questions ones that historians are still often acrimoniously debating anyone who tells you that answers are easy to come by are wrong anti-Semitism was at its height the Holocaust had just happened Jewish migrants had purchased land and settled in Palestine peacefully for decades but among these difficulties there are some indisputable figures the UN partition plan offered Palestinians 43% of the land despite them comprising 68% of the population and around 700,000 Palestinians became refugees shave cites an interesting letter written from an Israeli he knew who for F in the 4748 war in it he wrote at the time that when I think of the thefts the Looting the robberies and recklessness I realize that these are not merely separate incidents together they add up to a period of corruption the question is earnest and deep really of historic Dimensions we will all be held accountable for this era we shall face judgment and I fear that Justice will not be on our side and this is another report from an Israeli military Governor reporting the conversation when Palestinians were forced from the small city of liia in 1948 during the war after the Israelis triumphed the Palestinian dignitaries said what will become of the prisoners detained in the mosque the governor responded we shall do to the prisoners what you would do had you imprisoned us dignitaries no no please don't don't do that Governor why what did I say all I said is that we will do to you what you would do to us dignitaries please no master we beg you not to do such a thing the governor no we shall not do that 10 minutes from now the prisoners will be free to leave the mosque and leave their homes and leave lier along with all of you and the entire population of lier dignitaries thank you master God bless you and with that they were gone and in many cases people left before the war broke out in one case the Israeli mayor even begged the Palestinians to stay in their Town although this was only one recorded case for many years the Israeli narrative although to call it that is far too simplistic ignoring the disagreements differences and dissent within the Israeli narrative was was that surrounding Arab states called upon the Arabs in Palestine to leave so that they could invade school books in Israel taugh that Israelis wanted peace but they were surrounded by enemies who wanted their destruction that the Palestinian Arabs fled to safety as a natural process of War this was challenged in the80s as official archives were opened and a generation of new historians in Israel looked at the period differently Benny Morris one of those new historians has argued that there was no master plan of expulsion however it was understood that it was in the leadership's interests to establish a Jewish state with as small of a minority of Palestinian Arabs as possible many say that the order came from benguan directly including later prime minister zzak Rabin who reported in his autobiography that bangua had given him the order to expel the Palestinian Arabs of lyia when Rabin published this in 1979 it was censored and the Battle of narratives rages in Israel to this day what to me seems in disputable is that there was an overwhelming atmosphere of fear of Exodus of violence and beatings of many massacres too that led to 700,000 Palestinians leaving their home never to [Music] return thank you everyone for watching I want to reiterate though that I'm not an expert in this area I have though approached this with an open mind thorough research from a variety of sources in the time that I've had and good faith I've only included what's been written in books from well credentialed and well reviewed historians and commentators that being said there might somewhere be a mistake or at least places I've said too emphatically something which might be contested this is obviously a controversial and contested period and the debates and research are ongoing if there turn out to be any glaring errors which I doubt or mistakes by Omission which could be more likely and they come from well sourced feedback I will make those Corrections in a pinned comment I should also just add a note on my reasoning for making this video I had no intention to do so at first but over the past month or so I decided that on balance if well-intentioned careful commentators with the requisite background knowledge don't then the space This Strange New Media space we find ourselves in is left to those with large Ms closed minds and an intolerance for thorough Fair research

A TimeGhost chronological documentary produced by OnLion Entertainment GmbH.",2023-12-13,83181,2893,722,UCLfMmOriSyPbd5JhHpnj4Ng," the promised land what would happen if you promis that land the very same land to two different peoples at the same time what if the land you promis isn't even yours to promise away in the first place wouldn't that create an irreversible mess that might take generations to resolve if it can be resolved at all for the answer we only have to look at what the British and French Colonial Powers did to the Jewish and Arab people who share a belief that bibl land around Jerusalem is their promised land this is how the Israeli Palestinian conflict began I'm Sparticus Olen I'm Sebastian Brader Sebastian one of our most recent additions to our time G team has done the research for and co-written with me this special extra long episode of time ghost into context today due to increasing demand from our community and events tragically unfolding in Israel and Palestine we will look into the historical beginnings of the Israeli Palestinian conflict we will try to uncover what motivations mechanisms and historical events led to today's situation to be clear we are historians and we do not take sides in this conflict our side is always Humanity all of humanity and always Humanity never just a part of humanity we expressly condemn all forms of hatred and Terror and expect all nations to uphold the principles of international law conflict and War to narrate the events unfolding in the world as we speak is not our purpose it is also not our purpose to assign blame or Justify the actions of one or the other party we simply give you the past events as they unfolded we hope that may help you all to better understand if not the causes then at least some of the historical aspects and perhaps in a perfect world become part of a future solution we also do not pretend to have covered every event or every aspect of this conflict not even in this long an episode but we do claim that what we will get is to as much of a concise fair and precise overview as possible okay most of the time when dealing with generational longlasting conflicts the roots of the problem reach back far into ages past in this case they reached back very far indeed several Millennia in fact the year year is 1098 Common Era and Pope Urban II called for the first of eight eventual Crusades the goal to capture the holy city of Jerusalem why you may ask at its core it's really quite simple basic geopolitical consideration about power and wealth the sjuk Empire had made significant territorial gains against the byzantines in the decade before this threatens to change the entire power structure in Asia Minor for the Christians in the Eastern Roman Empire and then the Holy Roman Empire control of the region offers strong economic incentives most notably through trade hence when alexio the first asks for help from his Western Christian Brethren the motivations are clear however this is not what the pope presents to the general public as his main reason he and the Catholic church spread the narrative that the pilgrimage to the holy city has become perilous and uncertain for most Travelers this message packaged in the form of propagandistic church sermons whips up a sort of religious fervor and fanaticism about protecting the Cradle of Christianity from Heathen influence and ensuring the safe pilgrimage of Believers to the holy SES and in the end the Pope's Ambitions and those of contemporary rulers are not fulfilled as you may have already guessed by the fact that there were eight Crusades to make a very very long story short all this paves the way for 10 centuries R of sectarian conflict that continues to ferment Strife to this day and has globally become an ingrained aspect of the perceived identity of the region in other words Jerusalem has been the hot spot of conflict between the three abrahamic religions since at least 1098 if you count Jewish Strife in the region by itself even all the way back to Antiquity that is why in our search for answers we need to tread carefully when examining the importance of Jerusalem and the Very ious conflicts that have been fought over it throughout the centuries as we mentioned one of the reasons for the First Crusade was the threat of Muslim influence in Asia Minor roughly 350 years later on the 19th of May 1453 the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire would not only Mark the definitive end of Christian influence in Asia Minor but also its eventual demise in Eastern Europe the Ottoman Empire would remain in control of the region for almost 500 years and would shape the region its people and its future the city of Jerusalem can perhaps serve as a proxy to understand the makeup of the Ottoman Empire as a whole it is a land of many cultures religions and peoples the census taken in Jerusalem from 1562 to 1563 underlines this it's roughly 10% of the population are then Jewish 12% Christian and 78% Muslim Within These distinctions based on religion many more could be made on culture overall however the population was rather small at 12,617 total contrary to the west where Jewish people continually face persecution and discrimination from the 16th to the 19th century they are rather safe and prosper under ottoman Rule now a quick sidebar here yes the Jews in Jerusalem were relatively safe compared to Western Europe at least but they were still not full citizens any non-muslims were considered diim or people of The Pact based on passages in the Quran Surah 9:29 fight against Those whom the scriptures were given and who believe not in God until they pay the tribute out of hand and are humbled members of other religions are expected to pay a special tax wear distinctive clothing and Obey other rules which set them apart from the first class citizenry of of the Empire while not perfect this two class system is still significantly less discriminatory than the status quo in Western Christendom even more so as the conflict within the Western Christian Nation intensifies throughout the 17th century Jewish people are seen as potential allies diplomats and spies as the persecution in Europe continues Jews from Spain Sicily France and Hungary settle all over the empire overall throughout the existence of the Ottoman Empire until its very end its Jews and Arabs generally got along fairly well and without much Strife because of different diasporas Jewish people coming to the Ottoman Empire were descendants of people who had migrated to Europe centuries prior two major groups are the sapharic and ashkanazi Jews the sapharic Jews settled in modern Spain while their precise origin in the region remains unclear Some sources suggest that members of the judian ruling class were moved there after the Roman Emperor Titus destroyed Jerusalem in 70 current ERA when in 1492 Isabella and Ferdinand of Spain succeed in bringing all of Spain under Christian rule the sapharic Jews are faced with the Edict of expulsion essentially giving them the choice between conversion summary execution or migration similarly it seems as though the ashkanazi Jews also hailed from Judea originally how exactly their distinct community formed so far remains unknown well what we do know is that by the Middle Ages they settled in middle and southern Europe but as their distant Spanish relatives they were faced with expulsions in England France and later Germany which gradually pushed them Eastward as such the Ottoman Empire was not the only place that Jewish people sought to escape persecution in Western Europe the other option was Eastern Europe the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth welcomed many disenfranchised Jews throughout the late Middle Ages and its sizable Jewish population would be absorbed by the Russian Empire later on sadly the situation of relative safety in the Russian Empire would not last and by the end of the 19th century Jewish people in Russia were experiencing that from which they had fled again and again discrimination and persecution in other words diasporas now this leads to two essential things one two waves of Jewish Mass Exodus from Russia the first and second Aliyah to the emergence of cism as a political movement from 1881 to 1882 Jewish Russians increasingly face pogroms it all begins with the assassination of Zar Alexander II on the 1st of March 1881 as so often in times of turmoil and uncertainty people look for scapegoats and as so often before in the history of Europe the scapegoats are agents of foreign influence or in other words Jews the two years of prosecution most notably the pgrs of Kiev Warsaw and Odessa lead to the first aliia the first Ascent in English further prosecution from 1903 to 1905 marks the beginning of the second Aliyah which lasts until 1914 as a result the Jewish population in the Levant the region that today stretches along the Mediterranean Coast from Southern turkey to the Israeli Egyptian border grows from around 24,000 in 1882 to almost 100,000 in 1914 however the vast majority of Jewish people fleeing Russia go somewhere else the United States between 1907 and 1914 alone almost 1.5 million Jews pass through Ellis Island while about 20,000 immigrate to Pal this despite the fact that over the centuries several self-proclaimed Messiahs had tried to persuade Jews to return to the torah's promised land with little success in Eastern Europe haway sonion lovers of Zion is formed to promote the settlement of Jewish farmers and artisans in Palestine the individual who will politicize this idea and coin the term Zionism is Theodore hatza an austr Hungarian journalist hatel regards assimilation as the most desirable option for Jewish people but contends that in the face of centuries of anti-Semitism and persecution it is simply not possible in vain we are loyal Patriots our loyalty in some places running to extremes we are still cried down as strangers the answer to this problem is in hertel's eyes the creation of a Jewish nation state he argues that if the Jewish people are forced by external pressure to form a state it would have to be by migration into one distinct territory the whole concept of a nation state as such is a novel concept at the time until the creation of Belgium and Greece in 1830 there had not been a single nation state on the whole planet how does one approach such a Monumental task founding a state without any land well Herzel seemingly has a Clear Vision of how to get there and it begins in bosil in 1897 with the first scientist Congress later he will write in his diary where I to sum up the Basel Congress in a word it would be this at basil I founded the Jewish state if I said this out loud today I would be answered by Universal laughter perhaps in 5 years certainly in 50 everyone will know it now thereby the idea of a Jewish return to the promised land has been combined with the modern notion of a nation state and this project will eventually give birth to today's state of Israel almost to the day 50 years later after the basil Congress to get there hatel arranges talks with various leaders of large countries such as Germany and France but only the British are receptive to the idea offering 15,500 square kilm of uninhabited Uganda for settlement however the prospect of a new country in the middle of Africa is not very appealing to the zionists and they continue to hope for the return to the promised land they are however aware that advocating for the establishment of a Jewish nation state in the Levant could meet Fierce opposition especially by the Arabs living there and by other International actors to avoid this problem their phrasing is carefully fine-tuned referring to a Homeland rather than a state the main slogan of the Zionist movement at the time is a land without people for a people without land there is only one problem there are in fact people in the land as many as 595,000 by 1914 to be exact thus some zionists know that in order for their Endeavor to succeed at least initially the Goodwill of the native arish population is of utmost importance a sentiment not always shared by Jewish settlers causing concerns within the Zionist movement as says say Zionist humanist a har yet what do our Brethren do in Palestine just the very opposite surfs they were in the lands of the diaspora and suddenly they find themselves in unrestricted freedom and this change has awakened in them an inclination to despotism they treat the Arabs with hostility and cruelty deprive them of their rights offend them without cause and even boast of these deeds and nobody Among Us opposes this despicable and dangerous inclination he also notes that generally many sists are not open to objections that people are already living in the region sadly his words are not heeded and this is where we can first observe the lines along which the eventual cracks and tensions will appear hatel dies in 1904 well before Zionism has fully matured as a political movement and before the problems outlined by harm become relevant in any case Hat's Vision will continue to grow and spread to Jewish people across the globe but then in 1914 the first world war threatens to completely alter the governance structure and the lives of people in the region of today's Palestine and Israel the British Empire will now play a major role in deciding the fate of the entire Middle East they will be joined by another continent spinning Colonial Empire of the time France naturally the British expect to win the war and as such make preparations and agreements in anticipation of their Victory this means negotiating with various Global players such as France but also with smaller Regional players and other interest groups at the heart of all of this diplomacy there is a clear goal the greatest possible benefit to Britain to make this a reality the British enter into almost simultaneous negotiations with the French and other unton power poers local tribes in the Southeastern part of the Ottoman Empire today's Middle East and the zionists while these negotiations do not all start on the same day they clearly overlap in their preparation and execution the only problem is that the British make promises they cannot keep that is to say they make contradictory promises to varying partners by 1917 their vindictiveness becomes apparent for all to see okay so three competing promises have been made the buff War Declaration of 1917 the letters between Sir Henry McMahon British High Commissioner of Egypt and Sharif Hussein the Amir of Mecca and a secret agreement with the French they all center around the same question how do you carve up the proverbial cake or more succinctly who gets what part of the Ottoman Empire's carcass the secret deal between France and Britain is facilitated by the diplomats Mark Sykes and franois Jor Pico hence the name Sykes Pico agreement and it will decide the future of the entire Middle East turkey itself will be allowed Independence but largely stay occupied by the Allies Syria and Mesopotamia will be carved away from turkey and fall under French and British control respectively now the Syria of 1920 is what we know today as Jordan Israel Lebanon Palestine and parts of Syria Mesopotamia is today's Iraq Kuwait parts of Syria and parts of Saudi Arabia now if you think that the ethnic map of Europe causes problems when the lands are divided into nation states this is even worse many of the tribes living here are still nomadic the stationary population is a mixture of various Arab tribes Shia Muslims Sunni Muslims a dozen or so Christian denominations Jews and many more the language ethnicities are just as diverse with speakers of a variety of Arab dialects Kurdish Hebrew Armenian Turkish Persian and many more smaller languages and these ethnicities are not clearly separated geographically the colonial power brokering ensures the continued influence of France and Britain in the region however it also directly contradicts the promises made to the Zionist and the shareif now throughout the Great War TE Lawrence AKA Lawrence of Arabia and imir fisel the eldest son of the sheriff of Mecca head of the hashimite family worked together to secure the cooperation of the Arab tribes against the Ottoman Empire the idea is that fisel and his father could be onon friendly rulers who will bring stability and prosperity to the region why the Sharif of Mecca you might ask well because as the steward or keeper of Islam's most important holy sites he is seen as a representative of all Arabs in the region a sentiment that some Arabs do not share in the letter exchange the Sharif clearly demands the independence of the Arab countries and provides exact Maps as to what territories he deems to constitute the Arab sphere of influence this area clearly includes today's Palestine and Israel in return the British expect the staging of an Arab revolt against the ottoman to which the shareif agrees as a resp McMahan notes Great Britain is prepared to recognize and support the independence of all Arabs in the regions within the limits demanded by the shareif of Mecca again the British goal is to advance Britain's interest the support from the local tribes against the Ottomans does just that further destabilizing ottoman control in the region while seaing a Britain friendly population which could come in handy after the end of the war however the Sykes piku agreement we mentioned earlier outlines a very different future path for the region France wants control over the whole of Syria and Palestine the British make some arguments towards fulfilling the promises to the shareif but as discussions proceed gradually compromise away the reality of any establishment of truly autonomous States putting key areas of it under their own or French control or as they put it influence the spirit of these negotiation is really quite exemplary of the colonial attitude of the time that in the blue area of France and in the red area Great Britain shall be allowed to establish such direct or indirect Administration or control as they desire and as they may think fit to arrange with the Arab state or Confederation of Arab states in effect a significant area of the map provided by the shareif in the letter exchange and agreed upon by the British has become subject to the whims of France and in Britain a vassel state so to speak naturally this would not sit well with the Arab tribe leaders so they are not invited to the discussions put it clearly the British knowingly and purposefully have now made competing Promises to the French and Arabs all in their best interest if Britain were a person one might describe them as an egotistic opportunist opportunism that Segways into vindictiveness when you see how the next conflicting agreement practically programs conflict in the region that would be the B four declaration well it's what zionists have been waiting for ever since they rejected the idea of erecting the Jewish state in Uganda support for a Jewish state in Palestine his Majesty's government view with favor The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best Endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object the Declaration is the direct result of sanist organizations approaching past future and current British government members interestingly Sykes the namesake of the Sykes PCO agreement will be of most use in this endeavor the scientists openly state that they prefer a British protectorate over an American or French one but as expected the reasons behind the British support of the idea are more complex than mere Sympathy for the Jew cause once again the central motivation is geopolitical power brokering leading to the biggest possible upside for Britain primarily in 1915 and 16 as the Great War still rages without us involvement the British want to Garner political support among Jewish people for the war effort especially in the US they also hope that Pro British Jewish settlers to the region could protect the approaches to the sus canal and and thus Safeguard a vital route of goods in communication with British colonies further east especially India last but not least they hope for all these settlers to Splinter any anti-british opposition and make it easier to secure natural resources like the as of yet largely untapped oil reserves just one problem the British are promising away land that they have neither Sovereign rights to nor any argument for having a proprietary interest in not to mention no authority to dispose of that alone especially enrages many Arab leaders while the balur Declaration also runs contrary to the syes P agreement which sees Palestine fall under French control the British are able to convince the French of the idea of Jewish colonization so the French agreed to put the area of Palestine under International supervision which shall eventually lead to the British mandate under the lead of Nations perhaps the words of later military governor of Palestine Colonel Ronald stores can best describe the situation Palestine up to now a Muslim country has fallen into the hands of a Christian power which on the eve of its Conquest announced that a considerable portion of its land is to be handed over for colonization purposes to a nowhere very popular people Mark how despite the mild self-deprecation he manages to insert an anti-semitic undertone in any case the inclusion of the Bal for declaration as a res of the British mandate in conflict with the Arab self-determination lays down a foundation built on irreconcilable differences on which the British will now erect a house of cards however as already intimated the British do not openly negotiate competing promises otherwise one or all of their Partners could have easily spotted the lack of commitment to any of them yep all these Agreements are made in secret however that secrecy will not be possible to maintain to see how it all begins to unravel we return to Russia right after the October revolution in 1917 in their quest for fuel to drive their transformation to the dictatorship of the proletariat the Bolsheviks leave no stone unturned this includes scouring the former State archives for any useful information to use politically amongst the treasures of political Dynamite they find is a copy of the Sykes Pico agreement Lenin reputedly disgusted by the imperialist Ambitions of the agreement publishes it along with a slew of Russian imperial treaties the Manchester Guardian then reprints the whole agreement on the 26th of November 1917 this causes quite some embarrassment for the French and British and the Arabs are scandalized to what degree these emotions eventually pav the way for the next chapter in this sorted drama can only be left to speculation nonetheless a new chapter it is once the Great War is Over the war has given wi to the sales of nationalist emotions around the world arguably this is the moment when the idea of nation states countries founded on some kind of discreete geography and shared identity ceases to be a largely academic idea to popular sentiment okay this is of course a long process that began more than a century earlier but now that millions of men from across the globe have fought side by side for their Nation identities that before 1914 focused on family tribe or region have become supplanted by the idea of a common interest and identity based on larger geopol political constructs previously mainly of interest to a small ruling class paradoxically at the same time a general distrust of the larger Imperial order of the world and the ruling classes has led to a majority support for the idea of self-determination It Is by no means a class struggle these emotions supersede class and ethnicity and if not before at the Paris peace conference they become universally accepted principles at least for the peoples of America and Europe breaking a lance for the Arab world to be included in this game of nation-making is FAL by now the true representative of the Arab interest and prospective king of a pan-arabic Nation just before the Paris conference he meets with several major sist leaders most significantly he befriends biochemist Dr Kim vitman one of the main driving forces behind the Bal for declaration and president of of the British sist Federation on paper viman is a liberal Zionist who claims that for a Jewish state in Palestine to have success it must be in concert with Arab interest privately however he has called Arabs treacherous arrogant uneducated and greedy and has complained to the British that the system in Palestine does not take into account the fact that there is a fundamental qualitative difference between Jew and Arab fizal and BisMan find common ground in similar opinions about the Palestinian Arabs Vice man writes to his wife that FAL was contemptuous of the Palestinian Arabs whom he doesn't even regard as Arabs the outcome of their meeting is the fisal bitman Declaration in it fisal echoes the balur Declaration the establishment of a Jewish Home in Palestine he hopes that the official acceptance of the bord declaration would give him the support of the Zionist which in turn could Lobby the British on behalf of an independent greater Syria remarkably although facing enormous opposition to any such idea Fon manages to get the majority of the Arab leaders on board for the idea of a Jewish semi-autonomous state in Palestine along with Arab Independence within a pan Arabic Federation hopes that look like they may come true as the British now reiterate their promis of Arab Independence to fizal who begins to prepare to truly unify the Arab tribes behind a common cause yes if it only would be that simple the French are not at all happy about this development and pressure the British to come back to the principle of the syes peor agreement with the addition of a British mandate in Palestine in a not too surprising turn of developments the British secretly aband on all their promises to fisal instead of a United Federation of the Arab tribes they and fisal end up in a brief war with the French when the Arabs have finally had enough and take up arms to get their demands a brief war it is but it's also a long story of how the Arab tribes fall apart again and the Arab factions that are still at conflict more than 100 years later are formed within that fizel will become the first king of but all of that is a tale for another day before that can happen fizal surrenders to the French in 1920 and is extradited to Britain the defeat of fizal and the Arab leaders in 1920 marks the moment when development was more or less become set in stone and a new chapter begins the Middle East under Western rather than ottoman influence already before the Arab Rebellion fails the British mandate in Palestine the region that will eventually become Palestine Israel and parts of Jordan and Lebanon come under British military rule in 1920 a civilian Administration under sir Herbert Manuel takes charge now strictly speaking Britain has no right to occupy the territory according to international law which by the way is a novel concept pretty much forged at the Paris peace conference with the creation of the League of Nations in any case legal or not the league agrees that Palestine will fall under British rule and on the 24th of July 1923 with the Treaty of loan what is already deao reality will be formalized meanwhile in 1920 the tensions inside the Middle East continued to mount anything that is seen as a threat to a path towards Arab Independence at some point is a hot potato while the leaders around fizal have heard of The balur Declaration the general population has not moreover leaders who were maybe swayed by fizal now oppose any idea of Jewish autonomy then when Manuel's Administration comes in they make the Declaration public taken as an indication that it will be fulfilled outrage grows on the 4th of April 1920 violent protests engulf the holy city of Jerusalem at the end of the riot there are scores of dead and injured on both sides on the first day alone 150 Jews are injured however the British are not as United behind the Zionist cause as they seem to be at least not yet in fact it may be that touting the declaration has more Sinister reasons cut to a year later 1921 and ha Amin El husseini he is now appointed Grand muy of Jerusalem and president of the newly created Supreme Muslim Council the most authoritative religious legislative body in the Palestinian Muslim Community useni now begins to organize larger scale operations to terrorize Jews at the same time Colonel Richard minat haogen former head of British Security in Cairo writes in his diary that British officials inclined towards the exclusion of sanism in Palestine now let's go back to Easter 1920 only days before the Jerusalem riots when Colonel Waters Taylor financial adviser to the military Administration in Palestine from 1919 to 1923 meets with husseini is it a coincidence that the riots start right after according to Miner Haagen it most certainly is not he states that in the talks Taylor encourages Arab violence against the Jews going as far as to suggest toini that he had a great opportunity at Easter to show the world that Zionism was unpopular not only with the Palestine Administration but in whiteall and if disturbances of sufficient violence occurred in Jerusalem at Easter both General bols Chief administrator in Palestine and general alanby commander of Egyptian force and High Commissioner of Egypt would Advocate the abandonment of the Jewish Home wat's Taylor explained that freedom could only be attained through violence it is unclear whether the British officers are motivated by anti-jewish sentiments on their part or simple political considerations yet the two-faced nature of the British does not end there after the riots husseini who has fled to Jordan is sentenced to 10 years in prison in absentia then again in 1921 British arabist are able to convince the High Commissioner to Pardon husi and appoint him as Muti again subsequently more riots follow in 1921 and 43 Jews die as a result the ha craft commission is set up to evaluate the cause of these rides and we'll find that the fundamental cause of the acts of violence was a feeling among the Arabs of discontent with and hostility to the Jews due to political and economic causes and connected with Jewish immigration and with their conception of Zionist policy as derived from Jewish exponents husseini will play a major role in the development of the conflict as he consolidates his power over the Arab population and Palestine he uses his religiously derived authority to gain control over mosques schools and the courts as a result no Arab can reach an influential position without being loyal to him and his inherently anti-jewish stances in his role as Palestinian spokesperson towards the end of 1921 he writes Winston Churchill at the time Colonial secretary he demands that restrictions be put on Jewish immigration and that Palestine as a territory be United with trans Jordan and Syria these demands are partially based on developments outside of the Mandate of Palestine well at least theoretically the area west of the Jordan Palestine and east of the Jordan trans Jordan fall under one mandate the British effectively treat them as two separate entities this means that in trans Jordan the British have no ambition to establish a Jewish Home and their sole focus is a path towards Arab self-determination going even further they prohibit any Jewish immigration to trans Jordan it must have been quite something for the Arabs living in Palestine just across the river the reasons for their riots and protests are nonexistent and the British actively seek to enable Arab self-determination already in 1923 trans Jordan will achieve quasi independence with a hashimite king at the helm nonetheless and that would be Amir Abdullah I fal's brother in any case to be clear these British divisions of the territory is in no way shape or form reflected by the reality on the ground as we said earlier it's one ethnic or cultural group and the other separated by pencil line drawn in some fancy back office in London that in no way respects the tribal and nomadic culture of the region but back to Churchill and Hussein's demands to end Zionism in Palestine how does Winston respond does husseini get what he wants well no the Church of white paper or Church of memorandum doubles down on the balfor Declaration several years later while addressing the House of Commons Churchill will explain the purpose of the white paper to make it clear that the establishment of self-governing institutions in Palestine was to be subordinated to the Paramount plue and obligation of establishing a Jewish National home in Palestine as you can imagine essentially subordinating the self-governance of Arabs in the region to the creation of a Jewish National home does nothing to lessen the tensions with their backs now fully supported by the British government the zionists start to continue their efforts to create a Jewish state in Palestine their main tools to facility's Grand Endeavor are twofold immigration and land purchases in 1922 the Jews number only about 84,000 while the Arabs in the region number roughly eight times that however this is about to change throughout the 20s about 100,000 Jewish immigrants will arrive in Palestine leading to a total Jewish population of roughly 165,000 by 1929 overall the Jewish population in Palestine has more than doubled since 1918 accordingly the ratio of Arabs to Jews has shifted from 10 to 1 to 5 to to one with such an influx of people the ownership of land in Palestine has also changed rather drastically in 1920 it was estimated that around 650 square kilm or roughly 250 square miles were under Jewish ownership which constituted just shy of 2.5% of the total land area fast forward to 1929 and Jewish land ownership has grown to 1,200 square km nearly doubling and now constituting about 5% of the total land area looking at the total land area is problematic however since unable land is not really worth much and there's quite a lot of it in the area in total out of 26,000 Square kilm about 6,500 are arable of these the Jewish Community possesses round about 1 16 in 1929 well you might say 1 Sixth of the land for 1/5 of the people that does not seem too unfair there is one more decisive factor that so far we have not looked at and which heavily influences Arab sentiments about Jewish immigration and land ownership it is not the land ownership per se that causes so much Arab opposition but how the land ownership is managed by the Jewish communities in today's terms you might describe the practice simply as racial discrimination only Jewish laborers are allowed to work on the Jewish land and in Jewish settlements the land does not simply change ownership from an Arab to a Jew but it ceases to be a land from which the Arab can gain any advantage either now or at any time in the future not only can he never hope to lease or to cultivate it but he is deprived forever from employment on that land nor can anyone help him by purchasing the land and restoring it to common use these labor policies also run contrary to the articles of the Mandate the Zionist organization attempts to not assume any blame by not openly advocating their stringent labor policies some Zionist leaders including vitman also opposed the practices for example at the Zionist Congress of 1931 a resolution is passed that solemnly declared the desire of the Jewish people to live with the Arab people to develop the Homeland common to both into a prosperous Community which would ensure the growth of the peoples resolutions or not the practices feed into more anger suspicion and hatred in the region the Arabs faced with the reality that Britain openly favors sanist efforts over Arab self-determination feel betrayed Jews fleeing persecution in Europe now face the same in the promised land in August 1929 the conflict once again escalates as a dispute over the Western Wall in Jerusalem causes riots by Palestinian Arabs since 1925 Jews have been blocked access to the Wailing Wall as a measure by the British to calm emotions by segregation it all begins with a march on the Wailing Wall by 6,000 far8 Jewish zionists demanding access to the wall the protesters are unarmed and later reports conclude that the demonstration proceeds peacefully nevertheless false rumors that the Jews are about to seize the AL axam MOS and that they are attacking even slaughtering Muslims spread inflammatory articles in the Press of both sides fan hatred incensed Arab mobs then begin destroying Jewish owned property and beating Jewish people they find in the streets even killing them the riot soon spread Beyond Jerusalem the British police respond with gunfire and a few Jewish activists answer with violence of their own a week of bloody fighting leaves 133 Jewish Palestinians and 116 Arab Palestinians Dead with hundreds more wounded now note that we deliberately noted that the dead on both sides are Palestinians you see these events bring a deepening Rift to light many of the dead and wounded Jews are not immigrants not even zionists the collective punishment of Jewish communities in Palestine who had come to be their irrespective of Zionist ambition in ages past motivates more Jews to closely align themselves with the Zionist project likewise the violent response by the British police and a minority of Zionist activists further radicalizes some people in the Arab Community a cycle of violence giving birth to more violence that will last into our days has begun these events force a shift in British policy for the Mandate in Palestine the Shaw and hope Simmons commissions appointed to assess the events amongst other things heightens the awareness of the dangerous situation in Palestine as a result two immediate measures are taken in 1930 the increase of British troops in the region and a new policy on Palestine called the passfield white paper in it Palestinians as well as Jewish leaders are reprimanded the Jews for exerting pressure on officials to comply with Zionist wishes and the Arabs for excessively demanding self-determination both of them according to the report would render it impossible to carry out in the fullest sense the double undertaking this marks an important shift from the church of memorandum as now at least on paper the British make an effort to give the same importance to the creation of a Jewish Home and an Arab self-determination more specifically this means that the British are working towards a United Arab Jewish State you could call it a one-state solution furthermore the paper communicates the clear intent of reasserting British authority over the areas of immigration and land transfers which ever since the church memorandum had practically been in the hands of the zionists last the paper also calls for the creation of a common legislature where in both Arabs and Jews could deliberate a and reach a deeper understanding of each other after more than a decade of Fanning descent this change of TAC by the British is a fall into a canyon of their own digging zionists are not happy with the change and make their displeasure known by 1931 their efforts reach fruition and Dr vitman receives a letter from the British prime minister Ramsey McDonald where in the PM once again puts the zionists goals above rather than alongside those of Arab self-determination in a nutshell the church memorandum has been reinstated and un un surprisingly Palestinian Arabs feel short changed once again as zionists with renewed unquestioning British support renew immigration and land purchase efforts but there is a more dire threat to Jewish Europeans than simply the desire for a country of their own driving them to Palestine remember that Hat's whole reason behind the Zionist movement had been the continued and merciless persecution of Jews throughout the Centuries by the end of the 19th century was clear Beyond any doubt that for Jewish Europeans assimilation was simply not a viable option ASA would be proven right again during the third Aaliyah which lasted from 1919 to 1923 the Russian Revolution of 1917 led to a whole new scale of pogroms in Eastern Europe and in Ukraine from 1918 to 1921 more than 100,000 Jews were killed with acts of killing reaching an almost genocidal scale whereas earlier the goal had been to drive the Jews out now it seemed as if the goal was their complete eradication these mass killings are often forgotten in light of the great showah the Holocaust but the sheer scale of the violence leads some like French writer and journalist anat France to publicly question the security of close to 10 million Jews living in Europe and how right he would turn out to be as many of you will know by now in the early 1930s anti-Semitism in the whole of Europe is on the rise as is Jewish immigration combined with renewed British support of cism over self-determination this drives immigration to Palestine to record levels between 1930 and 1939 more than 230,000 Jews arrive in Palestine making their total population swell to somewhere around 450,000 turning the 1:5 ratio of 1929 into one of 1:3 uh at the same time land ownership also grows although not that drastically by 300 Square km to 1,500 total reaching almost 6% of the total land mass since nothing about the British policy changed and immigration continues the same as it had in the 1920s the result would also be similar however this time it is not just a Arab Revolution but the Arab revolt and it no no longer primarily targets the Jews it was an open rebellion of the Palestinian Arabs assisted by fellow Arabs from other countries against British mandatory rule in April 1936 things kick off with grand muy of Jerusalem husseini and the Arab hire committee calling for a general strike as the strike continues violence increases and the first attacks on British troops police stations and Jew settlements take place on the the Palestinian side one organization that plays a central role is the black hand founded in 1930 after the last Uprising it is an anti-zionist anti-british jihadist organization led by is Adin alasam a Syrian shik under Al Kasam the black hand now commits Terror attacks against Jewish immigrants and British residents Al Kazam dies in 1935 but his movement continues In The Same Spirit and dials up the terror in all around 7,000 Arabs are actively fighting the British by 1938 the British respond brutally by raising Villages looting and even executions the destruction of food and water supplies becomes standard practice to make the Arabs pay for their Disobedience by the time the Revolt loses steam in 1939 5,000 Arab Fighters have been killed while the British may have succeeded at quenching the Arab violence the uprising has not been for not already in 1937 in light of determin Arab resistance the British realize that their current policy as well as their more General ambition of fulfilling the Dual obligations are not feasible however vigorously and consistently maintained it will not solve the problem it will not elay it will exacerbate the quarrel between the Arabs and Jews the establishment of a single self-governing pales sign will remain just as impractical as it is now the solution to the problem and solomonian fashion would be bifurcation or in other words the splitting of Palestine into two the two-state solution but partition as you might imagine is unacceptable to Arab Nationals they've not just fought for a year and a half to lose a third of their country to the sinist so there is yet another change of heart among the colonial thinkers in London further examination has shown that the political administrative and financial difficulties involved in the proposal to create independent Arab and Jewish States inside Palestine are so great that this solution of the problem is impracticable so there's a new brilliant so far unthought of solution right no okay a workable solution which at least improves the situation somewhat no do they go back to the way things were yes you got to be kidding me well to be fair there is some change and yet another white paper the British decide to terminate the Mandate in 1949 by which time both Palestinians and Jews would share in government so back to dual Ambitions however they also renounced any intention to create a Jewish state in Palestine effectively nullifying the Bal declaration at the same time they also reject all Arab demands for self-determination and Jewish immigration is limited to 10,000 a year for the next 5 years this is arguably the best example of bad timing in all of human history Nazi Germany has by now graduated from anti-semitic rhetoric and oppression in Germany itself to launch a war aimed to annihilate all Jewish people in Europe with that as backdrop the Jewish Community is incensed by the new white paper with some even proposing a Jewish revolt against the British however for most the defeat of Nazi Germany seems most important as such the leader of the Jews in Palestine David benuron States in 1939 support the British as if there is no white paper and oppose the white paper as if there is no war while in 1939 it is certainly known that the Nazis are more than hostile towards anyone perceived as or actually Jewish the lengths they will go to to fulfill their genocidal intent is not yet public knowledge as a matter of fact many believe that all the Nazis want is to get the Jews out of Europe and until 1941 they might have been sort of right within the higher Nazi echelons the method to purge Europe from Jews the final solution is still under debate among the proposed ideas presented as an alternative to immediate mass murder is to resettle the Jews in the furthest corners of the soon to be 1,000-year Reich somewhere in the Luben region between the BG and Vistula Rivers some other proposals are far more ambitious than this suggesting that the Jews be resettled in Madagascar to be clear though the extermination of Europe's Jews is always the gold it's the method and speed generational genocide by for sterilization of slaves inside the raich faster by succumbing to an unsustainable migration to to for instance Madagascar or immediate by mass murder by the summer of 1941 the faction advocating immediate mass murder prevails and the Holocaust begins with pges during operation Barbarosa to invade the Soviet Union the governments in Moscow Washington DC and Great Britain become aware of the ongoing Slaughter at latest by Autumn of 1941 but it Tes until May 42 for the public to find out when the BBC will first report on the Mass killings of Polish Jews by then Operation Reinhard and the 100 deadliest day of the Holocaust are about to begin these 100 days constitute the biggest Act of mass murder per day in known human history and building on the Holocaust by bullets in the preceding months the slaughter will continue until the last day of the war killing over 6 million 68% of all Jewish people still living in Europe in 1939 close to 90% of anyone deemed Jewish and unfortunate enough to end up in the hands of the Nazis before all of that happens not even the Jews themselves could imagine the true scale of horror about to unfold in their ignorance some even thought the Nazis could be instrumentalized against the British yeah until now in our story Jewish opposition to the British and Palestine has mostly been through diplomacy and political pressure yet there have also been a smaller movement of militant oppos decision and sanism in 1920 the hagana defense was formed as a paramilitary defensive body to protect settlers and other Jewish Palestinians frustrated by a lack of progress offshoots from hagana chose a more aggressive approach Chief among them perhaps the eron the few hundred strong underground militia labels herself as far right and has been fighting both Arab nationalists and the British colonial Administration among other things during the Arab revolts When The War breaks out it officially seizes all work against the British in light of the bigger German threat some members grow dissatisfied with this decision and in August 1940 a former iron member Abram Stern forms Lei a breakaway group their goal is to force the British out of Palestine immediately to form a Jewish State now in a rather counterintuitive development to facilitate their in 1941 Stern suggests collaboration with the Germans despite growing evidence of The Naz Sinister aims Stern is under the impression that the Nazis want to make their land uden R free of Jews through immigration so Stern believes that if the zioners in Palestine helped Nazi Germany in conquering the Middle East the Nazis in turn would help them establish a Jewish state in Palestine as a cherry on top the Jews expelled from Nazi controlled Europe could migrate there as well the Nazis never answer the proposal and it costs the organization aner himself much support he becomes a pariah and is killed by British police the same year on the other side of the conflict far less paradoxically the grand Muti of Jerusalem husseini also looks to German furer Adolf Hitler and the Nazis for support now we've made a video about him especially on our World War II channel it's quite interesting link is in the description to make a long story short the Nazis do take him in but his efforts in the end amount to little other than serving Nazi propaganda and recruiting a limited force of Arab Fighters for Germany who end up fighting in Europe for Germany not Palestine however except for minor exceptions like these overall World War II generally means a relaxation of tensions between Arabs and Jews in Palestine at least compared to before tensions between the British and the zionists on the other hand are worsening steadily the limit on Jewish migration of 10,000 per year is by now far more than a mere slap in the face of the Zionist leaders hundreds of thousands of Jews fleeing mass murder in Europe are turned back to die as a result the situation is made worse by most western democracies amongst them the US and Great Britain refusing to take in any significant number of Jewish refugees even as the Holocaust becomes public knowledge in 1942 even with mounting detailed and confirmed reports on the abhorent reality of the war against humanity the British refused to lift the limit on migration and resentment of the Jews towards the British grow while illegal immigration to Palestine does grow this is a trickle of people saved when compared to the growing stream of Nazi freight trains bringing Europeans deemed to be Jewish to the death factories and concentration camps by 1944 some Jewish paramilitary organizations have had enough and theun declares there is no longer any Armistice between the Jewish people and the British Administration inet Israel which hands our brothers over to Hitler armed action follows promptly on the 27th of February 1944 income tax offices in Jerusalem Tel Aviv and hia are are bombed yet at this time the majority of the Orthodox zionists in Palestine are still not in favor of an armed struggle against the British and condemn the attackers all the while the Arab Palestinians watch and are surprised by the Jewish attacks and the lackluster response of the British with the muties St doing radio broadcast in Berlin more or less they are however leaderless and seemingly wait until the end of the war to see Britain's further course before for making any concrete plans until 1945 when the scale and horror of the Nazi extermination becomes visible in images and testimony there will also be no unified Zionist Revolution against the British that year a new labor government in Britain promises to repeal the immigration ban even iron and lei briefly put down their weapons in anticipation however the promises are again not met strict limits on Jewish immigration to Palestine stay in place while 250,000 displaced Jews survivors of the Holocaust are spread across Europe this broken promise against the backdrop of the biggest genocide in known history is the straw that breaks the camels back launching a wave of active Jewish resistance against the British and a United Jewish Revolt emerges police stations are now attacked immigrant detainment facilities raided policemen shot bomb set often trains derailed in response the British used the freed Manpower from the end of World War II to increase its military presence in the Mandate by 1946 they will have around 880,000 troops stationed there curfews police searches arrests and detentions become the norm for the Arab and Jewish population alike living in the Mandate the genocide also brings a change in the international perception of Zionism to even a casual Observer the Dreadful fate of six million Jews has clearly and once and for all cemented The Tragic Truth behind hetzel's Insight in their uden that assimilation was never an option so while before the war International public support for a Jewish nation state had been waning it now receives growing solidarity on the other hand the forces behind the Arab Revolt of 1936 also start to regain some steam and tensions between the Jews and Arabs again rise to pre-war levels the ongoing and sizable illegal immigration during and after the war further feeds Arab Warriors by 1946 the Jewish population Grows by another 100,000 to around 630,000 the Arab population has also grown since 1922 and numbers 1.2 million so in only three decades the ratio of Jewish Palestinians to Arab Palestinians has gone from 1 to5 to 1 to2 to put it succinctly the the situation looks to be a completely hopeless mess the Arabs fight against the Jews and the British the Jews fight the Arabs and the British who have abandoned them and the British desperately try to retain some level of control over the region on November 30th 1947 it all descends into a full out Civil War the trigger is the adoption of resolution 1812 by the newly formed United Nations General Assembly on November 29th now in February the British had announced that they will relinquish their mandate in 1948 a resolution of the growing Fiasco is left to the young United Nations The Proposal is a plan of partition in other words a two-state solution while the Jews Rejoice at this proposal for an officially recognized Jewish State Arab protests erupt all throughout the Mandate and soon spread to the rest of the entire Middle East for the Arabs petition means above anything else war or as Secretary General of the Arab League Abdul Rahman Assam Pasha puts it the Arab world is not in the mood to compromise we shall fight you will gain Nothing by peaceful means and compromises it is too late to speak of peaceful Solutions an atmosphere of violence engulfs the entire region and the Powder Keg finally explodes buses are attacked markets are bombed and retali I atory attacks on villages on both sides are conducted by the end of December 1947 the 100,000 Jewish residents of Jerusalem are under blockade throughout the entirety of this chaos the British do little more than focus on the extraction of their personnel and material resources from the region with as few losses as possible finally on May 14th 1948 the British completely withdraw what follows the second phase of the Civil War or the 1948 war will become known in the Arab world as the first Palestine War by Palestinians as al-a the disaster and by Jews mil haat ho the war of independence at the beginning of the Civil War the Arab forces had the clear advantage in Manpower while the Jews had more Weaponry better organization and had extensively prepared for the war since 1945 nevertheless the hagana now on its way to become the IDF the Israeli Defense Force is largely under defensive during the first four months of hostilities until March of 1948 the conflict is characterized by gradually expanding continuously small scale small unit fighting with no clear front lines at the same time the call for a Jihad reverberates around the Arab world and while many volunteers are available any efforts are marred by lack of organization training facilities and funding the Arab High Council is not only struggling to support the war interiorly but is also beset by paralyzing internal differences the better organized and unified Israelis are laer focused on the procurement of small and heavy weapons and aeroplanes in post World War Europe there is an abundance of surplus arms the Israelis collect a pot parri of weapons from across the world war biger 10 s199 mmid Avia Fighters thousands of Mouser rifles NG 34s millions of rounds of ammunition from Czechoslovakia 50 65 mm guns 12 120 mm mortars 10 age 35 light tanks and a large number of halft tracks from France and while the US publicly backtracks on any active support even for the partition plan they are still willing to supply equipment some repainted and defined as agricultural on May 14th the day of the British departure and just after the British High commissioner had left Jerusalem for good chairman of the Jewish agency and soon to be first prime minister of Israel David benuron speaking to other Jewish leaders members of the National Council the people's Administration the Zionist General Council and party politician announces the land of Israel was the birthplace of the Jewish people here their spiritual religious and national identity was formed accordingly to the UN resolution we hereby proclaim the establishment of the the Jewish State the state of Israel technically and perhaps legally that transforms the war from a civil war to an international conflict the same day forces from Iraq Egypt trans Jordan Lebanon and Syria attacked the newly formed Jewish State the Arab Coalition immediately occupied the areas in Southern and Eastern Palestine not under Jewish control as per UN resolution next they capture East Jerusalem on paper this seems quite daunting six countries fighting against a country just a day old and in the beginning it certainly is the Jewish Community suffered heavy casualties it reeled from the shock of contact with regular Arab armies and it suffered an ordeal which left indelible marks on the national psyche for the people who lived through this ordeal the sense of being MIM the few against the many could not have been more real however already in the early days of the international conflict despite being numerically inferior the highly motivated and by now comparatively well equipped Israeli forces successfully repel repeated Arab attacks on their positions while the UN manages to broker ceasefires during the conflict both sides disregard the stipulations of the agreement and use the time to improve their positions more weapons export to Israel also arrived during the first truce between the 11th of June and the 9th of July 1948 greatly enhancing its military capabilities meanwhile INF fighting between various Arab states increases during this first truce for Amir Abdullah of trans Jordan the war is effectively over he wants to incorporate what is left of Eastern Palestine into a new Jordanian Kingdom and unsuccessfully lobbies other Arab states to agree to this solution recently some revisionist historians have suggested that this in fighting between the Arab states had a larger effect on the outcome of the war than previously assumed one could even go so far as to see the war as an inter Arab conflict which the Israeli forces aily exploited to conquer Palestine you see although the Arab armies do not openly fight each other their actions are mutually destructive instead of working together and fighting the zionists as one cohesive force they wait while the Israelis send home one Arab Army after the other the two major factions involved in this inner Arab dispute are the hashimite block represented by imir Abdullah and the Egyptian Saudi and Syrian block the plan of Amir Abdullah is the same dream his brother FAL had after World War I the kingdom of Greater Syria unsurprisingly the overarching goal of the syrians is to prevent this from happening the Egyptians and Saudis similarly do not want a kingdom of Greater Syria thus the Arab states are more concerned with their National interest than with defeating the sinist or helping the Palestinians painted in this light the war seems not to have been for Israel to win but rather for the Arabs to lose sadly the war continues for another year and in a cruel twist of fate the Palestinian Arabs now suffer the Fate from which the zionists argue a right to their state diaspora by early 1949 the Israelis have successfully occupied all of the Nev the area in the south of today's Israel except for the Gaza Strip between February and July 1949 Armistice Agreements are signed between Israel and each of the Arab states and temporary Frontiers are established but while the war officially ends the suffering does not the Arab Palestinians suffer the most in this conflict and one sobering number can perhaps best illustrate that point 167,168 are killed 4,000 soldiers and 2,000 civilians on the Arab side slightly over 10,000 soldiers and civilians lose their lives 167,168 is the number of Palestinians living in Palestine in 1950 remember in 1946 they numbered over 1.2 million so more than 750,000 Arab Palestinian civilians roughly 75% of the entire Arab population have fled or been forcefully expelled from their homes some regions in Palestine such as haa lose as much as 90% of their Arab population during their their 1948 counter offensive the IDF carry out several ethnic cleansing operations such as operation Dany or operation yuav during the latter alow no less than eight massacres against Arabs are committed by the IDF and 200,000 to 220,000 people driven into flight men women and children whose families have lived in that region since anyone could remember now are driven from their Homeland they will end up in refugee camps set up by the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestine refugees in the near East in 1949 53 refugee camps will be created on both sides of the River Jordan and the Gaza Strip in Lebanon and in Syria for the first 8 years these camps are nothing more than 10 cities lacking basic infrastructure and supply of goods to date in 2023 none of the refugees have been allowed to return to their homes through population growth the refugees have reached almost 6 million it Remains the longest unresolved Refugee crisis in the world so while the beginning of the war and the isolation of Israel decisively shape its National psyche for the native Arabs War defeat humiliation and panicked flight do the same the root of this conflict is often framed as purely religious and ethnic differences it's far more complicated than that and then again it's far simpler than that it's about one simple basic human need to have a home a place where we can feel safe be ourselves share food have protection from the elements and the love of our closest and dearest when you take that away from any of us we will run wild and act like feral animals flee or fight with teeth and Claws to protect our safe haven and our loved ones one side you have millions of people who have for Generations been denied that right time and time again to be driven from house to house Village to village town to town city to City Country to Country and then finally by train into the furnaces of Hell by the millions simply for being the Sons and Daughters of their parents no other reason the other side you have a people held in bondage by Imperial interests in Far Away cities for centuries whose development into the comfort and relative safety of the modern world was denied them to serve the colonial chauvinism of people they have never even met a people now driven into Exile by the other disenfranchised people simply because both sides were fooled lied to and pitted against each other that is the tragedy of the promised land its promises are always a robbery a lie and the Betrayal of a promise made to someone else Perhaps it is not so much a Promised Land as a cursed land as long as we cannot accept the absolute Covenant of universal and equal rights and work together to create prosperity and safety for all of us for that we need to accept that my suffering is not more terrible than yours and your success is not my failure why do we make this so difficult if you want to learn more about the inter War events that led to World War II check out our between two War Series right here it is the time

first world war left a vacuum of power in the Levant here in this former ottoman region was the land of Palestine settled by a diverse population of Christians Muslims and Jews alike the power vacuum was quickly filled by France and Great Britain who secretly drafted the Sykes Pico agreement of 1916 which proposed to divide the ottoman territories between the two powers this contradicted the earlier McMahon Hussein correspondence between 1915 to 1916 which stated that the area of Palestine along with all of the Arabian Peninsula would become part of a new pan Arab Nation should the Arabs agree to help Britain defeat the Ottomans while this occurred the influential Zionist organization had their own designs in the area at the Paris peace Conference of 1919 the zionists led by ham wisman proposed that a Jewish homeland be established in the Palestinian territory their proposed borders included what would become present day Israel Western Jordan Southwestern Syria and Southern Lebanon no representation was afforded to the Arabs or Palestinians residing in the territory during these discussions for the zionists the settlement of Palestine was not a colonial Venture but instead a return from exile to the land of Israel their ancient Homeland for the Palestinians however this distinction seemed to matter little as Jewish immigrants began to arrive and steadily dispossess many Palestinians from their homes despite these concerns these zionists appeared to have the upper hand thanks to the implicit approval of the British government the most telling example of this support for Jewish settlement in Palestine occurred in 1917 when British foreign secretary Arthur Baler sent a declaration of support to Lord Walter Rothschild a banker politician and prominent Zionist leader the nature of the Baler declaration would become public on November 9th of that year when it was published in the British press ultimately the final decision regarding Palestine was a blend of Zionist aspirations and British geopolitical interests Britain's strategic AIMS in neighboring Egypt especially around the Suez Canal aligned with the Zionist vision for a Jewish homeland this shared Vision led to the creation of the British controlled mandatory Palestine which encompassed the territories of modern-day Israel the West Bank and Gaza as the years under British governance rolled on Discord between the Jewish and Arab communities soon broke out with each side nurturing National aspirations that often clashed the bow for Declaration of 1917 continued to fuel Zionist immigration and land purchases exacerbating tensions with the indigenous Arab population in 1936 these tensions exploded with the Arab revolt against both the British mandate and Jewish immigrants settling in the region in an attempt to quell the unrest the British proposed several Solutions including the partition of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states the proposed borders gave the Jewish State about 1/3 of Palestine including the Galilee the Jezreel Valley and the coastal plain while the Arab State received Judea Samaria and the Negev Desert however the plan was met with mixed reactions the Jewish Community was divided but more inclined toward acceptance while Arab leaders denounced The Proposal refusing the idea of land partition and population transfer while the seeds for the Israeli Palestinian conflict were planted in the aftermath of the first world war the recent violence is the result of Decades of deep mistrust TR and animosity between both sides creating an objective documentary on the history behind these events is a daunting task for creators who want to convey the facts without bias especially when information and disinformation is

possible in the shadow of these failed proposals extremist factions emerged fueled by deep-seated grievances Jewish groups like The Aron and Stern gang orchestrated terrorist attacks against British and Arab targets aiming to expedite a Jewish State's establishment concurrently Arab extremists retaliated with groups like the Arab higher committee and later The Holy War army aiming to counter Jewish insurgents and challenge British Bri rule the 1940s witnessed an escalating spiral of violence with both Jews and Palestinians employing terrorism as a means to further their respective nationalist agendas in the aftermath of the Holocaust which had convinced many Jews that they could never be safe without their own State the United Nations proposed a two-state solution in 1947 envisioning separate Jewish and Arab states the plan designated the fertile G Gile region the coastal plain and the negtive desert to the proposed Jewish State conversely the hill regions of Judea and Samaria along with the coastal Gaza Strip were allocated to the proposed Arab State Jerusalem holding religious significance for both communities was to be an international City these allocations aimed to distribute the Land Based on demographic and agricultural considerations but significantly altered the existing territorial status quo fueling intentions further the Jewish leadership accepted the proposal seeing it as a step toward an independent Jewish State however the Arab leadership rejected it outright refusing to recognize any partition of the territory and the separation of its peoples seeing few other options Jewish leaders declared independence in 1948 establishing the state of Israel this immediately triggered the Arab Israeli War as neighboring Arab States invaded to crush what they saw saw as a Zionist occupation despite the odds stacked against the Israeli Defenders the war ended in 1949 with an Israeli Victory establishing the green line as the deao border for the new Jewish State the green line expanded Israel's territory beyond the un's proposed boundaries incorporating Western Galilee and a broad Corridor through the Negev Desert by the end of the war over 700,000 Palestinians had been permanently displaced from their Homeland with many reduced to the status of refugees this event would be known as the nakba or catastrophe by surviving Palestinians and the rest of the Arab world although hostilities ceased the agreements didn't resolve the core conflict merely pausing territorial disputes from 1949 to 1967 the Gaza Strip was under Egyptian occupation and the West Bank under Jordanian occupation the end of the war also saw Israel's alleged violation of the UN General Assembly resolution 181 as it expanded beyond the un's proposed boundaries further souring relations with neighboring Arab states concurrently border skirmishes issues Over The Straits of Tran and the 1956 Suez Crisis further exacerbated problems with the Arabs Israel's probing into surrounding territories and retaliatory actions against crossb attacks further strained relations in the region setting the stage for June 5th 1967 when preemptive Israeli air strikes against Egyptian airfields caused a coalition of Arab states to simultaneously declare war and attack Israel across multiple fronts despite being grossly outnumbered Israel quickly launched an immediate offensive capturing the Sinai Peninsula Gaza Strip West Bank East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights at a lightning pace the war concluded on June 10th marking what we now know as the 6-day war these newly acquired territories significantly expanded Israel's borders with the green line being superseded by the ceasefire lines established at the end of the conflict from 1967 onwards new Israeli settlements would be established across the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank often encroaching on Palestinian land to do so the aftermath of of the Six-Day War left a lingering tension in the region with the Arab states seeking to recover their territories lost to Israel these tensions eventually sparked the yam kapor war in 1973 where Egypt and Syria launched coordinated surprise attacks against Israel to regain the Sinai Peninsula and the Goen Heights however by the end of the war Israeli forces had repelled the invasions and even advanced into Egyptian and Syrian territories beyond the pre-war lines despite these territorial changes during the conflict the borders essentially returned to their pre-war status following disengagement agreements in 1974 and 1975 even with the memories of yam kapor still fresh an unprecedented moment occurred in 1978 at Camp David in the United States here agreements were signed between Egyptian president and War Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister manakum beIN which led to a peace treaty and normalized relations the following year part of this treaty involved Israel returning the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt which was finalized in 1982 meanwhile Israeli military rule over the West Bank transitioned to a semi civil Authority Under the Israeli Ministry of Defense since its establishment in 1964 the Palestine Liberation Organization gained significant influence in the region its Pursuit for Palestinian self-determination led to the Arab League officially deeming them the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people in 1974 this recognition marked a pivotal moment in the Palestinian struggle as the pl's influence began to extend into neighboring countries like Lebanon this expansion contributed to Israel's 1982 operation peace for Galilee initially aimed at expelling PLO forces from Lebanon as the conflict rapidly escalated into an extended occupation of Southern Lebanon Israel established a security Zone to thwart attacks leading to intricate conflicts with Lebanese factions and the emergence of Hezbollah as a key political player in the region this occupation marked by its flagrant territorial violations significantly impacted Israeli Lebanese relations and the broader Middle Eastern geopolitical landscape the Israeli presence in southern Lebanon continued for nearly two decades marked by persistent military engagements political backlash as well as International scrutiny and criticism the occupation would only end with Israel's unilateral withdrawal in 2000 however this did not put an end to the pl's activities within Israel and other parts of the region the pl's involvement in hijackings attacks on civilians and Guerilla Warfare LED countries like the United States and Israel to label it a terrorist organization during that period though their reputation began to change over The Late 1980s the pl's chairman Yasser Arafat alongside other Palestinian parties became instrumental in setting the stage for the Oslo Accords which aimed to transition toward more structured Palestinian self-governance and a potential two-state solution signed in 1993 the Oslo Accords established the Palestinian Authority granting it limited self-rule over parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip for a transitional period with the aim of achieving a final peace settlement within 5 years the Accords divided the West Bank into three areas area a Under full Authority control area B under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control and area C Under full Israeli control the palestin inian Authority was given control over most population centers in the West Bank ant Gaza while Israel retained control over Jewish settlements military areas and most of the natural resources this Arrangement was meant to be a stepping stone toward a two-state solution although the subsequent Camp David negotiations in 2000 failed to establish a permanent settlement the transitional period set by the Oslo Accords was complex further exacerbated by the second inata a major Palestinian Uprising from 2000 to 2005 following the failed Camp David negotiations in 2005 shortly after the suppression of the uprising Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon took a unilateral step to withdraw from the Gaza Strip This evacuation involved dismantling all Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip and four in the northern West Bank the disengagement was aimed at improving Israeli security reducing friction between Israel and Palestinians and advancing the peace process but Israel still retained control over gaza's airspace territorial Waters and border crossings except for the land border with Egypt which is controlled by Egypt and the Palestinian Authority despite the disengagement relations did not improve the Gaza Strip instead came under the control of Hamas in 2007 following a civil war in the region this split the Palestinian territory deao with the West Bank controlled by the Palestinian National Authority and Gaza by Hamas ever since conditions in Gaza have been dire due to the Israeli and Egyptian blockades aimed at limiting hamas's influence economic struggles and ongoing conflict more recently tensions between Hamas and Israel have surged culminating in the disastrous confrontation that began in October of this year"

When President Trump's administration announced the move in 2017, it also officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. And while Israeli leaders celebrated, Palestinians denounced the move.

That's because both Israelis and Palestinians consider Jerusalem as their rightful capital. Jerusalem is home to important holy sites for all the Abrahamic religions, and so it has become a critical bargaining chip in the ongoing discussion between the two sides.

as the capital of Israel.” The US has officially moved its embassy in
Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and in doing so, President Trump has reversed decades of consensus about
the city’s status. While Israeli leaders celebrated, Palestinians denounced the move, deepening divides between two sides of a conflict
that is 70 years old. “We’re hearing live fire…” “Rising death toll…” “Quite a juxtaposition…” Here are 5 things to know about Jerusalem
and why it’s so contentious. Israel has controlled West Jerusalem since
1949. During the Six Day War, Israel captured East
Jerusalem and annexed that half of the city. But the international community considers
East Jerusalem occupied territory, whose fate needs to be part of a negotiated deal between
Israel and the Palestinians. In 1980, after Israel passed a law declaring
a united Jerusalem the capital, the United Nations
condemned the annexation. Palestinians want to divide the city and make
East Jerusalem the capital of a future Palestinian state, while Israelis want a unified Jerusalem to
be their capital. During peace process negotiations for the
Oslo Accords, the issue of Jerusalem was initially set aside to avoid derailing the talks. Any successful peace initiative in the future
would likely need to resolve the conflicting claims to the land. Control of Jerusalem has been a trigger for
violence many times in the past. The contested area of East Jerusalem is home
to some of the holiest sites in the world for Jews and Muslims. It is the site where Judaism’s two sacred
temples once stood. And the site where the prophet Mohammed ascended
to heaven. The trouble is that the sites for Muslims
and Jews exist on the same land. There’s a precarious power share in place. Israeli officials control who has access to
the complex. But Muslims have religious control inside. Jews can enter but aren’t allowed to pray. Instead, they use the Western Wall. The second intifada began in 2000, when then-opposition
leader Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount to assert Israel’s right to the complex. Palestinians protested and were met with tear
gas and rubber bullets. The violence lasted five years and killed
more than 3,000 Palestinians and nearly 1,000 Israelis, with thousands more wounded. In the early 70's, 16 countries had embassies
in Jerusalem, including the Netherlands and Colombia. But after the UN Security Council condemned
the annexation of East Jerusalem in 1980. member states left. Then, Trump signaled a change in policy, and Guatemala and Paraguay also announced they are moving their embassies to Jerusalem And it's possible that more countries will
follow America’s lead. Though Congress passed a law to relocate the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem more than 20 years ago, the law includes a loophole that allows the
president to delay the relocation for the sake of national security. Every sitting president -- Clinton, Bush,
Obama -- has used this power and signed the waiver every 6 months. President Trump signed the waiver in June
2017, and again in December 2017, but also signaled he would begin the process of moving
the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And in May of 2018, he carried out his pledge. The embassy move came at an already a tense
time. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have spent
the past few weeks holding protests on the border between Gaza and Israel, that weren’t
tied to the embassy move. Dozens of Palestinians had been killed even
before the embassy opened. While President Trump was careful not to call
Jerusalem an “undivided” capital. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said just that at the US embassy opening. “God Bless Jerusalem, the eternal undivided
capital of Israel.” But opposition to Trump’s declarations and
the embassy move has been growing. And as lines are drawn and the fight for Jerusalem
intensifies, the future of Israeli-Palestinian stability is once again at risk."

was his new assignment his name was Theodore Herzel France back then was the land of the Revolution Herzel expected equality and free thought well he was in for a surprise because as it turned out anti-Semitism was everywhere in France as a Jew Herzel knew all about it in fact it was a way of life in his homeland but in post-revolution France Herzel expected better and then came a famous military Scandal the draus affair a French Captain was accused of selling military secrets to Germany he too was a Jew the conviction later turned out to be false but her Herzel had seen enough there was a massive outpouring of anti-Semitism Jews were being targeted and abused this episode made Herzel realized his life's Mission he needed to find a country for Jews a place they could call home a place where they could live without discrimination the only question was where Herzel settled on the ancient homeland of Jews Palestine thus he founded a new movement for Jewish statehood what is often called Zionism Herzel himself is called the founder of political Zionism but he died before Israel was created let me tell you the story of what happened in between also why Jews left their ancient Homeland in the first place and how they came in conflict with the Arabs time for a flashback we'll start with a simple question who are Jews today we know them as followers of a religion the religion of Judaism but Jews never called themselves that in ancient times they called themselves Israelites not Israelis Israelites these people originated around 1,000 BC and where did they live in West Asia roughly the same place as modern day Israel Jews Trace their ancestry to three people Abraham his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob they belied God made a promise to Abraham the promise of a Homeland in present day Israel you may have heard Israeli leaders talk about the promised land well this is what they mean a land promised to them by God and Jews did live here many call it the Golden Age of ancient Israel two kings ruled over the Jews King David who founded Jerusalem and King Solomon who built the first great Temple now the obvious question is this why did the Jews leave because of multiple invasions first came the Assyrian Empire then the Babylonians then the Persian Empire then the Roman Empire and finally the Ottomans each round of invasion led to Jews leaving their Homeland the peak was probably during the Roman times Jews had tried to revolt against Rome the response was a brutal Crackdown Roman generals bed Jerusalem they massacred the population and destroyed the Jewish temple those who survived fled now our story makes a Time jump to the 19th and 20th centuries the Jews have fled their Homeland only a few thousand remain in West Asia the rest are now spread across countries and continents we're talking about a large diaspora Poland had around 3 million Jews Russia 2 and a half million Britain 300,000 and Germany half a million as anti-Semitism increased there Zionism emerged the call for a separate Jewish country the likes of Theodore Herzel led the call he decided to organize a World Congress of zionists herdel wanted Munich to host it but when Jews there rejected it he settled on basil in Switzerland around 200 zionists attended this Congress plus hundreds of onlookers and they decided on creating a Jewish homeland in Palestine just one problem though Palestine was not just vacant land it was home to tens of thousands of Arab people so how would Jews make it their Homeland hudel and Company had a plan back then Palestine was controlled by the Ottoman Empire so in 1896 Herzel went to Constantinople that's modern day stanbul and he stayed there for 11 days but he could not meet the sultan nonetheless he pushed on Herzel relayed an offer to the ottoman Sultan we will pay our foreign debt in return let us colonize Palestine it was basically an attempt to buy the land Herzel thought it was a Godfather sort of offer one the sultan could not refuse but the ottoman Sultan did just that he rejected it so colonization was a dead end that's when zionists turned to to plan B individual purchases Jews could buy land from ottoman landlords in Palestine one piece of land at a time this was the first wave of migration Jews bought the land and began farming but to the Arab population one thing was clear the Jews were not there to assimilate they were there to rule because after buying lands they fired Arab workers and Farmers they also set up their own towns and centers like Tel Aviv in 19009 and these settlements did not look like Arab once they looked out of place to put it simply they looked European most of this was funded from outside Jews had done well for themselves in America and Europe like the roel family arguably the most powerful European banking Dynasty with their help Jews bought land in Palestine still it was a trickle things would pick up after the British got involved remember this was before the first world war so Britain was still the superpower the Zionist asked London for help the response was not quite as enthusiastic Britain suggested alternatives to Palestine like Uganda and Argentina but the Zionist said no they wanted their ancient Homeland in West Asia then came the world war suddenly Britain needed the support of Jews so in 1917 they offered complete support the British foreign secretary Arthur James balur wrote a letter to the roel family he said Jews would have a homeland in Palestine he said Britain was committed to it and after the war they had the chance to do just that the Ottomans were defeated Britain was given control of Palestine by now Jewish migration had picked up they were still a minority in Palestine but they had their strengths more organization more money and more support an example of this was the hagana it was a Jewish paramilitary organization founded in 1920 its job to protect Jewish settlements in Palestine the Arabs were no match for it the hagana had better intelligence also better training than thanks to the British in the 1930s Jewish migration picked up again the reason was Nazi Germany this time Hitler targeted and massacred Jews by the thousands so those who could fled as the Jewish population exploded Palestinians revolted Jewish settlements and trains were attacked so the British did what they do best they said let's partition a Jewish State for the Jews an Arab State for the Palestinians but the Arab side rejected this much like today their leadership was divided so even when the proposals were favorable they could not capitalize and this back and forth continued through the second world war and soon Britain was fed up they were financially and politically drained so what did they do well they packed up and left they told the United Nations it is now your problem so the US came up with a plan and listen to this closely the Jewish state would get 55% of Palestine including the neev desert this state would have 500,000 Jews and 400,000 Arabs so a Jewish majority the Arab state would get 44% of this land and this state would have around 10,000 Jews its areas would include the West Bank in Gaza I know the math does not add up 55 + 44 is 99 so what happened to the remaining 1% well that was Jerusalem the city would be controlled by an international regime basically the United Nations Palestinians rejected the plan but the Jews said okay we are now independent in 1948 they declared the state of Israel and almost immediately Arab countries attacked them namely five of them Egypt Syria Jordan Iraq Lebanon but Wars are not fought on numbers alone the Arab leadership was divided each country had a different objective also their supply lines were stretched Israel on the other hand was motivated they were fighting for their existence and in 1949 they won the war Israel now occupied 77% of Palestine so after the war you had three different parts the state of Israel the West Bank controlled by Jordan and Gaza controlled by Egypt and the Palestinians it was a nightmare for them a quarter of a million people were displaced from their Homeland the Arabs called it the nakba the maps were not settled just yet in 1967 another war broke out again Arab States versus Israel this time Israel won an even more comprehensive victory in six days they captured three important territories the West Bank Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights basically all of Palestine and more later on Israel returned Sinai to Egypt they also formalized the border with Jordan but the question of Palestine remains Israel still controls the West Bank they often build settlements and eat into Palestinian land over in Gaza it's a full blockade and right now a full-blown War so where do both sides stand right now Palestine wants statehood based on three 1967 borders meaning the whole of West Bank Gaza and East Jerusalem Israel says it's not possible they have built dozens of settlements inside West Bank so Israel says the demography has changed plus the country is always expanding any Jew anywhere in the world can become an Israeli citizen it's called the Jewish law of return so resolution looks far away I know we call this a regional conflict a West Asian conflict but it's also an exported one Europe discriminated against Jews the Ottomans and Palestinians never did Europe drove them out and Europe asked them to stay in Palestine but when the plan looked tough they bolted classic Colonial attitude it's amply clear that there is no military solution to this problem the question of Palestine cannot be answered with weapons it requires Politics the only hope is that moderates on both sides can chart a course and remember statehood is not the end it's just the beginning because after that comes neighborhood the challenge of building friendship between the two [Music] states"

 The History of Israel and Palestine",2014-10-02,1584204,13426,6054,UCWQ9ZFFhEqUZ0r1IspnBm6Q," This is the history of Israel & Palestine. Through the centuries, the land we now call
Israel and Palestine changed hands many times as different groups of people battled for
control of the area. Over time, the establishment of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religions
made the land - especially the city of Jerusalem - a uniquely holy place. For about 1,000 years
in the middle ages, the Arabs almost always held control of the area, and actually lived
relatively peacefully with the Jews. In fact it was the Christians during their brief rule,
who massacred and persecuted both the Jews and Muslims. At the turn of the 20th century, around 1900,
the idea of statehood had firmly taken root around the world and so, naturally, many Jews
wanted a country of their own, but in the 2,000 years since the founding of Judaism,
most Jews had left the promised land and spread throughout the world. But with the goal of
creating their own country now achievable, large numbers of Jews started to come back
and settle in Palestine. World War 1 brought the defeat of the Ottoman Empire at the hands
of the British, French, and Russians, giving them control of the Middle East. They divided
it up, and the British were given a mandate over Palestine. With the more sympathetic
British now in control, these Jewish Zionists, as they were called, seized the opportunity
to accelerate their plan for statehood. But, creating a state for the Jews wasn’t really
the goal of the British, who just wanted to create a government in Palestine where power
could be shared peacefully by the different groups living there. And there were the Arabs
who didn’t trust the British or the Jews, because many of the Arab leaders thought the
British would favor the Jews. So the Arabs refused to form any government that included
Jewish participation, but before long this stubbornness grew into frustration at not
being represented, so some within the Arab community turned to violence and carried out
bombing attacks against Jewish settlers and started to destroy the crops the settlers
were growing on their farms. About a decade later, World War II broke out,
and millions of Jews were killed by the Nazis in the Holocaust. After the American, British,
and allied forces defeated the Germans, hundreds of thousands of Jews came to Palestine, and
the UN General Assembly passed a fateful plan to divide up Palestine into independent Arab
and Jewish states, with the all-important city of Jerusalem placed under International
control, but the five members of the Arab league didn’t want the Jews to control any
part of the land, so they all voted against the plan. In May, 1948, after much planning and covert
arms acquisition, the Jewish leadership went ahead and declared the establishment of the
State of Israel, and quickly convinced the US Government, the Soviet Union and many other
countries to officially recognize it. As expected by the Israelis, the Arab countries invaded
Palestine immediately, but the Israelis were ready and were more disciplined, better trained
and well-armed, and were too strong for their Arab enemies. When the dust settled, after
10 months of fighting and peace agreements were signed, Israel not only kept the whole
area under the original UN plan, it controlled almost 60% of the land that had been planned
for the Arab state. More than 700,000 Palestinian Arabs had also fled the fighting or were kicked
out of their homes, and about the same amount of Jews migrated into Israel from Arab lands.
So, you had about 1.5 million people basically switching places, making the population of
Israel much more Jewish. A generation later, in 1967, tensions were again reaching a boiling
point. There had been some deadly, cross border attacks from both the Israelis and the Arabs,
so Israel decided to launch a surprise invasion, and in six days, won control of the Gaza Srip
and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, took the West Bank and East Jerusalem away from Jordan,
and kicked Syria out of the Golan Heights. Fewer than 1,000 Israeli troops were killed
in the short war, but over 20,000 Arab soldiers died, went missing, or were captured. And
- just like in the 1948 war - hundreds of thousands more Palestinian Arabs left. Since then, Israel’s really built up its
security capabilities and constructed many settlements in these newly occupied territories,
even though the UN and the International Court of Justice declared the settlements illegal
under International Law. Ten years after the war, Israel returned the Sinai peninsula to
Egypt, and in 2005 pulled its troops and the settlers out of the Gaza Strip, but there
are around 750,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. In 1993, Israel struck a deal with the leader
of the Palestinian Liberation Organization - Yasser Arafat - and agreed to allow the
Palestinians to set up a government and rule themselves in the Gaza Strip and the city
of Jericho in the West Bank, in exchange the PLO recognized the right of Israel to exist.
This new Palestinian government, headed by Arafat, became known as the Palestinian Authority
and was controlled by its majority party, Fatah. But not all Palestinians - especially
people in the Gaza Strip - liked Arafat’s more moderate approach and so a split took
place, leading to the rise of the more extremist Islamic party, Hamas, whose leaders refused
to negotiate with Israel or recognize its right to exist. In 2006, Hamas won the Palestinian
parliamentary election, but Fatah refused to be a minority party and a violent power
struggle between Hamas and Fatah played out in the streets of Gaza. After more than 100 people died in the fighting,
Hamas controlled the area, so Arafat’s successor, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas,
essentially cut the Gaza Strip loose from the Palestinian Authority and set up an emergency
Fatah-controlled government in the West Bank. So today, there are two fairly different Palestines:
One is the West Bank, led by Abbas and his Fatah party, who more or less coexist peacefully
with their many Jewish neighbors, although Israel is in the process of building a 400
mile-long barrier along the border. It is Abbas who is engaged in ongoing negotiations
with Israel and the international community about reaching a solution to the conflict
that would allow Palestine to become an independent country. The other Palestine is the Gaza Strip, which
is essentially poor and mostly cut off from the rest of the world by Israel’s sea embargo
and a wall that divides it from Israel and Egypt, leaving its people without many basic
necessities including clean drinking water. Gaza is very dependent on the UN and the rest
of the International community for aid and is controlled by Hamas. Khaled Mashal is the
chairman of Hamas, and has led the party since the 2004 assassination of the Hamas leader
al-Rantisi. Mashal though lives in Qatar. In 1997 Israel tried, but failed, to assassinate
him in retaliation for the bombing of a market in Jerusalem that Hamas claimed responsibility
for. It’s Hamas who has been the target of repeated
Israeli military actions recently - including this year’s Operation Protective Edge, which
was a response to a number of attacks by Hamas against Israelis, including kidnappings and
rocket attacks, both of which have been aided by the digging of many tunnels under both
the Gaza-Israeli border and Gaza’s southern border with Egypt. Hamas uses these tunnels
to smuggle in weapons and money that it gets from others in the region who have an interest
in destabilizing Israel’s security, like Iran. In its response to Hamas, Israel has
taken heavy criticism for its destructive and vengeful air strikes that kill a high
number of civilians. There are generally two ideas for how to end
the conflict and give Palestinians statehood. The first, is a two state solution, where
Israel and Palestine would be two sovereign countries living side-by-side. This is the strategy embraced by many in the
International community including US President Obama and is embraced by people like Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud party. But time after time, negotiations around
this solution fail because of the many issues it has to confront and resolve like what to
do about the three-quarters of a million Jewish settlers in Palestinian areas, the instability
of the Gaza Strip, the fact that the Gaza strip and the West bank aren’t even connected,
and of course, who would control Jerusalem? These obstacles have given rise to a second,
alternative solution that’s embraced by many Arab Israelis and even Jewish politicians
like the newly elected President of Israel, Reuven Rivlin. They think the only practical way to go is
a one-state solution compromise where neither the Palestinians nor the Jewish people get
exactly what they want, but would instead be unified in one single state that would
ensure equal rights for all of its citizens. Proponents of this plan think it would solve
one of the world’s toughest problems and remove the entire area from the criticism
of the modern world. The main argument from Israelis against the one-state solution is
that it would instantly end the idea of a Jewish state and would make Jews a minority
again, but looking at the numbers, in a combined Arab-Israeli state, Jews would number 6.6m
and Arabs around 5.6m. Of course that’s before the issue of people migrating back
to this unified country is settled. Another issue that would require a creative
solution is the wealth gap between the technologically-driven and very prosperous economy of Israel, and
the much more challenged economic situation of the Palestinian territories. Thanks for watching. Hopefully this video
helps you see the situation with clearer eyes the next time it’s in the news. But I want to know what you think, how should
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict be solved?"
25,MknerYjob0w,Is Israel Guilty Of Apartheid Against Palestinians?,"For many years, Palestinians have accused Israel of practicing apartheid: An official policy of treating the people under its rule differently depending on their ethnicity.

Although it’s most famously associated with the white supremacist regime that used to rule South Africa, apartheid is actually a crime with specific conditions. In this explainer, we look at what those conditions are and whether they truly apply to Israel or not.

#Israel #Apartheid #SheikhJarrah",2021-05-15,1367106,44796,12710,UCV3Nm3T-XAgVhKH9jT0ViRg," Many people think of Israel and Palestine as two countries at war, with this one — a state for Jewish people — occupying this one here, where Palestinians live. The truth is, both Israeli Jews and Palestinians live all over this territory, ruled by one government and one army, based on the idea of: advancing the supremacy and domination of one group of people, Jews. And that is what guides its policies and its practices towards Palestinians. In other words, apartheid. Apartheid is a loaded word, tied to the racist South African regime of white minority rule. But, although the word comes from there, apartheid isn't just a description of
what happened in South Africa. It's actually a crime against humanity under international law. In 2021, Human Rights Watch accused Israel of carrying out apartheid. It based this accusation on the 1973 apartheid convention and the 1998 Rome Statute, which say that three elements have to occur for
the crime of apartheid to apply. They are: like denying people the right to leave
and to return to their country, expropriation of land and property, and the creation of separate reserves and ghettos. So let's see if any of these apply to
 Israel's rule over Palestinians. About half of the people that live here under Israel's rule are Palestinian, and the other half are Jews, like myself. For those 7 million Israeli Jews, almost the entire land is one space.  Whether they're here, here, here or here, they have the same rights, 
privileges and legal status. They can move freely, vote in the same elections and live under the same laws. The boundaries are invisible to them. But for the 7 million Palestinians, the boundaries are very visible. Whereas this is essentially one space for Israelis, Palestinians have been divided into four areas. Each area gets a different colored ID card issued by Israel, and your life and rights are determined by that ID card. In Gaza, Palestinians have no freedom of movement and are under a
complete Israeli blockade. Israel no longer has soldiers inside Gaza, but it controls every aspect of life from the outside. People in Gaza have no civil or political rights. They've got no say in the Israeli
government that controls them. Palestinians in the West Bank also have very limited freedom of movement, with their population divided
into 165 disconnected cantons cut off by Israeli military checkpoints, walls, settlements and other infrastructure.  They also have no civil or political rights in Israel. In East Jerusalem, Palestinians generally have more freedom to move, but Israel can take away
their right to live in the city. They can't vote in Israeli elections, and Israel also bars them from taking part in Palestinian politics. Palestinians who are citizens of
Israel can travel relatively freely, but they face restrictions on where they can live. They can vote in Israeli elections,
but face legalized discrimination. Yara Hawari is a Palestinian with Israeli citizenship. This ID system, it penetrates all areas of life where you live, where you study, what you work, etc. Even the more intimate areas of life, such as who you marry. That's because, for the most part, a Palestinian can't pass on their ID status to their spouse. And this has huge implications on  where they can live. Many indeed actually end up leaving and choosing to live abroad because it is that difficult. On rare occasions, Palestinians are able to change their ID, but only in one direction. So, for instance, if a Palestinian from East Jerusalem moves somewhere else inside the West Bank,  they could lose their residency
in East Jerusalem and Israel. Since it's considered that a downgrade, then that's a direction that would be feasible. And further down the line, again from Israel's perspective, if West Bankers move to the Gaza Strip,
then that's a direction that Israel will accept, but not in the opposite direction. So while Palestinians are granted different rights based on their IDs, nowhere do those rights
match those of Israeli Jews. Looks like we can check off at least one of the elements required for apartheid to apply. When Israel was founded in 1948, 700,000 Palestinians had fled or been forced out. The result was that the new state
had a Jewish majority. To maintain that majority, Israel has never allowed the refugees to return. The Palestinians who remained were
given Israeli citizenship, although they were kept under strict
military rule for 19 years. But, in 1967, when Israel occupied more lands, including Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, it faced a problem. It wanted the land, but didn't want
the Palestinians on that land. So it's refused to extend citizenship to the rest of the Palestinians under its control, while keeping them under military rule ever since. To further control the ratio of Palestinians to Israeli Jews, Israel still bans Palestinian refugees and their descendants from moving into any of the territories it controls, while encouraging any Jewish person anywhere in the world to immigrate to Israel, even if they've
never set foot there before.  In Jerusalem, the Israeli authorities actually have a population target:
60% Jews to 40% Palestinians. Palestinians in Jerusalem are only granted a ""permanent"" residency permit, even if they've been living in the city since before Israel was founded. About 350,000 Palestinians are in that status, which is Orwellian the way it's defined, because the only thing permanent in permanent residency is that it can actually always be taken away. These permits can be revoked if a Palestinian moves out of the city. But Jewish Israelis living in
Jerusalem never lose residency, even if they move to the other side of the world. This discrimination has
been enshrined in Israeli law. The 2018 Nation-State Law says that Israel
""is the nation-state of the Jewish people."" That means that even Palestinians 
with Israeli citizenship aren't considered equal to Jews 
with Israeli citizenship. As Israel's prime minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu put it, but rather, So let's go back to to that list from before. The Nation-State Law is only one of many
Israeli laws that explicitly discriminate against Palestinians. For example, there's the
1950 Absentees' Property Law. Deeming Palestinian refugees ""absentees,"" Israel seized hundreds of thousands
of acres of their land, even though they were only absent because Israel wouldn't let them return. Remember, denying people the right to return to their country is on the list of inhumane acts that legally make up the third element of apartheid. There are more Israeli policies that could fall under the category of inhumane acts, especially when it comes to land. So Israel desires the land, even more so desires empty land or land that it makes empty, and doesn't desire the Palestinians living on that land. And that has resulted in policies in which land is constantly moving in one direction. Land that used to be Palestinian becomes state land, and then that land is allocated for the development of towns and communities for Jewish citizens. And yes, expropriation of land
is also an inhumane act. So let's see what that looks like on the ground. Across the entire territory, Palestinian communities are overcrowded and surrounded by Jewish-only communities. It's the same type of practice of encircling Palestinian communities so that they can't expand, cutting them off from one another. It's a continuous practice that began in 1948 and was expanded to the West Bank in 1967. The Israeli state prioritizes Jewish development in places where it wants to restrict the growth of Palestinian communities, with the government keen to Judaize areas like the Galilee and the Negev. Israeli politicians frequently use that term: to ""Judaize"" an area. In other words, to ensure Israeli Jewish dominance in a particular area where the government has a concern over the Palestinian demography. And in any other context, this would be condemned as, you know, gross ethnic engineering. It's in its basic laws,
which is essentially the Israeli Constitution. The land is deemed for the Jewish people, not the Israeli people, but the Jewish people. In fact, only 3% of the land inside Israel's 1948 borders is allocated for its Palestinian citizens. Meanwhile, hundreds of new communities have been built for its Jewish citizens, many on the ruins of
destroyed Palestinian villages. Plus, there's the 200 illegal Jewish settlements that have been built across the West Bank as well. At the same time, 
thousands of Palestinian homes have been demolished or are under threat of demolition, having been built without permits because Israel rejects most Palestinian building applications. Meanwhile, in the Negev Desert, the Israeli government wants to maximize the land available for Jewish development. So it has tried to force Palestinian Bedouin citizens into small townships by demolishing their homes and not allowing them to connect to the water and power grids. One village, Al-Araqib, has been demolished
more than 180 times. Now just across the Green Line, a similar struggle is taking place in the village of Susiya, which is in the West Bank, just south of Hebron. And it too has faced a series of mass demolitions by authorities in attempt to establish Israeli Jewish control over the area. Looks like we can check off another one of the criteria for apartheid. Israel has total control of this entire territory. Even in Gaza and the West Bank, 
which have some limited autonomous Palestinian administration in place, Israel controls the borders, trade, resources, water, electricity, the airspace, the electromagnetic spectrum, the population registry and more. Accusing a government of carrying out a crime against humanity like apartheid is no simple matter. But we've seen how Israel's control over and discrimination against Palestinians fits the legal threshold for apartheid. Israel's own leaders knew this was happening, although they didn't do much to stop it. Still, how could apartheid apply to Israel when, say, Palestinian citizens can vote? So as a Palestinians citizen of Israel, I cannot question the fundamental Constitution of Israel, which says that the state is for the Jewish people and the Jewish people alone.  My citizenship doesn't allow for inclusion in that state. And so therefore,  participation in Israeli elections or in the Knesset is really nominal and has no potential to change policy. Another argument against the accusation of apartheid is that the occupation is only temporary, and when it ends,
Palestinians will rule themselves. Normal people don't think that 54 years is temporary. We've passed that line already a very long time ago. And yeah, there's a lot of Israeli propaganda insisting on that worldview of democracy plus temporary occupation. No, it's not a democracy and it's not a temporary occupation. It's one regime between the river and the sea. And that regime is apartheid."

https://www.facebook.com/iwm.london",2024-02-21,76812,1601,454,UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA," In 1936, British Mandatory Palestine was in 
flames. In response to rising Jewish immigration   and economic dominance, Arab Palestinians 
revolted against the British, attacking   military installations and Jewish settlements. The 
British authorities were scrambling for an answer.  The British sent a commission led by Lord Peel 
to investigate the causes of the violence. And   in 1937, that commission concluded that problems 
in Palestine were ‘so deep-rooted that the only   hope of a cure lies in a surgical operation’. Some 
Jewish leaders were enthusiastic about the idea,   although did not publicly admit 
this. Most Arab leaders, however,   rejected the proposals outright. Instead of ending 
the violence, the Peel Report made things worse.  In our last episode, we explored the conflicting 
promises made by the British during the First   World War and how they tried to resolve 
them. In this episode we’ll examine how   the Second World War transformed the conflict 
once again. Why did Britain change its mind   about a Jewish homeland, how did a Zionist 
underground insurgency defeat the British,   and how were the borders of Israel, 
Gaza and the West Bank created?  Britain controlled Palestine under a League 
of Nations Mandate. Its job was to prepare   the territory for independence. As part of the 
Mandate, Britain had committed to setting up   what was described as ‘a homeland for the Jewish 
people’ in Palestine, but it had also promised to   respect the rights of the existing populations. 
Doing both was proving extremely challenging.  After the failure of the Peel Report, Britain 
declared Martial Law and used a surge of troops   to supress the revolt. They brought in Jewish 
Auxiliaries to add to their numbers and killed,   imprisoned or exiled Arab Palestinian leaders. 
But with a Second World War on the horizon,   the British government felt they had to 
go one step further to end the dissent.  Britain was trying to balance a number of 
different objectives. It wanted to maintain   stability in the region in order to protect 
its territorial interests – most notably the   Suez Canal, which was not only a vital link 
to Britain’s overseas Empire, but was also the   channel through which Persian oil was transported 
to Britain. The looming threat of war caused   Britain to reason that placating Palestinian 
Arabs was more politically and strategically   advantageous than siding unambiguously with 
Palestinian Jews. While support from Jewish groups   in any future conflict could be assured in the 
near term because of Hitler’s ideology, support   from Arabs was far less certain and Britain wanted 
to do whatever it could to keep bring them onside.  The result was a complete reversal of the British 
government position. In the White Paper of 1939,   Britain claimed that, with 450,000 Jewish 
people now living in Mandatory Palestine   this was already the National Home for the Jewish 
people and the Balfour Declaration had already   been delivered. Now, instead of partitioning 
the country, the British planned to create an   independent Palestinian State within the next 
10 years, in which Arabs and Jews would share   government. However, the White Paper also 
included strict limitations on Jewish land   purchases and restricted Jewish immigration 
to just 75,000 over the next five years. This   all but ensured that Palestinian Arabs would be 
the dominant group in the new Palestinian state.  Most Zionists were appalled by the proposals 
outlined in the 1939 White Paper, not only because   it suggested an entirely different overall 
objective but because the restrictions on   immigration would condemn hundreds of thousands 
of Jews in Europe to ongoing persecution and   suffering under the Nazis and their collaborators. 
This is given particularly potent expression in   the fact that the report was initially issued 
a mere 30 minutes before the death of Nazi   official Ernst vom Rath. His murder would be 
cynically exploited as the pretext in events   that became known as the November pogrom and 
were described by the Nazis as Kristallnacht.  But the Arab response to the White Paper was 
not as the British expected either. The revolt   of 1936 had hardened positions on all sides 
and while moderate Palestinian Arabs accepted   the White Paper, hard-line nationalists like Amin 
al-Husseini rejected it for not going far enough.   In response to the restrictions on migration, 
the Zionist militias that Britain had trained,   began facilitating illegal Jewish immigration. But 
before their resistance could turn to open revolt,   the Second World War began. Now, Palestinian 
Jews rallied to the Allied cause as did many   Palestinian Arabs. Al Husseini on the other hand, 
tried to get support from the Axis Powers. The   war and in particular the Holocaust, in which 6 
million of Europe’s Jews were murdered, would turn   the conflict in Mandatory Palestine on its head.
The outbreak of the Second World War had a   profound impact on events in Mandatory Palestine. 
Most Zionist underground members stopped any   direct action, wary of doing anything that could 
jeopardise the Allied war effort against Germany.   As David Ben Gurion, future Israeli Prime 
Minister suggested, ""They would fight the   White Paper as if there was no war and the war 
as if there was no White Paper."" Internationally,   increasing understanding about the Holocaust 
generated considerable sympathy for the Zionist   cause. Many surviving Jews believed that their 
ongoing existence in Europe was untenable after   everything that had happened. Having lost 
everything, and often everyone, they had   no desire to return to the places in which their 
lives had been so completely devastated. Britain,   for its part, remained very reluctant, despite the 
pressure of world opinion, to lift restrictions   on immigration to Mandatory Palestine.
By 1944, as Allied victory seemed more assured,   two hard-line Zionist militias, the Irgun and 
Lehi, began an insurgency against British rule,   assassinating diplomat Lord Moyne in November. 
But resistance was not widespread. In 1945,   Britain’s newly elected Labour Government under 
Clement Atlee campaigned on a promise to end   restrictions on Jewish immigration. But fearful 
of exacerbating tensions among Palestinian Arabs   and damaging relations with neighbouring Arab 
states, upon arriving in office, Atlee changed   his mind. Instead, some 50,000 Jewish refugees 
inbound to Palestine were redirected to camps   on Cyprus. The conditions and the sight of Jewish 
Holocaust survivors being held behind barbed wire   generated widespread criticism. With Britain’s 
position now clear, the largest Zionist militia,   the Haganah, joined the Irgun and Lehi to form 
the Jewish Resistance Movement. They aimed to   drive the British out. Together, they targeted 
immigration control, transport infrastructure   and British military installations. In response, 
the British curbed civil liberties in 1945 and   launched a series of raids and searches 
in 1946, codenamed 'Operation Agatha'.  Their intention was to combat what's described 
as a 'Jewish illegal armed organisations in   Palestine'. It says here 'these organisations 
have been conducting a campaign of violence,   terror, sabotage, and murder'. A vast amount 
of documents were seized during the course of   the operations 'that will prove of the greatest 
value and interest'. Now these documents were all   moved to the King David Hotel in Jerusalem 
where the British administration were being   housed alongside a number of military personnel. 
In July 1946 that hotel was bombed by the Irgun.  Palestine and the world was shocked by the blowing 
up of the King David Hotel Jerusalem. In broad   daylight dozens of Jews, Arabs and Britishers 
were murdered in cold blood by the notorious   Jewish terrorist organisation Irgun Zvai Leumi.
The attack killed 91 people and attracted   widespread criticism from both international 
governments and other Zionist organisations.   The Irgun, for their part, claimed that it 
was never their intention to kill anyone and   that warnings sent in advance of the attack 
had been ignored. Their main target was the   documents that had been captured during Operation 
Agatha. Now amongst the public condemnation,   many people in Britain started to wonder 
if the mandate was worth the trouble it was   causing. There was dwindling public appetite 
to expend more British lives protecting it.  The violence now intensified. Though the 
Jewish Resistance Movement dissolved after   the King David Hotel attack, the Irgun and Lehi 
continued to attack British targets. Meanwhile,   Britain continued to send ever-larger numbers 
of troops to Palestine, hoping to suppress the   insurgency in the same way that they had 
supressed the Arab Revolt of 1936. But it   wasn’t working. In July 1947, the Irgun kidnapped, 
hung and boobytrapped the bodies of two British   Sergeants in a eucalyptus grove near Netanya. 
The attacks were widely condemned and lead to   anti-Jewish rioting back in Britain. To many 
the Sergeant's Affair, as it came to be known,   was the 'straw that broke the Mandate's back'.
The Second World War had virtually bankrupted the   UK and public sentiment both within Britain and 
across the countries concerned was changing. In   the three years after 1945, India, Pakistan, 
Burma and Ceylon all achieved independence.   Whilst in Europe, the dividing lines of a new 
global conflict were being drawn, preparing   for and responding to this Cold War dominated 
military planning and strategy. Ultimately,   the Mandate in Palestine was only ever supposed 
to be temporary, and Britain didn’t want it   anymore. It was too complicated and too costly.
With all other Class A League of Nations mandates   now having received their independence, Britain 
turned over Mandatory Palestine to the newly   formed United Nations in 1947. Taking inspiration 
from the Peel Report of 1936, they recommended   a partition into two independent states with an 
economic union and an international zone around   Jerusalem. Most Arab groups rejected the plan. 
They were opposed both to partition in principle,   and to the way the lines were drawn. They pointed 
to the fact that while Jews represented just over   30% of the population, they were apportioned 54% 
of the land, although arguments persist about the   quality of that land. Most Zionists, on the other 
hand, willingly accepted the proposal, seeing   it as a stepping stone towards their ultimate 
ambition for a Jewish state that extended further.  In November 1947, the plan passed a vote 
in the UN with backing from both the United   States and Soviet Union. The United 
Kingdom abstained and declared that   it would leave on May 15th 1948. Now, violence 
took hold between Palestinian Arabs and Jews,   and a Civil War broke out between militias from 
each side. But even as the death toll mounted,   Britain largely did not get involved.
These documents come from Major General   William Scott Cole who was tasked with the 
responsibility of overseeing the British   withdrawal from Mandate Palestine. Whilst Jewish 
and Arab groups were fighting it out to determine   the future shape of Palestine, Britain's focus 
became about how to remove itself from the place   entirely. For example, here it says in January 
1948, 'difficulties arose at this time due to   absence of staff owing to internal troubles. Jews 
will not go to or through Arab areas and vice   versa.' As well there's a note talking about the 
disposal of Sherman tanks that had to be destroyed   by Royal signals and blown up until they were 
quote 'unrecognisable scrap'. As Rees Williams,   undersecretary of state for the colonies, told 
the House of Commons 'the manner in which the   withdrawal took place is unprecedented 
in the history of our Empire'. It was,   in many ways, emblematic of the entire episode.
Meanwhile, the Civil War in Palestine continued.   At first, Arab forces seemed to have the upper 
hand. The Jewish communities in Palestine were   spread out and Arab forces were able to blockade 
them, most notably in Jerusalem where 100,000   Jewish people were trapped. But in late March 
1948, Zionist militias launched Plan Dalet. This   offensive aimed to create territorial continuity 
and secure their borders in anticipation of an   invasion by neighbouring Arab states. As the 
Zionist forces attacked, hundreds of thousands   of Palestinian Arab refugees fled their homes. 
The causes of this flight are still considered   controversial. Some left by choice, others in fear 
and some by force. Many refugees took their keys   with them, planning to return home someday soon.
On the 14th of May, Zionists declared the new   state of Israel. The following day, 
neighbouring Arab states invaded. But   the Arab forces were unprepared for war, 
and the Israeli forces were able to hold   onto their territory. Over the next nine months, 
they built enough forces to push well beyond the   land allotted to them in the 1947 UN Plan.
The 1936 Revolt had left Arabs in Palestine   leaderless and significantly weakened. Though they 
were supported by other Arab states, these states   had different interests and agendas and were often 
at crossed purposes. In contrast, while there may   have been differences between the convictions 
of different Jewish groups, they were completely   unified in the common cause of creating and 
protecting the Jewish State. They also benefited   from having received military training and arms 
from the British administration in earlier years.  By the war's end in 1949, Palestine had been wiped 
off the the map. Israel controlled 60% of the   proposed Arab state, with the remainder controlled 
by Jordan and Egypt. 700,000 Palestinian Arabs   either fled or were expelled from their homes, an 
event remembered as 'the Nakba' or 'catastrophe'.   In the following years, 260,000 Jewish people 
emigrated from neighbouring Arab states,   some by choice and others by force. Around 150,000 
Palestinian Arabs remained in Israel. Today their   descendants number over 2 million people, making 
up the largest minority group in the country. The   legacy of the Arab-Israeli War is still at the 
heart of today's conflict in Israel-Palestine.  Ultimately, Britain’s administration of the 
Mandate never proved to be much more than a   firefighting exercise, lurching for one policy 
to another in an attempt to hold the mandate   together and protect its own strategic 
interests. On the last day of the mandate,   the chief secretary of the British administration 
called a press conference in his Jerusalem   office. One of the journalists there 
asked: ""And to whom do you intend to   give the keys to your office?"". ""I shall 
leave them under the mat,"" was the reply."

On October 7, Hamas, a militant group based in the Gaza Strip, launched a deadly attack on Israel, killing over 1,400 Israelis and kidnapping over 200. In retaliation, Israeli airstrikes have killed, as of this video, over 6,400 Palestinians in Gaza, where Palestinians have lived for decades under an occupation and blockade. 

Since 1967, Israel has imposed tight restrictions on travel and essential goods such as food, fuel, medicine, and water in its occupied territories. In 2007, those restrictions became even tighter in Gaza after Hamas seized power there. Since then, it has been nearly impossible for Palestinians to leave Gaza or to access an adequate supply of essential goods.

Today, the Gaza Strip, with a population of over 2 million Palestinians, is a victim of what many call “collective punishment” as Israel bombards its population, shuts off access to internet, power, food, water, and medicine, forces them to leave their homes, and prepares for a ground invasion.

This latest episode of Vox Atlas explains how the experience of Palestinians in Gaza got to this point, and what’s behind Israel’s occupation and its blockade of Gaza.

In the 17 centuries BC, following the call of God, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob settled in Canaan, later known as the Land of Israel. In 1000 BC, King Saul established the Israelite monarchy, which was later split into the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah. The conquest of Roman Empire in 63 BC gave the name “Palestine” to Judah. During this time, Christianity became a dominant religion towards the end of the Roman Empire. In 636 came an Arab conquest, beginning the spread of Islam. In the 11th century, Christians in Europe launched several crusades to bring the Holy City back to the hand of the Christians while from the 16th century, more and more Jews were joining a movement called Zionism aiming to create a Jewish national state in its ancient homeland.

WWI exploded in 1918 and ended with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Its land in the Middle East was carved by the British and French Empires. The region under the control of Britain was what it called the British mandate for Palestine. Tensions between the Jews and the Arabs who both claimed the land grew, which even led to acts of violence.

In 1947, the UN partitioned Palestine into two independent states: a Jewish state and an Arab state with the City of Jerusalem becoming an international zone with a special status. Less than one year after that, Israel declared itself an independent state. Right after the declaration, the 1948 Arab-Israeli War broke out and ended when a cease-fire agreement was reached in 1949, giving more than two-thirds of historic Palestine, including West Jerusalem, to Israel. 

There came more wars and fighting in the following decades, namely the Six-Day War ending with the victory of Israel, the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon kicking the Palestinian Liberation Organization out of Beirut, the First Intifada ending with the Oslo Accords, the Second Intifada ending with Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza.

Then came the establishment of Hamas, a Sunni Islamist militant group founded in 1987, aiming to destroy the state of Israel and create an Islamic state. After the Battle of Gaza (a conflict between Hamas and Fatah), Hamas split from the Palestinian authority and gained power in the Gaza while the West Bank was separately controlled by the PLO. 

Israel put Gaza under a suffocating blockade, leading to several bloody wars between Israel and Hamas, the military group in control of the Gaza Strip till today.

territory of the arab population that hails from the israel-controlled land have long been known for their enduring conflict with the israeli occupation of the west bank and the gaza strip the tension between israel and palestine has been deteriorating in years climaxing with many violent clashes between the two sides to understand the root of the israel-palestine conflict we have to look back a few thousand years ago early history of israeli-palestinian conflict in the 17th centuries bc following the call of god three patriarchs of the jewish people abraham isaac and jacob settled in kanaan a region approximating present-day israel the west bank and the gaza strip parts of lebanon syria and jordan the region later had the name the land of israel the promised land the palestine region or the holy land in 1000 bc king saul established the israelite monarchy which then was ruled by king david who made jerusalem the capital of his kingdom and his son king solomon who built the first temple in jerusalem after the death of king solomon the united monarchy was split into the kingdom of israel in the north with samaria as the capital and the kingdom of judah in the south with jerusalem as the capital the land became home to a majority of jews but then it was subject to numerous conquests of various groups leading to the significant decrease of the jewish population on the land one of these conquests was conducted by the roman empire who gave the name palestine to judah intending to break the jewish connection with the land of israel during this time christianity which started as a jewish sect ultimately became a dominant religion toward the end of the roman empire in the 7th century came an arab conquest beginning the spread of islam the dome of the rock was built on the ruin of the second temple making jerusalem the holy city to three monotheistic religions judaism christianity and islam after christians in jerusalem were intensely persecuted by the seljuk turks a central asian empire with ambition to expand its territory christians in europe launched several crusades to bring the holy city back to the hand of the christians during this time many jews were killed others were making pilgrimages everywhere mostly in western europe from the 16th century to world war 1 the holy land along with much of the middle east was ruled by the ottoman empire an islamic superpower the land was unofficially called palestine at the same time in europe more and more jews were joining a movement called zionism aiming to create a jewish national state in its ancient homeland hence in the first decade of the 20th century tens of thousands of jews moved from europe back to the region israel and palestine under the british rule world war 1 exploded and ended with the collapse of the ottoman empire its land in the middle east was carved by the british and french empires the british then gave more independence for iraq and jordan and the region remaining under the control of britain was what it called the british mandate for palestine where britain promised to establish a jewish national homeland under its balfour declaration which went into effect in 1923. tensions between the jews and the arabs who both claimed the land grew which even led to acts of violence by the 1930s following the increasing jewish population in palestine due to the fear of persecution during the nazi reign in germany the british limited jewish immigration in response the jewish militias formed to both fight the arabs and resist the british rule then came the holocaust throughout nazi germany which claimed almost 6 million jewish lives after the war more and more jews then fled from europe to palestine to seek a homeland escalating the tension with the arabs overwhelmed by the situation britain began to withdraw from the region the birth of the israel state after world war ii the u.n proposed a plan to partition palestine into two independent states a jewish state and an arab state with the city of jerusalem becoming an international zone with a special status however the plan according to which the jewish accounting for only one-third of the population was granted more territory 56.5 of the land was rejected by the arabs they began to form volunteer armies throughout palestine less than one year after that as britain completed its withdrawal from palestine israel declared itself an independent state marking a new bloodier chapter in the struggle between the jews and the palestinian arabs the 1948 arab israeli war right after the announcement of an independent israel a war between the arabs and the jews broke out which was known as the 1948 arab israeli war the war involved five recently independent arab nations egypt jordan iraq syria and lebanon the arab league who invaded the region in an attempt to establish a unified arab palestine however a ceasefire agreement was reached a year later in which more than two-thirds of historic palestine including the west jerusalem belonged to israel while jordan occupied east jerusalem and the area known as the west bank and egypt occupied the gaza strip as a result more than 750 000 palestinians were expelled from the land where they lived for centuries on the day that they call al-nakba or the catastrophe with the deteriorated dispute between the jews and the arabs there came more wars in fighting in the following decades [Music] the 60-day war it was in 1967 when the 60-day war broke out after a volatile period of diplomatic friction and skirmishes between israel and its neighboring arab states jordan syria and egypt this brief war ended with the victory of israel giving israel control over the golan heights from syria the west bank and east jerusalem from jordan and gaza and the sinai peninsula from egypt sinai was later returned to egypt under the egypt israel peace treaty after the war most palestinian refugees and their descendants were not allowed to return to their homes but had to live in gaza the west bank in neighboring jordan syria and lebanon the first intifada and the oslo accords the rising number of israelis settling in the palestinian territories in the west bank and gaza gave rise to the plo the palestinian liberation organization first founded in cairo egypt in 1964 to create a liberated palestine in israel the plo launched attacks on israel from its base in jordan it was then forced to move from jordan to lebanon starting to carry out acts of terrorism against israel fighting went on for years including the israeli invasion of lebanon to kick the plo out of beirut the plo eventually agreed to divide the land between palestine and israel but there were still more and more jewish settlers moved into the israel-occupied palestinian territories in 1987 a violent palestinian uprising was ignited starting from the jabilaya refugee camp after an israeli defense forces truck collided with two palestinian civilian vans killing four of them this was known as the first intifada this bloody conflict resulting in hundreds of deaths triggered a peace process with the signing of the oslo accords by israel and the plo the oslo one accord signed in washington dc and the oslo ii accord in taba egypt according to the oslo accords the west bank was divided into three areas area a was exclusively controlled by the palestinians area b was controlled by both the palestinians and israel area c was fully controlled by israel the second intifada though further peace talks continued in 2000 the israelis and palestinians could not reach agreements on issues like the status of jerusalem rights of refugees and the increased jewish settlement in palestinian lands ariel sharon a jewish israeli who would later become israel's prime minister visited the temple mount home to the al-aqsa mosque in jerusalem the action was deemed offensive by many palestinians and the second intifada broke out the violence ended with israel's withdrawal from gaza but continued to settle in the west bank israel conflict with hamas hamas is a sunni islamist militant group aiming to destroy the state of israel and create an islamic state after the armed conflict between hamas and fatah who managed the plo hamas split from the palestinian authority and gained power in the gaza israel put gaza under a suffocating blockade leading to several bloody wars between the two groups in the gaza strip including operation cast lead operation pillar of defense and operation protective edge in 2014 hamas and fatah reached agreement to form a national unity government in 2018 the u.s embassy was relocated from tel aviv to jerusalem which was deemed by the palestinians as a signal of american support for jerusalem as israel's capital 2021 the conflict between israel and palestine was reassumed by a series of hostile events in east jerusalem leading to several acts of violence until a ceasefire deal brokered by egypt qatar and the united nations came into effect on may 21st peaceful though it may seem now the complex and long-lasting territorial dispute between two states is a ticking time bomb that can

31,cfkUE5Q0K04,Whose Land Is It? Palestine Or Israel? A 1982 Documentary Looks At This Issue With Old Footage,"A Documentary On The The Israel Palestine Conflict From 1982. It was made by my film partner Amram Nowak. The documentary is extraordinary in part because of the unique stock footage he gathered to make the film, footage of Palestine and Israel taken by amateur filmmakers.

In 1982 the Israeli Palestinian conflict was marked by significant events many of which were extensions of earlier events and underlying issues. It was marked most prominently by the Lebanon War which had wide-reaching consequences for both Israelis and Palestinians. The events of this year further complicated the already intricate web of regional politics and conflicts.

The Lebanon War (also known as the First Lebanon War). Tensions between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) had been escalating, particularly from southern Lebanon, where the PLO had established bases from which they launched attacks into Israel.

In June 1982, in response to an assassination attempt against Israel's ambassador to the UK (attributed to the PLO), Israel launched Operation Peace for Galilee. This was a full-scale invasion of Lebanon aimed at pushing PLO forces out of missile range of Israel's northern cities.

Israeli forces encircled West Beirut where the PLO leadership and its main forces were headquartered. After weeks of bombing and negotiations, an agreement was reached for the PLO to evacuate its fighters from Lebanon. The evacuation was overseen by a multinational force.

After the assassination of Bashir Gemayel, the newly elected Christian Maronite president of Lebanon and a key Israeli ally, Lebanese Christian Phalangist militia entered the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila in Beirut and killed a significant number of civilians. Israel's indirect role in allowing the Phalangists into the camps led to widespread condemnation and an investigation within Israel, which found that Ariel Sharon, then Israel's defense minister, bore ""personal responsibility"" for not anticipating the possibility of Phalangist violence. He was subsequently forced to resign his position, though he remained in the cabinet.

Israeli settlement activity in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip continued during this period, despite international condemnation. This settlement expansion contributed to heightened tensions between Israelis and Palestinians.

Beginnings of the Intifada. While the First Intifada (Palestinian uprising) against Israeli occupation began later in 1987, the seeds of resentment and discontent that would lead to this mass uprising were growing in the early 1980s.

The Israeli government of the time, led by Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his right-wing Likud party, held a hardline stance toward the Palestinians and had a vision of a ""Greater Israel"" that included continued control over the West Bank.

The PLO, under Yasser Arafat's leadership, was the predominant Palestinian political and militant entity. Despite being based out of Lebanon at the beginning of 1982, by the end of the year, after the evacuation from Beirut, the PLO's leadership had dispersed to various Arab countries, with a significant portion relocating to Tunisia.

The Role of Other Arab States: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict was not isolated from the broader Arab-Israeli conflict. Many Arab states, especially Syria and Jordan, had significant roles and interests in the Palestinian issue. Syria, in particular, had its own reasons for involvement in Lebanon and confrontation with Israel.

AND I KNOW THAT EVEN SAYING THAT SENTENCE MEANS I’M LOSING FOLLOWERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THAT’S HOW CONTENTIOUS THIS TOPIC IS. BEFORE YOU EVEN FINISH THE SENTENCE, PEOPLE ARE LIKE, ""YOU IDIOT! HOW DARE YOU! SHUT THE HELL UP!"" BUT, GUYS, WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT, BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT STORIES THAT HAS EXISTED IN OUR LIFETIME. I MEAN, THERE ARE LOTS OF FIGHTS THAT SEEM LIKE THEY WILL NEVER COME TO AN END:  INDIA VERSUS PAKISTAN, CHINA VERSUS TIBET, WHITE PEOPLE VERSUS RHYTHM. BUT ISRAEL VERSUS PALESTINE IS A 73-YEAR-OLD BEEF THAT HAS STUMPED EVERBODY. I MEAN, WHEN IT STUMPED JARED,
YOU KNEW THAT THIS THING WAS YOU KNEW THAT THIS THING WAS DIFFICULT. BUT THE PARODOX, THE PARODOX IS THAT BECAUSE ISRAEL AND PALESTINE HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR SO LONG, PEOPLE FORGET THAT IT IS ONGOING, UNTIL THERE ARE FLARE-UPS THAT THE WORLD CANNOT IGNORE, WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED AGAIN THIS WEEK. >> OVERNIGHT, A DEADLY BARRAGE FROM ISRAELI FORCES LIGHTING UP THE SKIES OVER GAZA. ( SIRENS ) AND IN THE WEST BANK, WARNING SIRENS ECHOING THROUGH BETHLEHEM. EARLIER, PALESTINIAN MILITANT GROUPS FIRING MORE THAN 200 ROCKETS INTO ISRAEL, MOST OF THE HAMAS ROCKETS STOPPED BY ISRAEL’S MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM, OR THEY FELL SHORT. ISRAELI STRIKES REPORTEDLY KILLING AT LEAST 23 PEOPLE, INCLUDING NINE CHILDREN, ISRAEL SAYING THE DEAD WERE MILITANTS. AT LEAST SIX ISRAELIS WERE REPORTED INJURED. TENSIONS HAD BEEN ESCALATING OVER ISRAELI MOVES TO EVICT PALESTINIAN FAMILIES FROM THEIR HOMES IN EAST JERUSALEM. THEY BOILED OVER AS MORE THAN 100 WORSHIPPERS AND PROTESTERS WERE INJURED AS ISRAELI POLICE STORMED THE AL AQSA MOSQUE USING TEAR GAS AND RUBBER BULLETS. >> Trevor: YES, THIS WEEK, THE CONFLICT ESCALATED AGAIN, AND NOW DOZENS OF PEOPLE ARE DEAD. INCLUDING CHILDREN. AND, LOOK, MAN, WHAT MAKES ISRAEL-PALESTINE SUCH A DIFFICULT TOPIC TO EVEN BROCH IS ALL THE LAYERS PACKED UNDER IT. NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU TRY TO BREAK IT DOWN, PEOPLE WILL SAY YOU’RE LEAVING OUT SOME CRUCIAL PIECE OF CONTEXT, AND THEY’RE PROBABLY RIGHT. I MEAN, THERE’S THE HISTORY OF HOW ISRAEL BECAME A STATE AFTER NAZI GERMANY TRIED TO DESTROY THE JEWISH PEOPLE. BUT THERE’S ALSO THE HISTORY OF THE BRITISH TAKING THE LAND FROM THE PALESTINIANS, NOT TO MENTION THAT EVERY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE
REGION HAS ITS OWN ISSUES AND REGION HAS ITS OWN ISSUES AND ITS OWN AGENDAS. AND ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT, THERE’S RELIGION INVOLVED. AND RELIGION HAS NEVER CALMED ANY SITUATION WHERE THERE’S A CLASH. WHAT MAKES IT EVEN HARDER IS THE FACT THAT WHO’S RIGHT AND WHO’S WRONG ALWAYS SEEMS TO CHANGE, DEPENDING ON WHEN YOU START MEASURING FROM. THIS WEEK WAS THE PERFECT, PERFECT EXAMPLE OF IT. IF YOU START FROM ""ISRAEL FIRED ROCKETS INTO GAZA,"" THEN ISRAEL IS THE BAD GUY, BECAUSE THEY’RE BOMBING GAZA. BUT THEN YOU TAKE A STEP BACK IN TIME, YOU GO, ""WELL, BUT HAMAS FIRED ROCKETS AT ISRAEL."" THEN HAMAS IS THE BAD GUY. BUT THEN YOU TAKE A STEP BACK, AND YOU GO, ""BUT THE ISRAELI POLICE WENT IN AND STARTED BEATING PEOPLE UP IN A MOSQUE DURING RAMADAN, THE MOST HOLY TIME IN THE MUSLIM CALENDAR."" WELL THEN, ISRAEL IS THE BAD GUY. BUT THEN YOU GO, ""WELL THE PALESTINIANS WERE THROWING ROCKS..."" ""WELL, THE ISRAELIS WERE KICKING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR HOMES..."" ""WELL, THE INTIFADA..."" ""WELL, ISRAEL KEEPS TAKING MORE AND MORE LAND..."" ""WELL, THE ARAB INVASION..."" AND BACK AND BACK AND BACK, AMD WHO KNOWS HOW FAR. THE FIRST CAVEMEN WHO HIT EACH OTHER WITH CLUBS WERE PROBABLY ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN. I DON’T KNOW. AND, LOOK, I DON’T WANT TO HAVE THAT ARGUMENT. I DON’T WANT TO HAVE THE ARGUMENT AND THE NOISE THAT GOES BACK AND FORTH IN THIS THING, BECAUSE, HONESTLY, I DON’T THINK ANY TV SHOW IN 10 MINUTES IS GOING TO SOLVE ISRAEL-PALESTINE. TEN MINUTES ISN’T EVEN ENOUGH TIME TO EXPLAIN THE MORTAL KOMBAT"" CONFLICT. SO I’M NOT EVEN TRYING TO COME IN AND DO THAT. THE PART WHERE WE SAY WHO’S GOOD AND WHO’S BAD, OR WHO STARTED IT-- LET’S STEP AWAY FROM THAT. INSTEAD LET’S ASK A DIFFERENT QUESTION. INSTEAD, LET’S LOOK AT WHO’S DEAD AND WHO’S ALIVE THIS WEEK. IN GAZA, ISRAELI AIR STRIKES HAVE REPORTEDLY KILLED 28 PEOPLE, INCLUDING 10 CHILDREN. OVER 150 PEOPOLE HAVE BEEN WOUNDED. IN ISRAEL, HAMAS ROCKETS HAVE KILLED TWO PEOPLE. AND THIS EXCHANGE OF FIRE COMES AFTER THE ISRAELI ASSAULT IN AND AROUND THE AL AQSA MOSQUE THAT LEFT MORE THAN 600 PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS, WORSHIPERS, AND CIVILIANS WOUNDED, AND A FEW DOZEN ISRAELI POLICE. NOW, PERSONALLY-- I’M NOT SAYING FOR YOU-- JUST PERSONALLY, I CANNOT WATCH THAT FOOTAGE AND HEAR THOSE NUMBERS, AND SEE A FAIR FIGHT. SET ASIDE MOTIVES AND INTENTIONS, AND JUST LOOK AT TECHNOLOGY, TECHNOLOGY ALONE. ISRAEL HAS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARIES IN THE WORLD. THEY CAN CRUSH GAZA LIKE TA. NOT TO MENTION ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED DEFENSE SYSTEMS. YOU SHOOT A ROCKET AT THEM, IT’S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO THEM BECAUSE OF THAT DEFENSE SYSTEM. RIGHT, THEY’VE GOT A GIANT MOTUMBO IN THE SKY, JUST KNOCKING THEM DOWN. AND I KNOW, I KNOW THIS IS CONTENTIOUS, AND I KNOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HATE ME FOR THIS. BUT I JUST WANT TO ASK AN HONEST QUESTION HERE: IF YOU ARE IN A FIGHT WHERE THE OTHER PERSON CANNOT KNET YOU, HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU RETALIATE WHEN THEY TRY TO HURT YOU? IT’S AN HONEST QUESTION. I ASK THIS QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK OF IT LIKE THIS: WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER, I WOULD ALWAYS GET INTO FIGHTS WITH MY LITTLE BROTHERS. AND LITTLE KIDS CAN BE VICIOUS. THEY’RE TRYING TO PUNCH YOU IN THE LEGS. THEY’RE TRYING TO PUNCH YOU IN THE NUTS. THEY DO THAT. BUT MY MOM WOULD SAY TO ME, ""TREVOR, DON’T HIT THE KID BACK, BECAUSE THEY CAN’T HURT YOU.ñu3i IS FOUR."" AND I WAS LIKE, ""YEAH, BUT THE KID IS HITTING ME! HE COULD HURT ME!"" BUT MY MOM SAID, ""YES, BUT YOU’RE ALSO SO MUCH BIGGER THAN THE KID. YOU CAN CRUSH HIM IN AN INSTANT."" AND PLEASE DON’T GET ME WRONG, BECAUSE I KNOW SOMEONE WILL WATCH THIS AND SAY YOU’RE COMPARING PALESTINIANS TO CHILDREN. I’M NOT DOING THAT. I’M TELLING A STORY ABOUT MYSELF, HONESTLY, I AM. WHAT MY MOM MADE ME UNDERSTAND IS, AS THE PERSON WHO HAS IMMENSELY MORE POWER, I HAD TO ASK MYSELF WHETHER MY RESPONSE TO THIS CHILD WAS JUST OR NECESSARY. COULD I FIND A DIFFERENT WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS? WHETHER I FELT AGGRIEVED OR NOT, OR WHETHER THEY WERE FIGHTING FAIR WAS ALMOST IRRELEVANT. WAS I EVEN ABLE TO ASK MYSELF THE QUESTION ABOUT WHY THEY WERE DOING WHAT THEY WERE DOING? WAS I WILLING TO ADMIT GUILT. THIS IS ALL PART OF THE QUESTION I HAD TO ASK MYSELF. BUT THE MAIN QUESTION I ASK IN THIS SITUATION IS ABOUT POWER. AGAIN, I KNOW, IT’S NOT A GREAT ANALOGY BECAUSE I’M NOT SAYING PALESTINIANS ARE CHILDREN. I’M NOT SAYING THEY’RE ALL CHILDREN. I’M NOT SAYING THEY’RE HARMLESS OR IRRATIONAL OR ACTING OUT. I’M NOT SAYING ANY OF THAT. I’M NOT. I’M TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE IN POWER, WHICH IS SOMETHING WE DO ALL THE TIME. THINK ABOUT POLICING. IF A MAN HAS A KNIFE, SHOULD THE COPS SHOOT HIM? IN MANY PARTS AROUND THE WORLD, LIKE IN THE U.K., THEY SAY, ""WE’RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING TO TRY AND NOT SHOOT THE PERSON, EVEN AT RISK TO OURSELVES,"" BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY, THEY BROUGHT A KNIFE TO A GUN FIGHT. SO WHAT’S THE RIGHT RESPONSE? EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT ANSWERS TO THE QUESTION, AND I’M NOT TRYING TO ANSWER THE QUESTION NOR DO I THINK I’M SMART ENOUGH TO SOLVE IT.

33,IDj0ghd7xMs,Why the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is so complicated,"Israel and Palestine jump from crisis to crisis, but a string of deadly attacks over the past few weeks has raised fears the Holy Land is spiralling toward unrelenting bloodshed, with speculation it is on the brink of an intifada – a Palestinian uprising or, literally, a 'shaking off' of Israeli control.

The first two uprisings failed to end the occupation, with several thousand people killed, mostly Palestinians. Some believe a third intifada has already started.  

But what makes the decades-old conflict so complex? The Guardian's Jerusalem correspondent, Bethan McKernan, examines the key figures and issues at play – and looks at why experts fear peace is further away than ever.

#Israel #Palestine #GazaStrip #WestBank #Jerusalem #News",2023-03-01,433275,3498,813,UCIRYBXDze5krPDzAEOxFGVA, so when we say israeli-palestinian conflict it sounds like there are just two sides but in reality it's way more complicated than that the israeli-palestinian conflict basically encompasses four different areas there's obviously Israel the Gaza Strip there's the Westbound and East Jerusalem the history of the conflict is really long and really complicated for the last several decades there's been fighting over which people are entitled to which bits of the land but the way things currently stands the core issue is that the Israeli military occupies what we call the Palestinian territories and there are various Palestinian movements that want that to end the main players are fata the political group that is basically in charge of running the West Bank and then on the other side there is Hamas which is a islamist movement that is in charge of running the Gaza Strip so the political ideologies of fatso and Hamas are not particularly compatible which makes it difficult for there to be a kind of United Palestinian front against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories when we see occupation what that means is the Israeli military presence in the Palestinian territories daily life for Palestinians who live in these three different areas looks completely different it's much more mixed up and much more complicated than just this blank here Israel versus the Palestinians Palestinians living in East Jerusalem generally don't have Israeli citizenship so they still face a lot of difficulties in everyday life accessing services to Israel West and East Jerusalem are both part of Israel but to the Palestinians and to promote to the International Community East Jerusalem is the capital of a future Palestinian State Palestinians living in Gaza arguably have the rawest deal it's home to more than two million people people often talk about Gaza as being the world's biggest open-air prison Israel has total control of everything that comes in and out 97 of the water is undrinkable there's also been several rounds of devastating Wars that these people have had to deal with fish in the West Bank 60 is totally controlled by the Israeli military so on the other side of the conflict there's obviously Israel on paper every Israeli government for the last 30 years has said that it wants a two-state solution in reality every Israeli government has continued to build settlements home to Jewish people in the West Bank and it completely negates the possibility of a two-state solution prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has had no interest in pursuing the peace process at all the Israeli leadership is right when it says that they don't have legitimate Partners For Peace on the Palestinian side there has been very little appetite on the Palestinian side either to actually resolve the conflict for the last 15 years the actual large-scale Warfare and fighting has been concentrated on the Gaza Strip devastating rounds of war between Hamas and Israel with rocket fire on those sides it's basically impossible to predict what's going to happen in a place this complicated but we're already seeing a lot more violent incidents in the West Bank and in Israel there are worries for a lot of people that large-scale violence might not just be contained to the Gaza Strip it might be happening on a large scale the other side of the green line within Israel itself

#StartHere #AlAqsa #AlAqsaMosque #Jerusalem #Israel #Palestine #IsraelPalestineConflict #AlQuds",2023-02-01,1477918,22484,4059,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg, let's talk about one of the holiest sites in the world [Music] that's always in the news we have another session of violence here right in front of such a sensitive religious site isn't it one of the flash points that led to the 11-day conflict Israel's far-right national security minister itamar bengvir has visited the AXA mosque compound and it's a place that you need to get your head around if you want to understand what's going on between the Israelis and Palestinians foreign here's the old city and occupied East Jerusalem the place where Islam Judaism and Christianity all intersect there are several sites here that are holy to all three including this big compound that rises above everything else Jews call it the Temple mount Muslims call it al-haram al-sharif which means the noble Sanctuary or the Al-Aqsa mosque compound or sometimes just Al-Aqsa now right in the middle of everything is the Dome of the Rock it's an Islamic Shrine where Muslims believe the prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven here is the Al-Aqsa mosque itself it's got a huge prayer Hall with space for 5 000 worshipers the Alexa mosque got its name from a reference uh in the Quran that refers to a mystical night Journey that the prophet Muhammad made Rebecca to El Mezza which means the furthest mosque and that was generally understood to be in Jerusalem Jerusalem was the location of the first direction of prayer for Muslims and was later changed to Mecca because of that the Al-Aqsa mosque compound is the third holiest site in Islam after Mecca and Medina in Christianity the site matters because of its significance in the Old Testament and because Jesus would have spent time there and it's also the most holy site in Judaism it's where two ancient Jewish temples once stood the first was destroyed by the Babylonians the second stood for almost 600 years until it was destroyed by the Romans in the first century and according to Jewish teachings the mount is where a third Temple should be built when the Messiah a savior figure is sent by God now for most of the last 800 years the compound was controlled by Muslim rulers and wasn't accessible to non-muslims traditionally Jewish law actually forbids Jews from entering or praying inside the Temple Mount because it's considered so holy a place of divine presence so Jews pray outside the compound at the Western Wall which is thought to have been part of the second temple even to this day the overwhelming majority of Orthodox rabbis will say you are not allowed to visit what this means is that throughout the Millennia the Temple mount for Jews was a focus of devotion but there were no particular demands pending the coming of the Messiah all of that changed in 1967. [Music] that's when Israel seized control of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank including East Jerusalem in the Six-Day War Between the Arabs and Israelis but when it came to Al-Aqsa the Israelis stuck with an arrangement that kept something called the walk-off in charge it's an Islamic trust that's run by Jordan Jordan would retain control over the actual compound itself the Alexa mosque its custodian ship of its Administration its upkeep who could access the site who couldn't access the site uh you know pram worship and that whole Arrangement is wrapped up in this idea known as the status quo it's a Latin phrase which means the situation as it is now but in this context the status quo refers to how things are done at Al-Aqsa very simple Muslims pray non-muslims to visit or stop if I were to try and translate this into the description of a dynamic um the holy Esplanade Haram Temple mount is exclusively a place of worship for Muslims that is open to the dignified and respectful visits of non-muslims and in coordination with the autonomous authorities of the work that's the theory anyway what actually happens in practice is another thing because remember Israel occupies East Jerusalem and has a heavy security presence in the old city including at the gates of the Al-Aqsa compound so effectively it's the Israeli police not the walk-off officials who ultimately control who goes in and out although it wasn't always so explicit there was a shift in the early 2000s after the Palestinian Uprising against the Israeli occupation known as the second intifada we saw Israel then controlling not only the vicinity around the Alaska but also the unlocks the most compound itself taking control over security access and allowing increasing numbers of Jews to access the site the change in the Israeli perspective is we're not your guests we're here a landlord and we're going to show you that we're your landlord and what we're seeing is Israel increasingly exercising that control and more and more accusations that they're breaking the agreed conventions of the status quo so there are lots of ways that the status quo has been violated restrictions uh on Muslim warship which is something that the Israeli occupation imposes quite frequently sometimes age restrictions usually limiting men of a certain age from entering the site if they feel that there may be protests or or something happening we're all set seeing more Jewish prayer whether it's silent but slowly it's becoming much more of that now [Music] there is Jewish prayer I've seen it daily uh but beyond that there is a triumphalism an ultra-national triangleism which is perceived as a violation of the sanctity of the site by Muslim worshipers and people in the Muslim world the backdrop to all of this is the growing power of far-right groups and religious hardliners in Israel for example there is the Temple Mount movement that's been around for decades it brings together a range of groups who want to overturn the status quo throughout the years that Fringe uh became less of a fringe and during the 1980s and the 1990s began to go mainstream and today it is not only not a fringe it is in power so you've got people like the new national security minister it's Amar bengaver who entered the Al-Aqsa compound after only a few days on the job he says the arrangements that limit Jewish access are racist it's one thing to have a non-governmental entity or groups of individuals go but when you have ministers going up to the site it's it's very different he was effectively asserting what he had promised during his campaign uh during the Electoral run-up which was Jewish Supremacy and sovereignty over all of Israel that's why what Ben Geer did was so provocative lots of countries condemned it the U.N security Council called a special session about it because there's always the fear of how quickly things can escalate when it comes to Alexa [Music] like in the early 2000s when a visit by the then opposition leader Ariel Sharon triggered the second into fada [Applause] [Music] [Applause] anyone when Israeli forces stormed Al-Aqsa Moss during Ramadan it all spiraled and led to an 11-day Israeli War on Gaza thank you our mission is both an explosive but it is even more a Detonator and with the climatic conditions are correct what happens on the mount can make the region uh erupt in Flames I'll access such a powerful symbol so what happens there takes on an even bigger Dimension and for Palestinians it's become emblematic of their wider struggle the constant chipping away of their rights their land and their identity didn't get to 700 000 Israeli settlers in the occupied territories overnight it happened house by house Brick by Brick Road by Road settlement by settlement and so that's what's happening with the status quo it's being eroded bit by bit it is a slow piecemeal process that the International Community generally tolerates the Israeli governments haven't faced any real costs or repercussions for those actions and so it's that impune D that allows them to kind of keep pushing the envelope further each time

He is based in Philadelphia.",2023-11-09,857641,21551,3729,UCvQECJukTDE2i6aCoMnS-Vg," - You can't have this
conversation on CNN or Fox. You can't do it, right? Because if you are only talking about how the Israeli Defense
Forces are responsible for these brutal killings, or if you're only talking about what Hamas did on October 7th, and you don't talk about the
broader context, right, you are absolutely not understanding
what's happening in this war right now. - Today on Big Think, we're
gonna be talking to Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Eurasia Group and GZERO Media about
the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel. Ian, thank you so much
for joining us today. - It's great to be back with Big Think. - This region has been embroiled
in turmoil for thousands of years, so there's many historical factors we could discuss. But I would like to know
from your standpoint, is it more helpful to
focus on recent history to better understand this conflict? - Both the Jews and the
Palestinians have long, long running and legitimate claims to live on this territory. Palestinians, some 700,000 plus were kicked off these territories after 1948 post-Holocaust. The Jews had lived on these
territories for millennia, and a number of empires
have kicked them off. We can talk about that. There are people that are far
more expert on those histories than I am, but the reality
is that for the Jews and the Palestinians that are
fighting over this land today, they've been living there
for their lifetimes and, and so it's really not
about who has a right to live on the territory. It's rather that they need to find a way to live together in peace. And what has happened over
the past years is that everyone in the world
has basically given up on finding a peaceful solution because they've tried for
decades, it's too hard or because they're not interested; they have other things that
they would rather do. That's where we are today. The last time that the Americans who are not an honest broker
for peace in the region, the United States, a principle
ally in the entire Middle East is Israel. So you can't say, ""Oh, well,
you know, they're the ones that can broker peace between
Israel and the Palestinians, because they're equally trusted."" That's not true. But they do
have the dominant military presence in the region, and
they also have the dominant diplomatic capability on the region. So they've been the ones that have played the
most significant role. And the last time an
American senior diplomat was really invested on trying to
figure out a way to bring peace to this region was when
John Kerry was Secretary of State in the first couple of years of the Obama administration. And he did shuttle diplomacy
between the Israelis, the Palestinians, the Jordanians,
the Egyptians, I mean, all the time, for 18 months this was his top priority. He wanted a Nobel Peace
Prize for it. He failed. And after that, basically
the Americans gave up. It was the pivot to Asia. It was no longer focusing
as much on the Middle East. And then when the Russians
invade Ukraine, it's focusing on Europe too. But no one's spending real
time on the Palestinians, the Gulf States, who had
been providing so much money for humanitarian support for Palestinians living in the West Bank, and particularly Gaza, as well
as refugees in other places that they were saying
there could be no peace in the Middle East unless
the Palestinian-Israel issue is resolved. Well, it turned out they were willing to make peace with Israel. They're, they're willing to engage open diplomatic
relations, allow Jewish tourists to come to their country, trade and investment, technology
cooperation, security cooperation. But what about the Palestinians? Well, too hard to resolve, and Israel, and particularly this far-right, Netanyahu-led government has been
willing to not only expand illegally, the settlements
in the West Bank, reducing the territory that the
Palestinians can live on, and making it harder for them
to get to work, go to school, you know, have a possibility
for a viable future. But also, Netanyahu's
government was engaging more with Hamas in Gaza at the expense of the Palestinian authority, because they never wanted to
pursue a two-state solution. So they forgot about the Palestinians too. So when you look at
everyone around the world that was committed to the
Palestinians, finding a way to live viably on their territories, the answer is this has not
been a priority for anyone for a long, long time. And their own government
in the West Bank that recognizes Israel's right to
exist, as opposed to Hamas, which does not, they were corrupt. They were divided. They couldn't speak for
Palestinians in Gaza, and they were being weakened
by the Israeli government. So, I mean, this was a long introduction to talk about the history, but the point is that if
you are looking for people that are responsible, historically, for why we are in the
mess that we are in today, and it is an unholy mess, and I use that term very
literally, you know, you can look everywhere and you have people to blame that that is where we are today. - Thank you for that. I'm,
I'm curious, you know, to talk about some of the
domestic politics within Israel, because that's something that
I think has not been paid enough attention to and specifically the actions
of the Netanyahu government and the people who they are
partnering with as it relates to this conflict, but also just
internally inside of Israel. What does it look like in
terms of the partnerships and the dynamics that are happening there? What has been the lead up
to this conflict in terms of the internal politics with Israel, and how has that had an
effect on just the general relationship between Israel and the Palestinians
in the various places? - You know, Israel is a
very political society. The average Israeli citizen reads a lot about news and politics. If you go to a cafe in
Tel Aviv or in Jerusalem or Herzliya, you're gonna hear a lot of people talking about politics. It's also a very fragmented society. There are a lot of
different political parties. And, and in order to get a government
together in the Knesset, you can't govern by yourself because you'd never get a majority. You have to find a coalition
with other partners. And Netanyahu, who has,
you know, faced all sorts of internal corruption scandals and, and who's Likud party
has also been painted with a lot of those challenges. The only way he could form
a government this last time around was with a hard-right group. A party that specifically
has, you know, said some of the most horrible things about wanting Palestinians removed from
the West Bank, about wanting to take over their territories. In some ways, the hard-right partners of Netanyahu have been as unyielding and aggressive about the
Palestinians not having rights in the occupied territories as Hamas has been about the Jews not having the right to have an Israeli state. Now, that does not reflect the opinions of the Israeli people as a
whole, but it has meant that before the events of October 7th, the terrorist events against
the people of Israel, you had enormous domestic instability. That domestic instability
was the people of Israel revolting against Netanyahu, attempting to change a very strong,
independent judiciary of that country to basically
report to the executive and report to whoever was
in charge in the Knesset. And the reason for that,
more control for Netanyahu and his coalition, and the
ability to avoid getting charged and jailed for these corruption scandals and investigations that are ongoing. And, and for months, the news
in Israel had nothing to do with Hamas, had nothing to do with the Palestinians in Gaza. It instead was about a
potential constitutional crisis that was pending in Israel,
that Israel's legitimacy as a democracy in the Middle
East was under threat, not because of what they were
doing to the Palestinians, but because of what Netanyahu
was doing to the country, to the balance of power in Israel. So that was, they were taking
their eye off the ball. The other thing that happened
is the hard-right part of the Israeli government
was doing everything possible to expand their territorial
influence in the West Bank. And the Palestinians
living there were angry and there were a lot of clashes. There were violent reprisals. And the Israeli Defense Forces some of the best in the world, incredibly well-trained high
morale, while a lot of them had been sent to the West Bank and to the border zone inside
Israel proper in an effort to contain and respond to that violence. Where were they in Gaza?
Not worried about Gaza. Netanyahu was providing Hamas in Gaza with more resources, with
more money, with more ability to have work visas to
come on over into Israel. Why? Because they were
just focused on governance. According to Netanyahu, they
just wanted to rebuild Gaza 'cause he wanted a stronger Hamas to weaken the Palestinian authority. So what happened is you
took one of the world's best-trained, most
effective defense forces, intelligence forces, security
forces, border forces, and, and you had them focusing on everything but a terrorist organization
that was running Gaza with a people that had abysmal economic conditions, life
conditions, half of them without enough food to eat, 90% of them without access to clean water. And everyone is now talking about how Israel has a right to self-defense. They have a right to be able
to defend their borders. And that is absolutely true. But that right did not
begin after October 7th. That right existed before October 7th. And the Prime Minister of Israel and his hard-right government
failed the Israeli people. They did not defend their country, they didn't defend their borders. They weren't concerned with or focused on the real
threats that were right there just on the south of Israel,
that wanted to destroy everything that the Israeli
people have been building since 1948. So the Israeli people want Netanyahu out. They overwhelmingly blame him and his government for
the events of October 7th, consistently in polls taken inside Israel. In fact, one of the only things that the Middle Eastern
peoples can agree on in, in this conflict is that
the Israeli Prime Minister and his government need to go,
that they, that they are not fit for office either to govern Israel and defend Israel, or to engage and create peace with the Palestinians. - You know, it's interesting
to bring up the government of Israel and how people are perceiving their
actions in the lead up to, and even just in the response
of the October 7th attack, I'm curious, you know, to bring it to the surrounding nations and their relationship with Israel. And, you know, you
mentioned how the treatment of Palestinians has taking a back seat to sort of recent concerns. I'm, I'm curious if you
can paint a broader picture of just like what types of
relationships has been happening with, between Israel and other nations, other Arab
nations that surround them, and how the concerns of the Palestinians have just
not been the forefront of the discussions between those parties. - No, they, they have not. And to be fair, I mean, the fact that the Palestinians have not been diplomatically important to,
for example, the Gulf States or, or even to countries like Jordan and Egypt that have been more
willing to engage with Israel as the Palestinian plight has
become worse, there has been a lot of effort to bring
aid, humanitarian support in for the Palestinians and the Gulf states who are very wealthy, have been providing a lot of that. But when the Israeli government, after the events
of October 7th started engaging in widespread
bombardment across Gaza, which has led to thousands and thousands of casualties:
civilian casualties, children, almost 50% of the Gaza
population are children, right? I mean, this is now being
seen across the region, and it is impossible for any
government of the region, any Arab government of the
region to just sit and stand by and say, ""Okay, we don't care. We're still gonna work with Israel. The way we were working with
them."" Israel had benefited from being seen as an economic juggernaut, a security juggernaut, a technological juggernaut. And a lot of the countries
in the region wanted to work more closely with
Israel as a consequence of that. That's why you had the UAE and Bahrain and Morocco signing the
Abraham Accords, not just to normalize diplomatic relations, but also to dramatically expand trade and investment with Israel. That's why the Saudis were
improving their informal relations and were moving
towards normalization. Even though the Saudi population is going to be quite cautious and conservative on the
Palestinian issue, they say, ""No, the priority is we gotta find a way to work with Israel."" But once you have Israel in
response to these terrorist acts going after Hamas, and as they're doing so killing all of these Palestinian civilians, well then there's a freeze on
everything; then if you are, you know, Jordan, you
say, ""We can't work with, we can't engage with
Israel going forward."" If you're Turkey, Turkish
President Erdogan, who has said that Hamas is not a terrorist
organization, he has said that Hamas is a liberation movement, and he hasn't condemned the Hamas from the hostages that've taken from the 1,400 civilians that they killed. Not at all. So they've thrown out the Israeli diplomats
on the ground as well. And when that's happening
across the region and the Arab Street is
demonstrating in solidarity with the Palestinians, then
even if you have a number of wealthier Arab countries
that want to continue to work with Israel, they can't because
of the domestic pressure. And, and so the, the efforts that had made Israel the
strongest, geopolitically, that had had ever been,
since independence, suddenly are moving in a very different
direction, it's, it's hard for those countries to even
maintain present levels of engagement with Israel. And indeed, a lot of the progress that had been made could be lost. So it's very interesting. You have an environment where before the acts of October 7th, Israel was the most divided domestically because of the response to Netanyahu, but the strongest in the region. Then the events of October 7th happen, and suddenly Israel is enormously unified. Everyone is responding. You get a, a unity war cabinet because everyone says,
we must defeat Hamas. We must destroy these terrorists that have just threatened our homeland and have killed our children. Right? And, but the international
environment from Israel has suddenly become one of massive criticism and condemnation. And that is clearly true
in its immediate region. It is clearly true for
Iran, which continues along with Hamas to believe that, that the Jewish people in the state of Israel should be
replaced with Palestine. But that's also true
for all of the proxies of Iran across the region,
the Shia proxies in Yemen and in Iraq, in Syria. It's true across the global
South where we have governments that are outraged and coming after Israel, and even for the United States, which is by far the strongest ally
of Israel in the world. You have significant pressure, especially among young people, and especially among Democrats in Congress saying, ""We can no longer provide
the kind of support that we have historically
given what's happening presently on the ground."" So domestically in Israel,
much more cohesive and stronger and resilient; internationally,
much more fragmented and, and much more challenging for the Israelis going forward. - I'm curious, you know, to think about this situation in regards to what Hamas' motivation was for the attack. And so do you think that
there was a strategic goal of the Hamas attack on October 7th? And was this in a way,
setting a trap for Israel? And if so, was it successful? Was this outcome of
people turning the tide of opinion against Israel
internationally, part of a strategic goal for
Hamas when doing this attack? - It's very hard to
say that Hamas actually expected the kind of success that they experienced on October 7th. There were some 2,000 Hamas fighters, terrorists
that managed to get across one of the most well-defended
borders with some of the best intelligence out there. Human intelligence, signals
intelligence managed to get across the border, kill Israelis with reckless abandon, and capture some 250 hostages and bring them back into Gaza. I have a hard time
believing that Hamas expected that they would have that kind of success, that they would be able to kill more Jews in one day
than had happened anywhere in the world since the Holocaust. I have a hard time with that. I think it, it turned
out that Netanyahu and the Israeli government
was dramatically weaker and less focused on defense than Hamas could have anticipated, because the level of
success that Hamas has had is a death sentence for those leaders and for those fighters, I mean,
there is really no choice. There is no one in the
Israeli political leadership, the entire spectrum from left
to right that would say, ""Oh, we can now leave Hamas intact. We've hit him for a few
weeks. And that's enough."" I mean, the idea that Israel, after what they experienced on
October 7th would, would have a few weeks of attacks, but then could still
live neighboring to Gaza, which is being run and
controlled by Hamas- no country in the world
would live with that. And let's also remember that
the people that were killed by Hamas, the people
that are hostages, those that are Israeli, by
the way, these are not, this isn't a settler population. This isn't a hard-right population. This was a progressive population. These were the people in Israel that were most interested in making peace with the Palestinians. And so you now have a
situation where people that I know, friends of mine in
Israel that I would consider to be very thoughtful,
moderate politically, that are saying,
""I wanna level this place. I wanna make it a parking lot."" Not not differentiating
between Hamas fighters and Palestinian civilians and Palestinian women and children. That, that, I mean, to you
and I that sounds insane, but, but on the back of what the Israelis have just
experienced, that is the emotion that is coming out. And so I don't think that Hamas expected that they were going to
have that kind of success, but I absolutely believe
that Hamas' efforts to defend themselves, and when I say themselves,
I don't mean the Palestinian people, I mean just the
fighters and the leadership; they do that by attempting to get the Israeli Defense Forces to kill Palestinian innocents, to kill civilians. And what we have now seen for a month has been extraordinary
brutality and violence. And we have seen refugee
camps and hospitals and schools and United
Nations aid workers blown to pieces by Israeli Defense Forces. And the Israeli Defense
Forces are the ones that are pulling the trigger. They are the ones that
are bombing these people. And now there's a ground war. They're the ones that are
on the ground as well. But it is Hamas that is
operating on the ground with tunnels underneath those targets. It is Hamas that has their missiles and their commanders in
residential buildings and right next to playgrounds
and right next to hospitals and even shooting out of mosques. Now they know exactly what they're doing. They're not just holding 200 plus Israelis and other civilians hostage illegally, but they're also holding large numbers of Palestinian civilians hostage. And so the Israelis, yes,
the Israeli Defense Forces are responsible when they are killing lots and lots of Palestinian
civilians to get at one, two, or three militants. But Hamas is also deeply responsible for making the only way that
Israel can kill terrorists to ensure that large numbers of Palestinian civilians also die. That they are not just
fighting Israel militarily because they will lose badly if they fight Israel militarily. They are fighting in the
court of public opinion. They are fighting an information war, and they are using disinformation. We have seen this play
out over four weeks, and there aren't that many
Jews around the world. There are a lot more Muslims. And so if, if Hamas is able to get out all of this information
that says, ""Look at all of these Palestinian kids
that the Israelis are killing,"" and they don't say anything about how Hamas is also putting them at risk, well then they're going
to look a lot stronger. And is that a trap for Israel? Absolutely. That's a trap for Israel. Absolutely. That makes Israel weaker and more vulnerable than the
geopolitical position they were in on October 6th. I mean, that strong position
of Israel with the countries of the region working with
them, that's a direct threat to the future of Hamas. That's a direct threat to their being able to drive their agenda to undermine Israel, to remove Israel from the region. So, and, and the, the problem is that you can't have this
conversation on CNN or Fox. You can't do it because
it's the headlines. And, and so, you know, know
you can do a minute of it, you can do two minutes of it, then you move on to the next thing. It, if you are only talking about how the Israeli Defense
Forces are responsible for these brutal killings, or if you're only talking about what Hamas did on October 7th, and you don't talk about the
broader context, right, you are absolutely not understanding
what's happening in this war right now. - I'm interested in talking about disinformation and misinformation. You mentioned that as part of your answer to the previous question. I'm, I'm curious what you think
the role digital media plays in this conflict, both being
a vehicle for disinformation, but also being a vehicle
for accurate, on-the-ground information about what's happening. - It has become increasingly
difficult for anyone to get good, valuable information on social media, on Israel-Palestine, the number of accounts
that if you look not at one post, but if then
you go back into the account and say, ""Okay, what are they presenting? Are they actually presenting the news because it's being put out as if they're presenting the news? There's a headline that
you need to focus on,"" then you realize, wait a second, this entire account is only
focusing on the suffering of Jews, or this entire
account is only focusing on the suffering of Palestinians. I, I would wager that
that is the vast majority of the social media
verified, algorithmically promoted accounts that
people are presently digesting on this conflict. And by definition, that is disinformation because it is not interested
in understanding the entirety of what's going on. The one thing that we know
for certain is that the level of suffering that has occurred
on the ground for Jews and for Palestinians over
the last four weeks is unlike almost anything that's been experienced by anyone watching this video right now. And yet you would never feel
that way if you were digesting the accounts that are
driving most of the media in social platforms. So fundamentally, this
is a disinformation-rich and dominant environment. Some of that is assertively fake news. Some of that is assertively filtered and promote programmed news
that only gets you one piece, one side of the story. And God forbid you say
something that is more nuanced, that doesn't align fully with what either or both of those sides are promoting. They come after you and
they say it's fake news. They come after you and
they call for violence. They call to dox you, they'll call for, there'll be death threats. And I've seen this with almost
everyone I know that's trying to have a more civil,
a more focused, decent, grounded human conversation. This is nothing like what people are like in the
real world, in the real world- everyone understands
that they're both people. In fact, they come from the same part of the world, they're family. But you couldn't, you wouldn't get that- and if you were on social media. Now, I wanna, I wanna be
clear that when you say that something is not black or white, that doesn't
mean everything is the same shade of gray. I mean, we, we can all
admit that, you know, Hamas targeting civilians is not the same thing as Israel targeting the military, but also killing a lot of civilians. We can also both agree that both of those are deeply problematic compared to not having any civilians die. We know that we, we also know
that the economic conditions that Palestinians are living
under in Gaza are radically worse than those of
Palestinians in the West Bank, which are radically worse than those of Jews living in Israel. That's context. Those are
not equal shades of gray, but it's not black or white. There is no space for that on
social media. There's none. Social media is dehumanizing.
It is hate-inducing. And it is actively preventing people from getting good information and from talking to each other. What we need is less social media. We need more long-form content. We need more person-to-person engagement. We need more community,
more schools, more family. We, we need more humanity.
Algorithms are not humanity. Algorithms are programmed
by business models that are productizing people for profit. And it just so happens that
the process of doing that is more, is facilitated more directly through very, very strong emotions that, that
that is what we have today. But that is the opposite
from what we need if we want to understand and if we want to resolve
this Israel-Gaza war. - I would love to just do
a quick follow up on that 'cause you know, one of the
things that I found interesting as a dynamic was certainly
when there was the, the hospital bombing
that happened in Gaza, and there was a rush of
reports that said Israel was to blame for that attack. And then following up, there was a lot of what seemed like open source
intelligence reporting that said that that might
not have been the case. How do you take an example like that where a legacy institution
like the New York Times and some other institutions
reported something that ended up being walked back in terms of the truthfulness of the statement. How do you weigh that with what
you were just talking about in terms of social media? - Information warfare. This was the New York Times,
it was the Wall Street Journal, so it wasn't just left
or right, it was both, they both have a lot of journalists that are very professional
and they do very solid work, but they were getting their
real-time information from social media from the region, and it was a
disinformation-rich environment. And so you see these blaring headlines, and it's the middle of the
night when this hospital is hit and no one has good information. You don't have journalists that
are on the ground that are, that are real-time reporting to you. So they're getting that
information secondhand from journalists on the ground. And most of those journalists are getting that information from Hamas sources. And so they said: ""A hospital
is hit. 500 people are dead. And it was an Israeli
missile that hit them."" And it turned out that
all three of those pieces of information were false. It was a hospital parking lot was hit, far fewer people were killed, though a lot of people were killed. And it was not an Israeli Defense Forces missile that hit them. But by that point, the
story had already went out to everyone who wanted to believe that, and they ran with it. And not just the journalists
that are more supportive of the Palestinian than the Israeli cause, but also the governments in the
region who condemned Israel, the governments of the region who decided they weren't
gonna meet with Biden, the Palestinian authority,
the Jordanian, the Egyptians as Biden was meeting with Netanyahu. Now this was absolutely
essential at a time that the United States was
sending its President to try to find a way to, to
stabilize this environment. And they, they probably would've failed, but they're much more likely
to fail if they can only talk to Israel and they can't
talk to the other side. And, and they failed because
of Hamas misinformation. The, this was happening to a lesser degree in the early stages of
the Russia-Ukraine war, but it was happening
much more successfully by the Ukrainians who almost everyone in
the world supported. So you'll remember there
was this Snake Island attack and you had, you know,
this, this news report that was put out and promoted
by the Ukrainian military and the government that showed
that there were, you know, people on the ground and the Russians demanded that they surrender, they refused. They, they used an obscenity and the Russians blew
them all up and they died. And they were seen as
heroes all over the world, except it never happened. No one was killed on Snake Island. The people were captured
and they were released. And that got a little
bit of news weeks later, but the purpose was already
served: equal disinformation. Everyone ran with that story. The New York Times, the Wall
Street Journal, they ran with that story, but it didn't
have as much of an impact because everyone was
sympathetic to Ukraine anyway. And it wasn't going to change. Whether it happened or
didn't happen wasn't going to change the outcome.
In this circumstance, early fog of war, but there was massive,
massive disagreement over like who you wanted to
sympathize with and right, because a lot of people are sympathetic to the Palestinians who've
historically had a much, much harder situation, and the Israelis are more powerful- but then a lot of people are
really sympathetic to Israel because of the terrorist
attack against all of them. So there's a lot to play for. And the fact that Hamas had that meaningfully successful
disinformation in the early moments of the war was a
really big win for them. Either way, the point is the same, that we are no longer fighting a war that is only on the
ground with the success or not of who's winning militarily. So much more of the fight
is being determined by who is able to drive
real-time disinformation with the headlines in social media. - Israel has launched a
ground defensive in Gaza. Do you believe such actions
will make Israel safer, or do you believe it could
have the opposite effect? - My view is that Israel
has every right to want to destroy Hamas as an organization. But we are talking about
30 to 40,000 fighters. And Hamas is, you know, they are, they're absolutely
integrated in the firmament of civilian society across Gaza. And you may remember that in
the early days of the war, Israel said that they were going to do a siege on all of Gaza. So not just Hamas, because you
can't have a siege on Hamas. Instead it was 2.3 million people: We're not getting you food,
we're not getting you water, we're not getting you fuel, we're not getting you medication. And you know that that is going to cause massive humanitarian tragedy. But that was the Israeli response. And my response to that is,
""You don't wanna do that."" That is, you know, that's
gonna create war crimes and so you need to get humanitarian aid. And finally they got some
men, but nowhere near enough. Then as they're bombing and they're bombing all sorts of targets. And as I said, it's not just
fighting against Hamas on the ground, it's also fighting
information warfare. They hit an ambulance. Now that ambulance, it
looks like it was being used by Hamas fighters. But if you've got videos that are showing that the Israelis are
hitting an ambulance, what is Hamas gonna say? What are people gonna run with? It's, ""Look, they're,
they're hitting ambulances."" So you can't, it's not just
what's happening on the ground, it's also how what's happening
on the ground is perceived. So now you have a ground war and that ground war is
going to lead to far, far more Palestinian
civilians getting killed. And it's happening before large numbers of
civilians can get out. The Israeli government has
been, they've sent leaflets, they've warned everyone,
you've gotta evacuate, but they're telling people
to evacuate into the south before there's adequate
food or water or fuel or medicine for those people in the south before there are adequate
refugee camps set up for those people in the South. So who's gonna leave?
How many people will go? And of course, Hamas is also preventing some of them from leaving. It's hard to do. So my
point is, Israel has time. There is an urgent desire
to get rid of Hamas, but the Israelis are now
laser-focused on their border of security in a way that
their government was not before October 7th. They are laser-focused on air defense. They're laser-focused
on sea defense in a way that they were not before October 7th. So my point is, spend more time not just on how you're
going to blow up Hamas, but also on building your information war on building your
relations with other countries. If the, if you're losing
support from the United States because you refuse to allow
in aid for the Palestinians, then you need to spend more time sending in aid with the Palestinians. If you're losing the Europeans, it's, Ukraine has been in a
much stronger position because the entire West
was standing with Ukraine. The entire West is not
standing with Israel. And in part that's because
the Israeli war cabinet has refused to allow in the aid. They've refused to provide
adequate, safe zones for the Palestinians to be
able to, to, to spend time, to get to and to live as families. That's a huge problem. So I believe that ultimately
the Israelis will be safer if they spend more time
working with their allies and developing a multilateral response. Nobody out there from the West believes that Israel should leave Hamas alone. Nobody believes that there
should be a permanent ceasefire and they don't have the
right to defend themselves. That's not the argument. The argument has been
for a humanitarian pause. The argument has been
for a temporary ceasefire that allows far more
Palestinians to have the ability to live and to live safely
because the future of Israel and peace in the region depends not just on Israel destroying Hamas, but also depends on the
ability to create conditions for peace between Israel and the Palestinians in
Gaza and the West Bank. And yes, there are some
in Netanyahu's government that have no interest in that. Those people will be out of
government after the war. The Israelis do not want them anymore. Do not trust them anymore. But, but you can't be, Israel will not be
successful if they fight this war by themselves. They will not be successful
if by destroying Hamas, they also destroy the
conditions for long-term peace with the Palestinian people. We all know that when Israel was fighting against the PLO and they removed them from Lebanon, they ended up with Hezbollah- that's not better. When the
Americans fought against Saddam Hussein and destroyed the Ba'ath
party in Iraq, they ended up with the Islamic state- that's not better. So if Israel
is going to destroy Hamas, but they don't create
the conditions for peace with the Palestinian people, they will end up with something worse. So I am not suggesting that
Israel should say, ""Okay, okay, okay, let's, we'll just
make peace with Hamas."" They can't, that's not doable. No one in Israel would support that. But they have to also
create conditions for peace with the Palestinians
that will live there 'cause they're not
going anywhere. The idea among some in
Netanyahu's government, and by the way, far too
many, that what really needs to happen is you need the
Palestinians to leave. They need to, to go to
Egypt, to the Sinai, and maybe never come back, that they need to take more territory and let the settlers just,
you know, sort of grab up all of the West Bank and the
Palestinians can go to Jordan- they won't be Israel's problem anymore. That is not a viable solution. The Palestinians won't stand for it. The Egyptians won't stand for it. The Jordanians won't stand for it. The Gulf states won't stand for it. And these are countries that
are not fundamentally Israel's enemies, but they will not tolerate it. So Israel must, must, must- at the same time they are
trying to destroy Hamas- they must create conditions for peace for the Palestinian people. And my concern about a ground war today on the ground in Gaza, is that they are creating the conditions to destroy Hamas without
creating the conditions for peace after Hamas. - The United States and Israel have been allies for a long time. What effect are you seeing
from the U.S. continuing to support Israel, and how could that play a role in the
future of U.S. politics? - I would say that Biden
could not be more supportive of Israel following the
October 7th attacks. His immediate decision
to make a trip there, the shuttle diplomacy by Secretary of State Blinken in
particular, the willingness of the U.S.
government to stay as long as the United States exists, that Israel will never
have to stand alone. Those are enormously powerful statements and they are statements that
are clearly shared in a broad and bipartisan way in the United States. But Generation Z, young people in the U.S. support the Palestinian position more strongly than they support Israel. And you have seen that
particularly on college campuses across the country, but also more broadly and many on the progressive
wing of the Democratic party. And I'm not just talking about
""the Squad"" and Rashida Tlaib and AOC I'm talking more
broadly are in increasingly, deeply uncomfortable with the extent of the Israeli military strikes against Hamas and the Palestinian
civilians in Gaza. All of the, all
of the human destruction that we are all witnessing right now. And President Biden has made it clear to the Israeli war
cabinet that the ability of the United States
to continue to provide unconstrained support
for Israel is a window that will narrow if the present levels of atrocities continue. So the conditions for peace are not just
about making sure the Palestinians have an opportunity to live, they're also about making sure
the Americans can continue to support Israel the way
they have here to fore. I think it is not guaranteed that in another four weeks time, the U.S. will still be
willing to provide the kind of military equipment,
high-tech, military equipment and support that they
have provided to Israel, historically, if Israel continues to fight the war the way
they have been fighting it, even the United States,
Biden and his cabinet and core members of Senate
in the house are facing that pressure from their
own progressive wing- and that is going to grow over time. I also think that this is
a risk for Biden in 2024 because this war right
now is primarily about Gaza and Hamas. But there are American carrier
strike groups in the Eastern med. and in the Gulf. They've already been
involved in direct strikes against Iranian Shia proxies in Syria. There will surely be more of those strikes in the coming weeks. American servicemen and women
have already taken casualties, not deaths, not so far,
but actually injured troops because of the knock-on impact of the war between Israel and Hamas. So if it turns out that the United States is
directly involved in a Middle Eastern war, that Biden has not
sold to the American people- he hasn't justified- you go from no wars started
under the Trump administration to two wars started under
the Biden administration. Neither of them started by Biden, but both of them, the American
taxpayers are paying for, and one of which the Americans
might be taking casualties. That is a very hard thing to run on if you are President Biden. And they know it. It also, the distraction of the Middle East and President Zelensky of Ukraine has just been
saying this has made it harder for people to focus on the
continued support for Ukraine, especially given a
counteroffensive that has failed. So you now have these two
massive global foreign policy crises both of which
are not looking so great for the United States
as we head into 2024. I, I expect that Trump, when he becomes the Republican nominee, and that certainly looks
very likely at this point, will make a meal out of that. That is a vulnerability
for the United States and Biden knows it. So this is very much not
just about the Middle East. This has implications for the
U.S. more broadly and globally. - A lot of people are viewing this as potentially a precursor to something like we would
see in World War III. What do you think are the factors that are keeping the
situation from escalating to a global conflict? And do you think it could
potentially escalate to a bigger conflict that involves a lot more
parties like the United States and potentially some other parties both in the region and globally? - We have seen that the
Iranian President has, and the Supreme Leader have
both said things publicly that imply that the world will burn because of what the
Israelis are doing in Gaza, but they use the passive voice. They are, they are very
careful not to say, ""We Iran will do X, Y, and Z."" They'll say, ""These are the
impacts that it will have."" These are, these are clearly
statements that are meant to put Iran at a distance
from direct involvement and engagement, even though
the Iranians are the ones that have provided weapons and
training and money for Hamas and for Israel's principle
enemies in the region. We've seen that from Lebanon. Nasrallah, Hassan Nasrallah who runs
Hezbollah, gave a really big and very strongly anticipated
speech where he said, ""You guys go Hamas,
you're doing a great job."" But certainly did not in any way imply that Hezbollah is going to
be out there fighting for and opening a second
front as a consequence of what Israel is doing
on the ground in Gaza. So, so far I would say we're four weeks in the likelihood of
expansion is significant, but nobody sees World War III coming anytime soon. What we have is an
expansion of Israel's fight against Hamas, and that means that we're
gonna see a lot, a lot, a lot more casualties. And as that happens, Israel will be under more
international pressure, there will be more antisemitism, there'll be more attacks against Jews, there will be more Islamophobia, there'll be more attacks against Muslims, there'll be more one-off
nuisance strikes against American bases in the region. There'll be more American
strikes against proxies of Iran. That is an expansion
of the war beyond Gaza. It is not a regional war. What we need to watch out
for for a regional war is that number one, Iran has influence over, but not operational control
over its proxies in the region. And as the war in Gaza gets bloodier, and if it looks like Hamas is really, truly losing everything that they have, there are others in the region
that may well be willing to fight and escalate against Israel and against Americans in
the region irrespective of what Iran does or does not say to them. So you can easily have farther escalation by those organizations themselves. The Shia militants
in Iraq, in Syria, the Houthis in Yemen in particular, they could also engage in strikes into the Straits of Hormuz. They could hit oil tankers that
could increase energy prices and create a global recession. Again, that would hurt
Biden very dramatically. We also, so far, thank God, have not seen significant lone
wolf terror attacks against Americans inside the United
States or in the region. We've already heard
from the head of the FBI and from others that that threat assessment is
higher than they've seen at any point post-9/11. That's a real concern. Obviously that's
something that can happen. If it does, the Americans
are gonna need to respond. So I, I don't think we
are anywhere close to out of the woods on this one. And I, while I'm, I'm deeply concerned about
people out there talking about World War III because I
really don't see that as a, you know, sort of proximate
risk, the likelihood that this can escalate in ways
that none of the actors want to see, but can happen anyway- I think that's a very real possibility. - This question comes from a
subscriber in our Big Think membership community. Is there a two-state solution
that ensures the rights of Palestinians as well as the
security interests of Israel? - I cannot see any environment where we have peace in
the region without a two- or three-state solution. Whether, you know, you have the Palestinians governed in the same way with the same institutions in Gaza and the West Bank are separate. I don't know. But clearly, the Palestinians must have the ability to live in peace on land that
they can defend and govern. Now we are nowhere close to that, but I think it was Henry
Kissinger that said that the time you get peace is
when both sides are exhausted. And he's someone that knows
a lot about fighting wars and war crimes, frankly, but also knows a lot
about negotiating peace. And I do think that we are oddly closer to a two-state solution today
than we were on October 6th. And the reason for that is because everyone in this region and with equities in this
region now understand that you can no longer
ignore the Palestinian issue. Or if you do, it's at your peril. So yes, the, we're still in a time of war and it's gonna get worse
before it gets better. But as we come out of this
war, the level of demand for finding a route for peace
between the Palestinians and the Israelis will
be far more prioritized. Much more capital will be expended on trying to make that happen. Some of that will be
humanitarian resources to try to rebuild Gaza. Some of that will be diplomatic
resources to try to come up with what a new Palestinian authority for Gaza might look like. Who would those people be and how would you build
such an administration? But you know, of course the more suffering we see in the coming weeks and months, I mean, if
you're already talking about half a percent of the
Palestinian population in Gaza is dead since October 7th; one of every 200
Palestinians in Gaza dead- and those numbers are going up. I don't know exactly
what those numbers are. They fight between the United Nations and between like, you know,
the Gaza Health Ministry, which is Hamas and you can't trust them, but the numbers are big. We know the numbers are big. Like every one of those
civilian deaths is going to make it harder to
get from here to there, right? We've already suffered the pain and tragedy to know that we need to move to a two-state solution. We know that. But the damage that you
can do to make that much, much harder and longer
term with the suffering that will be remembered for generations and generations, that is
a very different story. - Ian, thank you so
much for your time today and for the insights you're able to provide the Big Think
audience about this ongoing and complicated conflict. - It's great to be back with you. - If you found this conversation with Ian Bremmer valuable, we
would love to hear from you. Please respond with your feedback
in the comments about the format and the types of guests or topics you would like
to see in the future. Thanks so much for watching."

happened post 1948 that is after the creation of israeli state then we will also learn what were the main reasons that triggered the recent israeli-palestinian conflict and in the end i'll end this video on few comments about middle eastern ethno-religion politics alright then without any further ado let's begin let me begin with a small realistic life philosophy which says what you see on the surface is not what you will find under though india israel recently you must have heard the statement of tien tirumurti who is the indian representative at the united nation he said india strongly supports the palestinian cause if you notice there's a word called reaffirmed it means confirming the validity of something previously established that means india's support to palestine is part of india's old foreign policy that began during the neruvian era as you all know that jawaharlal nehru was the first prime minister of india after 1947 the indian economy was in a very poor state india's development strategy began on a socialistic approach under the leadership of first prime minister jawaharlal nehru in fact the concept of 5-year plan was first implemented in the soviet union in 1928 by joseph stalin jawaharlal nehru was inspired by stalin's plan if you know the full form of ussr it is the union of soviet socialist republics officially the ussr was a federal socialist state nehru was inspired from it and that is how after independence india's development strategy began on a socialistic approach so after 1947 the indian national congress made india follow largely whatever the soviet union did and soviet union used to support palestine likewise india also started supporting palestine in simple words whatever soviet union did india also very much followed that if i have to summarize the last hundred years in terms of distribution of power then it is something like this before the first world war the entire world was a unipolar world if you remember before 1914 when the first world war started different empires were fighting with each other the western european countries like the dutch britain french were ruling different parts of the world by forming colonies which were also referred to as colonial rule similarly there was the russian empire then prussian empire in germany most part of the middle east was under the ottoman empire so all these empires had their own territory where they exercised military cultural and economic power they also used to expand their territory to gain more and more influence and this continued till second world war this is what we refer to as a unipolar world the second world war ended in 1945 after 1947 the cold war started it was a period of ideological and geopolitical tension between the united states and the soviet union in other words the entire world became a bipolar world you could only support the ussr or the united states these two were the only major powers so this continued till 1991 when the soviet union collapsed and since then the world became a multipolar world after 1991 india also opened its market to the outside world through the lpg reforms and today as we know there are multiple superpowers you have the 5v2 countries united states uk france china russia then you have germany saudi arabia japan south korea australia and then there are emerging superpowers like argentina india you will notice all these countries exercise their influence in some form or the other that is how we come to this conclusion that there has been a dramatic change in world politics and the balance of power it has moved from the bipolar world to a multipolar world when it comes to india on the surface or at face value it has always adopted the policy of non-alignment in other words india adopted the middle part because we knew that the moment we supported one country we would automatically become the enemy of the opposite country so to avoid such kind of political disadvantages at international level india thought of maintaining the middle path as i've said this policy was just to show to the world in reality you have to take a side when it comes to buying weapons ammunition and other military equipment you will have to take a side as to whom to buy from the moment you decide your client the world is going to tag you irrespective of what you say so like that india the surface or at the face value followed the policy of non-alignment but it very much maintained its close relations with the soviet union which later became russia the big aircrafts sukhoi s 400 missiles joint cooperation of brahmos missiles many submarines etc came from joint cooperation with russia since 1950 india is the world's biggest arms importer till the late 90s russia was india's first choice now as we know india imports from many countries including the united states so that is how today when you hear india supporting palestine at the united nations it is purely because of historical reasons that is the right context of understanding india's statement now let's try to understand the israeli-palestinian conflict i will try to explain everything in a simple way so that you have a clear picture and i hope i will be able to give you a great amount of clarity first let me show you the map of israel and palestine this is the west bank territory you must be wondering in israel it is on the eastern side then why is it named as west bank well west bank used to be part of jordan's territory and if you see it from jordan's side it lies on the western side that is why it is named as west bank and by the way majority of the population of jordan is palestinians jordan conquered the west bank territory in 1948 during the 1948 arab israeli war but after that israeli took it back if you want to understand the jewish history i have made a separate video on it i'll put the link of that video in description if you are interested please watch it if you look at the history it goes around 2000 years back but if you just want to understand the israeli-palestinian conflict it began only after 1900. the first world war started in 1914 during that time palestine was under the control of the ottoman empire the first world war was fought between the allied powers and the central powers during the first world war the british openly promised the jewish community through balfour declaration of 1917 to give them a homeland in palestine in return the british wanted jewish support against the central power and ottoman empire see you have to understand one thing jews lived in palestine since ages their numbers were small but they lived in palestine and jerusalem since ages so don't think that it is because of british jews ended up in palestine palestine and jerusalem were the place of residence within the jewish people's hearts since ages the british only made a deal with the jews to give them recognition in return of their support during the war as we all know the central powers lost in the first world war in europe the prussian empire lost and in the middle east the ottoman empire disintegrated and was partitioned after its defeat after the end of the world war one the map of the middle east was redrawn and divided up between the european powers mainly between france and britain palestine and jordan territory came under the british control after the end of the first world war all ottoman control territories eventually became fully independent states except palestine britain was still controlling palestine and on the other hand british also had to give a separate homeland to the jewish people which they had promised as for the balfour declaration of 1917. from 1922 till 1947 britain allowed large-scale jewish migration in palestine mainly from eastern europe and other parts of mediterranean and western europe millions of jewish people migrated to palestine in a span of 10 to 15 years obviously the arabs living in palestine did not like this large-scale immigration of jews palestinian arabs started protesting against the british and were demanding independence in 1937. situation turned violent in late 1920s palestine was infested with terrorism and violence jews and muslims developed strong hatred towards each other then world war ii started in 1939. hitler killed many jews in nazi germany concentration camps after coming to power in 1933 which is also referred to as the period of holocaust as a result of that many jews from eastern europe migrated to british palestine so obviously jewish population increased tremendously till 1945. even then it wasn't more than the arab palestinians british tried different formulas to resolve jews and arab conflict but nothing worked then in 1947 the british handed over the palestinian problem to the united nations after looking at alternatives the united nations proposed the partitioning of british palestine into two independent states one was for the palestinian arabs and the other was the jewish state since jerusalem was the holy site of three religion united nations decided to bring jerusalem under its own control and made it a special international zone the jews accepted this plan and declared independence of israel on 14th may 1948 however the arabs were against it they saw the united nations partitioning of palestine as an attempt to spread western countries influence in the middle east that means till 1948 when the united nation partitioned palestine and gave a separate state to the israelis the map of israel looked like this and by the way the point to be noted is that israel declared itself as a full-fledged country by accepting the united nations plan and they did not create a palestinian state neither they accepted israel as a country that is why you will see names like west bank gaza strip you will not see it as palestine that means in 1948 the jews were happy with whatever land they had got as their homeland plus if you look at the map you will realize that the partitioning of british palestine was done in such a way that in 1948 if a palestine had to travel from west bank to gaza strip or from west bank to acre they had to obtain an israeli permit and that made the arabs angry so overall the united nations partitioned palestine into an area of jewish land three arab areas and jerusalem under international control now what the arabs did was immediately next day that is on 15th may 1948 the day after israeli independence arab forces from egypt jordan iraq syria saudi arabia north yemen and lebanon formed the arab league and had put together the arab liberation army full of volunteers to fight against the jews they surrounded israel from all three sides and started attacking if you look at the emblem of the arab liberation army you can judge for yourself how much hatred the arab world had against the jews in return israel started giving military training to its population and even sent their agents to europe to retrieve world war ii stocks and signed armed contracts anyhow this gave rise to the first arab-israeli war so this war went for almost one year and ended on 10th march 1949 by the end of this war israel dominated the war and won more territory this was the new map of israel after the 1949 war as you can see western part of jerusalem came under israel's control eastern part of gaza came under israel's control and the whole city of aker in north israel came under israel's control on the other hand jordan annexed and gained control of the west bank and egypt gained control of the gaza strip after the end of the war hundreds of thousands of palestinian arabs left and fled the israeli territory and moved into jordan lebanon syria and egypt on the other hand jewish communities who lived in many arab countries since ages were also forced to leave and they all took shelter in the israeli territory many jewish people especially the european jews were extremely happy to come back to their homeland and choose to settle there this kind of movement on the both side continued till 1967. in between in the year 1956 there was a second arab israeli war which is also referred to as the suez crisis or tripartite aggression britain france and israeli military attacked egypt on 29 october 1956 with the intention to acquire the senai peninsula and take over the swiss canal because the egyptian government had nationalized the swiss canal in july 1956 these countries realized the importance of swiss canal in maritime trade as you know swiss canal is the lifeline for all trade between the west and the east and they had concerns having it under the control of an arab country however there was a political pressure from the united states the soviet union and the united nations which led to the withdrawal of britain france and israel on 2nd june 1964 plo that is palestinian liberation organization was founded however it did not come into limelight until the end of third arab israeli war then in june 1967 the third arab israeli war took place it is also known as june war or six day war it was fought between the combined group of egypt jordan and syria against israel the nations of iraq saudi arabia kuwait algeria and others also contributed troops and arms to the arab forces in six days israel dominated the war and acquires whole of west bank territory from jordan golan heights from syria sinai peninsula and gaza strip from egypt when israeli forces occupied the sinai peninsula in 1967 in return egypt closed the swiss canal it was closed in 1975 that is for almost eight years in 1975 egypt and israel signed a disengagement accord the suez canal was reopened in june 1975 then a peace treaty was signed between egypt and israel in 1979 after which the senate peninsula was returned to egypt after acquiring west bank gaza strip and golan height israeli settlers begin to move into palestinian territories even the united nations condemned the israeli occupation but i would request you not to judge too early let's put a marker here and we will get back to this israeli occupation issue whether it is right or wrong in a while anyhow six years later in october 1973 egypt and syria launches a surprise attack on israel for recapturing their lost territories they attacked on the holiest day of jewish faith yom kippur this day is also referred to as jewish new year in fact there is a small tradition that the jews follow almost 2000 years ago when the jewish people were expelled and forced to leave from jerusalem after all king david conquered jerusalem and made it the capital of jewish kingdom his son solomon built the first holy temple about 40 years later so when the jewish were expelled from jerusalem 2000 years ago all the jewish communities who migrated to various parts of the world they used to take wine on this day and raise a toast while saying this phrase yerushalayim which means next year we will be together in jerusalem the jews have been following this tradition since 2000 years so you can imagine their love and integrity for their homeland anyhow that is why this war is also named as yom kippur war since it was a surprise attack egypt and syria crossed the cease-fire lines in the sinai and golan heights respectively since it was also the era of cold war soviet union supported the arab countries against israel looking at this the united states sends emergency supplies of 22 000 tons of weaponry to israel with the american help israeli army further continues to push its borders after ceasefire all the oil exporting arab countries decided to punish the united states and israel's allies by increasing the price of oil by 70 and decreasing production by 5 this caused the first oil crisis of 1973. as i've told you in the previous point in 1975 egypt and israel signed a disengagement accord and after that israel returned the sinai peninsula to egypt and some part of the golan heights to syria after the end of 1973 war israel still had control of the whole of west bank gaza strip and the remaining part of golan heights by 1980 israeli settlers occupied many streets in east jerusalem in 1987 the palestinian population rebels against israeli government situation got violent and the palestinians started belting stones at the israeli forces this was the beginning of the first intifada which is an arab term meaning uprising from here you will notice the rise of hamas it is the palestinian sunni islamic fundamentalist organization whose aim is to liberate palestine from the israeli occupation in 2007 hamas was designated as a terrorist organization by the united states canada european union israel and japan then from early 90s peace efforts between palestine and israel begins 1993 peace agreement was signed between israel and palestine which is also called the oslo accord as per this agreement there was a mutual recognition between the israeli government and plo israel actually acknowledged plo as a palestinian authority who will be running limited self-governance in the city of jericho in west bank and few parts of gaza strip but keep in mind the oslo accord however did not create a palestinian state this tells us that the israeli government were open to peace talks otherwise they wouldn't have acknowledged to plo as a palestinian authority with limited self-governance then in 1995 israeli-palestinian interim agreement on the west bank and gaza strip was signed on 28 september in washington dc as per the agreement the israeli civil administration will hand over the administration to the new palestinian interim government and the israeli military will withdraw by transferring powers and responsibility to plo yasir rafal leader of the plo arrived in gaza to take charge of the new palestinian authority in january 1996 the newly installed palestinian authority held its first democratic elections to choose an 88-member palestinian legislative council was elected president of the palestinian authority while all of this was going on israel was open to peace talks even acknowledged plo as a palestinian authority however there were disagreements on many issues such as the status of jerusalem and the return of palestinian refugees because you have to understand this israeli government were open to peaceful negotiation with the palestinians but at the same time the israelis were also suspicious of the palestinian future plans then in the year 2000 second uprising that is intifada occurs followed by many suicide bombings in 2002 israel begins the construction of wall in the west bank territory to protect its own people and country in the next four years the israeli government built a long wall and if you look at it from the israeli point of view it was necessary for their security as i have said suicide bombing was on the rise since 2000 and by the way while building the wall in few places the israeli government even encroached the palestinian territory which actually triggered anger within the palestinians this was even condemned by the international court of justice but then as you know israeli doesn't really care about anyone's point of view especially when it is about their own security that is why israel is at top among the most safest and secured country in the world by 2005 israeli government removed all the israeli settlers from the gaza strip in 2006 election hamas gained a large majority of seats in the palestinian parliament after coming into power hamas used to regularly fire rockets into israeli territories that is when in 2007 hamas was designated as a terrorist organization by the united states canada european union israel and japan by 2014 there were many clashes between gaza and israel in response israeli planes also caused destruction in gaza and that caused a humanitarian disaster in gaza on december 6 2017 president trump formally recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel and stated that the american embassy would be moved from tel aviv to jerusalem and that triggered more rebels among the palestinians today the situation is very complicated to understand this conflict you will have to use your brains to the highest degree you cannot get carried away by emotions and what you see on the media especially by cnn al jazeera and many other such outlets you have to know things in its actual context so let's see what exactly happened here are the three major issues that led to the 2021 israeli-palestinian conflict on 6th may palestinians protested in east jerusalem over an anticipated decision of the supreme court of israel on the eviction of six palestinian families in sheikh jarrah it is a neighborhood of east jerusalem the protest then escalated into violent confrontations between jewish and palestinian protesters then on 7th may israeli police raided the compound of the al-aqsa mosque which is the third holiest site in islam located on the temple mount the holy site in judaism the israeli police used tear gas rubber bullets and stun grenades in response to stone-throwing palestinians on 10th may hamas gave israel an ultimatum to withdraw security forces from the temple mount complex and sheikh jarrah on the same day hamas and palestinian islamic jihad began firing rockets into israel from the gaza strip so these are the three primary reasons that triggered the 2021 israeli-palestinian conflict the first one is property dispute in sheikh jara the second one is israeli police raid in al-aqsa mosque and the third one is hamas fighting rockets on israel now let's analyze these three situations one by one because if you watch some emotional video where they will show you palestinians getting hit by the israeli police that will not give you the whole picture that will just tell you one side of the story and to be very frank we all have to agree with this fact that the israelis don't give a [ __ ] about what anyone thinks of them they are not going to sit in front of the world and justify their actions to you and i they know what they are doing and even if nobody stands with them they are fine they haven't asked anyone's help and they have been facing violence since ages if you look at the history so this incident is nothing new for them apart from united states they really don't care about anyone because a lot of their military and technological market depends on the american market apart from united states i don't think is really scared about anyone's opinion anyhow let's analyze the first problem we all know that in 1948 israel was created united nation gave three areas to palestinians then a jewish state and jerusalem came under international zone then as we all know immediately next day on 15th may 1948 the arab forces attacked israel from all three sides after the end of the war israel gained control of the western side of jerusalem eastern part of gaza and the whole city of acre in north israel came under israel's control in 1956 28 palestinian families settled in sheikh jarrah neighborhood in east jerusalem these 28 families had an agreement with the jordanian ministry of construction and development and the un refugee agency unrwa to provide housing for them in sheikh jarrah neighborhood at that time west bank came under jordanian rule so basically the jordanian government gave the land and the united nations refugee agency paid the cost of constructing 28 homes for these 28 families now this process got interrupted in 1967 when the third arab israeli war took place which is also known as the june war or six day war and as we all know in six days israel dominated the war and acquires whole of west bank territory from jordan golan heights from syria sinai peninsula and gaza strip from egypt now you should understand this it was the arab countries who again started the war first with israel in 1967. the palestinian fidein attack meaning suicide attacks were carried out against israel that's what led to the 1967 june war but anyhow by the end of this war israel conquered the west bank territory that means the sheikh jarrah neighborhood in east jerusalem in 1967 came under israeli control today this 28 family has grown into 38 families and by the way you should not forget that these 28 families are refugees the israelis who are now settled in these homes their association has property papers which shows that they have purchased this land from the arabs in 1875 during the ottoman rule the ottoman land registry records showed the property was registered in the names of avraham ashkenazi and mair or back in response the palestinian refugee lawyers have questioned the authenticity of the document which was verified by an israeli court and they have stated that the document of jewish ownership was authentic on the other hand the palestinian refugees don't have any legal paper the jordanian government couldn't give them proper documents when the jordanian government was asked about this incident they simply said that the process was interrupted due to 1967 war so in simple terms the jewish people have papers and the palestinian refugee don't have any property papers and even in the 1860s and 1870s this neighborhood was a jewish neighborhood then of course as we all know the british occupied the palestine province being an indian we all know how good the british are in demarcating land borders even in india during the partition the british did not consciously do the partition of india that is why so many people died in india while migrating so what we can learn is that the british did not care about giving justice to the people whom they had ruled in fact they drew happiness from human and societal suffering so we all can collectively agree that the british did a lot of blunders but then oppressed people at that time didn't have that far-settedness they were simply happy for the fact that the britishers are going you get what i'm trying to say right so what you need to understand is that this neighborhood was initially a jewish neighborhood but after 1948 the west bank went to jordan as per the u.n partition on the other hand it was the arabs who were not satisfied that's how they collectively attacked one single country they underestimated israel in response israel conquered their land in 1967. after 1967 when israel controlled the west bank so obviously the original jewish owners will claim their land right after all they have their property papers and israel as a country did not steal west bank it acquired it by winning a war the jewish owners are also telling to the israeli supreme court that we have the papers and we have paid money and bought it even the israeli supreme court spoke a little in favor of the palestinian refugees the court said to the jewish owners look we get you have the papers but these palestinian refugees have been living here for a long time now so if you see israeli supreme court speaking a little in favor of the palestinians shows that there is some neutrality in the israeli justice system in fact the supreme court even said to the palestinians that look you can stay here but give the jewish owner some rent then you will get a protected tenant status that means nobody can move you out the palestinians said no to that also in other words the palestinians are saying that we will continue to stay here and we will not even pay you rent and even if we don't have documents it is our house this is a clear case of property law this is how you have to look at this problem and that's when you can come to a fair conclusion the western media has hidden all this information and have only showed what suits their narrative and they gave it a new cover story by calling it racial eviction whereas if you analyze it carefully there's nothing racist about it it is a simple case of land grabbing which comes under property law now to all my indian viewers by looking at this property dispute of sheikh jarrah does it remind you of any similar situation in india on 19 january 1990 lakhs of kashmiri pundits and sikh people were forced to leave kashmir many were killed massacred raped looted forcedly converted by islamic settlers hateful slogans were announced from the loudspeakers of mosques and issue fatwa saying kashmiri pundits were kafirs so many hindus and sikh left their own houses lands and properties what do you think happened to their properties they were grabbed and occupied by muslims who lived there for 30 years these kashmiri pundits have been living in refugee camps of jammu you will see many of these kashmiri pundits as roadside vendors near delhi heart south extension malvia nagar patel nagar and other parts of the city do you think kashmiri pandits will go back and claim their land and properties do you even think when they were running away from their houses they were carrying their property papers they very well know where their properties are they can very well locate it but do you think will they get their properties back so naturally today it will be difficult for these people to go back to kashmir and claim their land and property it can only happen with government support and i must also point out one thing after going through so much not even a single kashmiri pundit turned hostile or turned into an armed rebel so if you see palestine case is nothing in front of this the land dispute of sheikh jarrah is a simple property dispute of land grabbing the israeli owners have property documents they were kicked out after 1948 when west bank went to jordan and the palestinians who are currently reciting are refugees they don't have any document and they also don't want to pay any rent the jordanian government had placed them illegally in 1956 and i also feel if these palestinian people had cooperated with the israeli government or justice system then i'm sure they would have got something in return there are so many arrangements that the government can do provide low cost housing or reallocation etc you have to cooperate with this system if you consider yourself as israeli palestinians then you cannot always protest and throw stones at the authority our kashmiri pundits did not become hostile in fact if you see indian kashmiri muslims in kashmir throw stones at the indian army the kashmiri muslims get all the protection and benefits from indian taxpayers in return they throw stones at the indian armed forces so can you see the pattern you can get away doing that in india but that is israel that is not india you are not going to gain anything from the israeli system if you throw stones and fire bombs at them in return the system will be harsh on you so today the palestinians are accusing jewish original landowners of grabbing their properties in sheikh jarrah then those palestinians are no different even their ancestors have kicked the jewish out in 1948 and took over their land without papers and then neighboring arab countries collectively attacked on israel is that fair and if israel conquered the land after defeating its enemies in 1967 war then what's the matter israel is a democracy arabs are living in israel so why don't these palestinians support israeli nationhood if they can't do that then they can move to jordan which has majority of palestinians if you look at the total population of arabs living in west bank and gaza strip it is roughly around 20 lakhs the population of the state of israel is 90 lakhs so today if the arabs are in minority in israel if they don't fight with the israelis they can live happily but instead they are going against them and when israeli government retaliates they play victim card if suppose the palestinian arabs were in majority and jews were in minority do you think they would have left these jews they would have either killed them or converted them hamas who rules the gaza strip they're openly saying that we will throw israelis into the sea and will do ethnic cleansing so the day the palestinian population increases they will wipe out the jews israelis are aware of this they're not going to sit and wait for that day their policies are very straightforward if they see any threat they will deal with it in advance that is why i said to understand this conflict you need to use your brain to the highest degree you cannot get carried away by looking at few videos which are emotional and one-sided i'm not against the palestinians in fact the israeli supreme court has also spoken a little in favor of them and said just pay the rent and live peacefully but there is no gain in being hostile you have to look for a peaceful way land's properties it is an ancestral position grabbing it and illegally settling there is not the right thing to do we have good examples in india i am talking about kashmiri pundits they never complain of being unfair of course they feel sad but they have moved on and more importantly they never became hostile but in the case of israel the israeli government is not like the indian government so they have their own way of dealing things one should not even expect softness from israel when the entire arab nation have said we will push the jews into the sea kill all the jews so israelis have their own threat perception and they will deal with it accordingly as far as the first problem goes the property dispute in sheikh jarrah i hope now this problem is much clearer to you and i hope you have gained some perspective now let's look at the second problem israeli police raid in al-aqsa mosque there is a clear footage that shows the palestinian crowds first started throwing stones and other objects at the israeli police officers that is when in response the israeli police started clearing the crowd by throwing tear gas and stunt grenades not directly at the people on empty grounds obviously the israeli police is going to clear the crowd nobody expects any police in any country to be sweet and polite when there is a potential threat and those are rubber bullets they're not real bullets now this part of the footage was taken by one of the palestinian protester so this angle might be a little confusing as to who initiated this clash now have a look at this video which was released by the israeli police because israeli police were smart nowadays even the indian government is doing that which is a good thing government should have their own filming crew in this footage you will see that the palestinian protesters were throwing a patrol bomb at the israeli police and look at this scene the israeli police is pushing them away that is the standard procedure for any country's police here in india during covet lockdown days you take your bike out the police makes you dance like anything so clearing the cloud is a standard procedure here the palestinians attacked first just remember one thing the whole west bank and jerusalem is under israel's control but the administration is shared by both the israeli government and fatah which is a palestinian authority if you remember in the 90s the peace process began between israel and palestine in 1993 a peace agreement was signed between israel and palestine which is also called oslo accord as per that agreement there was a mutual recognition between the israeli government and plo so in a nutshell the creation of palestinian authority was actually agreed through mutual understanding by the israeli government so presently the west bank is partially governed by the palestinian authority called fatah however law and order remains in the hand of israeli government that is why you will see only israeli police on the other hand the gaza strip is currently under the control of hamas and i've already mentioned hamas is a designated terrorist organization however the palestinians staying in israel supports hamas and plo the palestinians consider these two organizations as their saviors so anyhow the palestinian protesters attack the israeli police and jews first with a fire bomb stone and other objects in response the israeli police evacuated the compound by lotti charge for restoring law and order you will also find another footage where the jewish people are dancing and jumping and raising their israeli flag while there is a fire going on at a distance so this kind of video makes you feel that how can the jewish people be happy when something is burning and many on the internet might even assume that maybe they are happy because the palestinians are being beaten by the police again that is not true if you look at this incident from the other side of the wall it is the palestinian protesters who have set the tree on fire they were protesting in response to the israeli supreme court's hearing on the sheikh jarrah property dispute case the supreme court hearing was only for six palestinian families just imagine for six palestinian families this much of violence was orchestrated so you see what is happening these things are being done just to gain attention of the international media and the third reason that led to the 2021 palestinian-israeli conflict was when hamas launched rockets into israel from gaza in response to the al-aqsa and sheikh jarrah incident they fired more than 4000 rockets at israel some hitting deeper inside israeli territory and with greater accuracy than ever before so you see how everything is being orchestrated six palestinian families property dispute then supreme court hearing al-aqsa mosque incident then palestinian protesters throw firebomb first and then burn the tree in response israeli police used water cannon rubber bullets stunned grenade to restore loin order even some police have got hurt just like the palestinians and finally hamas launched more than four thousand rockets from gaza onto israel in response when israel fired the palestinians in gaza started playing victim card up till now everything was in internal conflict the moment hamas fired rockets followed by hezbollah from south lebanon it all became an external enemy threat in simple words we call it war so you see how a small property dispute transformed into a large-scale war and you will be surprised when you hear people's logic such as so what hamas fired rockets israel has iron dome hamas knows its rockets are not going to cause any harm to any israeli it was just to teach israelis a lesson when you are firing more than 4000 rockets on a country the intention is to wipe out the entire human race of that country people need to understand this that the arabs are not able to digest the jewish israelis the israelis are giving the arabs doses of their own medicines if the arab muslims are aggressive israelis are showing firmness in return then you also must have heard in the news that the israelis have taken down al-jazeera and associated press building in gaza if you all don't know al-jazeera is qatar's satellite tv network that was launched in 1996 it is fully funded by the kathari royal family this tv network has collaborated with many terrorist organizations in the past like hezbollah taliban isis al-qaeda even in kashmir if you read their articles al-jazeera portrays the militants like jaish muhammad lashkar-e-taiba as freedom fighters even muslim countries like egypt saudi arabia uae and bahrain have kicked al-jazeera bureaus out of their countries and have accused qatar for sponsoring and harboring terrorist groups such as al-qaeda and isis the gulf cooperation council group has also officially published a list of 59 individuals and 12 institutions linked to terrorist organizations that received support from qatar and this has also been one of the reasons behind the qatar diplomatic crisis that started in 2017 and ended in 2021 anyhow so it is quite an open fact that qatar harbors as well as supports many terrorist organizations so naturally even the israelis are aware of it that is why they have shot down its building in gaza israel also attacked the home of hamas leader and i must also point out that before hitting any target the israeli military personnels have been giving advanced warnings to the civilian population that is the character of a moral army on the other hand you will see that hamas always hides behind civilians especially women and children always play a victim card when it gets counter hit from the israelis now if you pay attention hamas controls gaza and it is a palestinian sunni radical islamic group on the other hand hezbollah is a lebanese shia radical islamic group even hezbollah has fired rockets from southern lebanon towards israel the hezbollah terror group has also dug a network of tunnels hundreds of kilometers long from beiru to southern lebanon for infiltrating hezbollah terrorist in northern israel anyways so hamas is a palestinian sunni radical islamic group and hezbollah is a lebanese shia radical islamic group that means hezbollah is supported by iran because iran is the only muslim country which has large population of shias and we also know iran is a nuclear state now what is surprising to see is that since childhood we have heard that the sunnis and shias don't get along well with each other they have sectarian divides from the last 1400 years then within sunnis they have mukhalidan gaya mukhilit under mukhalid they have four categories in that one category is hanafi even under hanafi they have devi under dev bandi they have two more hayati and mamathi so if you see these are deep fault lines within islam if one sits down and explores what is surprising for me in this israeli-palestinian conflict is that both sunni and shia radical groups are united against israel i also don't understand what is the relation between indian muslims and palestine what is the relation between pakistan muslim and palestine what is the relation between iran shia muslims and sunni palestinians nobody is asking these questions these are very important questions just go and look up who is the leader of hezbollah it is hasan nasrallah he is a lebanese shia muslim he is not even iranian however since he is the leader of hezbollah then his allegiance has to be towards iranian supreme leader ali khamenei now if you look at which are those islamic radical organizations that are fighting against israel they are hamas which is sunni plo that is sunni hezbollah it is shia and other islamic jihadi organizations that means there is no sectarian divide among these radical terror outfits everyone is united and cooperating in this conflict against israel you must have even heard that the taliban is cooperating with iran these days so it is quite interesting to see this cooperation so what you have to realize is that at the back end these organizations have met sat together and have done a great deal of negotiations to achieve the ultimate goal of re-establishing a super-islamic state once that is achieved then they will fight among themselves and sort it out there's an old arab saying i against my brother i and my brother against my cousin i my brother and my cousin against the world so this kind of sunnisha reunion is always carried out by poor people in the case of kashmir we have seen all the militants are young people who belong to poor socio-economic backgrounds similarly these poor israeli-palestinians are also being used by these radical islamic organizations for continuing their agenda and it is working you will find that an average israeli palestinian hates jews and they are also teaching the same to their children and those innocent children when they grow up they will grow up with this mindset again i will point out the kashmiri pundits it's been 30 years not even a single kashmiri pundit or their children have picked up any arms and there are many more such examples in the world so one has to be aware of all these things israelis are aware of these temporary agreements between various radical islamic organizations and how they are brainwashing innocent people israelis are vocal about it as well as fighting against it that is why most of the arab nations don't like israel so that's it then this was everything that you had to know about the israeli-palestinian conflict i hope you found this video informative thank you for watching it

----------------------------------------------------",2021-05-16,10594599,349520,45164,UC-CSyyi47VX1lD9zyeABW3w," Hello, friends! 1993 was the year when Israel and Palestine were very close to drafting a peaceful solution. But what happened after it that the situation worsened to the extent that today there is a war between them? If we want to understand today's crisis properly, we need to know the history first. This is why, in today's video, let's get to know the detailed history between the two countries. How did the country Israel came to be? And how did the conflict between Israel and Palestine begin?   Our story begins thousands of years ago. You must've heard about how terribly Hitler had treated the Jews. But do you know, the atrocities against Jews began thousands of years ago. It is said that Jesus Christ was born into a Jewish family. And some Christians believe that some Jews wanted to crucify Jesus Christ. This is a belief from an ideology that remained among the Christians for
several years, decades and even centuries. And when the crusades happened around a thousand year ago, Christians killed the Jews in large numbers. At that time, there were many rumours being circulated against the Jews that they drink the blood of Christian children, or that they use the blood for religious rituals. Because of these rumours, there was rampant hatred against the Jews. The hate that the Jews had to bear hardly any religion had to bear that in the last thousand years. After the 1800s, this hatred towards the Jews was not only because of religious reasons but also because the Jews were being seen as a different ethnicity as well. Because of all these reasons, till the late 1800s, Jews living around the world began feeling that no country accepts them as their own. If they wanted to live peacefully, they would need to create their own country. To create a Jewish country. There was an Austro-Hungarian journalist named
Theodor Herzl. He started a new political movement in his 1896 pamphlet. Zionism. He said that the Jews should get their separate country. At the time this wasn't a new idea. Since the 1870s, there were several organizations calling themselves Lovers of Zion. They were already propagating this idea. Because of these reasons, in 1881, the first large scale migration of Jews was seen in the Palestine area. The Jews built many permanent settlements in the area and started living there. Why did they choose the Palestine area? Because this was a very holy area for them. Jerusalem is the holiest place for the Jews. Do remember that at that time there was no Israel, Gaza or the West Bank. The whole area was Palestine. That fell under the Ottoman empire. Under the Ottoman empire, the Christians, Muslims and Jews lived together peacefully, more or less. There were no conflicts. One reason behind it can be that most of the land was empty. There were very few settlements on the land. And the population was very little in the area. Now we fast forward to the year 1915. World War 1 began. The British, French and Arab revolutionaries were fighting the Ottoman empire. The British play a clever hand here. They tell the Arab revolutionaries that in return for their support in defeating the Ottoman empire, they will give them the Palestine area. And the Arab revolutionaries were fighting to create a unified Arab country. The Arab revolutionaries wanted one Arab country from Syria to Yemen. The Britishers promise the same thing to the Jews. That they will help them to create their own Jewish country near Palestine. Why do they do this? So that they could appease the American Jews. And could gain influence on American politics. But in reality, the British made a secret deal with the French. As soon as the Ottoman Empire fell
after World War 1, Britain and France divided the Middle East area between themselves. The British took over the control
of the Palestine region. 1918-1948 the entire Palestine area was under the control of the British Government. At this time in Germany, Hitler gets political power. And the Jews are massacred in millions
in a genocide. Why did Hitler get political power? I made an entire video on it and I'll put a link to it in the description. You can watch that as well. The Jews flee from Hitler-controlled Europe to different countries to save themselves. Some get refuge in America. But many of these Jews go to Palestine. Britain allows them to enter Palestine initially. But later, they start stopping them from coming to Palestine. Because of this, an Israeli Nationalist Movement starts in Palestine. At the same time, around the 1940s, Palestine Nationalist Movement had also begun. And the Palestinians were also demanding their own country. In 1948 the British Government realises that enough's enough. And that they cannot remain there longer. They left the Jewish to form a Jewish country and
the Palestinians to form their own country. They accepted that they could not do that and ceded the responsibility to the United Nations. The British then leave Palestine. United Nations comes up with a partition plan. About the area to be allotted for creating a Jewish country and a Palestinian country. In 1947 the United Nations Partition Plan is released. In the plan, the United Nations keeps 57% of the area for the Jewish country And 43% of the area for the Arab-Palestinian country. Jerusalem is a very historically important area for three religions, for the Jews, Christians and Muslims. So the United Nations decided that Jerusalem would be under international control. The Jews accept this plan and name their new country Israel. Here, the Israel country is born in 1948. But unfortunately, the other neighbouring Arab countries weren't pleased with this plan at all. They believed that the plan was basically the Britisher's way of continuing their colonialism. So they start a war against Israel. Saying that they will not allow the Jews to take any part of the land. This war is named the First Arab-Israeli war of 1948. And this is a very historic war in and of itself. More than 5 countries were fighting against
a tiny new country. The Jews living in Israel knew that five years ago they had seen how the rest of the world treated them. How Hitler had treated them. And then all the Arab countries were starting a war against them. If they didn't fight to survive then, they wouldn't be able to survive ever. So to save themselves, they fought with all they had. And very surprisingly, Israel won the war. Defeating all these countries. After the war ends in 1949, the areas that were supposed to be Palestine's according to the UN Partition Plan, Israel occupied several of these areas. The Gaza Strip area went to Egypt. And the West Bank area went to Jordan. This meant that the Palestinians did not have a country any longer. More than 700,000 Palestinians had to leave their homes and become refugees in Arab countries. This is named the 1948 Palestinian Exodus. After this, in 1967, the Second Arab-Israeli War takes place. This war lasts for six days. And Israel wins this easily too. Not only does Israel occupy the Gaza Strip and the West Bank area but also this large Egyptian Peninsula gets occupied by Israel after this war. Palestinians want their own country. For this reason, in 1964, Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was founded. Initially, their aim is through armed struggle. To use weapons to get their own country. In the beginning, they also wanted that Israel should cease to exist. Because of this, the USA and Israel declare it to be a terrorist organization. But one thing that needs to be remembered is if you see them from the perspective of one person they'll seem like a terrorist organization and from the perspective of another, they're revolutionaries who want freedom for their country. In 1973, the Third Arab-Israeli War begins but it isn't very important for our story because, after that, nothing changes much. But in 1974, PLO gets officially recognized by the United Nations General Assembly. To be the representative of the Palestinian people. In 1979, the peace talks between Egypt and Israel is successful And Egypt becomes the first Arab country to recognize Israel as a country that exists there. After the Peace-Talks, the entire Egyptian peninsula area captured by Israel is returned to Egypt by Israel. The Egyptian and Israeli Prime Ministers both are awarded Nobel Peace Prize for this successful peace treaty. But unfortunately, after two years, the Egyptian Prime Minister gets assassinated. By the right-wing extremists in Egypt. The fanatics questioned the Prime Minister's treaty with Israel. They wanted to kill him because he reached a compromise. And so he was assassinated. From 1967 to the 1980s, It had been more than 10 years since Israel had occupied the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. During this period, many Israelis start establishing their colonies in the West Bank. They start building settlements and living there permanently. Israeli government supported them directly or indirectly. And the prices of the homes were low there. Some people go there for cheap housing while others for their religious nationalism. Some fanatic Israelis claim that the entire West Bank area is theirs. And so they'll reside there. And so Israeli settlements start cropping up in the West Bank area. The international community deems these settlements to be illegal because these settlements go against the United Nations Partition Plan. And the Palestinians see them as colonization. Basically, their country is being colonized by the Israelis. In 1992, Israel gets an amazing Prime Minister. His name was Yitzhak Rabin. He said that PLO is not a terrorist organization. They just want their country and the Israelis should let them have it. Israel officially recognized PLO. And in return, PLO officially recognized Israel as a country. And here the 1993 Oslo Accords take place. For the first time, both of them come together and talk. About how the country can be correctly and peacefully divided. About how the Palestinian country can be created. As a result, in 1994, the Palestinian Government is established for the first time. It is named the Palestinian National Authority. But at this point in time, Israelis had already established permanent settlements in many West Bank areas. Which were supported by the Israeli Government. And the Palestinians were living in few areas in bits and pieces. It was then decided to divide the West Bank area into three parts. Area A, B and C. Area A would be where the Palestinian government would be in control. In Area B both the governments will exercise control. And Area C will be the areas where the Israeli Government will retain control. Let alone the United Nation's Partition Plan In reality, in 1994, Palestine gets only some bits and pieces in the West Bank area and Gaza Strip to form their country. But the good news is that at that point in time, Israel and Palestine were very close to come up with a peaceful solution. For this reason, in 1994, the President of the Palestinian Authority - Yasser Arafat, and the Prime Minister of Israel Yitzhak Rabin were awarded Nobel Peace Prize. But unfortunately, after this, the whole situation goes downhill. When the extreme wight-wing Jewish people assassinate their Prime Minister. In the same way that Godse assassinated Gandhi Ji. Because Gandhi Ji talked about unity between Hindus and Muslims. A Jewish extremist shot the Israeli Prime Minister thrice from a pistol at point-blank range in 1995. These fanatic Jewish people questioned the compromise with Palestine. About why they were given any land at all. They wanted entire Palestine to be Israeli's. And because of these fanatics, the situation kept on worsening. Around 5-6 years before this incident, some Islamic fanatics in Palestine came together to form the HAMAS group. HAMAS group claims that the PLO is being too secular. And compromising a lot with Israel. But in reality, they want to erase Israel from the maps. So the fanatics created a new organization to fight for the eradication of Israel. And here the HAMAS group forms. Obviously when the peace treaty is signed around 1994 between Palestine and Israel the Jewish fanatics start hating their Prime Minister and on the other hand, the HAMAS group starts hating the PLO. All because they reached a compromise with Israel. Not only does the HAMAS group boycott the 1996 Palestinian election but they also carry out suicide bombings in Israel. Because of this, on both sides, the dominance of the extreme right-wing groups starts rising. There is increasing polarization. People on both sides, the Israelis and Palestinians start hating each other. Some hatred was already there and after 1995 it keeps on increasing. Around 2002, violent protests were seen on both sides. More than 100 Israelis and Palestinians died on the other side of the border. There are clashes on the ground and the people have become so sceptical of each other that Israel starts building walls around its settlements. Security guards are deployed around the permanent houses built by the Israelis in the West Bank and checkpoints are placed. And it continues to become increasingly difficult for Palestinians to live there. In 2006, the HAMAS militant group runs in the Palestinian election and wins. It defeats the PLO party, Fatah, but by a very small margin.  It wins 74 out of 132 seats. But after this, in 2007, a civil war takes place between these two parties in Palestine. Internally, the supporters of one party start fighting the supporters of the other. In 2007, this war is known as the Battle of Gaza. And Palestine is divided into two parts. In the Gaza Strip, HAMAS establishes its control. And the West Bank area is controlled by Fatah and PLO. Who are non-violent and rule the West Bank as a government should. But today when Gaza Strip is under the rule of HAMAS, they have basically occupied the area like a terrorist group. And like I told you in the last video, the war and the rockets that we get to see are sent from the Gaza Strip area to Israel. Whereas in the West Bank where the PLO is in control, this sort of violence is not seen there. So this is the situation today, friends. There is no doubt that Israel has continued to colonize the West Bank area for several decades. Causing the clashes to intensify. The recent clash, about which I talked in the previous video, was because Israel is occupying the areas in the West Bank. And the fanatics in Israel demand that the entire West Bank area be theirs. That the entire Jerusalem be theirs. And the fanatics in Palestine want to eradicate Israel completely. The most important question is
What can be the solution to this? Look at the map of Palestine. In the West Bank, the country is divided into so many parts That today if this country were to be given an independent government how will it exist in so many bits and pieces? Some people believe that a two-state solution can still be possible. That the area is divided on the basis of 1967. On the basis of Israel and Palestine. Some people say that the division needs to be on the basis of the 1947 Partition Plan. But if this is done then the most prominent question will be What will happen to the colonies of permanent settlement that Israel had built in Palestine? There are proper societies with homes and schools and hospitals and wide roads. What will happen to these areas if they are reclaimed by Palestine? There are hundreds of thousands of people living in the settlements in the West Bank. Here I will like to ask what do you think, friends? What can be the solution to this crisis?
This problem? How should two countries be divided? Write in the comments below. I hope you found this video informative, friends. If you want to take a lesson from this video,
in my opinion, it should be that Don't stop raising your voice against the fanatics! Let's meet in the next video. Thank you."

----------------------------------------------------",2021-05-14,6754016,334201,43746,UC-CSyyi47VX1lD9zyeABW3w," Hello, friends! The situation between Israel and Palestine has worsened so much so that it looks like a war. Thousands of rockets are fired
and many people are losing their lives. In fact, some kids lost their lives as well. This topic is so controversial that people across the world are divided in their opinion. Even in India. Two trends were at the top on Twitter. One, India Stands With Israel. And the other, India Stands With Palestine. Who is in the right here? Why did this topic and this war start again? Come, let's try to find out in today's video.   Friends, this is the map of Israel-Palestine. You can see where Israel is on this map
very clearly. But one needs to look for Palestine. The highlighted region on the top is known as the West Bank. And the thin green strip at the bottom
is known as the Gaza Strip. In this map, the areas in green are the places where Palestinians live. And the areas in dark green are the ones governed by the Palestinian government. But the pink area in the West Bank is where
Israel is in control. Some Israelis also live there. Don't you feel that this is a weird map? How can two countries exist as hundreds of different parts? There are more than a hundred parts. And if a person starts walking from the top to the bottom, he'll find that he starts in Israel, reaches Palestine,
walks further and then re-enters Israel. Even further and he's in Palestine again;
how is this possible? How can a country exist in more than a hundred different pieces? It has its own interesting history. I won't talk about the history in this video because it will make this video very long. I'll make a different video after this that will tell you the historical situation of Israel-Palestine about how this came to be. So it is not very surprising. If two countries exist in pieces surrounded by each other  there is bound to be a lot of conflict between them. In the middle of this map is the city of Jerusalem. A very holy city for the people from three religions,
Christians, Muslims and Jews. Jerusalem faces the same situation. West Jerusalem is under Israel's control and many Israelis live there. And in the East Jerusalem area, many Palestinians live there. And according to International law, it is a part of Palestine. But Israel has occupied that area. Israel believes that the entire Jerusalem city is theirs and should be so. And Palestinians believe that it is theirs, obviously. In the last several years, in East Jerusalem, many Palestinian families had to face evictions. Israeli Government is accused of forcefully evicting many Palestinian families out of their homes. On the other hand, if we talk about the Gaza Strip, the story differs there. Palestinian Government is not in control there. It is occupied by a militant group/ political party HAMAS. The Palestinian Prime Minister governing the dark green areas in the West Bank, even he doesn't have any control over the
Gaza Strip. Because HAMAS has occupied the entire
Gaza Strip. And some countries of the world like the USA, Israel, the European Union and Japan, these countries believe that HAMAS is a terrorist group. But on the other hand, there are countries like
the UK and Australia, that consider only the militant wing of HAMAS as a terrorist group. But there are also countries like China, Russia, Turkey, Iran and Norway, that do not consider HAMAS as a terrorist group. HAMAS and the Israeli military often launch rockets against each other. Though Israel has an Iron Dome. It is a very efficient defence system that keeps them protected against the rockets from HAMAS. The firing of rockets and airstrikes occur between Gaza and Israel. The West Bank of Palestine doesn't have much to do with it and no rockets are launched by them. Because Israeli people live there too. But at the same time, the borders in Gaza are clearly defined. Israeli people don't live in Gaza, it is very clearly a dark green strip. In fact, Israel has put complete blockades all around Gaza. On one side Israel has blocked it and on the other Egypt has blocked it completely. They have been economically cut off from the rest of the world as well. Because of this, the unemployment rate in Gaza is very high. The money that comes to Gaza is from the people across the world that want to help them. Help the people living there.  But most of the time HAMAS uses that money to buy weapons and launch rockets. So it is very important to understand this difference. The problems at the border and the problems of
evicting people out of their homes, where Israel is accused of illegally occupying the land, are in the West Bank. And in Gaza, there is HAMAS. Once that you've understood this background knowledge now let's talk about the current events. It can be said that the current issue began with the topic of Sheikh Jarrah. Sheikh Jarrah is a neighbourhood in East Jerusalem. Where many Palestinian families were ordered to leave their homes. Additionally, about a week ago, some extremist right-wing Jews had provocating rallies in the neighbourhoods of East Jerusalem. Where they carried the slogans ""Death to Arabs"". When these rallies passed, fights outbroke between the Jews and the Arab Muslim communities amidst heightened tensions. And these were inflamed by the extreme right-wing Israeli politicians. Like them. They gave extremely provocating speeches. They claimed that the whole city was theirs. And this led to the worsening of the situation. On 7th May, Palestinian people were protesting against these evictions. These protests turned violent. Stones were thrown, the Israeli police tried to control the situation. The police and the protestors crashed and people were injured on both sides. On 10 May, the Israeli police entered the Al Aqsa mosque rubber bullets were fired and stun grenades were thrown at the Palestinians there. At the people praying there. Israeli police claim that they had information the some Palestinians had collected stones to be thrown at the right-wing people of the passing rallies carrying the ""Death to Arabs"" slogan. After hearing the news of the mosque, the HAMAS group gave an ultimatum to the Israeli government to withdraw Israeli police from the mosque
or else they would attack. Even though the Palestinians living in the West Bank hardly have anything to do with HAMAS, but still, HAMAS posed as the representative of the Palestinians and gave this warning. And after some hours, started firing rockets at Israel. The HAMAS group launched thousands of rockets against Israel from Gaza. And when these rockets fell on Israel,
Israel retaliated with airstrikes on Gaza. Israel carried out more than 130 airstrikes on Gaza. And in the last two days, more than 40 Palestinian people have died. Including more than 9 kids. On the Israeli side, two Israelis have died
as well as one Indian person. The biggest question arising here is
Who is right and Who's wrong? There is no end to excuses on both sides to justify their actions. Israel claims that they carried out the airstrikes because HAMAS launched rockets against them. HAMAS says that they launched the rockets because the Israelis attacked the mosque. Israel says that they attacked the mosques because people were throwing stones there. And the people throwing the stones say they did so because their land is being unfairly occupied. And then those people will say that it was not an unfair occupation of land because it was a legal matter finalized in the court. And then the conversation will turn to history. There is no end to the excuses on either side. One excuse after the another. And then it'll lead to history about what happened in the 1967 war. But a few things are very clear that we need to remember in this situation, in my opinion. First, what do international observers have to say? European Union says that the evictions by Israel are illegal on humanitarian grounds and lead to tensions among the masses. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said that the law enforced by Israel is inherently discriminatory. And the sending of Israelis to occupy land is prohibited under International Humanitarian law and that it may amount to a war crime. So it is clear that Israel's occupation of the areas of the West Bank and eviction of Palestinians is wrong according to the International observers. But does that mean that the actions of HAMAS are right? Absolutely not.  In fact, the rockets of HAMAS are often pointed at the common cities of Israel where the common citizens are harmed. It is a good thing that Israel has such a good defence system, the Iron Dome, because of this, most of the rockets launched by HAMAS cause no destruction. And there are little to no casualties on the Israeli side. But if there were no protection against the rockets from HAMAS, many Israelis would've lost their lives. Violence as a response to violence
and even more violence to its response does not improve the situation;
it worsens the situation exponentially. Like Gandhi Ji had said, ""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."" Secondly, the situation as of now is that more than 60 people have lost their lives. Including more than 17 children. All of them were humans. But the unfortunate reality is that the extremists in Israel and Palestine do not see humans. They can see only terrorists. Israelis think that all the Palestinians are terrorists. And some Palestinians believe that all the Palestinians are terrorists. They don't see them as humans. The politicians and militant groups have instigated so much hate in people on both the sides That both groups of people cannot treat each other with compassion and respect. They behave like sworn enemies. This is why they keep justifying one act of violence after the other. ""We did this in defence."" ""We did this to protect our lives."" It needs to be understood that all the Palestinians do not support HAMAS. At the same time, all the Israelis do not support the Israeli Government or its actions. In the past, there have been politicians that have tried to maintain as much peace as possible. And they were assassinated by
extremist Israeli Jews. There are a lot of extremist people on both sides. The population of the extremist people are so significant that it is overpowering. And to term the entire country as terrorist because of this reason, to say that all the Israelis are terrorists, or that all the Palestinians are terrorists, is extremely wrong. If you say this, it will only increase the hatred on both sides. The third is the quote from Spiderman,
""With great power lies great responsibility."" Look at both sides, which side has more power? It is quite obvious. The military technology of Israel, its defence system, agencies like Mossad, It is next to impossible to compete against them. Israel is one of the best military powers in the world. With so much power, their responsibility is also enhanced. The organizations like HAMAS which is considered to be terrorists by Israel. If the terrorist group launch rockets at them, they do not have to respond similarly. They do not have to respond violently to violence. The Gaza airstrikes by Israel killed many civilians and children. And Israel has so much technology that they should take precautions to target only the rocket launchers and the terrorist groups. The children as not involved in terrorism. And to say that there will be casualties every time you target them is not right. Had your family member been there. And if there were terrorists in the next building. And your family member died because the building next to them was bombed, will it be justified? It will never be.  Especially when this is done by one of the top military powers in the world. These things need to be thought of. Remember them whenever you talk about this issue with anyone. And I will make a detailed video on the history of Israel-Palestine soon. You will get the answer to many questions when you see their detailed history. Let's meet in the next video. Thank you!"

0:00 Intro
0:20 Establishment Of Gaza Strip
2:55 The Oslo Accords
4:53 Israel Pulls From Gaza
9:00 Palestinians Held Captive",2023-12-12,281116,13900,1194,UC73H5p3GP8b5N1f3hozIXyQ, [Music] at this point in time all of you at least most of you have heard the statement Gaza is the biggest open prison in the world so today we're going deep into that story the story of the Gaza Strip its history its people its borders and who benefits from you thinking that it's the biggest prison in the world the Gaza Strip is a small piece of land on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea a borders Egypt on the Southwest and Israel on the East and the north people have lived in Gaza for Millennia but for for today's purposes were focusing on the history starting in 1947 in 1947 the entire land is inhabited both by Arabs and Jews and controlled by the British Empire it's already riddled with violence fueled by competing National aspirations then the UN proposes the partition plan a two-state solution with Jerusalem as its International City the Palestinians were to receive the Western Galilee the Samarian Highlands and the coastal plains south of jof including the Gaza Strip Jewish leaders accepted this plan reluctantly of course and the Palestinians along with the Arab countries around them opposed any partition leading to a Jewish State igniting the 1948 War following Egypt into war were Iraq Jordan that back then was known as trans Jordan Lebanon and Syria the Egyptians attack from within Egypt and this is important to note from Egypt they washed through the Gaza Strip and then up the coastal plains toward Wards Tel Aviv and with much effort this wasn't at all an easy battle the young state of the time pushes them back to the Gaza Strip establishing that first sliver as we know it today at the end of the war Gaza was occupied by Egypt what's interesting is they never annexed the Gaza Strip it forever remained even under Egyptian control an area controlled by military governance but not fully citizens or people with full rights Egypt maintained control over for Gaza for 19 years and in that 19-year period it's not like everything is peaceful in the Gaza Strip there's a ton of refugees that have sort of come in the Gaza Strip there's a lot of violence and they're under military control but not only that there wasn't no fence back then so those communities in the Gaza Strip continuously throughout the period go out and murder Jewish communities that border them in 1967 the 19-year control of the Egyptians in the Gaza Strip ends with a Six-Day War what was that war a quick reminder it's this incredibly Swift six day battle where Israel quadruples its landmass in a strategic attempt to push hostile forces further away from its borders and to gain some strategic depth this is when Gaza first came under Israeli control over the years tension between Gaza and Israel continued to rise but in 1993 things seemed like they could change for the best with the start of the Oslo Accords finally the time is approaching when there will be safety in Israel's house when the Palestinian people will write their own destiny so sidebar what are the Oslo Accords the Oslo Accords were a series of agreements starting in the early '90s that were supposed to gradually bring together the Israelis on the one side the Palestinians on the other side with the ultimate goal of having two states one Jewish State called Israel one Palestinian State called Palestine the Gaza Strip was part of that agreement the first Sao Accords is basically this general statement of we accept your existence as a people which sounds basic to us today but back then there was a lot the next set of Accords was 1995 and they go way farther into detail of where the borders are going to be what the future Palestinian state is going to look like and again all of this encompasses also the Gaza Strip at the same time as Israel government and the Palestinian leadership are negotiating there are extremists on both sides who are strongly opposed to these Accords in Israel an extremist murders are then prime minister isin in the Palestinian side you have the Hamas and the Islamic Jihad Palestinian terrorist organizations who do everything they can to stop the Accords and what does everything they can mean it means they're murdering Israeli civilians in the streets of our country in 2000 we have this big attempt to jump start the oso Accords in which the US of course the Israelis and the Palestinians come together in Camp David in the US to try and rekindle this ongoing discussion UD Bak is our prime minister at the time he shows up with whatever mandate he had from the government and Y Al Palestinian leader shows up and for whatever reason he can't or will not move on with the Accords if you look at the big picture timeline of history that last Camp David meeting is sort of the last ditch attempt attempt to restart the oso Accords after that we really never have an effective one in fact the Palestinians start what we now call the second intifada in late 2000 which is a 5year ongoing terrorist attack on the heart of Israel it was suicide bombers blowing up on buses in cafes in malls across Israel that is the reality I grew up to as a teenager the Palestinians did everything they could to sabotage the peace Accords and on the Israeli side our population strongly lost faith that there's a chance to really reach meaningful peace of the Palestinians many years down the line we find out that arafat's second in that was marketed as this Grassroots movement wasn't as spontaneous as it was pegged to be in fact it was meticulously planned by the PLO by the Palestinian Authority to sabotage the peace with Israel so how is all of this related to the god of strip and today's topic let's go back to the Gaza Strip so from the 9s through the early 2000s Gaza has a mix of Palestinian cities which are the vast majority of the population in Israeli communities that are spread out on the coast on the Eastern side and in the north of the Gaza STP in the absence of Peace negotiations with the Palestinians and in response to the ongoing threat of terrorism in 2005 the Israeli government led by Ariel Shon does something that no one has ever done in history we decided to pull out of the Gaza Strip with no agreement with no preconditions with nothing just with a point to stop the violence to stop the terrorism every Israeli Citizen and Soldier are pulled out of the Gaza Strip till the last one it's important to know that this was not easy for the Israeli people in fact till this day the 2005 disengagement from the Gaza Strip is considered to be one of the most divisive events in Israeli history till this day people talk back to that event as one of the causes for our current political conflict no more Israelis inside the strip no Israeli military presence the Israeli Gaza border crossings were to be used only for the passage of goods Aid and individuals with permits from within Gaza into Israel or Goods into Gaza control of the Gaza Egypt border was handed over to Egypt and the expectation was that this move on our end would allow the Palestinian in the Gaza Strip to finally have the peace to have the freedom that they wanted to have the control of their own land and to finally move away from violence so Israel withdraws from the Gaza Strip in 2005 leaves behind the Palestinians who a year later 2006 have national elections the Hamas wins they don't win all the votes but they win enough to overthrow the fat the PLO and they don't do this in the Democratic way they violently and murderously throw them out of the Gaza Strip there have been no other election since in Gaza so the Gaza Strip was now under Hamas control which openly called and still calls for the destruction of the entire state of Israel we continue to give them water we continue to give them electricity we continue to have tens of thousands of Palestinians work inside of Israel and the violence continues from the Gaza STP again and again and again the Israeli Gaza border has been the crossing point of numerous terrorist attacks abusing Israel's permits coming into the country to kill soldiers and civilians alike and the communities along the Israeli side of the Border have become so accustomed to the rocket attacks from the Gaz inside that everywhere you look you'll see bomb shelters with a hostile entity along its border Israel resorted to tightening the Border points between Israel and Gaza saying if you want open passage at least recognize our country's right to exist since 2006 that has not not yet happened I think if there was anyone who had any doubts about how much of a necessity having a strong border with the Gaza Strip is those doubts disappeared on October 7th with a vicious attack of the Hamas against the innocent civilians of Israel there's this claim that's constantly made that Israel is the one that controls all the entry and exit of the Gaza Strip but that's of course not true Israel controls the Eastern side and the northern side bordering with Israel but they have a whole big border that borders with the Egyptians and that border is controlled by the Egyptians since 2005 so who benefits the misleading statement that Gaza is a prison controlled by Israel there are ulterior motives at play here Hamas are a terrorist group that is part of Iran's Network it's Iran fighting through Hamas attacking Israel the biggest victims of the Hamas actions and the Iranian government behind them are the Palestinian people living in the Gaza Strip if you've seen any of the footage coming out of the Gaza Strip lately it's impossible not to feel empathy and compassion for the people of that strip the Hamas took the water pipes that were donated and they used it for Rockets they took the fertilizer meant for building the land and used it for explosives they took the construction materials continuously brought in to build tunnels to attack Israel because the Hamas policy has been destructive and devastating to the people of the Gaza Strip that is the reality of what's happening on the ground so where does this all leave us what do we do with all this information we have to understand how important it is to have a strong border between Israel and the Hamas in the Gaza STP the people of Gaza deserve a peaceful life they deserve Prosperity they deserve quiet as do the people of Israel and with Hamas control of the Gaza Strip that's simply never going to happen if Gaza is a prison then Hamas are the prison guards

which flared up again in October 7th 2023 is a deeply rooted issue with layers of historical religious and territorial complexities while many contemporary discussions Trace its Origins to the establishment of Israel in 1948 its roots delve much deeper spanning nearly 3,000 years in the 8th Century BC de the territories now identified as Israel and Palestine were under the Dominion of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel these kingdoms were the political manifestations of various Jewish tribes concurrently the ancestors of the Palestinians often referred to as the Philistines in ancient scriptures occupied a stretch of land from the Gaza Strip to Tel Aviv the Old Testament a foundational text for Judaism cites God's promise of a vast tract of land to Abraham's Descendants the Israelites this Divine promise became a Cornerstone for early territorial disputes by 722 BCE the Assyrians under King Sargon second reshaped the geopolitical landscape by annexing the Kingdom of Israel to suppress potential rebellions the Assyrians adopted a strategy of population displacement this led to the Jews gradual assimilation with diverse cultures across the Assyrian Empire diluting their unique identity the late 7th Century BCE saw another Power transition as the Babylonians replaced the Assyrians they controlled vast territories including Jerusalem Jewish resistance against Babylonian dominance led to the destruction of Solomon's Temple in 587 BCE marking the onset of the Babylonian exile however the Winds of Change blew again in 539 BCE when the Persians under the leadership of King Cyrus the Great overthrew the Babylonians Cyrus allowed the exiled Jews to return to Jerusalem he also sponsored the Reconstruction of Solomon's Temple a significant gesture that endeared him to the Jewish populace by 63 BCE the Roman Empire extended its tentacles to Jerusalem the subsequent centuries under Roman rule were tumultuous for the Jewish Community two major revolts against the Romans resulted in catastrophic losses for the Jews leading to a diaspora where many fled Roman [Music] persecution the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire added another layer of complexity Jews faced intensified persecution being blamed for Jesus's crucifixion this persecution persisted until 638 CE when Muslims under Calif Umar conquered the region this Conquest ushered in a period of relative religious tolerance allowing Jews to return to Jerusalem for the subsequent centuries the majority of Jews resided in Europe where they faced a myriad of challenges including discrimination pograms and socioeconomic restrictions conversely the period of Ottoman Dominion in Jerusalem spanning from 1517 to 1917 was of considerable importance for the Jewish community in the city the Jewish population in Jerusalem saw a significant uptick during the Ottoman Reign by the onset of the 19th century Jews emerged as the most substantial religious group in the city under the ottoman administrative structure Jews were categorized as a demi Community denoting their status as protected non-muslim subjects although they faced certain financial obligations and limitations they were predominantly allowed the freedom to practice their religious Customs unhindered by the late 19th century Theodore herel a Visionary Jewish journalist proposed a radical solution the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine his Zionist ideology gained traction especially after the British government's balour declaration in 1917 which endorsed the idea of a Jewish homeland in

states with Jerusalem as an international City the Jewish leadership accepted the UN partition plan but the Arab leadership did not on May 14th 1948 David benuron declared the establishment of the state of Israel this declaration was met with military intervention by neighboring Arab states leading to the 1948 Arab Israeli War by the end of the war war in 1949 Israel had expanded its territory

took control of Gaza in 2007 the peace talks that resumed in September 2010 were part of ongoing efforts to resolve long-standing issues between Israel and the Palestinian Authority however they quickly broke down due to Israel's settlement activities in the West Bank Israel has maintained a blockade on the Gaza Strip aiming to restrict the flow of goods and resources to Hamas which Israel

of the most bizarre places in the world. I just crossed over from Israel into the West
Bank. If you look at a map of where I am right now,
you will see a jumbled mess of of Palestinian towns shown here in green, and Israeli
settlements, which are blue. Many people think of this territory as Palestine. But of the 3 million people living out here,
almost twenty percent of them are Jewish Israeli citizens. The Israelis living out here are called settlers. They live in the West Bank but are citizens
of Israel. As I drive I’m looking at effectively two
different nations, woven into each other through decades of conflict,
I visited 15 settlements all over the West Bank, talking to the people who have decided
to pack up and move to middle of this disputed land. We’ll meet them in coming videos. But first let’s look at the maps that explain
how the West Bank got to looking like this. So let’s first go back to 1948, when the
map looks a lot different. Back then, all this land was controlled by
Great Britain. Due to growing tension between Jews and Arabs,
the UN worked with the Britain to split the land into two states, one for Jews, Israel,
and one for Arabs, Palestine. The Jews accepted the plan and declared independence. But the Arab states in the region saw this
plan as just more European colonialism. They didn’t accept the plan and declared
war with Israel. Israel won the war, pushing well past the
borders of the UN plan. During the peace negotiations, a ceasefire
line was drawn in green ink. It became known as the green line. It wasn’t a border, just a ceasefire line
with this being the state of Israel, and this section being controlled by Jordan, who had
taken control of it during the war they just fought. The Jordanians named this newly-seized land
the West Bank because it was West of the Jordan River. The fragile ceasefire remained until 1967
when Israel fought another war with its Arab neighbors. Israel wasn’t looking to take over land
in the war, but In just six days of fighting, it blew past the Green Line and seized a whole
swath of land, including the entire West Bank. Suddenly Israel had a decision to make: do
they make the West Bank a part of Israel and give the 1.1 million Arabs living there Israeli
citizenship and voting rights? Do they give back the land to their enemy
Jordan or else let the people create their own Palestinian state? This became a major debate in Israeli politics. Many Israelis saw this war they just won not
only as a military victory but a religious sign that the Jews were meant to return to
the the place where a huge amount of Jewish ancient history happened, the hills of ancient
Judea and Samaria, which was basically the entire West Bank. So while the government was debating what
to do, Israeli civilians began moving into the West Bank without any permission from
the government. They just starting setting up homes, establishing
a Jewish presence in this region. Suddenly, any debate about what to do with
the West Bank had to take this growing number of Israeli civilians into consideration. This is how the the settler movement was born. The rest of the world did not approve of this. As the settler presence grew, the UN issued
a resolution saying that the settlements had “...no legal validity and constitute a serious
obstruction to achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.” Two different narratives emerged here: One
said Jewish civilians were moving onto mostly empty plots of land that they had captured
in a war and that had deep historical and spiritual significance to them. The other side, which is the side most of
the world took, said that these settlers were colonizing land to expand their nation. The settler project was widely seen as apart
of an illegal occupation of the West Bank. In spite of international condemnation, the
number of settlers grew quickly. Over the next few decades, more and more factions
of the Israeli government began to support the settler movement, allocating public resources
and granting permits for building. The Israeli housing ministry and military
began developing plans for how to build up the West Bank. They built roads throughout the entire region,
allowing for easy access between settlements and mainland Israel. More and more building permits were given
out and new planned communities began popping up all over the West Bank. The settlements slowly shifted from a fringe
group of motivated civilians to an institutionalized part of Israeli society, totally supported
by the state. Here are the Palestinian towns in the West
Bank. As settler activity surged in the 80s and
90s, watch how the settlements weave around these towns. Palestinians didn’t like this encroachment. They began protesting, sometimes with extreme
violence. Between the violence and the condemnation
from the international community of the settlements, the situation became unsustainable. So in the mid 90s American president Bill
Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat signed
the Oslo Accords, agreements that established Palestinian government and split the West
Bank into 3 sections. Area A gave Palestinians total control over
security and government. This makes up about 18% of the West Bank but
most of the palestinian population centers. This gave the Palestinian government self
rule for the first time. Area B was designated for Palestinian government
control while retaining Israeli security control, meaning the Israeli military remains very
present. Area B is about 22% of the West Bank. Area C Remained completely under Israeli military
and government control. This is where all the settlements are. It is about 60% of the West Bank. So this is how we ended up with this mess
of a map. Israelis can easily come and go to mainland
Israel through really nice roads that go straight to settlements. They call these “flyovers” because they
bypass Palestinian villages and give easy access from one settlement to another, although
not every settlement has a flyover road like this. Palestinians can drive on almost all roads
in the West Bank but their movement it often more difficult, having to stop at checkpoints
or have their car inspected by a soldier. But perhaps the biggest difficulty faced by
palestinians is how restricted their economy is due to this carved up land. Area C contains the majority of the West Banks
agricultural land, as well as water and mineral resources. Palestinians companies are severely restricted
in accessing these resources which takes a huge hit on their economy. So with these three sections agreed upon by
both sides, the settlements continued to grow within Area C. But in 2005 something happened
that would ignite even more passion for the settler movement., Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon decided to remove 8,500 settlers from the Gaza strip, another disputed area. Seeing Israelis being evicted, their homes
demolished, left a huge mark on the country, especially the settlers. They immediately redoubled their efforts to
settle the West Bank. The numbers continued to grow. Most people who think about resolution to
this conflict propose a two state solution, meaning giving the Palestinians a state somewhere
in the West Bank region. But if you look at this map you can see what
it’s getting harder and harder to do that. The settlers living in Area C of the West
Bank are not living in tents or Caravans. They are living in developed communities with
schools, hospitals and even a university. In the next video I will go inside the settlements
and talk to the people living there."

It was not easy to make.",2022-10-04,3007463,97312,18216,UCJsUvAqDzczYv2UpFmu4PcA, this is the most controversial video I will make and it's about Israel and Palestine and more than 10 million people have asked for this video so here it is with no filters and I hope you watch to the end I'm going to take you on a journey to finally understand my Israel and my Palestine in 1992 God gave me the greatest gift in the world to be born in the most controversial place on Earth inside of Israel to a Palestinian family yes 20 of Israel is not Jewish it is made of people like me Muslim Arab Palestinian for Generations but born under the Israeli government with an Israeli identity and passport I wish I was born in Denmark instead with blonde hair and blue eyes but I wasn't my unique controversial background helped me see things not many people can see for one I saw what Palestinians see I was called a terrorist by a 15 year old Jewish girl I was almost attacked by an Israeli soldier and I was stuck at checkpoints for hours I saw what Israelis see I saw Rockets fall on Israel I hid in a bomb shelter with Israeli friends and I saw Jews afraid for their life I opened my Facebook and I saw my Palestinian friend who lost his innocent cousin from an Israeli airstrike I scroll and I see my Israeli friend who lost his brother from a Palestinian who stabbed him in the back outside of the conflict I saw Palestinians living in refugee camps just because they're Palestinians where are you from I saw Jews kicked out of the Middle East just because they're Jewish what's in common with everything you saw suffering pain anger suffering it exists on both sides both sides and no one can deny that no one suffering pain anger you know a lot of people want to see Israel disappear I don't I think Israel should exist because it has good people inside of it and I think Palestine should exist because it has good people inside of it and that's why I think it's not one or the other and I really don't like it when everybody keeps saying it's one country it's fake countries it's it's a stupid argument Israel and Palestine is not a game where people get to pick sides and cheer on them from a distance for you it's a conflict that's thousands of miles away but for me it's life and death if Israel doesn't exist that means the death of my family if Palestine doesn't exist that means the death of my people that's why we need two independent countries for two people living side by side in peace with no one dying not from an airstrike or a knife attack it's my job and yours to push for a solution that stops the suffering it's been going for 74 years non-stop my solution is simple bring people together not apart this is why we make these videos this is why we support the many Israelis who want peace and the Palestinians who need peace we hired six Palestinians in my company and we hired three Israelis too we invested in real estate in Palestine and we invested in tech companies in Israel too this video is not about me this is not about Israel or Palestine this is about every conflict in the world the extremists on both sides will force you to join them and be them but you are not them you are not an extremist who wants to keep the suffering Alive You and I I just want a solution so instead of siding with the extremist get out of your village and befriend an enemy you will see what I saw for 30 years you will see that they want the same things you do you want a home you want a job you want a family but above all you just want to live you know there's a very sad thing and there's a very sad thing I made this like 12 year old kid in one of the two countries I'm not going to say which and he told me I love your videos because I also want peace and immediately the people around him said no you can't say that we want Justice for ourselves and we want to defeat the enemy one year later the kid was saying I want to defeat the enemy and that was the saddest thing I saw in my life

tight spot on top of the growing tensions in Europe the fabric of the empire was starting to fray with Independence movements cropping up in every corner and some with violent agitation and one of the most controversial was coming from the Mandate for Palestine two populations with claims to the land based on history religion and political promises from the British government Vie for control one population working within the system the other seeking to overwhelm it these tensions and agitations eventually exploded in 1936 when the Arabs across the Mandate took up arms against both the British and the Jews whose mere presence they despised the story of the great Vault doesn't start in 1936 but when exactly you should start it is kind of difficult to parse because depending on when exactly you started you end up placing more blame on one group or the other and considering how much of a cesspool the comment sections of my videos about the Israeli Arab and Palestinian conflicts are I am going to start this story in the aftermath of World War One for Pure simplicity's sake but before we get on with the video I want to tell you about myheritage in my videos I typically cover the wider geopolitical facets of modern conflicts but smaller scale history matters as well which is why I partnered with myheritage it's a tool that can help you piece together your family's history just as National and international history can explain why a country is the way it is family history tree can help explain why you are the way you are and my Heritage helps you do just that myheritage has this handy tool for helping you build a family tree allowing for a fractal-like expanse of your family tree as far as you can dive and it didn't take very long for my Heritage to discover more family members I hadn't added yet making the process that much easier while researching my grandparents I actually found some photos of my grandmother from her High School yearbook that I'm sure she'll be surprised to see and they do this by scouring over 19 billion different documents in their records you can have photos of your family which can really bring your family tree to life and they even have a feature where they can colorize black and white photos as well as animate them my Heritage also offers DNA testing so you can get even more granular with your heritage and find people around the world you had no idea you are related to if researching and building out your family tree is of interest to you then I have good news because myheritage has a special offer for viewers of this channel you can get a 14 day free trial file and use all the features of myheritage for free and see if you enjoy the experience and if you decide to continue on with your subscription after the trial you'll get 50 off thanks again to myheritage for sponsoring this video but for now back to the history now for this video I'm going to be discussing the pre-1919 period as little as needed but if you want more context on that right now or preferably after you finish watching this video then I suggest watching either this video from the Great War Channel or checking out Sam aarono's Channel you know it's like if he hasn't gotten to this stuff already I know he will eventually so by 1919 British forces with substantial help from local Arab populations had driven the ottoman Turks out of the Levant it had been a subdivision of the province of Syria and very few Arabs would have identified as Palestinian and even the idea of being Arab wasn't a super strong unifier certainly weaker than the loyalty to their Clans and families many histories of the late Ottoman Empire tend to emphasize the second class stature of Arabs within the Ottoman Empire but in reality they had been an invaluable asset in governing the southern half of the caliphate Southern Syria in particular which would go on to Encompass the Mandate for Palestine was dominated by a set of Arab families frequently referred to as the notables you had the khalidis a Jerusalem family that traditionally provided civil servants for the provincial government as well as judges for the local Sharia courts you had the alamis who also provided civil servants to the Ottomans as well as frequently occupying the mayorship of Jerusalem yet the nisabes whose family had a history of manufacturing weapons for the Sultan's Army as well as holding the keys to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and then you had the husseinis who were the most frequent occupiers of the Mufti ship of Jerusalem which controlled the religious sites and institutions of the province and appointed imams for the mosques of Jerusalem these families all traced their lineage back to descendants of the prophet and thus were the first ones alarmed when the zionists began encroaching upon their privileged status again if you want to know the history of early Zionism check out Sam arenau the Great War or even some of the videos from unpacked but the extremely short version is that in the latter half the 19th century we saw a concerted effort by Jews and Eastern Europe to escape anti-jewish programs by immigrating to ottoman Palestine these early settlers faced little opposition from the local populace due to being small in number as well as their relative poverty but when Jews in Central Europe Western Europe and the United States began taking an interest in Zionism they began to contribute funds to help buy more land in Palestine and to provide the resources and expertise that allowed Jewish settlers to drain swamps and build thriving Farms this is when you get the notables starting to complain about the presence of the Jews claiming that they were buying up all the best land taking their jobs and trying to replace them the Ottomans had placed restrictions on Jewish immigration and land purchases in the latter years but these were all done away with when the British took over in January 1919 Prince faizel met with Keim weitzmann the president of the Zionist organization the two would sign an agreement in which Faisal endorsed the Balfour Declaration with the understanding that the Jewish homeland would be separate from his future Arab State this signed agreement would be brought to the Versailles conference and the eventual San Remo conference would formalize the division of the Levant between the British and French the British helped the Jews establish their own governing institutions to handle settlement and finance and they attempted to set up parallel institutions for the Arabs as well but the Arabs of Palestine were divided along Clan and familial lines but just as important was their opposition to the growing Jewish presence the pan-arabist amongst the notables refused to cooperate with these parallel institutions because they saw as acquiescing to and legitimizing of the Jewish presence in Palestine the Jews would create the Palestine Zionist executive which was later renamed the Jewish agency which became subject to the world Zionist organization headed by kaim weitzmann the Zionist movement wasn't monolithic with feitzman himself being a classical liberal in the anglo-american sense while the Labor zionists led by David bengurion were social Democrats and would dominate the Jewish agency in its early years prioritizing the immigration of Jews with socialist backgrounds to the Mandate over over more conservative Jews the Arabs failed to establish their own secular governing institutions to rival the Jewish agency instead they founded more locally Centric associations consisting of both Muslim and Christian Arabs with the notables favoring unification with Syria under Prince Faisal who had recently been proclaimed as king of Greater Syria and inspired a revolt against the French the most successful Arab institutions would be religious during the Great War the Mufti of Jerusalem Kamil al-husseini cooperated with the British occupation and in return the British elevated his title to Grand Mufti and placed him in charge of the Supreme Muslim Council which replaced the older ottoman institutions that govern Sunni religious Affairs in Palestine the council would not just control the appointment of imams in Jerusalem but throughout the entire mandate in April of 1920 the Mufti led the all-nabi festival procession which led Muslims on a pilgrimage from Jerusalem to the tomb of Moses located at a mosque outside of Jericho however the procession would be incited into a ma job by two of its participants Arif alorith the owner of a local Arab newspaper and Amin al-husseini the younger brother of the Mufti Arif and Amin were pan-arabists and supported King faisal's Revolt in Syria arief's newspaper had spread a rumor that the British military supported Palestine being annexed by Faisal Syria the riot expanded into the old city in Jerusalem which saw Arabs randomly assaulting Jewish pedestrians robbing Jewish shops and vandalizing synagogues not making any distinction between the newly arrived Jews from Europe or the native population of Mizrahi Jews the Jewish communities responded by setting up their own patrols the British would declare martial law taking three days to restore order five Jews and four Arabs would be killed with 200 other casualties over 200 people would be arrested and at least a quarter of them were Jewish one of the arrested Jews was ziv jabatinski a co-founder of the Jewish Legion that fought for the British in the Great War and the father of revisionist Zionism a right-leaning variant of Zionism that believed in the establishment of a Jewish state that encompassed territory on both sides of the Jordan River claiming the maximal extent of the old Jewish and Israelite kingdoms additionally the mayor of Jerusalem Musa qazim hussaini the uncle of Camille and Amin was removed from office for helping his nephew incite the riots after the failure of the Revolt in Syria as well as that of the riots in Jerusalem Musa kazim al-husseini told other Arabs we must introduce a basic change in our plans here Palestine is Southern Syria no longer exists we must defend Palestine it would take several decades before his conception of Palestine as a separate entity within the wider Arab world would take old Arif and amine would be sentenced to 10 years in prison but they would Escape Justice by first fleeing to Jordan and then reaching Damascus where they sought Refuge amongst the pan-arabist communities he would become a popular figure amongst the Arabs of Palestine being proclaimed a national hero the British military government would be replaced by a civilian government in July of 1920 which would be headed by the High Commissioner for Palestine and trans Jordan sir Herbert Samuel who made a name for himself within British politics by being the first Jew to hold a cabinet position and he was instrumental in getting much of the leadership of the conservative party to support Zionism knowing that his jewishness would make him less trusted amongst the Arabs of Palestine one of his first actions as High Commissioner would be to declare a general amnesty for the rioters which would eventually be extended to both Arif and Amin who would receive a hero's welcome some in the British government were hopeful they could appease the Arabs by creating independent Arab monarchies the colonial secretary Winston Churchill hoped that giving the defeated Faisal his own Kingdom in Iraq along with giving his brother Abdullah a kingdom in trans Jordan would be enough to appease the Arab nationalists in Palestine but it wouldn't because the Arabs were preoccupied with denying the legitimacy of the Jews rather than building up Arab power and prestige a month after the al-nabi riots Ani Abdel Hadi an associate of King Abdullah had told a British official we will not rest until Palestine is either placed under a free Arab government or becomes a graveyard for all the Jews in the country we will finish them off one by one if not in a month than in a year if not in a year then in 10 years but our goal will be achieved and there is nothing that can prevent us from achieving it slowly but surely Arab newspapers fed their literate populations a steady diet of propaganda and fear-mongering which made the process of governing Palestine much more difficult for the British in the first place the people discovered that the disasters which they had been told were about to fall upon them did not in fact occur yet tax upon their Villages by well-armed Jewish colonists which some of the agitators had announced did not take place the day when a hundred thousand Jews were to disembark in Palestine in order to occupy their lands came and went and there was no such Invasion month followed month and year followed Year and no man had his land taken from him so far from the mosques being closed and turned into synagogues a new purely Muslim elected body was created to which the control of all Muslim religious buildings and of their endowments was transferred it rebuilt those that were in ruins it began to restore those that needed restoration it is difficult under such conditions to maintain indefinitely an attitude of alarm people cannot be induced to remain constantly mobilized against a danger which never eventuates the zionists were not happy with the amnesty granted by the High Commissioner and since the riots had already begun to prepare for future attacks by creating their own militia the hagana under British Administration the Hogan were legally considered terrorists but British authorities were willing to look the other way due to their inability to protect Jewish communities jabotinsky and his revisionists were also upset at the creation of transjordan believing the territory was the god-given right of the Jews as part of the promised land one of the most fateful decisions the British made during the Mandate period was in March of 1921 when they supported Amin al-husseini the man who instigated the al-nabi riots to succeed his brother Camille as Grand Mufti Kamil al-husseini died in March and all the major notables nominated their own candidates Each of which had years of experience studying Islam or serving as judges in Sharia courts but the husseinis would nominate Amin despite him being at most 26 years old with hardly any religious training but the husseinis had a few aces up their sleeve the British were very aware of how controversial it would be for a Christian Sovereign to meddle in the religious Affairs of non-Christian peoples they had learned this the hard way in India the British also had a predisposition to maintain the ottoman-era order of Palestine as much as possible and considering the husseini family were the most frequent holders of the office and the Amin was the younger brother of the most recent Mufti they saw this as maintaining continuity but more important than any of that the British like most of Europe were strapped for cash and weren't interested in putting down a rebellion and I mean with the support of the al-husseini clan could easily Foster one so in hopes of avoiding further violence and bloodshed they would Place their support behind amine despite him being a virulent anti-semite the husseinis themselves would get the other families to withdraw their candidates through a combination of threats and bribery Amin al-husseini would be elected Grand Mufti by an electoral college consisting of imam's Islamic scholars and local councils this placed Amin in control of the Supreme Muslim Council which controlled the appointment of imams to mosques around Palestine and he would use this power to appoint radical clerics spreading his extremist message the Mufti report we said this to the High Commissioner just as it is impossible to put two swords into the same sheath it is impossible to squeeze two people into one small country there is no place in Palestine for two races the Jews left Palestine two thousand years ago let them go to other parts of the world where there are wide vacant places one of the mufti's associates izat darwaza would say Palestine is a purely Arab land and there is no possibility that another people with their own language customs and traditions and a contradictory political goal could live with them Amin actively sought to Foster anti-semitic attitudes amongst the Arabs of Palestine he would take a page out of the history of Europe delving into over a millennium's worth of religious writings within Islam to justify pogroms against the Jews the Mufti would also become an Avid Reader of the protocols of the Elders of Zion quoting them at length in letters lectures sermons and in interviews he even had the Supreme Muslim Council distribute Abridged versions of it and pamphlets another it would break out in Jaffa on May 1st of 1921 two competing Jewish rallies one consisting of Labor zionists and the other of marxists clashed in the streets local Arabs would take advantage of the Jewish infighting to assault both groups along with looting Jewish homes and shops and they were joined by local Arab policemen British troops would arrive later that day to restore order 27 Jews were killed and over a hundred were wounded members of the hagenob would seek revenge by assaulting Arabs and breaking into their homes these retaliations escalated into riots as well resulting in about 50 Arabs and 50 Jews killed after the all-nabi riots back in 1920 the British set up a commission to investigate the causes and concluded that the route were Arab fears that the Jews would demographically economically and politically dominate them and they would blame the Zionist leadership for doing nothing to mitigate these fears Colonial secretary Churchill would publish a white paper in response to the commission's report in 1922 which restated the British support for the Balfour Declaration but rejected the idea of Palestine becoming a holy Jewish entity the only restriction on Jewish immigration it proposed was one based on economic capacity now the economic picture of the Mandate period is complex but if you were to read the Arab narratives of the time they would imply or just explicitly state that the Arab standard of living either stagnated or got worse which is just patently false in this time period the Arab population grew faster than it did in most other Arab countries and this was due to improvements made in healthcare infrastructure and Financial Resources provided in large part by the British colonial Administration as well as the Jewish immigrants bringing money and technical skills the Arab population grew by over 50 percent between 1920 and 1936 and it's fairly clear this jump was because of Jewish immigration because the biggest growth happened in cities with large Jewish immigrant communities cities such as Haifa Jaffa and Jerusalem saw the Arab populations grow by 86 62 and 37 respectively while in purely Arab towns such as Nablus Hebron and Gaza it only grew by seven and two percent the standard of living for Palestinians living in cities with large Jewish populations was higher than those of neighboring Arab states Arab Farmers benefited as well with more technology and capital available life expectancy Grew From 37 in 1926 to 50 by 1944 and child mortality shrank by 34 percent in the first year 31 in the second 57 in the third 64 in the fourth and 67 in the fifth year there's also the issue of land sales and again if you read the Arab accounts of this they would basically make it look like it was just Jews would show up to a random Arab farm with a bunch of British stalls urges and just outright steal the land but that was not the case the Jews and Zionist institutions bought every square inch of land they owned and again Arab newspapers were responsible for spreading misinformation about this by 1935 a year before the Revolt individual Jews and zionists institutions collectively owned a total of seven percent of the land in Palestine despite encompassing nearly 30 percent of the population the reports of the Jews buying up all the land and all the best land is a distortion by the very self-evident jealousy of the Arab journalists in the early years of the Mandate it was the large landowners that sold most of the land to the zionists Amin himself did not sell land to the Jews but he acted very angry at those who did calling it a crime against God but punishment and intimidation for doing so were mostly reserved for smaller landowners despite his public pronouncements against the Jews and private amine frequently sought their services to enrich himself or his clan a Jewish lawyer he hired Bernard Joseph would say Arab nationalists were never allowed to harm the interests of the husseini family the mufti's cousin Jamal husseini would use a Jewish lawyer in a litigation battle over a land dispute with a rival Arab family and then proceeded to sell that land to Jews now although the lies of Arabs did materially improve that Improvement wasn't evenly distributed obviously the Arabs that lived near large Jewish communities benefited more than those living further away but the Zionist institutions tried to economically isolate themselves from the rest of Palestine the Jewish agency and the National Fund constructed settlements for Jewish immigrants to live and work in this resulted in the Jewish community building up their own infrastructure and farms and they hired almost exclusively Jewish workers this was done for a few reasons firstly the zionists were fighting against age-old anti-semitic stereotypes throughout the history of Christian Europe the Jews were frequently referred to as landless people who were living off the labor of Gentiles while never producing any material wealth on their own by the 19th century the Jews of Europe had taken up careers that required a lot of education and had become a sizable presence within Finance but this was because the various rulers of Europe for over a millennium had forced them to in most of Europe for the last Thousand Years Jews weren't allowed to own land which meant they couldn't be Farmers they were also kept out of most specialized trades due to Medieval guilds frequently requiring its members to be baptized which keeps practicing Jews out of those professions Additionally the Christian Bible prohibited Christians from usury which is the charging of interest on financial loans however Jewish scripture was typically interpreted as only forbidding usury against co-religionists meaning they could charge interests on loans to non-jews but not fellow Jews charging interest on loans is the easiest way to make a profit in finance which resulted in far fewer Christians being involved Christian rulers in Europe would thus use their local Jewish communities to fund their War efforts borrowing money often with implied or explicit threats that if they didn't lend them the money they would be punished the Christian rulers would continue to borrow money until they couldn't afford to repay their lenders anymore at which point they would expel the Jews from their territory and confiscate their property this happened repeatedly throughout European history forced the Jews into a position where finance and usury was their only means of earning a living and then condemn and punish them for doing it another reason for Zionist institutions only hiring Jewish workers was political ideology at this time and basically until the 1970s labor zionists had a monopoly on most Zionist political institutions and they envisioned a future socialist Homeland for the Jews where everyone worked on Collective Farms it would be a classless society where nobody earned a profit off the labor of someone else since about three-fourths of all Jewish workers were members of the history a labor union it was easier to guarantee good worker relations with Jewish workers than Arab ones who did not have an organized Union the third reason for only hiring Jewish workers was simple practicality most of the Jews didn't speak Arabic and most of the Arabs didn't speak Hebrew or whatever European language they were communicating in it was also done in order to make the Jews of Palestine economically self-sufficient they didn't want to become dependent on the Gentiles for food labor or protection this policy made the Jews a more sticky presence in Palestine possessing the ability to support and defend themselves but for decades they were tort to Arab critics was that everybody would be better off but by excluding Arab workers from the upper echelons of the Jewish economy the zionists failed to get any Arab stakeholders into the Zionist project the Arab notables tolerated the Jewish presence so long as they could earn a profit from land sales throughout the Mandate period all the anti-zionist factions continued to protest the British government against the Jews being permitted to buy land if nobody had been willing to sell the Jews obviously could not have bought but Arab owners eagerly took advantage of a booming Market even acquiring new properties in order to sell them and a bunch of them did so believing that that land would eventually just make it back into their hands because they assumed the Jews would either eventually be expelled or exterminated and this belief was perpetuated and exacerbated by the grand Mufti how can the Jews be respected for their wealth at a time when they spread wickedness and misery throughout the world they tortured their innocent prophets killed John the Baptist rejected Jesus the corrupt morality in every single country destroy all religions and sympathize with communist Russia they robbed people's property steal money by usury and distort the prophets preaching of course the Arabs weren't alone in believing that there was little hope of coexistence between them and the Jews in his 1923 article the Iron Wall ziv javotinski predicted that the Arabs would not ignore the growing Jewish presence in Palestine indefinitely and that they would actively fight against the establishment of a Jewish State as long as the Arabs feel that there is at least hope of getting rid of us they refused to give up this hope in return for either kind words of a bread and butter because they are not a rebel but the living people and when a living people yields in matters of such a vital character it is only when there is no longer any hope of getting rid of us because they can make no breach in the iron War not till then will they drop their extremist leaders but unlike most Arab writers jabatinski did see a path forward then we may expect them to discuss honestly practical questions such as a guarantee against Arab displacement or equal rights for Arab citizens or Arab National integrity and when that happens I am convinced that ouijos will be found ready to give them satisfactory guarantees so that both peoples can live together in peace like good neighbors by the late 20s the Arab leaders realized they did not possess the means to defeat the zionists on their own and so they worked on internationalizing the conflict making anti-zionism the unifying force of pan-arabism and Islam the grand Mufti did this by trying to increase the perceived importance of Islamic holy sites in Palestine with a particular emphasis on the Al-Aqsa mosque now there are numerous holy sites within Islam but which ones are important was largely Regional the cities of Mecca and Medina were deemed important by all Muslims but Jerusalem was at best a distant third in importance and for the most part it was only really important to Muslims in the Levant otherwise most Muslim communities had their own local holy sites occupy that third spot Amin all husseini waged a propaganda War to boost the Alexa mosque's status as being on par with Mecca and Medina and he did this by fostering and exploiting fears that Jews were planning on destroying the mosque and rebuilding the temple and its place in pursuit of this he also claimed that the Western Wall was an integral part of the Al-Aqsa mosque tying it to the Islamic tradition that said the wall was where Muhammad tied his winged Steed before he ascended to heaven on November 1st 1927 Amin hosted the Islamic congress with 700 representatives from across Palestine along with foreign observers they sent a delegation to the mandatory government and demanded that there be no change in the status of the Western Wall the Islamic Congress would also establish Branch organizations around the world and called for Collective action by Muslims to keep the Western Wall Islamic the Congress also declared a Prohibition on land sales to Jews and that the Mandate government removed Jews from high positions traditionally the Jews had limited rights to pray at the West Western Wall as it along with the Temple Mount was owned by the Islamic walkth the Jews had been allowed to worship at the Western Wall since ottoman times however there were numerous restrictions but more often than not the Islamic authorities were willing to look the other way especially when they were bribed but since the election of amine as Grand Mufti the restrictions were more stringently enforced any physical alteration to the site even temporary edition of furniture prompted the Muslim suspicion that the Jews were trying to find a way to give the wall the status of a synagogue as a first step in taking it over the British wanted to maintain the ottoman-era status quo for the religious sites in Palestine and for them this meant enforcing the laws as written rather than as traditionally enforced to reiterate this point the British issued a white paper in February 1928 supporting the grand mufti's position that the Jews were only allowed to pray silently at the Western Wall and were not allowed to bring benches screens or any religious artifacts with them on September 21 3rd 1928 the day before Yom Kippur a beetle from a local Ashkenazi synagogue brought a large Torah Arc lamps and a screen to the Western Wall a local Sheik saw the setup and told the British authorities that there would be violence if the Beetle and everything he brought with him wasn't removed police told the Beale to take everything down and leave but he refused in a scuffle with the police the beetle holding the Torah Ark was thrown down an alley filled with cacti which angered Jewish newspapers and sparked protests and Jewish communities the grand Mufti began a media blitz to propagandize Islamic ownership of the site the grand Mufti wrote to the government having realized the bitter experiences the unlimited greedy aspirations of the Jews Muslims believe that the Jews aim is to take possession of the moscavel aksa gradually on the pretense that it is the temple by starting with the Western Wall of this place which is an Inseparable part of the mosque Amin and the Supreme Muslim Council intentionally increased tensions at the wall they are orchestrated counter protests at government offices to pressure the British into enforcing its decision along with demonstrations at the alaqsa mosque he also ordered the museum at the Dome of the Rock to revive the Zakir ceremony which consisted of a loud chant and a drum they also built a new office for the Sharia Court overlooking the wall but the British had not given support to Amin's claim that the Western Wall was an exclusively Muslim site and tensions continued to escalate into the summer of 1929. in June 1929 Arab youths beat up an old Beetle praying at the wall a month later Muslims began banging drums gongs and symbols near the wall which was part of a recently revived Sufi chant the district commissioner demanded they stop but the Mufti would double down and built a small mosque on top of a nearby house and installed a museum to lead the five daily prayers with an apparent order to grow louder every week on August 15 1929 the day before the anniversary of the destruction of the first temple the the British reaffirmed the wall was Islamic property and banned the prayer screens in the blowing of the shafar six thousand Jews in Tel Aviv and three thousand at the wall would Gather in protest on August 16th 300 Jewish youth mostly followers of jabotinski marched to the wall after two minutes of silence they weighed the Zionist flag and sang the hatikvah and chanted the wall is ours that same day was also the prophet's birthday which the Supreme Muslim Council commemorated by Leading A procession of two thousand people to the wall where they beat up Jewish worshipers burned Jewish holy books and desecrated the scraps of paper with prayers written on them that were inserted into the cracks of the wall on August 17th a Jewish teenager was killed by Arabs after his soccer ball rolled into an Arab tomato patch in a village on the outskirts of Jerusalem in retaliation a Jewish mob then stabbed an Arab teenager who managed to survive the attack August 21st the funeral of the Jewish teenager saw cries of Vengeance which led Jewish mobs to attack Arabs at least 12 times with Arab gangs retaliating at least seven times on August 24th 1929 after Friday prayers the Imam at the Al-Aqsa mosque told the thousands of worshipers to defend their holy sites to the death go pounce on your enemies and kill that you in doing so may obtain Paradise large portions of the crowd rushed away some pulling out knives swords and pistols the crowd killed two Jews near the Jaffa gate and ran up Joffa Road attacking pedestrians and setting stores on fire in Hebron a man arrived by motorcycle and claimed that the Jews had killed hundreds of Arabs and encouraged them to kill the Jews living in Hebron a student at the Yeshiva was lynched while another managed to evade the mob by hiding in a well an Arab British official superintendent kafarata told Jewish leaders to concentrate their Community into a small number of homes saying it would be easier to defend them representatives of the move team met with kafarata ordering him to join the fight against the Jews but kafarata refused the next morning more atrocities were committed Arab mobs murdered raped and dismembered defenseless Jews 67 were killed and over 50 wounded in one day there were Arabs however who protected their Jewish neighbors letting them hide in their homes saving at least 250 of them were not for them kafarata believed not a single Jew would have survived but the assault spread to two dozen locations where Jews had settled after six days 133 Jews were killed and nearly as many Arabs would be killed by the British trying to restore order the riots became an international news story President Hoover expressed Sympathy for the zionists a Cairo newspaper al-haram said the Arabs will fight in defense of their interests if the government practices the policy of Silence it will be the Silence of the flame which will suddenly burst forth newspapers in Britain debated whether it was worth it for the British to remain in Palestine the British government responded by calling a commission of inquiry headed by Sir Walter Shaw when interviewed by the commission the grand Mufti started quoting copy of the protocols he had brought with him javitinski was also interviewed due to many of the other Witnesses referencing him he told the commission that Europe was incurably anti-semitic and thanks to the U.S restricting immigration from Eastern Europe the Jews had nowhere else to go but Palestine he wanted at least 30 000 Jews a year to come to Palestine so they could create a Jewish state with a Jewish majority population in desired eventual sovereignty after his testimony jabotinski was banned from re-entering Palestine the final report condemned the mufti's campaign around the Western Wall as incendiary but acquitted him of culpability the commission would claim that the revisionists marched to the wall on August 16 1929 was the true cause of the riots Arab testimonies had claimed that the Jews had drawn first blood but the final report rejected this the outbreak in Jerusalem on the 23rd of August was from the beginning of an attack by Arabs on Jews it also stated that Jewish violence though inexcusable were in most case cases in retaliation for wrongs already committed in 1930 another commission was set up in order to discuss the future status of the Western Wall but the grand Mufti denied All rights for Jews in Palestine not just at the Western Wall Jewish immigration to Palestine escalated in the early 1930s with the Jewish population growing from about 17 percent in 1931 to about 30 percent in 1930 but Arab newspapers radically inflated those figures along with those of land sales further radicalizing the Arabs it was the uncertain figures around illegal immigration that the Arab authorities exploited to create fear one paper wrote the day is not far off when the zionists will succeed in wiping out any trace of the Arabs from this country will the establishment of the Jewish National home end win the number of Jews in Palestine reaches 500 a million 10 million after the Jews have purchased every piece of land in Palestine trans Jordan and afterwards Syria and Iraq to stop illegal Jewish immigration the youth Congress sent one of its militias to patrol the Netanya Coast but it would spend most of its time getting into fights with local Jewish youths these militias were organized in the countryside with the safed band known as the green hand led by Ahmad tafish and the black hand and by Sheikh is Aladdin al-qasam another commission was sent to determine what should be done about the violence The Hope Simpson report was released in October 1930 and condemned the Jewish agency and histajut claiming the Arabs were in no way benefiting from the Jewish economic activity it said there wasn't much land left for Jews to buy and unless the Arab seriously modernized their agriculture further Jewish purchases would lead to a landlessness crisis what should be remembered however is that at this time Jews and Zionist institutions owned less than seven percent of the land in Palestine and most of it was not Farmland at the time they bought it a white paper would be issued the same day the report was published in which quotas on Jewish immigration would be implemented and that these quotas would be contingent on Arab employment levels rather than the capacity of the Jewish economy it also restricted land sales Keim weitzmann resigned as president of the world's ideas organization in response and a Jewish protest in Warsaw grew to around 50 000 people an international media campaign by Zionist activists with endorsements from influential figures like Winston Churchill Herbert Samuel and Lloyd George pressured the government of Ramsay McDonald to walk back the white paper which succeeded in Parliament McDonald would say that Jewish settlement was the mandate's primary purpose in February 1931. that same year Sir Arthur grenfeld walk-up was named High Commissioner for Palestine unlike most officials of his time walkup actually liked Jews and supported the Balfour Declaration despite this walk-up also genuinely cared about the welfare of the Arabs frequently meeting with random Arab farmers and asking them their opinions on issues and what they needed this led him to hire Musa Alami as an advisor who would be named his personal secretary for Arab Affairs in 1833 Musa Alami was a member of one of the Arab notable families in Jerusalem that had provided civil servants to the Ottomans as well as occupying the Mufti ship when the husseinis were out of favor Musa was educated in Britain which meant he was popular amongst British colonial officials seeing him as a window into popular Arab opinion and a moderate with whom the zionists might negotiate with he graduated from Cambridge in 1924 and returned to Palestine marrying into a pan-arabus family from Damascus and would be hired by the mandates Attorney General's office he was annoyed at the british's seeming lack of interest in the Affairs of the Arabs while also being uninspired by Arab Society who refused to organize themselves in any meaningful way against the zionists the failure of the traditional leadership of the Arab Palestinians to change British policy led to popular support shifting to more extremist figures as well as looking to the Arab states for Aid and as the frequency of assaults on Jews increased the Yeshua began organizing its own militias to protect Jewish settlement a Conference was held in Nobles by the national Arab Society led by Azad darwaza which called for setting up Arab militias and acquiring weapons as well as criticizing the Arab executive the Arab parallel to the Jewish agency The credibility of the old notables was further degraded when a report was published exposing the lackadaisical attitude many of them had toward land sales the other Arab notables would follow the popular Trend toward extremism the failure of the old institutions led to new typically more radical groups being formed in 1932 Abdel Hadi the close associate of King Abdullah of transjordan founded the independence party as a Palestinian branch of a greater pan-arabus movement the party consisted of activists and academics from outside Jerusalem who opposed the self-defeating rivalries of the notables they still saw Palestine as Southern Syria and supported annexation into trans Jordan and they typically refused to cooperate with parties that were front groups for the notables the independence party would also establish the youth congress who predominantly focused on setting up militias and attacking Jewish settlements all this while storm clouds were growing dark over Europe the Nazis came to power in January 1933 which sent the zionists into a panic the German consulate in Jerusalem raised the swastika Banner above it leading to many instances of Jewish youth sneaking onto the consulate grounds to take the flag down or deface it on March 31 1933 the grand Mufti met with the consul General who communicated to Berlin the Mufti told me that Muslims inside the wound outside of Palestine greet the new regime in Germany and the hope for the spread of fascist on anti-democratic state authority to other lands on April 1st 1933 the German government held its first boycott of Jewish stores a week later the Jews were banned from government jobs and later as lawyers doctors accountants and musicians a month later they began burning all books by Jewish authors the Mufti and other Palestinian notables met with the consul General at the Nabi Musa Shrine where they asked Germany to do all it could to keep Jews from coming to Palestine Zionist officials secretly went to Berlin to negotiate an agreement with Hitler to allow Jews in Germany to go to Palestine in exchange all of these Jews would deposit their money into a zionist-run bank that would use the money to buy German manufactured goods that would be imported into Palestine this became known as the havara agreement the yeshiv was split over the deal the labor zionists supported it as a pragmatic solution to solve the plight of Jews in Germany jabatinsky and the revisionists however would decry the deal as disgraceful the agreement's Creator Heim Arlo solaroff would be assassinated in Tel Aviv in June of 1933 the plan would bring tens of thousands of Jews to Palestine along with 35 million dollars in capital despite Hitler approving the exiling of Jews from Germany he didn't want an independent Jewish State they have no thought of building up a Jewish state in Palestine so that they might perhaps inhabit it but they only want a central organization of their International World cheating fearing that it was losing what little sway or legitimacy it had with the Arabs of Palestine the Arab executive headed by Musa kazim al-husseini called for a strike and demonstrations against the Mandate government in October of 1933. the strike lasted a week but rather than Target Jews they targeted the British protesters attacked British officials with stones and clubs and when they charged the government headquarters the police opened fire killing 26. the zionists believed that amine was behind the riots Musa Alami told the government that the Arabs were beginning to think they shouldn't work with the British at all he thought it could be expected from this prison policy is a slow death it is better to be killed in an attempt to free ourselves of our enemies than to suffer a long and protracted demise zionists in London lobbied the government to have Alami removed from his post believing that he had undue influence in the Mandate government he would be reappointed as a government advocate in the Palestine justice system and at that point he was the highest ranking Arab to hold a position in the justice system and despite being moved he still had influence amongst the mandates Executives the strikes would be Musa kazim's last major act dying in March of 1934. after his death the Arab executive ceased to be a functional institution Amin and the husseinis would try to oppose the sitting mayor of Jerusalem Rajiv al-nashibi since the husseinis didn't have quite enough power in Jerusalem for one of their own to win the election they would back the khalidis candidate Dr Hussein Al khalidi the husseinis also won the mayorships of Lida Jericho majdal telkom bietshin and Beersheba Dr khalidi's Administration would focus its attention on local Affairs thus reducing the importance of the mayorship of Jerusalem in National affairs with the nashashibi clan no longer holding the mayorship of Jerusalem they no longer controlled any significant public office resulting in the rise of more political parties in nasashibis founded the National Defense party which was opposed to the husseinis and the grand Mufti they advocated Independence for Palestine but were not pan-arabists and sought cooperation with the British they had close ties with King Abdullah of Jordan and like all of the Arab parties they were anti-zionists but they did have a cordial relation with the Jewish agency and sought some kind of arrangement with the Jews already in Palestine the husseinis would create the Palestinian Arab party which was led by the grand mufti's cousin Jalal husseini and was directly inspired by the Nazi party they were pan-arabist and demanded full and immediate Independence and rejected All rights for Jews in Palestine as tensions were Rising the heads of the Jewish agency David Ben-Gurion and mosho sharet met with Musa me to see if they could come to an arrangement between the Arabs and Jews Ben Gurion tried to convince Alami that allowing more Jews into Palestine would be beneficial to the Arabs but Alami was not open to this if it allowed the Jews to become a majority of the population Ben-Gurion then proposed the creation of a pan-arab federation with an autonomous Jewish Province the Palestinian Arabs will not be sacrificed so that Zionism might be realized according to our conception of Zionism we are need the desires nor capable of building a future in Palestine at the expense of the Arabs the Palestinian Arabs did remain where they are their lot will improve and even politically they will not be dependent on us even after we come to constitute the vast majority of the population Alami was more open to the idea of a pan-arab federation but was apprehensive about the economic disparity between the Jews and Arabs saying that he would rather the country remain poor than rely on Jewish immigration to enrich them Ben Gurion and Alami met in September of 19 1934 Alami wanted to talk economics and asked Ben Gurion why the labor zionists only employed Jews which David explained was because Jews in Europe were always accused of living off the labors of others while never working the land themselves Alami suggested that a Jewish autonomous State could be built around Tel Aviv as part of an Arab Federation with British protection he was also open to allowing unlimited Jewish immigration to Palestine but only after the formation of an Arab Federation in another talk that month in Jerusalem Alami told bengurion that the Mufti knew about their talks and that the Mufti gave his okay to continue so long as Ben-Gurion could issue a public declaration to mollify Arab fears Alami later suggested that the Mufti in bengurion meet in person Ben-Gurion would then meet with alami's father-in-law in Geneva is sanjabri the editor of the Arab nationalist paper David told him that they hope to bring 8 million Jewish immigrants into their state and make Palestine a Jewish majority State jabri balked at the the suggestion and said that the Arabs would never recognize such a state after Ben-Gurion left Geneva the contents of their meeting was published in La National despite being told the meeting was secret Ben Gurion and the Mufti would never meet and it would be another decade before he and Alami would meet again tensions continue to rise in Europe Hitler attained absolute power in 1934 upon the death of President ludendorff and proclaimed himself fuhrer he began to rebuild the German air force in violation of the Versailles treaty and in 1935 Italy invaded Ethiopia which led Arabs and Palestine to believe that the Western democracies were in Decline the Middle East and its entirety is awaiting this opportunity and is doing what it can to hasten its arrival in the belief that war is the only means whereby the Arabs could achieve their National aspirations and put an end to the Zionist threat another Arab paper called for an Arab Hitler to Rally the Arab peoples to kill the Jews once and for all Jamal husseini frequently quoted Hitler in his writings and speeches and the husseini's founded numerous organizations modeled on the Hitler Youth the Mufti would regularly meet with the German Consul in Jerusalem asking for Germany to speak out against the Jewish presence in Palestine and telling him the Muslims in Palestine and elsewhere were enthusiastic about the new regime in Germany and looked forward to the spread of fascism throughout the region in 1935 Jerusalem mayor Hussein khalidi was planning to found a moderate Arab party that would emphasize the need for a negotiated settlement the Jews have come to the country have taken its citizenship and have become Palestinians and it is impossible to throw them into the sea they have also bought lands and obtained lawful title deeds and these must be respected there is no point in ignoring these clear matters he backtracked these statements after receiving death threats from the husseinis and called for a ban on land sales and immigration of Jews to Palestine this immigration had led to the growth of high with the first modern port in all of Palestine being built there along with its first International Airport and a pipeline bringing oil from Iraq to the Mediterranean the jewish-owned Palestine Railways was headquartered there as well as the Nestor cement works most of the building boom and Haifa was fueled by Jewish immigration and by 1935 Haifa was majority Jewish 42 000 Jews were allowed into Palestine in 1934 and 62 000 in 1935 making Jews about 30 percent of the population in October of 1935 Arab workers at Jaffa Port found a cache of weapons from Europe disguised as barrels of cement the paperwork said the delivery was for a Jewish Merchant in Tel Aviv the new stirred anger amongst the Palestinian Arabs which was additionally fueled by reports of anti-british and anti-french Strikes in Egypt and Syria later that month all of the parties except for the independence party met in Jerusalem to decide on joint action on November 6th Kasam the head of the black hand militia and his companions sold their belongings to buy weapons and hide them in a cave near the gaboa hills three policemen a Jewish sergeant and two Arab constables came across the cave and kasam's Men killed the sergeant but let the Arabs go after that Kasam and his follower were on the Run they were found in a forest near Jenning where they had a four hour standoff with the police where Kasam and his three men were killed and turned into Martyrs by Arab newspapers after kassam's funeral the Arab parties issued a joint declaration calling for a general strike and issued a set of Demands a halt to all Jewish immigration a halt to all land sales to Jews and the creation of a legislature for Palestine that excluded Jewish representation their List of Demands came with a threat saying that if they were not met they could not restrain their people from violence now the British had actually been trying to set up a legislature for the Mandate Palestine since 1922 but they couldn't get the Jews and the Arabs to agree on an apportionment for it the Jews demanded equal representation between the Jews and Arabs despite still being a minority of the population while the Arabs rejected any plan that gave Jews representation at all in March of 1936 the House of Commons was debating a proposal from High Commissioner walkup that would create a legislative Council for Palestine that granted the Arabs a majority voice but the proposal was rejected by most of the conservative party Winston Churchill who by this point was adamantly anti-hitler decried The Proposal as a death sentence for Germany's Jews the blood and race declared defiling in a cursed every form of concentrated human wickedness cast upon these people by overwhelming Power by Vaya tyranny when that is the case surely the House of Commons will not allow the one door which is open the one door which allows Sun relief some escape from these conditions to be summarily closed on April 15th a band of Arabs on the road between Nablus and telkaram set up a roadblock and extorted passing cars for money but they were explicitly raising funds to procure arms a pair of Jews in a truck were stopped told to hand over their money and park their car on the side of the road as more cars drove by another Jew was stopped and told to hand over their money and then told to sit in the first used truck the Arabs later came back to the Jewish men in the truck and demanded more money and when they told them they had none they were all shot and one of them Israel hazan died he would be the first victim of the great Arab Revolt thanks again to my Heritage for sponsoring this video

""Shattered Dreams of Peace: The Road From Oslo"" includes interviews with key figures from both sides of the negotiating table including Benjamin Netanyahu, Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres, Saeb Erekat and Ehud Barak.

The documentary traced how the cautious optimism in the aftermath of Arafat and then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signing the 1993 Oslo Accord was undermined in the following years by violence and major setbacks. It explored the growing threat to the peace process posed by radical nationalist factions among both Jews and Palestinians — groups, including Hamas, that opposed all compromise between the two peoples. The documentary also examined the U.S. role in the peace process, including the U.S.-brokered negotiations at Wye River in 1998, Camp David in 2000, and in Taba, Egypt, in 2001.

Watch a special presentation of “Shattered Dreams of Peace” Tues., Nov. 7, 2023, at 10/9c on PBS stations.

“Shattered Dreams of Peace: The Road From Oslo” was produced and directed by Dan Setton and Tor Ben Mayor. The WGBH executive producer was Zvi Dor-Ner. FRONTLINE’s executive producer was David Fanning.

Join Rory and Alastair for this emergency episode of The Rest Is Politics.

The CNN interview Rory mentions was with Palestinian National Initiative leader Mustafa Barghouti.",2023-10-11,1851211,29969,7269,UCsufaClk5if2RGqABb-09Uw," welcome to the restus politics with me alist Campbell and me Rory Stewart now Rory we've been trying for a couple of days now to get together and do something on what's been happening in Israel and Gaza and we put out a a question to listeners this morning saying what would you like to ask us about what's happening in the Middle East right now and I can tell you the single most asked question was asking Rory for one of his explainers now so take us from the beginning of time to where we are now in two minutes yeah and with without getting in trouble from every side well that is the problem you know I've noticed that already I've been Twitter is the worst place in the world to debate this issue I've discovered that which is why I've stopped debating it on there it's virtually impossible to say anything that is nuanced that is not black and white about this situation and the truth is as you know as we'll hear from you very very shortly you need a bit of nuance in this because it is so steeped and difficult history and very very complicated so why don't you just try and give us a bit of a a background I'll give it a go and with with apologies to people because there's a lot of sensitivities here so essentially um going back 3,000 years state of Israel was um dominated by a Jewish community and they were displaced just under 2,000 years ago basically by the Romans and uh large Jewish communities formed then in places like Iraq and Yemen but but also in in Europe central eastern Europe and in Spain and Portugal and in many other places too the um and then at the beginning of the 20th century end of the 19th beginning of 20th century there was the beginnings of a Zionist movement pushing for a Homeland for the Jewish people driven by the fact that Jews had experienced appalling discrimination and brutal pgms a murder murderous uh attacks on them over many many hundreds of years but mounting particularly in central eastern Europe in the late 19th century the British got behind this with a Baler declaration about the time of the first world war and there was increasing Jewish uh movement back to the former state of Israel but of course during the nearly 2,000 years this had become very much a place dominated by Arab Muslim communities so the Jews were moving back into a a populated place and the British initially after the first world war set up a mandate where they were trying to balance uh the interests of Arabs and Jews found themselves in the middle of an increasing Civil War and the the Brits were actually uh targets of terrorist attacks from both Arabs and and Jews and then of course the defining horror of the second world war the Holocaust in which 6 million European Jews are killed and which absolutely demonstrates to the world the extremity of the threat that Jews face and the requirement for a Jewish homeland which then drives into large numbers of Jews moving to Palestine after the war and in 1948 led by David Boran a the setting up of the state of Israel driven by actually uh an Israeli military assault that takes a lot of the territory previously held by Arab communities and involves many many Arabs being displaced from their homes and that state of Israel that 1948 state is then recognized largely by the International Community although not by many Palestinians and that remains the situation till 1967 when it then faces a simultaneous attack from Egypt Syria and then belatedly Jordan after the second world war Britain gave up the Mandate and the Jews in Israel fought to create a state which they created in 1948 and that state involved the Christian that state involved the displacement of quite a lot of the Arab Palestinian communities who were living in those areas that state was then recognized by the United Nations and then in 1967 there was an attack on Israel by Egypt uh Syria and belatedly Jordan and on the 1967 war Israel won a very very rapid Victory about six days and it took a lot of territory which was outside the 1948 borders so it took Gaza which we're going to be talking about today it took the West Bank which had previously been controlled by Jordan Gaza had previously been controlled by Egypt and just so we're clear to that that is why when people talk about the occupied uh Palestinian territories that is what they're talking about absolutely when when most people talk about the occupied Palestinian territories they're talking about those bits that were taken by Israel after 1967 now there's a detail here which is that there are also parts of the Palestinian movement who reject the original state of Israel and the 1948 borders but broadly speaking when people talk about the occupied Palestinian territories they're talking about these areas there was then another War um which is important to us because it was the anniversary of that war that triggered these recent attacks almost exactly 50 years ago a yum kipor War where there was another attack which Israel again uh beat off but with much more difficulty um fast forward and in the 1990s and we're now coming into stuff that you you began to connect with person in your professional life there were then a series of peace talks uh particularly around Oslo and the conclusion of Oslo was that territories would be divided into categories a b and c so there would be Palestinian territories there would be territories under mix control and C which were going to be Israeli territories and the idea was to push ahead with a two-state solution a Palestinian Authority emerged on the West Bank with its capital at ramala and in Gaza another form of Palestinian Authority emerged and the challenge there was that these territories are not contiguous they didn't form a joined up country in fact increasingly because of Israeli settlers who've been putting uh houses and settlements in beyond the 1967 boundaries it actually is a series of tiny enclaves over a 100 little enclaves um divided by checkpoints and walls fast forward to um 2004 2005 and Israel withdraws from Gaza and that's the first big move they actually remove a few thousand settlers who are there forcibly remove a few thousand settlers and hand it over to Palestinian control not long after that happens a movement called hammer which is a much more radical islamist group much more strongly associated with terrorism takes over the Gaza Strip which is this bit that runs basically from Egypt along the coast along the edge of Israel and the Palestinians are then divided between this Hamas controlled area which is the Gaza Strip and the rest which is controlled by the former P the fata government uh then there were FAS there were Israeli attacks both uh fights in reprisal against attacks from Hamas AR Gaza reprisals about attacks from hisbah which is another group which is based in southern Lebanon and fast forward to where we were about a week ago and a week ago Jake Sullivan the US National Security adviser was on the record saying the Middle East had never been so peaceful and the reason I think he thought that is that Israel had developed a special missile protection shield which meant it was increasingly difficult for these Palestinian groups to fire either from hisbah Hammer's Rockets into Israel and do damage there hadn't been that number of uh attacks and most of the focus in Israel as we picked up on the Pod over the last few months has actually been not about palestin it's been an internal Israeli fight between liberals and conservatives to do with challenging the way in which the Israeli government is moving in a populist Direction has brought in far-right people like a man called smotrich the finance minister pushing to overturn the independent Judiciary in Israel and that was broadly the situation um when on early Saturday morning the attack started I'll stop there that was a very long explainer well I thought it was a very very good explainer um and there will doubtless be some people who will object to some exclusions and some inclusions and I'm afraid that's the that's the nature of what we're talking about so um look I I don't want to ventriloquize for people but broadly speaking um if you want to see the view of I suppose a pretty middleof the road Palestinian politician uh there is a great interview which you'll will share in the links which has just been done on CNN 9 Minute interview uh in which a fata politician gives his views on the situation but broadly speaking from the Palestinian point of view they would say yes there's been a terrorist attack and most of them would say they would not in any way condone the killing of civilians and then the what would then happen is they would then say you need to understand that Gaza is from their point of view a prison camp with really no ability from people to go in and out it's a humanitarian disaster where people lack basic supplies and that at the root of this violence is an Israeli occup ation which Palestinians will then explain and you'll see it better if you're interested in this interview on CNN explains involve breaking tan territory into tiny enclaves checkpoints and what they experience as an aparte State and they call it an aparte State because they feel that they are not being given full civil and Democratic rights and if they were given full civil and Democratic rights the situation would be very different that's the Palestinian point of view the Israeli point of view there are many Israeli points of view but they would start by saying listen understand that these are very serious enemies out there that Hamas back in the 1990s had a founding Charter dedicated to the complete elimination of the state of Israel that states like Iran were committed to the elimination state of Israel that the 67 War and the Yum kipor War were designed basically to wipe them off the face of the map that they feel that they have been uh marginalized and um attacked unfairly at United Nations forums for decades while other countries like China and Zimbabwe and Cuba haven't been attacked in the same way they feel it's an existential threat they would emphasize that the isra Army warns civilians before it attacks buildings uh they will emphasize and again there are many different views on this 1967 territory but some Israelis would say the territory they took is essenti for protection of the state of Israel that the Goan Heights for example were artillery positions from which the syrians reigned Rockets down on them and that Israel's right to defend itself involves being very realistic about the significant threat that Palestinians pose um so somewhere uh there are those two positions and there will be 500 other positions we look forward to the conversation just on Oslo by the way the we had lots and lots of questions as I say but one of them was about good books to read and there is actually there was a brilliant play about the Oslo Accords and I think from memory it was called Oso it was by somebody called Taylor but it it was published as a book and it's it's worth um it's worth getting hold of that absolutely amazing play and it's one of those plays that you can read and get a sense of the drama and just before we go on to What's Happening Now coincidentally and I didn't know that Jake Sullivan had said that um that is pretty remarkable and just before these attacks literally the day before the the latest attacks by Hamas which have been bigger and more violent and more deadly than anything we've seen from them before and the anything the Israelis have endured before which is why they're calling it 911 plus Pearl Harbor in one um but our good friend the new European had a five-page spread in last week's paper called 18 days that shook the World about the yam kapor war that you mentioned and I think you're right that that was one of the the key moments in the history when you said there Rory about the people feeling that this was had never been safer and that is Israel felt secure when there finally was a ceasefire after this um the after the yapor war which went on for 18 days there was little rejoicing in Israel the failure to foresee the attack was the greatest failure in Israel is history one analyst analyst blamed arrogance lack of understanding of the Abundant intelligence and disregard for the enemy the military historian John Hughes Wilson described it as a classic example of confusing political aspirations with hard fact for good or ill Israel would never make the same mistakes again and here we are with and and here again so to remind people of what actually happened so 6:30 in the morning Hamas out of Gaza which is this Coastal strip adjoining Egypt fired perhaps 5,000 Rockets the Israelis are saying 2,500 rockets and then about an hour later they tore through the barriers through the fences that divide Gaza from Israel some coming in from boat one person coming in from Air bulldozers ripping down the eras Crossing and simultaneously drove ins some cases 20 30 kilm into Israel and uh began the most violent series of terrorist attacks some of them were directed against military targets so you'll see images of commanders Israeli commanders being um one of them I think in his box of shorts being kidnapped and taken into a car um tanks being seized uh they have to being hit by drones and Gaza Gaza divisional headquarters being stormed and the zikim base so it you know a big military frontal attack but also the Real Horror at the center of things which people will have focused on which was that there was a a festival taking place and people have been dancing up all night and 7:30 in the morning sun was Rising just coming to the end of the festival and into the middle of the final stages came a group of terrorists on bikes and trucks and began opening fire on the crowd killed something like it's difficult to know 250 260 people um and then went back across the border taking over 160 hostages and some of the fighters remained on the ground continued to fight holding police stations um in Border towns uh the Israeli military then mounted a Counter Strike which has probably killed about 400 people so far um and I mean I think that the thing to to say Obviously before we go any further on this is that hamus is a terrorist oper organization very clear terrorist organization this isn't the first time they've done this some people are saying you know why did they hit women and children the truth of the matter is that hamus has been behind indiscriminate suicide bomb attacks um they had an explicit policy of targeting civilians um since since the mid 1990s and they are recognized as a terrorist organization by the EU by the US and actually much more recently by the UK 2022 I think and Australia 2023 um but much of the rest of the world does not recognize hamus as a terrorist organization they treat them as the legitimate government because they're the the elected government um in in the Gaza Strip over to you no I I think what we're seeing is beyond anything that we've SE that the the Israeli people have seen as you say within the Palestinian context um there has been a lot of Bloodshed there's been a lot of anger it's been building I do think that once this thing hopefully calms down hopefully settles down though I think it could be I think this could be a long long long time but there are some massive questions for the Israelis they have perhaps the most most vaunted intelligence agency in the world um they really will be asking themselves some very very hard questions about as to how this happened because when you watched the scenes that you described there with the the fences being attacked with people arriving on hand gliders with the the levels of Armory that were available it seems to me remarkable that the Israelis literally did not seem to have a whiff of this um or if they did they were certainly not very well prepared and I think what's happening now quite rightly there's been massive uh widespread condemnation a little a little bit like Ukraine though we should be careful not to imagine that it's Universal uh I think we saw in the debate at the United Nations last night that the the the the straight divide in that body was on display again but generally a sense of absolute outrage and condemnation and support certainly in most of the countries that where most of our listeners are support for Israel's rights to defend itself but now um slightly into unknown territory because the hostages which we should with taking of Civilian hostages taking any hostages in this situation of War crime which they that does complicate things further um a lot of talk already about whether that there will be a ground offensive Byers Israel into Gaza which is one of the most densely populated places on Earth by the way yeah 2 million people in in a strip roughly 25 miles long very narrow strip of land um so the fear that there must be in that place uh will be horrendous and meanwhile Jews around the world I mean this is this was brought home to me in the very calm and peaceful setting of of my morning swim this morning talking to some Jewish people who are regular swimmers there who are feeling that sense of fear anxiety real concern and Dread about what about what's happening not not because they know people there yeah and was reason also not just because the horror coming out of Israel but also because an Egyptian policeman opened fire and killed two Israeli tourists after this um little bit on Gaza so hamus is is a something that emerged from the Muslim Brotherhood and different to the pl and fat it was from its beginning an islamist organization very much sort of I'm not I mean it's a misleading way to put it but it's in the broad tradition of the Muslim Brotherhood and even the Taliban it's a group that very much Prides itself on religion it's has very conservative social codes but it's not imposing them entirely I mean there's been some examples of it but it's not legally imposing them on the population there their brand was being cleaner less corrupt than the previous government but from the moment they've taken over they have faced a blockade so although Israel withdrew from Gaza it controls six out of the seven of the border crossings it controls all the air access and sea access to Gaza it provides all the electricity all the water supply all the Telecommunications for Gaza and the Israeli Army Reserves the right to enter um Gaza whenever it feels it has a security reason to do so the trade from Gaza the economy of Gaza really collapsed after these blockades were put in place because people didn't want to do business with a terrorist group it's kept afloat with support from in different ways turkey catar and uh Iran Iran putting the support more into the military attacks katar very focused on humanitarian uh support for people it's I think 160th poorest country in the world now in GDP per capita you know real shortage of water supply sewage and and one of the questions going forward is I suppose two questions one of them is is your point about the potential Israeli response inside Gaza because it's not going to be possible for Israel as it were to reoccupy Gaza if you think about the fighting mosul where the Iraqi Army tried to retake mosul from the Islamic State that was a multi-year operation that involved destroying most of the city and I don't think we should be expecting Israel to be attempting to try to do house toh house fighting in a place of 2.2 million people but there's going to be a lot of pressure now being put by Israel on countries to cease all forms of support for Gaza but that of course will also mean that you're on this knife Edge between providing support development support which keeps the hamus government alive but also preventing a humanitarian catastrophe so Qatar is a very odd example of this Qatar is criticized Often by Israeli politicians for by providing support to Gaza but then often says that behind closed doors they're encouraged to continue to provide support to Gaza by factions within Israeli government because they don't want a humanitarian crisis there and on the on the point of the humanitarian crisis couple of points first of all when when the Israelis are saying to the people in Gaza um essentially advising them to to move out um it's very very hard to know where they go in such a densely populated place where they can't come and go freely and the focus on the Middle East and the the Israel Palestine question has been negligible from a time when it used to be one of the most dominant issues of global debate yeah I think a lot of things changed is it so the assassination of yek Rabin who'd Been instrumental in bring together the oso Accord so this actually very famous Israeli General kind of national hero who made a very radical step to try to reach out towards peace with Palestinians and was then assassinated by uh a extreme extremist Jewish nationalist who was against him um then led to a period where the Israel left largely vanished and a lot of the politics we've been talking about in Israel reflects the fact that the Palestinians supporting two states Solutions supporting Israeli left largely lost confidence partly because of that partly because they felt that Palestinians weren't making the progress that they were hoping for partly because the Palestinian Authority has proved to be very useless and corrupt and has lost a lot of support but it's also that as you say as Israel's become economically more and more powerful and Saudi and UAE and others have developed confidence Trump drove through the Abraham Accords which effectively normalized relations between Israel and some of the key Gulf States meaning that the Palestinians had very much been marginalized and definitely as alist Bert says you know when I was in Jordan there was a palpable sense that people felt it no longer was anything that anyone was concentrating on and the two-state solution felt increasingly implausible it's more and more difficult to imagine that it would ever happen partly because these figures like smartr benav who are the farri um Israelis uh you know made very very explicit statements about essentially providing no acknowledgement for the Palestinian territories at all I mean smotrich was on the record saying that he wanted to retake those territories and the Palestinians would have to either be subjugated or leave or be killed um and this was part of of uh the Coalition I mean you guy was the Finance Minister who who was saying this so I think there are two things that we maybe before we close that we need to look at one of them is what does this mean to internal Israeli politics and what does it mean to the international picture I think internal Israeli politics there's going to be two opposing tensions one of them is it will strengthen some people on the right who will say we always told you you needed to be tougher on the Palestinians look at this Hamas is revealed as they always have been as terrorists dedicated to the complete extinction of the state of Israel we need to go much much harder and that will undermine some of the voices uh pushing for peace and some of the remaining voices on the Israeli left on the other hand it's an incredible humiliation of the Israeli government a total intelligence failure and there will be a push for a national Unity government to say well let's bring in a broader Coalition get rid of the farri right get Israel together again very important to mobilize the reservists who were essentially on strike because they were so horrified by the judicial reforms um and that then moves us the international pit and I think internationally there are going to be two things we have to watch one of them is that Iran is very closely associated with this Hamas attack and is boasting about the fact that Ayah met with the leader of Hamas um that Iranian funding is going in so you can expect a risk of the Israeli government and others taking retary action against Iran you can also see this as a deliberate attempt to break the talks that were going on between Saudi and Israel that Hamas has done it in order to deepen the division again within the Middle East and draw attention in the most horrifying way through this terrorist attack to the ongoing situation and hope that that begins to move people more into talks again there's an awful lot of stuff in harat's newspaper one of the main Israeli dailies today that is very very very critical of of Netanyahu the sense that the Israeli government he's he's had to essentially do a deal with people even well to the right of him to form the government that he did and this has been so far down their list of priorities that you do sort of have the sense that the for the for the more militant end of the Palestinian population that that they can see no no way out and that is not by the way I can even as I say those words I can I can feel people go to their tweets to say this is attempting to justify it doesn't justify it in any way at all but I think that unless what what has happened the reason why Hamas became as powerful as they did within the West Bank was because they felt that the Palestinian Authority Under the fataa party would were going nowhere were giving a lot recognition of Israel Etc without getting anything in return and that that having been done that there they saw no sense of progress at all not I'm not talking about progress towards a two-state solution I'm talking about progress in any shape or form in the reality of their daily lives and that is not going to be addressed between this government uh and the Palestinians it will for now be entirely seen I suspect as a security situation but at some point there has to be a return to a political process otherwise this thing just goes round and round and round and we'll be back in a few years talking about another war and giving another name and and I think at the heart of it is something you was was right at the center of your working life in Ireland which is that understandably Israelis look at Hamas and they say here is a murderous Bruce Hall terrorist group that has just gone into the middle of a music festival and moaned down 2060 people and is and his rhetoric is effectively about extinguishing the state of Israel I mean it's changed it it now talks about a right of return but there is deep deep anti itic rhetoric hate speech coming out of Hamas and all sort of thing um and that therefore feels to many many Israelis as though it's impossible to imagine any kind of conversation with them at all as as I did you know I felt very much with the IRA that you know the idea of talking to people who seemed in the 80s to be absolutely committed to driving the British entirely out of Ireland who were killing innocent civilians in hotel bombings seemed incomprehensible and horrible trth yeah go on there's a question here James M June do you think that the Israel Palestine scenario is more complex than the troubles in Northern Ireland does the fact that it shares a border with other Islamic Nations and isn't geographically isolated mean that a good Friday start agreement will always be unattainable I mean there's a couple of things I'd say to that the first is that the Good Friday agreement felt unattainable for a long long time I mentioned to you earlier recently watching Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland listening to the people telling their stories they felt it was unattainable but it happened so right now today in the middle of October 2023 a two-state solution and I I saw David Lamy this morning at the conference labor Party Conference he made his speech and absolutely unequivocal support for Israel but also saying that we have to keep having hope that there can one day be a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in peace in the current contest that's sounds almost an absurd thing to say but you have to hang on to that hope and you can only get there ultimately through some sort of political process and the reason why I mean the the the level of planning that must have gone into this operation and whether where they were getting their arms from and whether Iran was directly supplying and and all that stuff we don't know um but in a way I think what they're may be trying to do a bit like when excuse me when the IRA sort of had the Judgment they they they said to themselves that we can bomb away all we want in Northern Ireland uh but unless we actually take these bombs to the the British Mainland we're not going to inject ourselves into this process uh now so I'm I guess I'm throwing this one back to you do you think that part of what's going on is that Hamas are trying to get into the bigger picture start to be considered one of the players in finding some sort of resolution to this or are they so Hardline militant Terror organization that there is no way that this is going to end other than with a bloody long battle between them and the Israelis yeah and the truth is of course that like all these groups there all those things there are appear to be or have been in the past citing more moderate factions of Hamas and you know negotiators have dealt with them and talked to them and that's of the reasons why Norway for example I think has refused to condemn hamus as a terrorist organization and then there are Hamas Deputy ministers on record spreading blood lials about Jews and claiming they sort of mashed up you know Christian babies into mats of biscuits and I mean it's um so it's a a horrifying mixture of extreme terrorists with murderous intent and people who are trying to imagine some kind of political settlement and return to 1967 borders and all this kind of thing but the standoff in the end if I sort of go back to the central explainer is that there are two completely irreconcilable at the moment it feels like visions of what's going on for Hammer many Palestinians they want an absolute return to the 1967 borders and the truth is that there has been a lot of Israeli settlement Beyond the Edge of the 1967 borders and no Israeli government is currently remotely considering removing all those communities on the on the contrary they've been develop they've been adding to it exactly right well well I think you explained that very very well um I I actually came off Twitter when for just because it's uh it's impossible it's like it should be possible to condemn unequivocally what has happened whilst at the same time worrying about the nature of the Israeli government worrying about the fate of innocent children and others who have had a hellish life anyway now in one of the most densely populated areas of the world fearing what is about to hit them whilst at the same time only beginning to imagine the utter horror if you had been at that festival or a related to somebody who was at that festival or you're related to somebody who's been taken hostage but the way our debate polarizes so instantly around anything now it was almost like you know well you're either 100% this side 100% that side and at the moment you have to be 100% on on the side of of Israel and ultimately we've got to get to a place where there's a the reestablishment of a a serious grownup political process where major world powers are engaged and involved and put in the hours and the effort to try to get people to to coexist otherwise we've had it well thank you very much and I I know that listeners will have very strong opinions and if you want to get in touch do by all means please send us your tweets or go to the restus [Music] politics.com"

of a Palestinian state, and I hope that by the end of this video, you will better understand
the Israeli point of view. Before we dive into it, I want to zoom out. To talk about the Middle East. You hear so much about what is wrong with
Israel, but if you look at the countries surrounding Israel, you quickly see that the situation
there is much worse. Lebanon is falling apart, Syria has already
fallen apart, Jordan and Egypt are not stable, there is a terrible war in Yemen, and you
probably know about the chaos in Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Do you know how many Syrians died last year
in the terrible war there? You probably don’t. So let me tell you: 6,500, most of them civilians. That’s about 20 deaths a day. If Israel were to kill 20 Arabs a day, there
would be violent demonstrations throughout the Arab world and in many European cities. Do you know how many children have died so
far in the civil war in Yemen? You can’t blame Israel for it, so maybe
it’s not that important. Have you ever Googled women’s rights in
Egypt? Please do. Some of the basic rights, and I mean very
basic rights, that Western women enjoy will never be enjoyed by most Egyptian women. And I could give you ten more sad examples. Now you might say that I’m trying to distract
from the main issue, but if you claim to be outraged by what Israel is doing but you don’t
care about all the horrible things that are happening just a few kilometers from here,
then maybe you are being a bit of a hypocrite. If you disagree with me, cool, I love discussions. I love free speech, but try to be fair. Don’t just call me a liar or say that I
am biased. Those are not proper arguments against what
I’m saying. I can’t find much in the way of democracy,
human rights and women’s rights in Arab Muslim society. Prove me wrong if you can. Now let’s talk about the so-called Palestinians. When the British came here at the end of WWI,
they basically invented two nations: the Jordanians and the Palestinians. Two nations that never existed before. It is very easy to prove that. Name a Palestinian leader before Arafat, or
show me a Palestinian coin. What were the borders of this land? The land of Israel had been a pilgrimage destination
for 3,000 years. First for the Jews who came to the Jewish
temple in Jerusalem and also, over the last 1,600 years, for Christian pilgrims. Millions of pilgrims came from all over the
world to visit the holy sites. Some of them documented their journey and
over these 3,000 years no pilgrim ever reported talking to or seeing a Palestinian. They saw Jews, Arabs, Druz, Armenians… but
no one ever encountered a Palestinian. Even when the Arabs revolted against the British
in the 1930s, they themselves called it the “Arab revolt” and not the Palestinian
revolt. The name “Palestinian” is not an Arab
name. It was given to this region after the Jews
rebelled against the Romans in 132. The Romans got so mad at the Jews that they
attempted to erase the connection between the Jews and their land, so they changed the
name of Jerusalem to Aelia Capitolina and the name of Judea to Palestina. So if you are anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism,
you should really be pro-Israel and anti-Palestinian, seeing as they got their name from the colonial
Roman empire and their borders from the British empire. The only true Palestinians are those Muslims,
Christians and Jews who were born under the British mandate, like my grandmother. She has a Palestinian birth certificate. If you were born after the British mandate
you were either Israeli, Jordanian or Egyptian. Now you might be saying, OK fine, but they
are still human beings who have a right to define themselves as they see fit, even if
they were invented by the British. After all, the colonial powers invented many
countries in Africa and the Middle East. And you are of course quite right. They can call themselves whatever they want,
but it doesn’t give them the right to rewrite history and to try to annihilate us. In 1947, the UN proposed that the land be
divided into a Jewish state and an Arab state (again, Arab, not Palestinian), but the Arabs
started a war to annihilate the Jews. Luckily they lost. It is important to clear up another issue
here. Up until the war, the Jews had never stolen
a single square inch of local Arab land. The Jews bought all the land they settled
on, until the Arabs lost some land in a war that they themselves started. And if you are thinking that many Jews came
to Israel as immigrants, you are right. As did the Arabs. Jews arrived by sea and hundreds of thousands
of Arabs from all over the Middle East arrived by land to work for the British. Just as today millions of Arabs emigrate to
Christian countries in Europe for work and a better life, that is exactly what happened
in the 30’s and 40’s in the land of Israel. In Jewish and Christian countries, there is
prosperity and work whereas in most Arab Muslim countries... How can I put it nicely?… there is less prosperity. But let’s jump to the 1950s and the aftermath
of the War of Independence and ask ourselves: Why didn’t the Arabs in the West Bank and
Gaza establish their own country back then? They had 19 years to do that. But they didn’t do it. Now that is interesting. It was only after 1967, when the Arabs had
threatened to wipe Israel out again and lost again, that they suddenly decided to become
a nation-state. The Palestinians don’t want a peaceful state
alongside Israel. They want to eliminate Israel. Now I will say something that might surprise
you. I respect Hamas, much more than the so-called
human rights organizations that act against Israel. Because at least Hamas is a movement of honest,
if extreme people who say what they want. The Hamas declaration starts with the sentence:
Israel will exist until Islam obliterates it. I respect them; and so should you. They don’t say ‘we want a peaceful democratic
state alongside Israel’. Maybe that’s what some people in the West
want them to want. But the Arabs are very clear in their objective. Even Hamas doesn’t claim that it’s the
Palestinians who will wipe out Israel, but rather Islam. And it’s not just their words. It is interesting to see how the Palestinians
treat each other. Take Israeli society. There are many political, social, and religious
tensions between us Jews. But despite these tensions, there have been
very few occasions where the tensions actually erupted into violence. In Israel you can have huge demonstrations
without smashing windows or burning cars. Only very rarely have Jews killed other Jews
due to political differences, and each time it has occurred: Altalena, the murder of De
Han, Tubianski, Rabin and Emil Grunzwig, it is a national trauma that we still talk about
decades after it happened. The Palestinians have killed thousands of
other Palestinians in internal conflicts. Often the Palestinians kill more fellow Palestinians
in a single day than Jews have killed fellow Jews over the course of a hundred years. And the way you behave in your house is the
way you act outside. A few days ago, a Palestinian terrorist murdered
a man and two boys. As usual, the Palestinians celebrated with
fireworks and candy in the streets. And this is what they published. So what is the solution? Golda Meir, the Israeli prime minister in
the 1970s, said that peace would come when the Arabs loved their own kids more than they
hated us. When you see what the Arabs are doing to one
another, you know that peace is still far off. The huge amount of violence in the Arab Muslim
world: half a million dead in Syria, 350,000 dead in Yemen, violence and upheaval in Lebanon,
in Iran, in Libya – all of this turmoil has nothing to do with Israel and the Jews
and everything to do with Arab Muslim values. It is disappointing to see that there are
no Arab leaders stating this very obvious fact. Think about it. All the Muslim organizations you hear about
in the news: Isis, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Muslim brothers, Al Qaeda, taliban, organizations
that have the support of hundreds of millions of Muslims worldwide, are not big fans of
democracy or women’s rights and, as far as I know, and I might be wrong, they are
not big fans of the LGBTQ+ community either. Large parts of the left somehow fail to notice
it. Instead of demonstrating against the cruel
Iranian regime and supporting the brave Iranian women, the mayor of Barcelona last week decided
to cut off all connections with Tel Aviv because of Israeli apartheid. 2 million Arabs are living in Israel; there
are hundreds of active mosques in Israel, Arabs in the Israeli parliament, and Arabs
in Israel’s supreme court. Do you know how many Jews live in the Palestinian
authorities? Zero, nada, gar nix. Arabs enjoy more rights in the Jewish state
than in any other Arab country in the Middle East. The hatred towards Israel is so strong that
the left-wing parties of Europe will cut off Tel Aviv, a city where women are free and
gay couples can adopt children, but keep donating to Hamas, which throws gay people from rooftops. It is more than hypocrisy – it is madness. Even if Israel were to disappear from the
face of the earth tomorrow, there would still be no peace in the Middle East. And adding another corrupted, Arab-Muslim
dictatorship with no human rights, a Palestinian state, will definitely not bring peace and
stability to the region. Please help me share the truth. Like, subscribe, and share this video. If you disagree with me and have a smart comment

Around the time that Israelis celebrate Independence Day, Palestinians commemorate “The Nakba,” or “The Catastrophe.” The Nakba was a series of events, centered around 1948, that expelled hundreds of thousands Palestinians from their homeland and killed thousands. The Nakba isn’t the beginning of the story, but it’s a key part of Palestinian history — and the root of Israel’s creation. 

Prior to the Nakba, Palestine had a thriving population — largely made up of Arabs — that had lived and worked the land for centuries. But with the founding of Zionism, years of British meddling, and a British pledge to help create a Jewish state in Palestine — things began to change drastically. By 1947, with increasing tensions between Jewish settlers and Palestinian Arabs — the British left Palestine, and the UN stepped in with a plan to partition the land into two states. What followed was known as Plan Dalet: operations by Israeli paramilitary groups that violently uprooted Palestinians. An estimated 15,000 Palestinians were killed, more than 500 villages were decimated, and roughly 750,000 Palestinians displaced. 

Most who were expelled from their homes couldn’t return to historic Palestine. And today, millions of their descendants live in refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank and surrounding countries. The history of the Nakba has been deliberately concealed and often ignored in western narratives around the creation of Israel. In this episode of Missing Chapter, we break down how the Nakba happened — and how it defined the future of Palestine.

to Jerusalem. This is a story about 
what happened here in 1948. We are only 750 people.  And everybody knows each other. It was a black spot in the history. That history has been
carefully concealed... purposefully distorted, and in the West, 
largely forgotten. They put our village as an example
of what they can do. The massacre in this village
was one of many in a series of catastrophic events... that became known as 
the Nakba. When hundreds of thousands 
of Palestinians were violently displaced 
from their homeland... in order to create 
the state of Israel. “In May of 1948, a new Jewish state Israel was born in a bath of blood.” The borders of Palestine have been 
changed forcefully over time. But historically, this region has been home 
to Palestinians for centuries with hundreds of villages and thriving cities. One of them being the central city 
of Jerusalem... with holy sites important to Jewish Christian and Muslim people. By the late Ottoman Empire, 
Palestinians living here were overwhelmingly Muslim  with minority Christian and 
Jewish native populations, too. But regardless of religion Palestinians were often 
referred to as Arabs. People of the Arabic speaking world despite their distinctive culture. Palestinians have long distinguished 
themselves as Ahl Filastīn... or the people of Palestine. They developed a distinctive 
Arabic accent. They developed regional food, regional dress, 
and family ties. But by the time World War I began... several key political forces were competing for control of these lands. First, there was a growing Arab 
political movement... looking for independence from 
the Ottoman Empire in hopes of a unified Arab state 
that would include Palestine. Then there were Zionists a political group that had one main goal: The creation of a Jewish state. Zionism was a response to 
an increasingly brutal climate for Jewish people, particularly 
in Europe and Russia... where there was a massive wave 
of antisemitism... including large scale attacks 
in the late 1800s and early 1900s. After briefly considering other areas
for a new state including Uganda and Argentina... Zionist leaders decided on Palestine because of its connection to early religious history. But there was a third key group 
with political interests here. The British. Control of the region would 
allow them to expand their spheres of influence and protect 
trade routes to India. During World War I, since both 
the British and the Arab independence movement 
wanted Palestine... they decided to go after 
the Ottomans together with an important pledge. Through a series of letters in 1916 an Arab leader and a British official agreed that if Arabs would help the British 
fight the Ottomans and give the British economic and other 
foreign privileges in Arab lands... in return, the British would recognize and support an independent Arab state. Soon the Arabs started 
doing their part in revolting against 
the Ottomans making it easier for the British to move in. But the next year the British issued 
a new declaration and betrayed the Arabs. “In 1917, Lord Allenby conquered 
the Holy Land... and the Jews were promised 
a national home in Palestine.” Without consulting the native 
Palestinian population... the British issued what's known as 
the Balfour Declaration: Supporting the establishment
in Palestine of a national home for 
the Jewish people. So instead of supporting 
the idea of Palestine as part of a unified and independent 
Arab state... the British pledged to help secure this land 
for Zionists. It was a strategic move. This declaration opened up a pathway for Britain to gain power in Palestine. Under the guise that it was supporting the self-determination
of another people... of a people in Palestine... who don't reside there yet. As for Palestine's majority 
Arab population the declaration referred to them as 
non-Jewish communities... who would be given civil 
and religious rights... but not political rights. A few years later, after World War I ended Britain gained control of Palestine 
through a mandate... that also required them 
to put the Balfour plans for Jewish settlement in motion. And they did. Between 1922 and 1931 the Jewish population 
more than doubled. The migration helped the 
Zionist movement gain steam. And a slogan took off. “A land without people for,
a people without land.” And it sends a message to Western leaders... that the people who had been living 
in Palestine for generations... could just be easily moved elsewhere. The idea was that those inhabitants 
weren't a people with ties to that land. Palestine was, of course, 
a land with a people. In 1931, there were more than 850,000 Palestinian Arabs in the region, 
still the vast majority. But with the rise of Hitler and the Nazi Party in particular... “Hate became a rallying call.” Jewish flight from Europe 
became even more urgent. And Palestine started to see the biggest wave of Jewish emigration yet. Violence broke out, rooted in 
tensions over land. Jewish settlers purchased 
swaths of fertile land and evicted tenant farmers creating a crisis of hundreds of thousands of landless, dispossessed 
Palestinian-Arabs. Though Palestinians fiercely rebelled against  both British colonial forces
and Jewish settlers they were brutally crushed 
by the British. They put in Palestine more troops to repress that rebellion than they had stationed in India at that time. All of India. These troops killed thousands 
of Palestinians including many of their leaders and the British began training 
and arming Zionist militias to suppress the rebellion, too. But the rebellion continued. So in an attempt to prevent further 
Palestinian resistance... the British began to limit Jewish immigration 
into Palestine. This ended up angering 
Zionist extremists leading to more violence. So in 1947, after decades of trying 
to manipulate both Palestinian Arabs and Zionists 
to keep their control over Palestine... Britain gave up... and handed the question of Palestine 
to someone else. “To the United Nations also came the problem of Palestine.” “In recent years this small country had been the scene 
of disorder and bloodshed.” They figured, here is this new thing
called the United Nations.  Here. In your lap. Palestine. First gift. So the United Nations has 
now to figure out how do you disentangle 
this thing... that the British who helped create. A UN special committee proposed 
the land be divided into two states... a Jewish state and an Arab state, 
with Jerusalem as a separate UN-controlled entity. It was called the Partition Plan of 1947. The plan shocked Palestinians. We could not accept the partition plan because at that time the population 
was almost 2 to 1. But the plan proposed giving over 
half the land and often the most fertile areas 
to the Jewish state. From a purely pragmatic perspective... the partition plan didn't make much sense 
for Palestinian Arabs. That wasn't the only problem 
with the plan. Within this proposed area of the Jewish state... were hundreds of thousands 
of Palestinian Arabs... including both Muslims and Christians 
who had lived there for generations. On a moral level... the idea of making hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs minorities 
in their own homeland... seemed unjust and unfair. In November 1947, the UN 
put the plan to a vote. In the aftermath of the Holocaust  and after lobbying from 
US leaders and Zionists the UN voted in favor of partition. “And finally, a momentous decision 
to partition the Holy Land’s 10,000 square miles.” Britain announced their mandate 
over Palestine would end on May 15th, 1948. Even as Palestinians continued to reject the UN's decision to partition the land. After the partition took place, 
you know, in 1947... you know, we really were scared that something might happen to us. By the end of 1947 Zionists had several well-developed 
paramilitary forces... the largest one known as the Haganah. And more extremist militias like Irgun. On March 10th, a couple of months before 
the British mandate would end the Haganah adopted what was called 
Plan Dalet. Or Plan D.  On paper, the main goal was to 
gain control of the Jewish state as laid out in the partition plan, 
while also defending Jewish settlements outside of the borders. In reality, that's where the majority 
of these operations took place... outside of the UN's 
proposed Jewish state. Some carried out by Haganah and others
by more radical militias. Many of these operations focused on
isolating Jerusalem and the roads to it. A set of brutal instructions called for the destruction of Arab villages 
by setting fire to blowing up and planting mines. Especially those population centers which were difficult to control. In case of resistance it called for the population
to be expelled outside of the borders of the state... villages emptied and for the occupation and control 
of Arab villages along main transportation arteries. One of the most widely publicized
village massacres happened here in Deir Yassin. We lkived in Deir Yassin which is about 4 miles west 
of Jerusalem. 91 year old Dawud Assad was there the day of the massacre 
and was 18 at the time. On April 9th, 1948, extremist 
Zionist forces executing Plan D closed in 
on Deir Yassin... even though the village had made
a local peace pact with neighboring Jewish settlements. Friday morning they attacked us. Dawud escaped through a trench. I went down, all the way down here 
like this. So about 4 hours walking 
to Jerusalem. To this day, the archive of the Israeli army 
refuses to release many of the images and intelligence reports 
on Deir Yassin. But one UN report detailed 
circumstances of great savagery... including women and children 
stripped, lined up... photographed and slaughtered. Roughly 100 people, largely children
and the elderly were killed in the village. As for Dawud, he later reunited 
with the group of Deir Yassin captives in Jerusalem, including his sister 
and mother. My mother says... So everywhere there’s a commotion,
you know? News of what happened 
in Deir Yassin spread quickly with far reaching effects. The Zionist militias used it 
as a propaganda tool to tell people about it everywhere. The idea was that if you don't leave... we will do to you what happened 
in Deir Yassin. Stories came out about women
being raped about babies being killed and induced a great deal of fear among 
the Palestinian Arab population many of them fleeing as a result. “Jewish troops surrounded Arab forces 
from the city of Haifa.” After taking Deir Yassin Zionist paramilitary groups 
cleared major cities including Haifa and Jaffa and took hundreds of smaller 
villages and towns, too. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians 
were forced to flee pouring into neighboring states 
as refugees. Plan D became the blueprint 
for carrying out the ethnic cleansing of historic Palestine to make room for a new state. And on May 14th, the day before 
the British mandate ended... Zionist declared the state as Israel. But the creation of Israel 
didn't end the Nakba. Neighboring Arab countries 
that were overwhelmed by Palestinian refugees immediately 
went to war with Israel. “Now united and a league of Arab States... they are insistent that the entry of refugees into Palestine must be ended.” The fighting lasted for months. Arab armies eventually lost, 
while Palestinians continued to be killed and forced out
throughout that time. Palestinians who fled often carried
only enough to stay away for a few weeks hoping they'd eventually return home. A lot of them locked their doors put their key in their pocket
and then moved to safer ground. When you leave the house and 
you take your keys with you it’s because you're planning to go home. In the case of the Palestinians those refugees weren't allowed 
to return. Refugees trying to return 
were often shot at. Zionist paramilitary operations 
also tried to prevent them from returning again by destroying 
the villages. That act of preventing their return 
compounded the Nakba. So the Nakba is both the forcible displacement of Palestinians from their homes 
and lands and country... as well as preventing them to return once the fighting was over. Palestinian society was 
dismembered, crushed. More than half of the 
Palestinian people became refugees, stateless, 
dispossessed of their land. Over time, the state of Israel covered up the physical evidence 
of an Arab Palestine. Place names were often changed 
from Arabic ones to Hebrew ones. The Jewish National Fund 
embarked on a massive effort to plant thousands of acres of pine forests and recreational areas on top of hundreds of ruined 
Palestinian villages. Even though these forests have now grown 
into big pine trees Palestinians have not forgotten 
their homelands. While we know that roughly 
6,000 Israelis lost their lives in the violence of the Nakba... records for Palestinian deaths 
weren't kept. It's estimated to be around 15,000. By the end of the Nakba roughly 750,000 Palestinians 
had been forcefully expelled... and more than 500 villages destroyed. Though the UN’s partition plan 
allotted Israel 56% of the land through the Nakba, Israel captured
78% of the land. It was everything except 
what's now known as the occupied West Bank 
and Gaza Strip. Today, that's up to at least 
85% of the total area. Turning 6 million Palestinians into refugees without a homeland. It's why around the same time that Israelis are celebrating 
Independence Day... Palestinians are out protesting 
on May 15th. Holding up keys as a symbol 
of the homes they lost and the hope to return. For them, the Nakba isn't just 
a moment in history. It's a catastrophe that never really ended."

Even if you have heard a thousand different reports about
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,  I promise you that this will give you
a new perspective. I will be talking about the settlements,
the occupation, the two-state solution,  Islam, Jerusalem, the solution,
and a whole lot more. Before I break down the
Palestinian narrative, a small trigger warning:
I like facts. If you don't like what
I'm saying, then bring me facts that contradict what I'm saying. If I say that Jerusalem is
not mentioned in the Quran, or that the Jews said ""yes"" to
the Partition Plan in 1947 and the Arabs said ""no"",
or that there was no such thing as Palestinians in the
18th century— then feel free to prove me wrong. Send me a link to a letter from
a pilgrim to the Land of Israel who says that he met a nice Palestinian. I'm asking you to challenge me. If you just write me that I'm Zionist,
or that I'm biased, or that I've received money from the
Israeli government to make this video— those aren't actually arguments. And for your information, I am completely
against the current government of Israel. The good thing about Israel is that
unlike most of the Arab-Muslim countries,  Israel is a democracy. I'm not afraid of the government preventing
me from expressing my thoughts. Israel is not Iran or Syria or Egypt
or Saudi Arabia or Gaza. And I don't delete comments. Some people are 100% for Israel
and some are 100% against it. I'm aiming for the middle ground. If I get dislikes and smart comments,
then I know that this video has reached the right audience. But you know, do give this video
a like and subscribe. The last thing that I
want to ask is this: Don't use bombastic language
in your comments if you don't have the numbers to support it. ""Ethnic cleansing"" is a very powerful expression. If in 1948 there were around
700,000 Palestinians, and today there are 7 million
in the Land of Israel, you can't really use this term. However, if you want to use the
words ""ethnic cleansing"",  you can do so to describe what
happened to the Jews in Arab countries. In Morocco in 1948, there
were 265,000 Jews. Today, there are around 2000. In Iraq, there were
135,000 Jews in 1948. Today, there are fewer than 10. Algeria used to be
home to 140,000 Jews. Today, there are fewer than 50,
and I can go on. It is Muslim countries who perpetrated
ethnic cleansing on the Jews. But this statement doesn't quite cover
what has been happening. Muslims have been doing this to all
minorities, not only to the Jews. If you zoom out, you will see that
a hundred years ago there were many Christian communities
and other small ethnic groups in the Middle East. They are all
being wiped out by Muslims. For some reason, the Western world,
the Christian world, doesn't want to talk about it. As a Jew, I care about
what is going on with Jews all over the world,
and I find it very odd that Christians don't really care
about Nazareth or Bethlehem, which are kind of important to the
followers of Jesus, and used to be 80%
Christians 50 years ago, and now are 80% Muslims. The same goes for Christians in
Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt. In Nigeria, Muslim organizations
have murdered thousands of Christians. 2 million Christians have fled Iraq
and become refugees in the last two decades.
But no one seems to care about them, neither the
media nor the universities. Everyone is obsessed with the
Palestinian refugees. Did you know that the UN has two
agencies for refugees? One for hundreds of millions
of refugees all over the world, and another one called UNWRA,
which is only for the most privileged refugees on earth—
the Palestinians. Don't just take my word for it. 
Check it out for yourself. So let's talk about the story the
Palestinians like to tell and the media likes to repeat:  ""The Palestinians lived in
Palestine for hundreds of years. They lived peacefully alongside
a small Jewish minority, until the rise of Zionism:
a colonialist movement which, under the umbrella
of the European imperial powers, started kicking the Palestinians
out of their land and homes, causing the current situation."" And now for the facts. In the long history of the Land of
Israel, there was never such a thing as a Palestinian people until
the 20th century. Millions of pilgrims have come to the
Land of Israel over the last 3000 years. They've come across Jews,
Arabs, Christians, Muslims, Druze, Turks.
They've never met a Palestinian. Now, you might say, regardless of
whether they have existed as a nation all people should enjoy human rights
and all people should have the right to identify
themselves as they wish. And I agree. You have the right to
identify yourself however you like,  but you don't have the right to
reinvent history, and the history of the region
is very clear.  This is probably the most documented
piece of land on the planet. There is a very good book, a very ancient and popular
book about the connections of the Jews to Judea.
It is called the Bible. Now, wait, wait, I know what you
are thinking: ""He's going to say that God gave this land to the Jews.""
And no. If you believe that God gave this land to the Jews—great,
and if not—also great. The undeniable point is that
there is a strong connection between the Jews and
the Land of Israel. There are thousands of books from
the last 3000 years that write about Jews and the Land of Israel, and in
archaeological digs we find Jewish coins, Jewish texts,
and Jewish artifacts. There isn't a single book or piece
of archaeological evidence that point to a
Palestinian people. You don't like what I'm saying?
Then prove me wrong. But it is much more than that. The connection of Christians
and Muslims to Jerusalem is based on the
Jewish connection. Jesus was Jewish, and the
connection of Muslims to Jerusalem is also based on the Jews.
Let me explain. I will go even further and say that
Jerusalem was never the capital of a Muslim empire. It was always
Cairo, Damascus or Baghdad. Jerusalem was mostly important to the
Muslims when they were fighting against the Jews or the Christians. Under Muslim rule, Jerusalem was
often a very neglected city.  This makes sense, as Jerusalem,
which is mentioned some 600 times in the Jewish Bible, isn't
even mentioned once in the Quran. Chapter 17 of the Quran talks about
the night journey of Muhammad. He ascended from Al-Aqsa, which means
""the most faraway mosque"". How did it come to be
associated with Jerusalem? In order to understand this,
you need to go back to the Jews. The Jews had two temples on what is now
known as Temple Mount. The temples were located on the
holiest site for the Jews, which is the top of Mount Moriah.
The first temple was destroyed by the Babylonians and the second was
destroyed by the Roman Empire. 60 years after the Romans
destroyed the temple, the Jews rebuilt again, and the Romans
changed the name of the region from ""Judea"" to ""Palestina""— and this is how the name came to be. It was intended to disconnect the Jews
from the name Judea. 700 years after the destruction of the
temple, the Muslims colonized the Land of Israel and said that
Muhammad ascended to heaven from the place where
the Jewish temples stood. Now at this point, you may well be saying
""What? The Muslims believe that Muhammad ascended to heaven from the exact 
same spot that is the holiest site for the Jews? And this is not
written in the Quran?"" Yes. And if you find it strange, that's because
you don't know Jerusalem. Nothing makes a place more holy than
competition with another religion. The Muslims took the place which was
the holiest for the Jews, 1500 years prior to the existence of Islam,
and made it their third holiest place. Don't believe me?
Here is a pamphlet of the Waqf, the Muslim authorities, that say 
that this is the location of the Temple of King Solomon. Although what I'm saying here is very basic history, there is a good
chance you don't know about it. And I don't blame you.
You hear so much about the conflict, but the media tends to forget the basics. Jerusalem was always
the center of Jewish life. Muslims turn their back on Jerusalem
when they pray towards Mecca, and Jews pray towards Jerusalem.
When Jews get married, part of the ceremony is to say that we will
never forget Jerusalem. Jews have almost always lived in Jerusalem,
even under the harshest conditions. Since the 13th century, the Muslims
haven't allowed the Jews to pray at their holiest site, the Temple Mount,
and the Jews have had to pay extra taxes and suffer harassment. They have even had to
pay the Muslims a fee to pray at the Western Wall,
the closest to the Temple Mount they were allowed to pray. The Islamization of Jewish sites
hasn't only happened in Jerusalem. In Hebron, one of four cities
that are holy to the Jews, there is the Cave of the Patriarchs,
which, according to tradition, is the place where 
Abraham was buried. To humiliate the Jews, Muslims didn't
allow them to enter the building, and Jews were only allowed to
walk up to the seventh step. Only in 1967, when Israelis liberated Hebron, were Jews allowed, for the
first time in 700 years, to enter the second holiest
place for Jews. Why do I say ""liberated"" Hebron and
not ""conquered""? I will get to that in a minute. And now we get to the interesting part:
The 19th century and Zionism. Jews have always migrated, or,
as we say in Hebrew, ""gone up"" to the Land of Israel. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Jews came
from all over the Jewish world: From Europe, from North Africa,
from Yemen—in small numbers, due to the harsh conditions— but there was always a steady
movement of Jews coming to Israel. The first Zionist Congress was
held in 1897, but 50 years beforehand,  in the 1850s, there were
more Jews than Muslims in Jerusalem. In the rest of the land, yes,
there were more Muslims, but it is important to know
that even before the start of the Zionist movement,
there were dozens of Jewish settlements in the Land of Israel. In the last decades of the
Ottoman Empire,  as in all empires, there were
lots of different groups. Some groups got bigger with time,
some smaller. Some bought land, some sold land. Many European powers bought land
for institutions, and some groups, mostly Germans and Americans,
settled in the Land of Israel to speed up the second coming of Jesus.
Many different groups. None of the groups used the word
""Palestinian"" to describe themselves. The First Zionist Congress took
place in 1897. The Zionist movement was a
national movement, not a colonialist or an
imperialist movement, but a national one,
one of many. This was the age of the fall of empires—
the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire
and the Ottoman Empire— and of the rise of national movements.
And the Zionist movement was the national movement of the Jews.
It is as simple as that. In the first half of the 20th century,
millions of people moved from one place to another to create nation states. What's special about the Jews is that they never stole
or used violence to take any land in the Land of Israel.
I'm always getting comments from Muslims and pro-Palestinians about Jews
stealing the land from the local Arabs. Here is a challenge for you: Give me the name of one village
that the Jews stole from the Arabs— from the seventh century, when
the Arab Caliphate colonized the Land of Israel—until 1947,
when the Arabs started a war to wipe out the Jews.
From the year 636 till 1947, not a single square foot
was stolen by the Jews. Again, if you don't like what I'm saying,
then prove me wrong. Give me the names of villages that
Jews stole prior to the War of Independence. On the other hand, I can give you lots
of names of Jewish villages that Arabs— or Palestinians, if you will—
destroyed before 1948. Take Hebron, for example. Jews lived in Hebron
for hundreds of years.  In 1929, the Arabs—not 1 or 10,
but whole gangs of Arabs— murdered 70 Jews, and the
ancient Jewish settlement had to be abandoned until
it was brought back into Jewish hands in 1967. You want more names of Jewish
villages that were abandoned because of Arab violence?
Here are some more. Many were rebuilt
after a few years. The Arabs used violence
against Jewish civilians in the Land of Israel many years 
before the occupation, and many years before the
Land of Israel was established. And by the way, 
they didn't only use violence against the Jews,
Christians suffered as well. Remember the German and American
settlements I told you about? They suffered as well.
The family of John Steinbeck, the American novelist,
had a farm outside Jaffa. Or at least they had it until Arabs
broke in and murdered Steinbeck's great uncle and sexually assaulted
his wife and his daughter. Here is an interesting anecdote:
Two other great American novelists, Mark Twain and Herman Melville,
visited the Land of Israel, and like hundreds of other pilgrims,
they wrote about how neglected the land was, and many wrote about how
violent the local Arabs were. From 1917 until 1948,
the British and the French were in control of the Middle East. The Jews blamed the British for being
pro-Arab, and the Arabs blamed the British for being pro-Jewish. I will tell it as it was: the British were pro-British. They had two main interests in the region:
to have oil flowing from Iraq to the port of Haifa, and to ensure
the Suez Canal remained open. And because both of these interests
lay in the hands of the Arabs, they were pro-Arab. Today it is very fashionable
to be against colonial powers, and of course they did
do a lot of damage. But I find it absurd that
pro-Palestinians are anti-colonial,  as it was the Roman Empire
that gave the name ""Palestine"" to the area,
and the British Empire that gave it its borders. When the British and the French
drew lines on maps, they invented two nations that never
existed before: the Palestinians and the Jordanians. Another fact that is often overlooked
is that pro-Palestinians are always talking about Jewish immigrants
coming from Europe. No one talks about the Arabs who
came to the Land of Israel. Hundreds of thousands of Arabs
from Egypt, Syria and other places entered the Land of Israel
in the 1930s and 40s to work for the British, and are
now seen as native Palestinians. It is hard to estimate
the number of Arabs who entered the Land of Israel
between 1917 to 1947 to work for the British,
as the borders were open, but the number is in the
hundreds of thousands. Probably about half of the
population of Gaza came to the Land of Israel
during the British Mandate time. Their last names usually hint 
towards the actual origin of the family. I find it absurd that people like
my great grandmother, who came to Israel from
Eastern Europe in the 1920s after dreaming about the
Jewish homeland for generations, are seen as white colonialists,
while Egyptians who came to work for the British in 1945
are seen as native Palestinians. Now you might be saying,
""Who cares where they came from and if they have been
here for generations? They have the right to self-determination"". And again, I agree. In 1947, the UN proposed a
division of the land into a Jewish state
and an Arab state. The Jews said ""yes"",
and the Arabs said ""no"",  and then started a war
in a bid to eliminate the Jews. The morning after the Partition Plan,
Palestinians attacked a bus and murdered five Jews. This is how the war was started. They were offered a state,
they said no, and started murdering Jewish civilians. Not a single Jew was spared
in all of the places that fell into local Palestinian hands. Luckily for us, after 15 months
of fighting the local Arabs and the five Arab armies
that invaded Israel, we won. And yes, during the War of
Independence, many Arab villages were destroyed and about 700,000
people were displaced. That's what happens when you try to
wipe out your neighbors. You might well lose
and have to pay the price. At the same time, 800,000 Jews were
brutally expelled from Muslim countries. For some reason, no one cares about
them or wants to tell their story. Millions of articles and papers
have been written about the Palestinians who
had to evacuate their homes because of a war they started.
Yet very little has been written about the Jews living in Muslim
countries who were subjected to pogroms and had to flee,
even though they were innocent. Please tell me why you care so
deeply about the Palestinian refugees, and yet you couldn't care
less about all the millions of other refugees who had to flee at
the same time: 14 million Germans, about the same
number of Hindus and Muslims, Ukrainians, Armenians, Poles,
people from the Balkans... and I could go on and on. The Palestinian refugees are the most
privileged refugees in the world. Some say that the Partition Plan wasn't fair,
as the Jews made up one third of the population, but got two
thirds of the land. To that I will say this: The Arabs actually also got
what is now known as Jordan. So in fact, the Jews got a 
much smaller part. And I should also add that
the Arabs got all the good land and the Jews got the
swampland and the desert land. And now I'm going to state a fact
that is definitely going to annoy all the haters of Israel:
The Jews took the swampland and the desert land and made
the impossible possible. We turned the land into gold.
Israel is a pioneer in irrigation systems and desalination systems. Israel invented vegetables and
fruits that can grow in salt water and yet taste sweet. As for the Arabs, the large part of
their land is now polluted and contaminated. After 1948, the Palestinians had years
to establish a free Palestinian state as they were under Egyptian
and Jordanian rule. Yet they didn't do that. In 1964, the Palestinians established the
PLO, or the Palestinian Liberation Organization.  Now, this is interesting. 1964 is three years before the Six-Day War,
so before Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,
and before a single settlement was built, they were already calling for the
destruction of Israel. When the Arabs say ""free Palestine"", they don't mean ""we want
an independent Palestinian state next to Israel."" What they want is a Palestinian
state that replaces Israel. The Palestinians kept rejecting all
offers made to them from 1947 till 2008, when Ehud Olmert,
the Israeli Prime Minister,  offered the Palestinian all the West Bank and East Jerusalem as their capital. They said ""no"" to every offer that was
made to them, invested all the money they received from the world in terror,
and then cried that they were the victims. The Palestinians do have a harder life than we Israelis, but they only
have themselves to blame. So what is the solution?
When will there be peace? Not in the near future, because this
conflict is not about the land. I've already told you that
even before the Six-Day War, and even before 1948,
the Palestinians were trying to wipe out the Jews. Here is another example.
Take Gaza. In 2005, Israelis withdrew
from the Gaza Strip. Gaza is an Israeli/Jew-free area. The Palestinians get more money
than any other group on the planet. From the US, from the
European Union, from Arab countries, from the UN. And what do they do
with this money? Infrastructure?
Education? No. They build tunnels and buy
weapons to kill Jews. Why do they do that? The Hamas
constitution makes it very clear. The first sentence is ""Israel will exist
until Islam wipes it out."" It doesn't say ""we want peace."" It doesn't say
""we want a Palestinian state."" It clearly says ""until Islam wipes it out"". They want a Muslim Caliphate.
I respect Hamas for one thing only: For actually expressing and being
clear about what they want, which is to eliminate Israel. Personally, I want the Palestinians to
have a democratic state with human rights and freedoms, and I wish for
all Arabs and Muslims to have the same. But what I want is not
necessarily what they want. To solve the problem, you
need to understand the problem. And the problem is made up
of two things: One, which Westerners don't
understand anymore—religion, and one which Westerners don't
want to talk about—values. Religion plays no role at all
in European politics.  In the US, politicians do say
""God Bless America"", and the debate surrounding
abortion is partly religious. But when it comes to foreign policies,
you don't hear American generals talk about spreading
the Word of Jesus. In the Muslim world, it is very different.
When Arabs kill Jews at a music festival,
or Christians in a school in Nigeria, or one another in Syria, Yemen, Libya.
What is it they shout? ""Allahu Akbar!""
""God Is Great!"" ""Jihad"" is a religious war
against the infidels. To many Europeans, the words
""infidels"" and ""heresy"" probably remind them of dark days that 
played out hundreds of years ago, when Catholics and Protestants
were killing each other. Sadly, this is still the situation in
some parts of the Muslim world. Just think about the organizations you
hear about in the Muslim world: Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad,
ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, the Taliban. These aren't national organizations.
They are all religious organizations. Now let's talk about the
bigger issue: Values. Lots of people run from this as if
they were running from fire, because the biggest concern is
potentially being called a racist. I want to be 100% clear here, although I know that some will do
their best to misunderstand me. If I say that men are more
violent than women, does it mean I hate all men?
No. Does it mean that I think
all men are violent? No. Does it mean that there are
no violent women? No. But if in almost all countries,
more than 90% of those in jails are men, then you can say that men
are more violent than women. I believe you can
criticize anyone for anything. You can criticize me as a Jew,
as an Israeli, as a man, as a tour guide.
You can criticize me for things I can't change, like my identity,
and for the things I chose, like my profession, the music I like,
the fact that I'm a father. My identity is comprised of
thousands of different aspects, and you can criticize any one of them.
And I can agree or disagree. I can say, ""True, Israelis aren't
very polite, and they don't know how to form a queue,
but I'm different"". And I can also accept the criticism.
If you are not a narcissist, you know that you're not perfect.
I don't subscribe to the narrative that you are only allowed
to say good things about other groups and criticize your own.
I actually want to be criticized. I want to be made to think,
to be made to improve my ways. The #MeToo movement
made me rethink the way I interact with women and made me
more aware of the language I use. I criticize all groups:
Americans, Germans, Britney Spears fans,
ultra-Orthodox Jews, women, Gen Z and Muslims. I even criticize the most dangerous
group of all: Israeli mothers. If a teacher writes that
she is sick, there is no need for 30 ""get well soon"" messages.
You don't show that you care by writing a message, you are just
spamming my WhatsApp. If there were peace in all of the
Middle East, and only the Arab-Muslim Palestinians were
resorting to violence, I would say, ""Okay, maybe we are in the wrong."" But if the Palestinians were using
violence before 1967 and before 1948, and almost all of the Arab-Muslim
countries are dictatorships with high levels of violence and low
levels of human rights, then maybe there's really
a problem here..? I'm also getting comments from Muslims
blaming colonialism and the Americans for all the problems
in the Muslim world. And it is true that the creation
of many countries and borders in Africa and Asia were determined
by the interests of the European empires, and that the US thinks primarily
about its own interests. But I'm always shocked to find that Muslims
take no responsibility for their wrongdoing. The fact that most of
the Muslim countries aren't democratic has nothing to do
with the US. The fact that 17 of the 20 most
dangerous countries for the LGBTQ community are Muslim has
nothing to do with colonialism. The fact that almost
all of the most dangerous places in the world to be a
Christian are Muslim, has nothing to do with imperialism. The Muslim world is huge. It has a lot of oil, and its failure
has very little to do with colonialism. Look at the Jews: One-third of them
were murdered by the Nazis, Israel has no oil, and it is
surrounded by enemies. And yet we are successful.
And it's not because of American money. Most of that money
has to be used to buy military equipment from
American companies. And besides, the Palestinians
get way more money. We are successful because we are
open minded, think outside the box, invest in education
and are not violent. This is true outside the Middle East, too.
Look at Arab-Muslim communities in Europe. If there were violent
riots in Paris or Sweden, Rotterdam or London,
would it be in the Jewish neighborhoods
or the Arab neighborhoods? Peace will only come when
the Arabs change their values, when Muslim countries become democratic,
when all of the different groups in Syria stop killing one another,
when Iranian women are free to cover or not cover their hair,
when gay men are not thrown from rooftops in Gaza
or thrown into jail by the PLO, when the Christian populations stop
shrinking in the Middle East, and when the Israeli Arabs
stop killing one another— then, and only then,
will there be true peace. Please like and share this video with

a place of conflict between Arab and Jew imagine waking up to a world where the sound of children playing is replaced by the Roar of rockets this is the reality of many in Israel and Palestine today overnight an unforeseen Invasion occurred Hamas Fighters stormed Israeli towns launching thousands of rockets the result hundreds dead on both sides but what exactly happened and how did we get here the conflict between Israel and Palestine is over a century old rooted in territorial and religious disputes to understand the complexities of this conflict we first need to delve into some key players and regions involved enter Hamas Hamas which basically means Zeal in Arabic is a Palestinian political and militant group it was founded by shik Ahmed Yasin to fight and break away from his Israel they first came into prominence in 1987 when Palestine revolted against the state of Israel this group sees themselves as Defenders of Palestinian rights against Israeli occupation now according to a video by Wall Street Journal the attack on Israel began when the same Hamas militants launched multiple rockets on Israel these militants infiltrated Israel near the kamam Shalom Crossing and important checkpoint between Israel and Gaza they broke the Border fence and attacked the Israeli milit based there and by late morning these militants began destroying sections of the Border barriers allowing more of them to infiltrate by 7:30 a.m. the Hamas militants were spotted in Israeli towns and cities multiple Israeli civilians were taken as life hostages and many more were killed as of today 2,300 people have been injured and more than 700 people have lost their life this is what's happening and it's absolutely heart checking to explain the whole conflict I want to take you back in time to understand the roots of this conflict let's go back to early 20th century this is when Palestine was ruled by the Ottoman Empire at that time seeing the rising anti-Semitism in Europe a small segment of Jewish people started settling in this Ottoman Empire then during World War I entered everyone's favorite Empire the British Empire now these British wanted to defeat the Ottoman Empire so to gather support they made a deal with both the Arabs and Jews in in this region to help this was the very beginning of the Palestinian conflict that we see today see these britishers knew what both parties wanted so they promised the Arabs Independence and the Jewish people a separate country because there was a rising belief among Jews that they should have their separate land in Palestine and this movement was called Zionism so after the British overthrew the Ottoman Empire in order to fulfill their deal they decided to car out some land in Palestine and give it to the Jews who were a growing population as more Jews had fled Europe during and after the World War II now this didn't go down very well with the Arabs and they resisted this this turned things extremely violent the British were unable to control the violence and in 1947 after 30 years of controlling Palestine they washed this hand of the country in the hands of United Nations to control the situation United Nations proposed partition of the land and assigned over 55% of the land to Jews which angered the Arabs even more the situation escalated and finally violence broke out between the two sets of people again and this was the very first Arab Israeli War of 1948 so what was the result of this war the Jews or the Palestinian Jews who declared themselves as a state of Israel controlled not only the area proposed by United Nations but also gained almost 60% of the area proposed for the Arab State several massacres by the Israeli forces took place in 1948 which forced 250,000 Arabs to leave the country now Israel had captured most of the land except Gaza which came under Egypt's control and the West Bank which came under Jordan's control since then there were more and more attempts to partition the land but nothing concrete materialized except more violence until 1967 after a 6- day war Israel finally captured the West Bank Gaza and saai Peninsula from Egypt but they returned it back in 1978 under a peace treaty brokered by the US called the Camp David Accord now almost 10 years had passed after the peace treaty in 1987 when violent protest broke out again with Palestinian Arabs revolting against Israel's military occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip This was known as intifa a turning point in the story between Israel and Palestine because it led to the formation of the extremist militant Group which we spoke about earlier the Hamas which is currently attacking is Israel in 2000s the second intifa adapted which pushed Israel to leave Gaza by 2007 Hamas had captured Gaza after the fight with another extremist group The Fate which went on to control the West Bank which brings us to today what triggered Hamas to invade Israel and where did things go horribly wrong it's too early to provide fixed reasons but this is what has been reported as of today Israel established a blockade in Gaza after Hamas captured it and according to the Human Rights group it's described as an open air prison which has left 45% of the population there unemployed the condition is similar in the West Bank where Israel has established a separation wall cutting off thousands of Palestinians from Social Services schools and farmlands now over the last few years tensions between the Israeli settlers in these areas and the Palestinians have been growing and this tension erupted after the AL AA mosque incident recently so alaka mosque is considered the holiest place in both Judaism and Islam according to Seattle Times in the past few years Jews were prevented from praying inside the compound to avoid any violent protest from the Palestinians but last week according to the guardian the Palestinian Jews trayed inside the mosque compound which triggered the Palestinian Arabs now the exact motivation behind this attack is not clear but according to Hamas spokesperson Khaled Kumi this became the trigger point and led them to launch a coordinated attack on Israel now while the h are claiming this as a reason to protect their holy Shrine several innocent civilians are getting brutally killed both in Palestine and in Israel during war it is very easy to point figures to label one side as right and the other is wrong but the Stark reality is there are no true winners in Wars economies crumble children lose their lives and entire nations bear the scars of conflict online on Twitter you'll see people voicing their support for Palestine While others tauny support Israel but what they're essentially forgetting is that millions are suffering our heart goes out to everybody going through this conflict our job is to come here and educate you all on the implications and horrors of what's happening so you can be smart and make your own opinions and decisions Wars are extremely complex in nature but we have tried to explain the gist of what's happening through this video that is all for today my name is Aina Maya thank you for watching"
52,xAs5EOBUDcs,Rory Stewart Attempts to Explain the History of Israel-Palestine in 10 Minutes,"How did Hamas launch one of the largest invasions on Israeli territory in recent history? What happens now? Will this conflict have geo-political ramifications throughout the Middle East?

Join Rory and Alastair for this emergency episode of The Rest Is Politics.

The CNN interview Rory mentions was with Palestinian National Initiative leader Mustafa Barghouti.",2023-10-11,1851211,29969,7269,UCsufaClk5if2RGqABb-09Uw," welcome to the restus politics with me alist Campbell and me Rory Stewart now Rory we've been trying for a couple of days now to get together and do something on what's been happening in Israel and Gaza and we put out a a question to listeners this morning saying what would you like to ask us about what's happening in the Middle East right now and I can tell you the single most asked question was asking Rory for one of his explainers now so take us from the beginning of time to where we are now in two minutes yeah and with without getting in trouble from every side well that is the problem you know I've noticed that already I've been Twitter is the worst place in the world to debate this issue I've discovered that which is why I've stopped debating it on there it's virtually impossible to say anything that is nuanced that is not black and white about this situation and the truth is as you know as we'll hear from you very very shortly you need a bit of nuance in this because it is so steeped and difficult history and very very complicated so why don't you just try and give us a bit of a a background I'll give it a go and with with apologies to people because there's a lot of sensitivities here so essentially um going back 3,000 years state of Israel was um dominated by a Jewish community and they were displaced just under 2,000 years ago basically by the Romans and uh large Jewish communities formed then in places like Iraq and Yemen but but also in in Europe central eastern Europe and in Spain and Portugal and in many other places too the um and then at the beginning of the 20th century end of the 19th beginning of 20th century there was the beginnings of a Zionist movement pushing for a Homeland for the Jewish people driven by the fact that Jews had experienced appalling discrimination and brutal pgms a murder murderous uh attacks on them over many many hundreds of years but mounting particularly in central eastern Europe in the late 19th century the British got behind this with a Baler declaration about the time of the first world war and there was increasing Jewish uh movement back to the former state of Israel but of course during the nearly 2,000 years this had become very much a place dominated by Arab Muslim communities so the Jews were moving back into a a populated place and the British initially after the first world war set up a mandate where they were trying to balance uh the interests of Arabs and Jews found themselves in the middle of an increasing Civil War and the the Brits were actually uh targets of terrorist attacks from both Arabs and and Jews and then of course the defining horror of the second world war the Holocaust in which 6 million European Jews are killed and which absolutely demonstrates to the world the extremity of the threat that Jews face and the requirement for a Jewish homeland which then drives into large numbers of Jews moving to Palestine after the war and in 1948 led by David Boran a the setting up of the state of Israel driven by actually uh an Israeli military assault that takes a lot of the territory previously held by Arab communities and involves many many Arabs being displaced from their homes and that state of Israel that 1948 state is then recognized largely by the International Community although not by many Palestinians and that remains the situation till 1967 when it then faces a simultaneous attack from Egypt Syria and then belatedly Jordan after the second world war Britain gave up the Mandate and the Jews in Israel fought to create a state which they created in 1948 and that state involved the Christian that state involved the displacement of quite a lot of the Arab Palestinian communities who were living in those areas that state was then recognized by the United Nations and then in 1967 there was an attack on Israel by Egypt uh Syria and belatedly Jordan and on the 1967 war Israel won a very very rapid Victory about six days and it took a lot of territory which was outside the 1948 borders so it took Gaza which we're going to be talking about today it took the West Bank which had previously been controlled by Jordan Gaza had previously been controlled by Egypt and just so we're clear to that that is why when people talk about the occupied uh Palestinian territories that is what they're talking about absolutely when when most people talk about the occupied Palestinian territories they're talking about those bits that were taken by Israel after 1967 now there's a detail here which is that there are also parts of the Palestinian movement who reject the original state of Israel and the 1948 borders but broadly speaking when people talk about the occupied Palestinian territories they're talking about these areas there was then another War um which is important to us because it was the anniversary of that war that triggered these recent attacks almost exactly 50 years ago a yum kipor War where there was another attack which Israel again uh beat off but with much more difficulty um fast forward and in the 1990s and we're now coming into stuff that you you began to connect with person in your professional life there were then a series of peace talks uh particularly around Oslo and the conclusion of Oslo was that territories would be divided into categories a b and c so there would be Palestinian territories there would be territories under mix control and C which were going to be Israeli territories and the idea was to push ahead with a two-state solution a Palestinian Authority emerged on the West Bank with its capital at ramala and in Gaza another form of Palestinian Authority emerged and the challenge there was that these territories are not contiguous they didn't form a joined up country in fact increasingly because of Israeli settlers who've been putting uh houses and settlements in beyond the 1967 boundaries it actually is a series of tiny enclaves over a 100 little enclaves um divided by checkpoints and walls fast forward to um 2004 2005 and Israel withdraws from Gaza and that's the first big move they actually remove a few thousand settlers who are there forcibly remove a few thousand settlers and hand it over to Palestinian control not long after that happens a movement called hammer which is a much more radical islamist group much more strongly associated with terrorism takes over the Gaza Strip which is this bit that runs basically from Egypt along the coast along the edge of Israel and the Palestinians are then divided between this Hamas controlled area which is the Gaza Strip and the rest which is controlled by the former P the fata government uh then there were FAS there were Israeli attacks both uh fights in reprisal against attacks from Hamas AR Gaza reprisals about attacks from hisbah which is another group which is based in southern Lebanon and fast forward to where we were about a week ago and a week ago Jake Sullivan the US National Security adviser was on the record saying the Middle East had never been so peaceful and the reason I think he thought that is that Israel had developed a special missile protection shield which meant it was increasingly difficult for these Palestinian groups to fire either from hisbah Hammer's Rockets into Israel and do damage there hadn't been that number of uh attacks and most of the focus in Israel as we picked up on the Pod over the last few months has actually been not about palestin it's been an internal Israeli fight between liberals and conservatives to do with challenging the way in which the Israeli government is moving in a populist Direction has brought in far-right people like a man called smotrich the finance minister pushing to overturn the independent Judiciary in Israel and that was broadly the situation um when on early Saturday morning the attack started I'll stop there that was a very long explainer well I thought it was a very very good explainer um and there will doubtless be some people who will object to some exclusions and some inclusions and I'm afraid that's the that's the nature of what we're talking about so um look I I don't want to ventriloquize for people but broadly speaking um if you want to see the view of I suppose a pretty middleof the road Palestinian politician uh there is a great interview which you'll will share in the links which has just been done on CNN 9 Minute interview uh in which a fata politician gives his views on the situation but broadly speaking from the Palestinian point of view they would say yes there's been a terrorist attack and most of them would say they would not in any way condone the killing of civilians and then the what would then happen is they would then say you need to understand that Gaza is from their point of view a prison camp with really no ability from people to go in and out it's a humanitarian disaster where people lack basic supplies and that at the root of this violence is an Israeli occup ation which Palestinians will then explain and you'll see it better if you're interested in this interview on CNN explains involve breaking tan territory into tiny enclaves checkpoints and what they experience as an aparte State and they call it an aparte State because they feel that they are not being given full civil and Democratic rights and if they were given full civil and Democratic rights the situation would be very different that's the Palestinian point of view the Israeli point of view there are many Israeli points of view but they would start by saying listen understand that these are very serious enemies out there that Hamas back in the 1990s had a founding Charter dedicated to the complete elimination of the state of Israel that states like Iran were committed to the elimination state of Israel that the 67 War and the Yum kipor War were designed basically to wipe them off the face of the map that they feel that they have been uh marginalized and um attacked unfairly at United Nations forums for decades while other countries like China and Zimbabwe and Cuba haven't been attacked in the same way they feel it's an existential threat they would emphasize that the isra Army warns civilians before it attacks buildings uh they will emphasize and again there are many different views on this 1967 territory but some Israelis would say the territory they took is essenti for protection of the state of Israel that the Goan Heights for example were artillery positions from which the syrians reigned Rockets down on them and that Israel's right to defend itself involves being very realistic about the significant threat that Palestinians pose um so somewhere uh there are those two positions and there will be 500 other positions we look forward to the conversation just on Oslo by the way the we had lots and lots of questions as I say but one of them was about good books to read and there is actually there was a brilliant play about the Oslo Accords and I think from memory it was called Oso it was by somebody called Taylor but it it was published as a book and it's it's worth um it's worth getting hold of that absolutely amazing play and it's one of those plays that you can read and get a sense of the drama and just before we go on to What's Happening Now coincidentally and I didn't know that Jake Sullivan had said that um that is pretty remarkable and just before these attacks literally the day before the the latest attacks by Hamas which have been bigger and more violent and more deadly than anything we've seen from them before and the anything the Israelis have endured before which is why they're calling it 911 plus Pearl Harbor in one um but our good friend the new European had a five-page spread in last week's paper called 18 days that shook the World about the yam kapor war that you mentioned and I think you're right that that was one of the the key moments in the history when you said there Rory about the people feeling that this was had never been safer and that is Israel felt secure when there finally was a ceasefire after this um the after the yapor war which went on for 18 days there was little rejoicing in Israel the failure to foresee the attack was the greatest failure in Israel is history one analyst analyst blamed arrogance lack of understanding of the Abundant intelligence and disregard for the enemy the military historian John Hughes Wilson described it as a classic example of confusing political aspirations with hard fact for good or ill Israel would never make the same mistakes again and here we are with and and here again so to remind people of what actually happened so 6:30 in the morning Hamas out of Gaza which is this Coastal strip adjoining Egypt fired perhaps 5,000 Rockets the Israelis are saying 2,500 rockets and then about an hour later they tore through the barriers through the fences that divide Gaza from Israel some coming in from boat one person coming in from Air bulldozers ripping down the eras Crossing and simultaneously drove ins some cases 20 30 kilm into Israel and uh began the most violent series of terrorist attacks some of them were directed against military targets so you'll see images of commanders Israeli commanders being um one of them I think in his box of shorts being kidnapped and taken into a car um tanks being seized uh they have to being hit by drones and Gaza Gaza divisional headquarters being stormed and the zikim base so it you know a big military frontal attack but also the Real Horror at the center of things which people will have focused on which was that there was a a festival taking place and people have been dancing up all night and 7:30 in the morning sun was Rising just coming to the end of the festival and into the middle of the final stages came a group of terrorists on bikes and trucks and began opening fire on the crowd killed something like it's difficult to know 250 260 people um and then went back across the border taking over 160 hostages and some of the fighters remained on the ground continued to fight holding police stations um in Border towns uh the Israeli military then mounted a Counter Strike which has probably killed about 400 people so far um and I mean I think that the thing to to say Obviously before we go any further on this is that hamus is a terrorist oper organization very clear terrorist organization this isn't the first time they've done this some people are saying you know why did they hit women and children the truth of the matter is that hamus has been behind indiscriminate suicide bomb attacks um they had an explicit policy of targeting civilians um since since the mid 1990s and they are recognized as a terrorist organization by the EU by the US and actually much more recently by the UK 2022 I think and Australia 2023 um but much of the rest of the world does not recognize hamus as a terrorist organization they treat them as the legitimate government because they're the the elected government um in in the Gaza Strip over to you no I I think what we're seeing is beyond anything that we've SE that the the Israeli people have seen as you say within the Palestinian context um there has been a lot of Bloodshed there's been a lot of anger it's been building I do think that once this thing hopefully calms down hopefully settles down though I think it could be I think this could be a long long long time but there are some massive questions for the Israelis they have perhaps the most most vaunted intelligence agency in the world um they really will be asking themselves some very very hard questions about as to how this happened because when you watched the scenes that you described there with the the fences being attacked with people arriving on hand gliders with the the levels of Armory that were available it seems to me remarkable that the Israelis literally did not seem to have a whiff of this um or if they did they were certainly not very well prepared and I think what's happening now quite rightly there's been massive uh widespread condemnation a little a little bit like Ukraine though we should be careful not to imagine that it's Universal uh I think we saw in the debate at the United Nations last night that the the the the straight divide in that body was on display again but generally a sense of absolute outrage and condemnation and support certainly in most of the countries that where most of our listeners are support for Israel's rights to defend itself but now um slightly into unknown territory because the hostages which we should with taking of Civilian hostages taking any hostages in this situation of War crime which they that does complicate things further um a lot of talk already about whether that there will be a ground offensive Byers Israel into Gaza which is one of the most densely populated places on Earth by the way yeah 2 million people in in a strip roughly 25 miles long very narrow strip of land um so the fear that there must be in that place uh will be horrendous and meanwhile Jews around the world I mean this is this was brought home to me in the very calm and peaceful setting of of my morning swim this morning talking to some Jewish people who are regular swimmers there who are feeling that sense of fear anxiety real concern and Dread about what about what's happening not not because they know people there yeah and was reason also not just because the horror coming out of Israel but also because an Egyptian policeman opened fire and killed two Israeli tourists after this um little bit on Gaza so hamus is is a something that emerged from the Muslim Brotherhood and different to the pl and fat it was from its beginning an islamist organization very much sort of I'm not I mean it's a misleading way to put it but it's in the broad tradition of the Muslim Brotherhood and even the Taliban it's a group that very much Prides itself on religion it's has very conservative social codes but it's not imposing them entirely I mean there's been some examples of it but it's not legally imposing them on the population there their brand was being cleaner less corrupt than the previous government but from the moment they've taken over they have faced a blockade so although Israel withdrew from Gaza it controls six out of the seven of the border crossings it controls all the air access and sea access to Gaza it provides all the electricity all the water supply all the Telecommunications for Gaza and the Israeli Army Reserves the right to enter um Gaza whenever it feels it has a security reason to do so the trade from Gaza the economy of Gaza really collapsed after these blockades were put in place because people didn't want to do business with a terrorist group it's kept afloat with support from in different ways turkey catar and uh Iran Iran putting the support more into the military attacks katar very focused on humanitarian uh support for people it's I think 160th poorest country in the world now in GDP per capita you know real shortage of water supply sewage and and one of the questions going forward is I suppose two questions one of them is is your point about the potential Israeli response inside Gaza because it's not going to be possible for Israel as it were to reoccupy Gaza if you think about the fighting mosul where the Iraqi Army tried to retake mosul from the Islamic State that was a multi-year operation that involved destroying most of the city and I don't think we should be expecting Israel to be attempting to try to do house toh house fighting in a place of 2.2 million people but there's going to be a lot of pressure now being put by Israel on countries to cease all forms of support for Gaza but that of course will also mean that you're on this knife Edge between providing support development support which keeps the hamus government alive but also preventing a humanitarian catastrophe so Qatar is a very odd example of this Qatar is criticized Often by Israeli politicians for by providing support to Gaza but then often says that behind closed doors they're encouraged to continue to provide support to Gaza by factions within Israeli government because they don't want a humanitarian crisis there and on the on the point of the humanitarian crisis couple of points first of all when when the Israelis are saying to the people in Gaza um essentially advising them to to move out um it's very very hard to know where they go in such a densely populated place where they can't come and go freely and the focus on the Middle East and the the Israel Palestine question has been negligible from a time when it used to be one of the most dominant issues of global debate yeah I think a lot of things changed is it so the assassination of yek Rabin who'd Been instrumental in bring together the oso Accord so this actually very famous Israeli General kind of national hero who made a very radical step to try to reach out towards peace with Palestinians and was then assassinated by uh a extreme extremist Jewish nationalist who was against him um then led to a period where the Israel left largely vanished and a lot of the politics we've been talking about in Israel reflects the fact that the Palestinians supporting two states Solutions supporting Israeli left largely lost confidence partly because of that partly because they felt that Palestinians weren't making the progress that they were hoping for partly because the Palestinian Authority has proved to be very useless and corrupt and has lost a lot of support but it's also that as you say as Israel's become economically more and more powerful and Saudi and UAE and others have developed confidence Trump drove through the Abraham Accords which effectively normalized relations between Israel and some of the key Gulf States meaning that the Palestinians had very much been marginalized and definitely as alist Bert says you know when I was in Jordan there was a palpable sense that people felt it no longer was anything that anyone was concentrating on and the two-state solution felt increasingly implausible it's more and more difficult to imagine that it would ever happen partly because these figures like smartr benav who are the farri um Israelis uh you know made very very explicit statements about essentially providing no acknowledgement for the Palestinian territories at all I mean smotrich was on the record saying that he wanted to retake those territories and the Palestinians would have to either be subjugated or leave or be killed um and this was part of of uh the Coalition I mean you guy was the Finance Minister who who was saying this so I think there are two things that we maybe before we close that we need to look at one of them is what does this mean to internal Israeli politics and what does it mean to the international picture I think internal Israeli politics there's going to be two opposing tensions one of them is it will strengthen some people on the right who will say we always told you you needed to be tougher on the Palestinians look at this Hamas is revealed as they always have been as terrorists dedicated to the complete extinction of the state of Israel we need to go much much harder and that will undermine some of the voices uh pushing for peace and some of the remaining voices on the Israeli left on the other hand it's an incredible humiliation of the Israeli government a total intelligence failure and there will be a push for a national Unity government to say well let's bring in a broader Coalition get rid of the farri right get Israel together again very important to mobilize the reservists who were essentially on strike because they were so horrified by the judicial reforms um and that then moves us the international pit and I think internationally there are going to be two things we have to watch one of them is that Iran is very closely associated with this Hamas attack and is boasting about the fact that Ayah met with the leader of Hamas um that Iranian funding is going in so you can expect a risk of the Israeli government and others taking retary action against Iran you can also see this as a deliberate attempt to break the talks that were going on between Saudi and Israel that Hamas has done it in order to deepen the division again within the Middle East and draw attention in the most horrifying way through this terrorist attack to the ongoing situation and hope that that begins to move people more into talks again there's an awful lot of stuff in harat's newspaper one of the main Israeli dailies today that is very very very critical of of Netanyahu the sense that the Israeli government he's he's had to essentially do a deal with people even well to the right of him to form the government that he did and this has been so far down their list of priorities that you do sort of have the sense that the for the for the more militant end of the Palestinian population that that they can see no no way out and that is not by the way I can even as I say those words I can I can feel people go to their tweets to say this is attempting to justify it doesn't justify it in any way at all but I think that unless what what has happened the reason why Hamas became as powerful as they did within the West Bank was because they felt that the Palestinian Authority Under the fataa party would were going nowhere were giving a lot recognition of Israel Etc without getting anything in return and that that having been done that there they saw no sense of progress at all not I'm not talking about progress towards a two-state solution I'm talking about progress in any shape or form in the reality of their daily lives and that is not going to be addressed between this government uh and the Palestinians it will for now be entirely seen I suspect as a security situation but at some point there has to be a return to a political process otherwise this thing just goes round and round and round and we'll be back in a few years talking about another war and giving another name and and I think at the heart of it is something you was was right at the center of your working life in Ireland which is that understandably Israelis look at Hamas and they say here is a murderous Bruce Hall terrorist group that has just gone into the middle of a music festival and moaned down 2060 people and is and his rhetoric is effectively about extinguishing the state of Israel I mean it's changed it it now talks about a right of return but there is deep deep anti itic rhetoric hate speech coming out of Hamas and all sort of thing um and that therefore feels to many many Israelis as though it's impossible to imagine any kind of conversation with them at all as as I did you know I felt very much with the IRA that you know the idea of talking to people who seemed in the 80s to be absolutely committed to driving the British entirely out of Ireland who were killing innocent civilians in hotel bombings seemed incomprehensible and horrible trth yeah go on there's a question here James M June do you think that the Israel Palestine scenario is more complex than the troubles in Northern Ireland does the fact that it shares a border with other Islamic Nations and isn't geographically isolated mean that a good Friday start agreement will always be unattainable I mean there's a couple of things I'd say to that the first is that the Good Friday agreement felt unattainable for a long long time I mentioned to you earlier recently watching Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland listening to the people telling their stories they felt it was unattainable but it happened so right now today in the middle of October 2023 a two-state solution and I I saw David Lamy this morning at the conference labor Party Conference he made his speech and absolutely unequivocal support for Israel but also saying that we have to keep having hope that there can one day be a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in peace in the current contest that's sounds almost an absurd thing to say but you have to hang on to that hope and you can only get there ultimately through some sort of political process and the reason why I mean the the the level of planning that must have gone into this operation and whether where they were getting their arms from and whether Iran was directly supplying and and all that stuff we don't know um but in a way I think what they're may be trying to do a bit like when excuse me when the IRA sort of had the Judgment they they they said to themselves that we can bomb away all we want in Northern Ireland uh but unless we actually take these bombs to the the British Mainland we're not going to inject ourselves into this process uh now so I'm I guess I'm throwing this one back to you do you think that part of what's going on is that Hamas are trying to get into the bigger picture start to be considered one of the players in finding some sort of resolution to this or are they so Hardline militant Terror organization that there is no way that this is going to end other than with a bloody long battle between them and the Israelis yeah and the truth is of course that like all these groups there all those things there are appear to be or have been in the past citing more moderate factions of Hamas and you know negotiators have dealt with them and talked to them and that's of the reasons why Norway for example I think has refused to condemn hamus as a terrorist organization and then there are Hamas Deputy ministers on record spreading blood lials about Jews and claiming they sort of mashed up you know Christian babies into mats of biscuits and I mean it's um so it's a a horrifying mixture of extreme terrorists with murderous intent and people who are trying to imagine some kind of political settlement and return to 1967 borders and all this kind of thing but the standoff in the end if I sort of go back to the central explainer is that there are two completely irreconcilable at the moment it feels like visions of what's going on for Hammer many Palestinians they want an absolute return to the 1967 borders and the truth is that there has been a lot of Israeli settlement Beyond the Edge of the 1967 borders and no Israeli government is currently remotely considering removing all those communities on the on the contrary they've been develop they've been adding to it exactly right well well I think you explained that very very well um I I actually came off Twitter when for just because it's uh it's impossible it's like it should be possible to condemn unequivocally what has happened whilst at the same time worrying about the nature of the Israeli government worrying about the fate of innocent children and others who have had a hellish life anyway now in one of the most densely populated areas of the world fearing what is about to hit them whilst at the same time only beginning to imagine the utter horror if you had been at that festival or a related to somebody who was at that festival or you're related to somebody who's been taken hostage but the way our debate polarizes so instantly around anything now it was almost like you know well you're either 100% this side 100% that side and at the moment you have to be 100% on on the side of of Israel and ultimately we've got to get to a place where there's a the reestablishment of a a serious grownup political process where major world powers are engaged and involved and put in the hours and the effort to try to get people to to coexist otherwise we've had it well thank you very much and I I know that listeners will have very strong opinions and if you want to get in touch do by all means please send us your tweets or go to the restus [Music] politics.com"

If we consider an example  The partition between India and Pakistan, Kashmir issue, Ram mandir and Babri Masjid dispute all these elements are present in this one conflict  and that's why it is so complicated Hey everybody! This is Priya and you are watching finology legal  Till 1947 this whole area was considered as Palestine In 1947 due to rising conflicts UN decided to divide this area in two parts  this area for the Jews and that for the Palestinians  In today's era also many countries and  international organizations recognize this map only now lets have a look at Palestine one part is West bank and the other part's name is Gaza Strip they both combine to become Palestine Arab countries didn't liked the partition plan of the UN and they said this whole area should be called as Palestine and no division should be done on the other hand Jews had no problem with this partition plan and in 1948 they established their country and named the country as Israel but till now the name Palestine was not in the existence and that's why for establishing the rights of their people in the Middle east  for the next 30 years there was always a war between Arab countries and Israel  because of this, the map of the Middle east continued to change  for example in this war of 1947-48  more than 7 lakhs Palestinians left their home and became refugee's in their near by Arab country  which is known as NAKBA another war is 1967 war  in which Israel acquired their near by territories  and became 3x of their size  this was the war in which Israel got control over West Bank and Israeli's started to live in West Banks  This move of Israel was condemned by the UN and the other countries  and they said Israel should not do like this, by doing like this there is no chance of peace but Israel said that we have acquired that whole area with proper war  if any Arab country had acquired our area in the war, will they give back that area to us ? NO! so that's why Israel didn't listened to any organization and kept acquired West Bank Only wars had took place in the middle east, its not like that.  Peace treaties are also signed here. for example Campdavid accord, Oslo accord the  ""Palestinian territories"" has come from Oslo accord only  and after every peace treaty the maps of Israel and Palestine kept changing Now in present situation who is right and who is wrong ? after understanding the full history of this matter one can give the answer of this question. and upto which extent you have to understand about the history, this will also effect the answer of the question lets see an example and move towards reverse  So Israel did air strike on Gaza but before this Hamas attacked on Israel with rockets  but all before this, during Ramadan (the holy time of the Muslims) Israel police enters Masjid and fire rubber bullets on the people over there  and there Palestinians started pelting stones  they were pelting stones because Israelis were throwing people out of their houses there is a long history between Israel and Palestine before this like Intifada, Arab invasion, Nakba and many like this So for understanding about the present day situation, it is very important to understand the history first So in today's video we will understand the History of Israel and Palestine and we will discuss the problems between them and about the chances of solution firstly, you need to understand this map the geographical location of Israel  the country established in 1948 and the 50% area of Israel is desert area  their one side is Coastal region and the north is Hilly region  and on this side is Jordan river, which separates Israel and Jordan The main challenge of Israel is they have very limited resources and secondly this country has no depth  for example if you see India's map you will see it can be protected very nicely  except northern areas, where border issues are quite more  because there is no depth in those areas similarly Israel also don't have that depth The narrowest point of the country is just 9.3 miles  due to which Israel keeps strengthening their military ability and keeps it always ready   now lets understand the history of this region and in the end we will get to know that how the present day map of Israel is made  When we study India's history we look many empires here  Such as Gupta Empire, Mauryan Empire and like this only we will learn about Ottoman empire in this video which is one of the long lasting dynasties in the world history this empire came in to existence around 12th century expansion was the main goal of the leaders of the Ottoman empire  and in this empire there were Israel, Turkey, Egypt, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Macedonia, Hungary, Jordan  Lebanon, Syria and some parts of the North Africa were also there  Ottoman empire became very larger because other countries were weak and unorganized at that time  and they had very advanced military during late 1800s and early 1900s Ottoman empire has to leave its major territories  and this was due to Social & Political instability inside the empire  Balkan wars and International negativity now lets look at the further story  During 1516 - 1917 AD Palestine was under the control of Ottoman empire and it was a religiously diverse land where Christians, Muslims and Jews lived together In early 1900s  several Jews started talking about Zionism and Jewish home land, they started a movement  actually this movement was started in 1897 by Theodor Herzl in Switzerland  in which it was decided to make separate Jewish home land in Palestine the movement hardly got any support because at that time there were only 8% Jews in Palestine at the same time Palestinians also wanted their own Independent country  on one hand Zions demanded separate home land and on the other hand Palestinians wanted Independent country and now Britain enters in this scene  who got to know the demands of Zionis and Palestinians  and they started thinkin how to use this situation in their interest  In 1914 during World war - 1 Britain and Ottoman empire fought against each other  In 1915 British representative Henry Mcmohan went to Arab leaders with his proposal and said Britain will agree for Arab independence  if they will support Britain, against fighting with Ottomans   after this in 1917, British foreign secretary Arthur Balfour wrote a letter to a leading figure of Jewish community Walter Rothschild it was mentioned in the letter to make a Jewish homeland in Palestine this letter is known as Balfour Declaration so are you understanding, Britain was doing 2 promises at a time  firstly they promise Independence to the Arabs who was living in Palestine at that time and along with this they promised to Jews to make Jewish homeland over there So what was Balfour Declaration? Basically it was a public statement issued by British government in 1917 which says about to make national home for Jews in Palestine  means the declaration supported Zionism but many confusions and many problems in near future rose due to this declaration like firstly, the word national home was used to support Zionism which was never used before this in Internal law  and so the meaning of this word was not clear, means is that word means for separate Jewish country or not ? secondly, for supporting Palestinians British government said that Jewish national home will not cover whole Palestine and the civil and political rights should not be effected of the non -Jewish communities living there  So now you will get, from this Balfour Declaration Israel and Palestinian territories was made from Palestine  and from this declaration only Israel and Palestinian conflicts also begins here one thing is important to notice that, western powers always wanted to control middle east regions Why? Two main reasons for that very important reason was for Oil reserves, Oil was became very valuable commodity at that time  and every one wanted the Oil reserves of Middle east in their control Second main reason was middle east's strategic positions and their locations  like Russia wanted the access of Constantinople which is present day Istanbul and Mediterranean sea  France had many investments in Syria so it wanted access over Syria  and Britain wanted to continue its control over India  that's why they wanted access over Persian Gulf and Suez Canal  after the collapse of Ottoman Empire in 1918 after the end of World War   its territories was divided between Allied powers (Britain, Russia and France) and many agreements was made for the proper division  the ongoing conflicts in the modern time weather its Lebanese Civil war   the matter going over there in Syria - Syrian conflict  Iraq's Instability and Israel - Palestine conflict  all these conflicts are deeply related with the agreements made at that time as we saw what problems were created due to Balfour Declaration similarly we will look at two more agreements due to which the Palestine problem increased much   First is Sykes - Picot Agreement and second is Mandate for Palestine  Sykes - Picot agreement which is also known as Asia Minor Agreement   This is named after British and French diplomat Mark Sykes and Francois Picot  during World war - 1 UK and France signed a secret treaty  with the confirmation of Russia and Italy  in which it was decided that, after the collapse of Ottoman empire which part of middle east will belong  to whom  to avoid any confusions later on.  according to this agreement, the pink part was given to the Britain, the purple part to the France and Russia was given the Orange part  now the territories which France and Britain acquired combinedly  they formed a single Arab state for that  and divided that in to A and B part  A part was in French protection and B part was in Britain protection and Palestine was kept under International administration because it is a holy place  Russia was stepped out before the end of World war -1  that's why they didn't got that promised territories  but when Arabs came to know about that Sykes - Picot secret treaty then they realized the betrayal happened with them  because Britain said through Hussein Mcmahon correspondence that if Arabs revolt against Ottomans  then Britain will provide them Independent state  but  Arab land was divided by Sykes - Picot agreement  and from this only modern day territories of Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Palestine was made  So now you got it what Britain did here  they promised the same land to France through Sykes - Picot agreement Arabs through Hussein Mcmahon correspondence  and through Balfour declaration they promised Jews for separate land  they did contradictory promises to all of them for which Britain is criticized even today  So the world war ended but the problems in Palestine was about to start  due to world war the area was effected by destruction  due to Famine people died of hunger, many diseases was spreading around  and because of uncertainty of the territory political tension was also rising  around 1920 they were considering to implement Balfour Declaration and 16000 Jewish immigrants were called  In 1921 18000 more immigrants came here  Now the Jews who were coming here they was also buying property here and watching all these, Arabs protested this act  Britain gave a clarification on this point and said they will limit Jewish immigration In July 1922,  League of Nations mandate instrument for Palestine Jewish national home was approved  this also supported the Balfour Declaration and says about the historical connection of Jews from Palestine this mandate came to force in 1923  At this point both Palestinian Arabs and Jews knew that  at the date on which this mandate will be over  On that day this areas future would be decided by mainly 2 things  First is Population and second on the basis of Ownership of land. and Jews had a upper hand on both the things  because every year thousands of Jews were reaching Palestine through immigration Now during 1926 -1930 Britain understood the fact that  if Jewish immigration increases more then the rights of Arabs will be compromise and that's why they demanded to stop Jewish immigration for some time  Zionist found this step against them and due to International pressure this limitation was removed now lets discuss about 1930s when Jews were started assaulted and widely persecuted in Germany  due to which Jewish immigration in Palestine rose highly  In 1933 - 30000, 1934 - 42000, 1935 - 61000 Jewish immigrants reached Palestine  In 1936 Jewish population in Palestine was over 4 lakhs  mens 1/3rd population of Palestine consists of Jews now at this time there was a rise in violence  and there were faculties on both the sides British commission said as Britain only allowed the mass migration  and now in Palestine there were 2 different societies which can't be combined  and that's why there should be a partition in Palestine  after that Britishers introduced white paper of 1939 which said to make Palestine in to 2 states  where Jews and Palestinians will live in their area  along with this they said to limit to Jewish immigration for the next 5 years  but this was the time period when lakhs of Jews were getting beaten in Germany  So illegal immigration in Palestine was in continuation  and Britain was unable to limit this  due to which each and every day there was a rise in violence  So till now Palestine was under the control of Britain  but when Britain was unable to handle this self created mess by them  then what they did ? they handed Palestine to newly created UN in 1948 Under resolution 181 United Nation passed Palestine Partition Plan of 1947 In this resolution Palestine was divided in Independent Arab and Jewish state  and Palestine was divided in to total 8 parts 3 areas was given to Arab  3 areas to Jewish 1 area to Jaffa, which was a Arab enclave under Jewish territory  and the 8th part belonged to Jerusalem, it was considered as a neutral territory  and was put under United Nation trusteeship council So when they began voting in UN regarding partition in Palestine  then 33 countries voted in favor of partition and 13 countries were against the partition in which India is also amongst that 13 countries  and 10 countries refused to vote  Arab countries opposed this partition and they walk out from General Assembly  because their saying was Arab population in Palestine is almost twice  so they should be preferred by the end of the day UN partition plan was adopted  after hearing this weird partition plan by UN just after a day Civil War broke out in Palestine between Arabs, Jews and British forces  which is called as 1st phase Arab Israel war  till this period British was partly controlling Palestine  and they intervene in between to stop the violence  now the time line which is to coming is very important    The condition was worsening in Palestine and watching all this Britishers decided to leave Palestine on 14th May 1948 Jews had not much problems from this partition  So on 14th May 1948 the last day of the Britishers there, Jews declared an Independent country  and the country was named as Israel  US and Russia recognized Israel as a country  So this was about how Jews reacted on the partition plan  Now lets discuss about the Arabs So Arabs felt as cheated about this partition  because Arabs wanted the whole Palestine  because according to them Palestine was Arabs homeland  and the creation of Israel, was like sparkling salt on there wound  So after a day only on 15th May 1948 the nearby 7 Arab nations formed a union  and sent their army to the Palestine and declared a war against newly formed Israel So now you guess who had won this war which lasted for 10 months  7 Arab nations who wanted the whole Palestine or newly formulated Israel ? So the very shocking fact is Israel saved that land which they got from the partition but the land which was given to the Arabs in the partition Israel captured 60% of that Arab land also and concluded that part in Israel  the partition map of UN looked like this  from which it was Israel's part  after the war of the 1948 Israel covered the whole area  in which the territories of Jaffa, Tel aviv and West Bank was also there  and Egypt got control over Gaza Strip there were major damages due to this conflict  those Arabs Palestinians who wanted the whole Palestine now had to leave that part which they got from the Partition due to which 7 lakh Palestinians had to leave that place  Palestinians were now the refugees in their homeland  and they remember this incident as Nakba  which means Disaster or Catastrophic after watching the widespread displacement, in the response of Nakba UN General assembly adopted resolution 194 under the resolution it was said that, those Palestinian refugees who want to come back they should be allowed and those who doesn't want to comeback, they should get compensation in the return of their property  But do you know, till date the refugees of 1948 war has not got any compensation after the end of Arab - Israeli war many Armistice agreements was signed  What is the Armistice Agreements ? These are the formal agreements which is signed by the parties who was involved in the war  signing the form means they are ending the war  So like this only Israel signed Armistice agreements in 1949 with Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria for ending the war  so what we saw in this 1st Arab - Israeli war is  before the war, according to the UN partition plan 43% of the land was allocated to Palestinian Arabs  where as Jews were allocated 56% land and after the war Israel got control over 78% land  Egyptian military's  presence was seen in Gaza - Strip  and Jordan got control over the West Bank now we will discuss about 2nd Arab - Israeli war  the war happened in 1956 due to SUEZ CANAL which was made by Egypt in France  Suez canal is an important international trade point  and the war happened in the matter of its ownership on one side it was Israel, Britain and France and on the other side it was mainly Egypt and Soviet Union was in the support of Egypt In this conflict Russia threatened to fire Nuclear Missile on Western Europe  on the other hand United States urged to end this conflict  and warned all of them to be fined with economic sanctions  Let us understand the impact of this war  by the end Egypt won the war and their leader Abdul Naseer emerged as a powerful leader  but this Suez crisis has established an important powershift   The world power which was earlier enjoyed by the Britain and France  was now shifted to USA & Soviet Union and they emerged as new world powers  where America established its position as Israel's friend and Soviet was got influenced on rest of the Middle east countries  Lets discuss about 1967s 6 day war  The next war held between Israel & Arab nations was in 1967 which proved as a big victory for Israel  and the whole map of middle east was changed now lets know how? The war started on 13th May 1967 when Soviet Union gave intelligence report to Egypt  that Israel is preparing for Syria invasion and collecting army over there  So to protect Syria from the invasion  Egyptian president Abdul Nasser also sends their army on Sinai Peninsula  by this point of time Egypt has full faith on their military superiority  but Israel was also ready On 5th June 200 military jets of Israel attacked on Egyptian air fields  due to which Egypt's air force was totally destroyed  Israel also did the same with the air fields of Jordan, Syria and Iraq On 7th June Israel successfully took East Jerusalem & West Bank from Jordan  and on the 4th day of war they acquired the territory upto Suez canal  in which Egypt's Gaza - Strip & Sinai Peninsula was also conquered  in this 6 day war Israel acquired many areas and now Israel was triple in size from this war Israel. established its military superiority in the middle east  So Israel got control over West Bank from this war  now Israel had 3 options  1st option was to make West Banks as Israel's part  but if they do so  then they have to give Israeli citizenship and voting rights to 1 million Arabs living over there  2nd option was to give West Bank back to Jordan and the 3rd option was to allow them selves to make a Palestinian state  Now what to do with West Bank was a big question  so before the Israeli government could decide what to do with the West Bank  till then many Israeli civilians started living in West Bank and make permanent settlements there So while deciding about the West Bank now they also have to think about the Israeli's living there  Now the question is settling down here was illegal?  Well, United Nations released a statement and said that the settlements have no legal validity  and by doing this, peace can never be restored in Middle east  where as other countries also stated this as a wrong move  and said settling down there is a type of colonization which means Israel is expanding its country  apart from this number of settlers in West Banks was increasing day by day  and now Israeli government also started supporting this settlers movement  In 1967s war along with West Bank & Gaza - Strip  Israel also occupied Egypt's Sinai Peninsula  which was a big victory for Israel  because from this part only Egypt use to attack every time on them  on the other hand this was a big loss for the Egypt  and after losing in 1967s, 6 day war Egypt's president Abdul Naseer resigned from his post In 1970s Egypt was suffering from many economical losses  and now there new president was Anwar al Sadat   In 1973 on the holy day of Jews Yom Kippur which is also called a Day of Atonement  on that holy day Sadat attacked on Israel to show their superiority  but Israel survived the attack and won  after this attack, a long term need of peace was felt between both   and in 1978 US president Jimmy Carter  invited Sadat and Israeli PM Begin to resolve some long term solution  this was 12 day long secretive process  and during this it was decided that Israel will give Sinai Peninsula back to Egypt  and in exchange Egypt will allow Israel to use Suez canal  along with this Egypt would be the 1st Arab country to recognize Israel as a country  In 1978 Sadat and Begin signed a permanent peace agreement between Egypt and Israel this peace agreement is known as Camp David Accord  it was someone first time talked about peace with Israel in the middle east  it was such a Historic moment that In 1978 Sadat and Begin got Nobel Prize for peace that year  from now onwards the conflicts of Israel became Israel - Palestine conflict from Arab - Israeli war  all the western countries praised Sadat  where as Arab countries got angry over him and in 1979 they removed Egypt out of the Arab league  after this in 1981 Sadat was assassinated  but the hope of peace was alive from the Camp David Accord  after this happens first Intifada  What is Intifada ? This is an Arabic word which means to shake off  and Palestinians used this word in sense of Uprising  1st Intifada happened from 1987 - 1993  in which violence level was very low but in Israel - Palestine conflict this is an important event How did it happened ? there were terror attacks at the Israeli border from many years  so those Arabs who were living in Gaza and West Banks  they became violent with time  and their claim was to get back the territories from Israel which they acquired in 1967 and from here only it was the born of Hamas who killed an Israeli military officer  and after few months they killed 6 more soldiers of Israeli defense force  and they motivated Palestinians to stand against Israeli soldiers  In December 1987 an Israeli truck driver accidently met the truck with a car in which Palestinian workers were present   and the rumors spread that the car crash was intentional  and from here the wide spread demonstration begins  and Israelis were attacked around 700 times  at this point Israeli army was only trained to fight against soldiers not against the civilians  but Palestinians didn't had any army  only the civilians were protesting and doing riots over there   So for ending the riots Israeli forces used tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets, curfews and mass arrests  This first Intifada was publicized heavily in the media  and for the first time Israel's image emerged as oppressor of Palestinians  and from here Palestinian Liberation Organization becomes a political organization from terrorist organization PLO leader Yasser Arafat got popular after this and Israeli PM Yitzhak Rabin talked about peace negotiation  and in September 1993 Oslo Accord was signed  American president Bill Clinton, Israel's PM Yitzhak Rabin and PLO leader Yasser Arafat signed Oslo Accord  Oslo Accord was a set of agreements by which Palestinian government was established and West Bank was divided in 3 sections  Area A which was 18% of West Bank and maximum Palestinian population was here in this area Palestinians had full control over Govt. and security of this area  this was a very big and historic move  because for the first time Palestinian govt got the chance for self rule  2nd was Area B, which was 22% of West Bank here the Govt. control of Palestine was of Palestine but Israeli military will be there because security control will be with Israel  3rd Area is Area C, this was the area where Israeli settlements were there this was the 60% area of the West Bank which was totally in control of Israel  majority agricultural land, water and mineral resources of West Bank are present in this area only  both the sides accepted the area A, B and C  and from Oslo Accord a more conclusive map was out  just wait for a moment here and think  by making this type of map between two sections can anyone imagine about long term peace ? No! If Israeli settlers had not increased in this area  then very easily two state solution could be implemented in the West Bank  Palestinians could have get their state in a specific area  So Oslo Accord was signed in 1993 which rose hope of peace between Israel and Palestine and due to this both Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rubin received Nobel peace prize in 1994  from this Accord Israel & PLO recognized each other  from this Accord a temporary govt. has to be formed in Palestine which in future will be permanent govt. of Gaza and West Bank and both the sides were given 5 years to sort 2 state solution Palestinians and Israelis both strongly opposed this Accord  and Israeli PM Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by and Israeli ultra nationalist  Benjamin Netanyahu becomes the next PM of Israel  who was always against this deal  and in the same year 2nd Intifada happened after the violence in 1st Intifada, general Israeli civilians avoided any kind of Palestinian involvement  where as in Palestine terrorist organizations like Hamas and Islamic jihadi was also forming  2nd Intifada lasted from 2000 - 2005 and it was very much violent in comparision of 1st Intifada On 20th Sep 2000, Israel's opposition leader Ariel Sharon visited Temple Mount the holiest site of Jews where 2 Islamic land marks Dome of the rock and Al Aqsa mosque is also there  this is a very sensitive site for the peoples of both the religions  Ariel Sharon's govt. wanted that place to be in control of Israel  In 1985 Sabra & Shatila Massacre happened  in which 3000 Palestinians citizens were were murdered though this attack was done by the militant organization but it is also said that Israeli defense forces also helped them in this after the investigation of the massacre  Ariel Sharon who was the defense minister at that time  he took personal responsibility that he was unable to stop the blood shelt and because of this all the Palestinian figures like Yasser Arafat told Ariel Sharon not to visit that site  but then also he went there  This visit of Ariel Sharon inflamed Palestinians  and to protect their holy site they protest over there and started pelting stones  in the response of this act Israeli police fires rubber bullets and tear gas on them  in this 2nd Intifada 3000 Palestinians and 1000 Israelis were killed  In the 2nd Intifada Israeli citizens witnessed suicide bombings this time  in which militant organizations go to the crowded cities of Israel, bus stops and malls and do suicide bombings at that places  73 suicide bombings happened in 3 years due to which more than 300 Israeli citizens were killed  In the response of these attacks Israel starts a military operation named Operation Defensive Shield in which to restrict terrorism their plan was  to take the territories back in control which they had given to Palestine under Oslo Accord in 1995 because under Palestinian control these areas were becoming the base of terror camps  Due to Operation Defensive Shield suicide bombings was reduced by 70%  after this conflict Israel started constructing a security barrier around West Bank so that terrorist can't be able to enter Israeli areas  Israel's security got very strong by this security wall  and no more suicide bombings happened after that So the peace process which was started by the Oslo Accord  was ended after the violence of 2nd Intifada  and now Israel don't believe in giving land any more for maintaining peace So this was today's video in which we understood the history of Israel and Palestine  and learned about the conflicts between them  and we got to knew about Arab - Israeli wars in the Middle east and Israeli - Palestinian conflicts  this topic is quite lengthy because its history is also long and many elements are involved in it  but if you keep little patience then you can easily understand about this conflict  If you have liked today's video, so please like this video and share it with your friends also  because there was days of hard work by the team behind making this video  So please share the video  and for more interactive contents like this you can follow me on my Instagram page @finologylegal I hope you have learned something new today  That's it for now see you in the next class Bye Bye!"
54,VA2tiAHmbm0,Why the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is so hard to resolve | Mapped Out,"Amid the latest escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict following the terrorist attacks on Israel by Hamas and Israel's subsequent bombardment of the Gaza Strip, one possible answer that keeps resurfacing is what's known as the two-state solution. The decades-long conflict has displaced hundreds of thousands of people and negotiators have failed time and again to break the deadlock. We take a look at the two-state solution and other ideas that have been proposed by experts and the international community and explore: what makes the conflict so complex?

#Israel #Palestinian #IsraelPalestineConflict",2023-11-04,186158,2150,927,UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg," If you want to drive from Tel Aviv almost to the end of the West Bank it’s supposed to take you less than an hour and a half. But this pops up on the map: "" This route may cross country borders."" That makes sense: according to international law, this is a Palestinian territory.  But Israel maintains the West Bank is “disputed” territory and often calls it Judea
and Samaria, in reference to the region’s Jewish history. This tiny piece of land is home to possibly the most complex conflict in the world:  The Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And it escalated further in early October 2023 when militants from the Palestinian terrorist
group Hamas  crossed into Israeli territory, killed people, took hostages. Israel reacted with massive
airstrikes on Hamas, which also killed civilians and displaced hundreds of thousands more. And it's not only
a regional conflict. The whole world seems somehow involved. Your own government may
be part of trying to negotiate a peace agreement. Part of your taxes may
go to humanitarian aid in the region - or weapons. And – everyone seems to have an opinion on it. The conflict has a long history – of wars, of violence, oppression… and failed peace negotiations. That has left many people hopeless.  And yes, with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict it’s hard to know where to start. We won’t have time to look into every detail – such as all the international players involved. That’s why we want to focus on the solutions that have been proposed over the years. And find out what the sticking points are. This is Israel, shown here in solid blue,  the only majority-Jewish country in the world. It was established to offer
Jewish people a safe haven in
their historical homeland, which many saw as essential after Germany’s systematic murder of more than six million Jews in the Holocaust. Israel has a population of around 10 million. About a fifth of its citizens are Arabs of Palestinian origin. Then there are the Palestinian territories: More than 3 million Palestinians live in the West Bank. It has been under Israeli military
occupation since 1967 and is partly governed by Fatah,
a Palestinian political party. Then there’s the Gaza strip, which is controlled by the terrorist group Hamas. The entire population of Gaza has
been living under blockade for more than 15 years, which rights groups say is illegal but Israel says is necessary for its safety. And there’s Jerusalem. But we’ll get to that in a bit because there’s really a lot to unpack. Basically the conflict is about land and who has the right to it. But how can this decades-long conflict be solved? The most talked about idea is a two-state solution: An Israeli state, and a Palestinian state – that would recognize each other and co-exist in peace. To dig deeper, we’ll take a short trip to the history of the two-state idea. In 1947 Britain wanted to end its control of the region.  The UN proposed a Partition Plan which would have divided historic Palestine between Arabs and Jews. The Jews accepted it, the Arabs didn’t. Israel then declared its independence in 1948. And was attacked by a coalition of Arab nations. Israel won and gained territory. During the war and the foundation of Israel, an estimated 750,000 Palestinians fled or were driven out of the new state. Palestinians remember this as the Nakba or ""catastrophe."" Israel and neighboring Arab nations who said they were supporting the Palestinians fought many more wars since then, changing the map multiple times. The first face-to-face peace agreements between Israel and
the Palestinians came in the 1990s  in what’s known as the Oslo Accords. This handshake kicked off
years of intense negotiations over a possible two-state solution. Here’s Nimrod Rosler—he's the head of the International Program in Conflict Resolution and Mediation at the Tel Aviv University. That was the point of time where there was a peak for hope, for peace among both sides. And they got really close to
a solution at Camp David in 2000, but ultimately didn’t make it. So, hang on a second. There was never a final peace treaty. Why? Let’s take a look at some of the sticking points. Here’s the first one: Jerusalem. It’s a city sacred to the major monotheistic religions: to Jews, Christians and Muslims. Jews gather to pray here at
the Western Wall, the only remains of their ancient temple,
the holiest site in Judaism. For Muslims the very same site is considered the third holiest place in Islam because the Prophet Mohammed is said to have transcended to heaven from the spot where the Al Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock is situated now - known to Jews as the Temple Mount. And because this place is so holy to both Jews and Muslims, it’s a trigger for both sides
and the scene of tensions and provocation. All that’s because the status of Jerusalem is so disputed. Israel occupied the Palestinian part of Jerusalem, East Jerusalem, during the 1967 war, ultimately annexing East Jerusalem in 1980. Israel sees the whole of Jerusalem as its eternal, undivided capital. What does that mean in the present? Imagine you’re a Palestinian who was born in East Jerusalem. You might feel Palestinian but cannot have Palestinian documents. And you generally also don’t have Israeli citizenship which makes daily life difficult – for example, your residency status can be revoked which can eventually lead to the loss of
health care and even the right to enter Jerusalem. We mentioned that Jews gather at the Western Wall.
But it’s not only that. Jerusalem is the holiest city
for Jews, and the most significant sites for Jews are located in East Jerusalem which is why Israel wants to hold on to the whole city. But to the Palestinians, East Jerusalem is the capital of a future Palestinian state. That’s been essential to proposals for a two-state solution. And most of the international community supports the idea. So it looks like a deadlock here. This is peace advocate and
Palestinian East Jerusalem resident Adeb Joudeh. He argues that, because Jerusalem is so special, it cannot be divided. Jerusalem leads us to the next contentious area: The West Bank, the largest Palestinian territory. The number of Jewish settlers here
and in East Jerusalem has continued to rise since Israel
captured the territories in 1967. The settlers are living
here illegally according to international law. Why did that happen? Many settlers argue with religion. For Jews, the West Bank
is home to many sacred places. Others are here for benefits like cheaper housing. And there’s the political level. The West Bank has a strategic meaning for Israel. Israel sees it as a buffer zone to defend itself against any attack from the east. That’s one reason why the Israeli government actively supports these settlements and
sends soldiers to secure them. Many Israelis are against the settlements but the recent Netanyahu government has stepped up its settlement policies. Over the last two decades,
the number of Israeli settlers living in the West Bank has increased to over 700,000  - if you also count settlers in East Jerusalem. Remember: 3 million Palestinians live here. In theory Israel has said it wants a two-state solution. But the illegal settlements in the West
Bank make it less likely to happen. Take this Israeli settlement in the West Bank  - administered by Israeli authorities.  On the other side of the street: a Palestinian neighborhood in Ramallah al-Bireh, administered by Palestinian authorities. This example really shows just
how intertwined the situation is. A two-state solution would mean Israel at least partly withdrawing from the West Bank
and giving up that territory for
a Palestinian state. And we haven’t even talked about Gaza. The humanitarian situation in Gaza was already dire – even before the October escalation. According to the UN, the Israeli blockade of Gaza and its 2.3 million inhabitants, has led to extreme poverty  and
very high unemployment rates. Nearly 80% of Gaza
residents rely on humanitarian aid. And by the way: Egypt also participates in the blockade — controlling movements in
and out of Gaza from its border with the Strip. Usually in proposals for a two-state solution, Gaza was going to be part of
an independent Palestinian state. But in 2006, the militant
Islamist Hamas was elected in Palestinian territories. One year later, it took complete control of the Gaza strip. It is deemed a terrorist organization by the EU and the US. And is responsible for multiple terrorist attacks. .
Hamas doesn’t accept Israel’s right to exist. For Pnina Baruch, a security researcher and former colonel in the Israeli army, peace negotiations are only possible once Hamas is disarmed. You have to beat Hamas, you have take away its military capabilities and
then hopefully they will be too weak to continue to control the Gaza strip. I believe that we could do business with Fatah, again. Just a reminder: Fatah is the main Palestinian political party in
the West Bank. Fatah and Hamas are rivals. Fatah recognizes Israel’s right to exist. Hamas doesn't. Civilians in Gaza are suffering under the rule of Hamas, too. And yet — Israel’s siege, the bombing, and killing has led many to believe that for Israel it’s not just a war on Hamas but on the Palestinians. Although Israel insists it tries to minimize civilian casualties. This is Amjad Shehab, he is a political scientist based in East Jerusalem. What he’s talking about here reflects what many Palestinians are thinking – the conflict can only come to a resolution when the rights of Palestinians are respected. Some people say Palestinian
rights would be more respected in a one-state solution. There are different kinds of one-state solutions that
are being discussed. One idea is a unitary state,
meaning one democratic state where both Israelis and Palestinians have equal rights. Another idea could be a federal state in which Jewish and Palestinian regions would have wide-ranging powers. Or: A confederation would involve two territories with open borders, with a joint Israeli- Palestinian government  responsible
only for a few issues, such
as foreign trade and external security. Mahmoud Abbas, the president of
the Palestinian Authority, put it on the table on a political level, when he talked about it in 2021 — to put pressure on the
Israeli government. But let’s remember what we talked about earlier: In all of the official peace negotiations the only proposed solutions were two-state solutions. Ideas for a one-state solution have always been just ideas. My analysis even before what happened... She is talking about the Hamas October 2023 terrorist attack. ...was that none of them work because of this immense hostility that exists and this friction  that will lead eventually to violence and I think now it's just strengthened my opinion that one state with open borders is not something that will work. And yet: support for a two-state solution has fallen on both sides. So, will Israel and the Palestinians ever agree on a way out of the cycle
of violence and trauma? For now it seems the only thing people can agree on is that peace is still out of reach. In order to continue to live here, we have to find a solution to the conflict. It has to be on both sides, but I
believe it will be very difficult and therefore there has to be also an international support."
55,0aM7RjXE1xo,Understanding the historical context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,"According to historians and experts, it is impossible to pinpoint one specific reason why peace talks between Israel and Palestine continue to fail. But tensions in the region go back thousands of years.  ""The region is the birth of the main Abrahamic religions like Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. But I would say the conflict we're experiencing now is very much a conflict over International law and human rights,"" Belisa Marochi, Assistant Teaching Professor of Political Science and International Studies at the University of Tampa, told ABC Action News reporter Michael Paluska.  ""The conflict has changed its characteristics. It's the birthplace of Christianity.

Thousands of rockets were fired at Israel from Gaza on Saturday, and Palestinian militants infiltrated Israel, killing at least one person, according to the Israeli military and medics.
Rockets rained down on Israel from Gaza starting at 6:30 am, following months of rising violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the highest number of fatalities in West Bank, which has been occupied by Israel since the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict, in years.

The Palestinian group Hamas claimed responsibility for the rocket assault on Israel, saying its militants had launched more than 5,000 rockets.

but it calls itself a political party it is in fact one of the two largest political parties in Palestine now Palestine is divided into two parts the West Bank and the Gaza Strip the West Bank is controlled by a coalition called the pl the Palestinian Liber ation organization led by a party called fat so the PLO rules the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is controlled by Hamas this group is ideologically and politically motivated it rules a population of more than 2 million Palestinians and it calls itself the face of the Palestinian movement Hamas gets its name from an Arab acronym harat Al Muka Al islamia which translates to the Islamic resistance movement now this group was founded by a man called shik Ahmed Yasin a Palestinian scholar and cleric in 1967 there was a Six-Day War Israel won and they took over Palestinian territory two decades later Yasin established Hamas and Palestinians Rose against Israel's occupation the year was 1987 the movement was called the first inada or the first Uprising there was there was a series of violent protests attacks targeting Jews in Israel one year later Hamas published their Charter it called for the destruction of Israel and for the establishment of an Islamic society in historic Palestine and then Hamas continued the attacks they reportedly resorted to Suicide bombings rocket attacks and Small Arms attacks their targets were civilians the International Community designated Hamas as a terrorist group over the years it tried to morph itself into a political party but it kept a milit milary Wing a political party with a military Wing that's what they call themselves and this Wing was to carry out attacks against Israel Hamas created a top down government Approach at the top was the polit bureau a 15 member body which operates in Exile then comes the shura council its members are unknown but this Council elects the polit bureau it also oversees some welfare programs in the West Bank at Gaza and then there is the K Kamas government it implements policies and agendas set by the shura council but it's more like a puppet government so does the Hamas have a representative face well it does and it's this man ismile han he's the designated chairman of Kamas and guess where he operates from qatar's Capital Doha Hamas leaders have made qat their workplace because they had a falling out with their previous hosts that's Syria which brings us to another question who supports and funds Hamas on the geopolitical level where do they get their money and weapons from Qatar is clearly an outright supporter apart from hosting the leaders of Hamas Qatar sends millions of dollars to the terror group in 2021 the Kari government announced Aid worth $360 million for Hamas that's $360 million that Hamas has never given accountability for where did that money go next in line is turkey their president erdogan is a stalwart supporter of this Terror organization Hamas even has offices in Istanbul in the month of July erdogan hosted the chief of Hamas is Hana in Ankara erdogan openly supports the Palestinian cause and turkey has repeatedly sent funds to Hamas and even now after today's attacks erdoan does not condemn them for what they've done listen to this is as turkey in the light of the events that have occurred in Israel this morning we call on all decides to act with restraint to stay away from impulsive moves that will heighten the tension further so erdogan is calling on all sides to act with restraint no mention of how Hamas escalated hostilities and how they put thousands of Civilian lives in danger despite eran's open Embrace of Kamas he's not their top supporter that title goes to Iran thean provides Hamas with funds weapons and Military train in it is common for Hamas leaders to meet Iranian leaders and clerics according to a report by the US state department Iran provides almost $100 million every year to Hamas what about the weapons there's no Clarity on how many they give or what kind but here's what the Hamas Chief says Iran is their biggest donor of weapons the Hamas leadership often visits Iran to plot against their common enemy Israel and they insist that this is not a proxy war that they're not fighting on behalf of Iran but they haven't found many takers over the years American sanctions have forced Iran to cut funding to Hamas but their relationship remains intact so for Iran Hamas is an ally for Israel it's a terror group but how do the people of Palestine see Hamas a poll was held in the month of June by the Palestinian Center for policy research and they revealed some shocking numbers only 31% of the people in Palestine say that Hamas should represent them a whopping 73% Palestinians believe that they should not Hamas should not represent them 73% they say there's widespread corruption in Gaza in institutions run by Hamas the pole also asked Palestinians another question who would they vote for if elections were to be held today 56% pick the current Hamas Chief ismile Han and that's a clear majority 56% so what does that mean it means that the people of Gaza do not trust the governing ability of Hamas but hania continues to be a popular figure ever since Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 Hamas has taken up the role of the de facto Authority here over the years they've purged political opposition the Gaza Strip has remained under their strict control Hamas has maintained its popularity with social service and the call to raise militias against Israel but this time they may have gone too far they've launched an allout military operation against Israel will this spell the end of Hamas we'll be tracking this story for you
59,53KolEoTyz0,Israel Palestine Conflict 2023 Explained in 3 Minutes | Israel Hamas War,"Israel Palestine Conflict: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict stems from deep-rooted claims to the historical land of Palestine, and the dispute's focal point lies in Jerusalem, a city of great religious significance. After World War II, Jewish migration to Palestine increased. In 1947, the UN proposed a partition plan, sparking conflict when Arab parties rejected it. Gaza, a small, densely populated region, is part of the State of Palestine. Hamas, a major Palestinian group, was founded in the late 1980s, opposed peace accords, and gained power through elections. Mohammed Deif leads Hamas's military wing and is a mysterious figure.

62,kUMYT6tozEg,Who owns Jerusalem? | DW Documentary,"Has US President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel exacerbated the deep-rooted dispute between Israelis and Palestinians?

This report talks to people on both sides of the conflict. For them Jerusalem is more than a political disagreement. The city is their home, a place of longing for Jews, Muslims and Christians alike. Our documentary joins travel guide Schmuel Kahn, who emigrated from Switzerland to Israel, on a tour through Jerusalem's Old City, where the holiest sites of Judaism, Christianity and Islam exist side by side. Anthropologist Ali Qleibo, who is descended from an old Palestinian family, wonders how he would react if his daughter wanted to marry a Jewish man. Sarah from Hamburg, who has taken Israeli citizenship, makes a fervent appeal for a Jewish state. And musician Muhammad Mughrabi is convinced that only dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians can bring an 'end of hatred'. This is a report about borders and competing claims to ownership, but also about hope and reconciliation.

people often ignore this aspect they only see the conflict hatred intentions but ever since Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel the fragile status quo of the city has been in the balance what long-term consequences will his controversial decision have will it further deepen the divide between Palestinians and Israelis or could it ultimately bring them closer either there will be like a crazy big war or miracle deal of the century that Trump wants to do well make everyone happy [Music] Hakan is relatively unfazed by the uproar surrounding the u.s. president's decision to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem for Israel it's been clear for a long time that Jerusalem is its real capital from these and status Swiss blanch work came to Israel 10 years ago and became an Israeli citizen five years later he wanted to become more intensely involved with his Jewish religion he studied Hebrew and became a tour guide Shmuel lives close to the government district in the western part of the city after he got married his wife efferent moved here from another part of Israel to be with him this small apartment is full of their wedding photos the two are making plans for their anniversary but no one in Israel can completely escape into private life politics is everywhere here the cons can see the Israeli Parliament building from their kitchen window you can see the Knesset behind me and there's the Supreme Court over there Trump's decision of the decision by the European countries on whether Jerusalem is the capital or not won't make much of a difference all the heads of state have been here to visit the Knesset whether they recognise Jerusalem as the capital or not was a mnemonic in all honesty the majority of Israelis probably see things that way too you can see that from the posters hanging everywhere but that's not the real issue the Palestinians also claim Jerusalem as their main city they feel as humiliated as the Israelis feel vindicated [Music] Jerusalem is divided between Israelis and the West and Palestinians in the east most of the international community views the predominantly Arab eastern part as being under Israeli occupation it includes the old city which is divided into Muslim Christian and Jewish quarters [Music] here on the Temple Mount the Western Wall and the al-aqsa mosque holy sites of Judaism and Islam are crowded side-by-side themselves it's usually pretty harmonious in Jerusalem and that's how it should stay but of course there are tensions here the Temple Mount is a huge religious magnet charged with historical and archaeological meaning and then there's the political aspect things get a bit shaky it can lead to unrest not in the shaft also I think all Palestinians have staged numerous protests following the u.s. decision to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital they see it as a move to cheat them out of their rightful heritage anthropologist Anacleto is from an old Palestinian family with roots in Jerusalem that he traces back to the 14th century he would rather not talk about Donald Trump but about his beloved city which he considers to be the historical home of the Palestinians [Music] Jerusalem without that you can be anywhere in the world it's the centerpiece in Jerusalem it's the holy place for excellence for the Muslims it's the place we have to realize where God connected with Muhammad or Muhammad connected with God on the ground it's one city where all the people were together the same hospitals it's the same cafes as the same restaurants it's the same streets we live together jointly but on a rural level it's a different affair the land has been annexed in Jerusalem the people have been overlooked this is a classical case of historical denial and historical revisionism Kleiber fears that US foreign policy will now make life for Palestinians even more difficult the European Union is concerned about that - perched high above the city on Mount Zion is the Dormition Abbey the Benedictine monastery is located on a piece of land that belongs neither to Israel nor to the Palestinians it was a gift from the German Kaiser in the late 19th century father Nicodemus Schnabel attaches great importance to its neutral status both the EU and Germany take a clear stance on this as does the Holy See a two-state solution is the fairest one for the city that means that the west where Parliament and the Supreme Court are already located is undisputably the capital of Israel and the east and that is the great aspiration is the capital of Palestine the horse's angels and hope to Palestine us [Music] this is all juicy it will be coming close to it so we get the better view the wall is the most visible symbol of division the Israelis have been building it as a protective barrier against suicide bombers since early 2000 the demography of Jerusalem has been tampered with such as to make the Jewish majority and an Arab minority the salient narrative has deployed that this is the homeland for the Jews this is the narrative that Trump played with and he really should not have interfered he legalized he sanctified he gave credibility to this alien narrative in which they overlooked and deny Palestinian rights to be here in father nicodemus view Palestinians and Israelis have equal claims to sovereignty over the Holy Land both nights have understandably deep yearnings Israelis longed for security they say if it had been up to Hitler we would no longer exist and we're surrounded by states that hate us refuse to recognize us and want to annihilate us on the other hand there's the Palestinians no less plausible longing for freedom they say we didn't send anyone to the gas chambers why should we live behind walls and checkpoints why can't we have our own state it's about a people's right to self-determination which is fundamental so the question is how do we reconcile these two often competing yearnings scenes like this one filmed by a security camera at West Jerusalem central bus station are also fueling Israeli demands for more security a Palestinian stabs an Israeli man and runs off such incidents have hit ceremony at ski very hard a native of Hamburg she became an Israeli citizen last November as a Jew she no longer felt comfortable in Germany she had been thinking of emigrating to Israel for a long time and finally decided to do it but if he had long been by faith numbers he naive to think when I first came here I was maybe a bit naive and thought for sure peace would eventually come and that there were lots of great Palestinians who were really open now after this I find it very hard to believe in peace it may be only a few thousand but nine out of ten of them I've spoken to say the Jews should be driven into the sea [Music] as a journalist Sara follows developments in and around Israel closely does she believe that the new American policy regarding Jerusalem will change anything in the long term of 18 Queens I always wonder what a peace dialogue everyone is talking about there are so many people here who don't want to share Jerusalem they don't even want to share Israel they don't view Israel as Israel but say it should be all Palestine so for me personally what Trump did is okay who knows maybe he even kicked off something that was long overdue and he's not crying them a document an animal see I don't care whether you go to a mosque a church or a synagogue but I'm definitely in favor of a Jewish state I strongly believe that Israel is a haven for Jews everywhere because they really need it you see it in the attacks and the demonstrations and the awful things being shouted on the streets of European cities that proves there simply has to be a place for Jews to come to where they can feel safe I'm Tim's economy I don't see this as being at the expense of the Palestinians because I know a lot of Israelis who say we'll share the city we all live well together what I find annoying is that Europeans from far away always think they know the answer they're not here they don't really talk to either Palestinians or Israelis but they always know better how to achieve peace what the Israelis are doing wrong and what they're doing right that's mentally stigma that this may be too much international attention to every twist and turn in the israeli-palestinian conflict to a gouge from where Khan also thinks that foreign media reporting goes a bit overboard very interesting situation we have here today is always examined through a magnifying glass that means every newspaper reports on what's happening in Jerusalem and on television of course Jerusalem is a very big topic but normal people here live their normal lives they go to school they go shopping and religion ethnic origins and political statements don't play that much of a role statesman Santorini Guardiola [Music] but a lot of people in the Palestinian part of the city would disagree the bus terminal in East Jerusalem serves the city's Arab neighborhoods you won't see Jewish Israelis here at all one of the passengers is Mohammed McGraw be a musician does he believe in the peaceful coexistence that SHM well described I like Jerusalem and I hate it at the same time there's it's like on paper it's very diverse and multi culture all kinds of religions and you have people tourists from all over the world all the time but the reality is very separate there's like a fine line between East Jerusalem and West Jerusalem where people from the East erson don't go to West Jerusalem and people from Western don't go Muhammad lives in the Shuafat refugee camp in eastern Jerusalem which is behind the security wall traces of a demonstration against Israeli soldiers the day before can still be seen Israel controls the entrance and exit to the camp while the rest of it is mainly and a United Nations administration Jerusalem is a very violent place for children and it's terrible you know you have kids children singing about killing people about committing suicide for for your homeland I don't see the point I understood that I want to live for my home yeah to build it not to die for it it's a long process it doesn't change does not happen and quickly you don't have to ask anyone here about the USA most Palestinians have lost faith in America as a mediator in the Middle East conflict especially in the wake of Trump's decision but Mohamed McRobbie is certain of one thing he is sick and tired of all the violence too much violence and in ten days three kids from the refugee camp got killed by the soldiers and I had a very very strong depression Mohammed also feels responsible for the death of one of his fans who went out to demonstrate after listening to his angry songs and was killed in a clash with Israeli border guards since then the rapper has adopted a more conciliatory tone he's loved and refugees is the title of one of Muhammad's music videos it even has Hebrew subtitles in an attempt to build bridges to Israelis but he wonders whether the other side has even noticed [Music] right now you have a total separation it's just getting worse ever since they built the wall between Israelis and Palestinians there's no connection you have a whole new generation of young people that have no idea what Jerusalem looks like they lived all of their life in Bethlehem or Jericho or Ramallah they have no no chance to to visit Jerusalem when you're desperate and you have nothing to lose you'll go crazy but if you're like comfortable and going to the beach and having a nice time why bother changed Mohammed is putting the ball in the Israelis Court but is he right on the assumption that Israelis don't want to change anything we asked shmoocon if he has Palestinian friends angles Tyler most of the people I worked with in tourism there are hotel staff and drivers are Muslims living in the eastern part of Jerusalem or in the northern and southern parts of Israel I have very good relations with that talk we talk to each other and have very friendly relationships as far as work goes then it doesn't really matter whether I'm Jewish or Christian or Muslim all toshite opposites you dah-dah-dah-dah muslima been [Music] that's me so we're gonna fall in conflict what makes me so sad about this conflict is that it doesn't have to be this way I have a friend who's Palestinian she's a reporter who lives in her mother but we can't really see a lot of each other it just doesn't work across the border but we are in touch through what's happened by phone we disagree about a lot of things but we still appreciate each other as people and say okay we're both human beings and we don't wish death on each other maybe exchanging views can also help us grow the male come on Amanda and then go down I was toast vaccine but what does tolerance actually mean it doesn't mean that everything the other does and says fits my opinion tolerance means we're different and see things differently but I still accept that and I'm willing to let them live their lives if I can live my life to me not to us if none of my name is William Khan Jerusalem's Palestinians complained that they are mistrusted as a group since the unrest following Trump's decision suspicion has been on the rise again here Israeli border police are searching a young Palestinian apparently he had just been sitting and enjoying the medicine it's very traumatic experience to grow young in Jerusalem you are suspect you are a persona non grata just because you're Arab at any moment subject to being harassed search press for centuries alley clubbers family has owned valuable property at the entrance to the old cities Muslim Quarter [Applause] [Music] he knows almost all the merchants here they are generally also opposed to the Americans recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital but they also live from tourism so they're cautious about openly criticizing foreign countries but Clio is concerned about something else more and more houses in the Arab part of the city are falling into Israeli hands instead of unilaterally supporting Israel he says the US should use its influence to stop these takeovers the real problem in Jerusalem is that sooner or later it will be taken over by their side is they're slowly moving over and their presence there those who choose to live here and not the polite nice people we see in the restaurants and the cafes in resolution it's their fundamentalist collaborators who come here to make problems and the present fear is itself political statements this leads to more confrontations it makes it more difficult for people to continue their normal life [Music] we are I feel one of the last generations that see an Arab city still inhabited by arms it's become more and more impossible for us to survive here so my daughter well who should love to live here but I'm sure it'd be very difficult for her to live me Moya Khan who is accompanying a tour group a few hundred meters away in the Christian quarter of the old city sees things rather differently hi tambien I'll Turkey beam there's a lot of things in our day-to-day lives are actually going well here we are on a street where we see pilgrims going to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and I'm standing here as a Jew next to Muslim merchants over there we must have let the things we constantly hear in the media fool us on the other hand of course there are always political tensions and we've repeatedly felt them over the last 3,000 years Vida dispute [Music] the souvenirs here aren't just being sold to the three religion but also to the different ideologies we have the Israeli army here America don't worry Israel is behind you on the one hand a very clear statement the other hand we also see maps of Palestine showing it occupying the whole of today's Israel and I love Palestine freedom for Palestine so different ideologies all in one place and they aren't just bought by tourists but by locals conversely that means as far as business and tourism is concerned you can sell everything and everything is permissible this is where we see togetherness and mutual opposition in one place over at the schewe fat camp in East Jerusalem musician Mohammad McRobbie is stepping up his efforts to promote togetherness for a long time his songs reflected his deeply felt anger at the Israeli occupation but now he's come to the conclusion that rage alone won't get him anywhere there's zero chance that Israelis will leave and Palestine will be for Palestinians or Palestinians would leave and Israel will be for Israelis they have to share I don't know how but they have to share it they have to figure out how to share it either there will be like a crazy big war or miracle deal of the century that Trump wants to do will make everyone happy you have to deal with the problem to solve it you can't go and like turn your back and stay comfortable and wait for the problem to be solved and talk about the problem to someone who agrees with you no you have to talk to the other part that disagrees with you and find out how to to make it better now he increasingly performs in Israel and collaborates with Israeli musicians who invite him to their concerts there's no point of me telling the Palestinian story to Palestinian people that living the story no I think the right thing is to tell you the Palestinian story to someone who don't know have no idea who lives in his comfort zone on Tel Aviv or West Jerusalem where in Haifa and it's shocking to see the reactions of the people they it touches them [Music] perhaps the way forward lies less in international politics and more in small steps towards reconciliation on the ground and perhaps also through the younger generation in Israel's regular education system Arab and Israeli students are taught in separate classes but in this school Jews and Muslims have lessons together and teaching is in both Arabic and Hebrew there are six schools like this in Israel Noah Yama works at one of them the Mercs reign hand in hand school in Jerusalem what we try to do here is to say that we are different from each other and that's okay we don't ignore those differences we put them on the table and talk about that and that really helps the kids connect because they don't think they have to push away who they are they can be exactly who they are and still be with the people who are different than them Donald Trump's decision has also been discussed with the pupils here Palestinian history teacher Haneen Hussain explains how they did it there are two teachers in the same class I'm the Palestinian one and he is the Israeli one so we bring through them together each narratives equally and sometimes we switch roles between us just to take to let this be a model for our our kids we also learn to understand that we don't have to agree but we do have to listen and when we listen and we disagree then we understand that we have a shared future no matter what hundreds of children are on the waiting lists for the schools and more are already being planned launched 20 years ago by Israeli and Palestinian parents this model seems to work [Music] although Israelis and Palestinians are unlikely to agree on Jerusalem status anytime soon not everything in and around the city is about the conflict nobody knows what impact Trump's move will have in the long run but at the beginning of last Hanukkah the Jewish festival of lights the mood on the Israeli side was optimistic Hanukkah Hanukkah is also about miracles happening from the Israeli point of view I really believe that the Palestinians can be part of this country beautiful thing I don't believe we have any problems with coexistence of course there are certainly radicals on our side who disagree but we are living together and Palestinians and Israelis or Jews are even intermarry and it can work baskets on Allen [Music] Jesus the mufasa me and it's a fascinating spider's web you can't just say the city is Jewish or a Muslim or Christian that's too narrow-minded what this city mainly needs is a sense of wonder where you say wow what a total work of art but it'll take care and tact help turn this city with all its wounds and scars into a true city of peace - come in son - dr. Sweden's [Music]"

66,QUCeQt8zg5o,Palestine 1920: The Other Side of the Palestinian Story | Al Jazeera World Documentary,"“A land without a people, and a people without a land” is how the relationship between Palestine and the Jewish people was described by Christian writers in the 1800s. And the 20th-century history of the Middle East has largely been written through these eyes.

But this film from Al Jazeera Arabic looks at Palestine from a different angle. It hears from historians and witness accounts, and features archive documents that show Palestine as a thriving province of Greater Syria and the Ottoman Empire at the dawn of the 20th century.

The evidence suggests that its cities had a developing trade and commercial sector, growing infrastructure, and embryonic culture that would enable it to meet the challenges of the decades ahead.

However, the political ramifications of the Balfour Declaration, San Remo Conference and British Mandate set in motion a series of events that profoundly affected this vibrant, fledgeling society and led to the events of 1948 and beyond.

This film is the other side of the Palestinian story.

decades of violence, the Israeli government and
the Palestinian Liberation Organization
secretly met in 1992 to put an end to the conflict. The meetings gave birth to
the Oslo Accords, designed to establish a partnership
for negotiating borders, governance,
and a path to peace. But these treaties didn't
last, and many consider them to be an ultimate failure. To understand how that
happened, we have to go back to the heart of the conflict. In 1947, a UN decision
proposed a partition of the British-controlled
Palestinian territories into a Jewish state,
an Arab state, and an international
city of Jerusalem. The Jewish state of
Israel agreed to the terms and was created that year, but
the Arab League did not want Palestine to be partitioned. They attacked Israel,
but were defeated. Israeli forces occupied
the area that had been mandated to be the Arab state. Many Palestinian
became refugees. The region has remained
in conflict ever since. Creating peace between
Israel and Palestine sometimes seemed impossible. Israel viewed the Palestinian
leadership, known as the PLO, as a terrorist organization,
and refused to work with them. Without an agreement existing
between Israel and the PLO, there was no end
in sight to their decades-long violent conflict. In 1978, President
Jimmy Carter finally succeeded in brokering
peace agreement between Israel and Egypt
through the Camp David Accords. While establishing some
peace in the Middle East, the agreement did not address
the right of Palestinians to self-govern. This remained the status
quo for more than 10 years. In 1992, Norway offered to
serve as an intermediary between Israel and the PLO. That December, both
parties met in Oslo, beginning the negotiation
talks that would continue over many months. In September 1993, Israel,
the PLO, the US, and Russia officially signed the
first of the Oslo Accords, later known as Oslo 1, at a
ceremony in Washington, DC. The terms of Oslo 1 mandated
that Israel officially accept the PLO as
the representatives of the Palestinians, the PLO
officially renounce terrorism and recognize
Israel as a country, both sides agree that,
over a five-year period, a Palestinian Authority,
or PA, would be created to govern the Palestinian
territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Once the PA was
successfully established, then more talks on the
issues of borders, refugees, and Jerusalem would be held. Two years later, in
1995, Israel and the PLO signed another
agreement, called Oslo 2. Israeli forces
agreed to withdraw from the six largest Palestinian
cities, as well as 450 towns. The West Bank was to be
divided into three areas, one under Palestinian control,
one where Palestinians had civilian control and
Israelis controlled security, and one area that would be
totally controlled by Israel. Throughout the entire process
of negotiating and implementing the agreements in
the Oslo Accords, many people, both
Palestinians and Israelis, refused to support the terms,
and both sides committed acts of extreme violence. In November of 1995, an
anti-Palestinian Israeli extremist assassinated Israeli
prime minister Yitzhak Rabin at a peace rally in
retaliation for his support of the peace process. By September 2000, with the
escalation of violent events, including riots,
suicide bombings, and sweeping Israeli
military responses, it was clear that the
Oslo Accords had failed. The Israeli-Palestinian
conflict continues today. Palestinian autonomy
has not been achieved, and support for a two-state
solution has declined. World leaders
continue to struggle to figure out a way to broker
a new agreement between Israel and the Palestinians and
their Arab neighbors."
68,VZ4ruk3KO48,Israel-Gaza conflict: What is Hamas? - BBC News,"Hamas is a Palestinian Islamist militant group which rules the Gaza Strip. 

Hamas is sworn to Israel's destruction and has fought several wars with Israel since it took power in Gaza in 2007. 

In between those wars, it has fired or allowed other groups to fire thousands of rockets at Israel, and carried out other deadly attacks. 

Israel has also repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes, and, together with Egypt, has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 in what it says is for its security.

Hamas as a whole, or in some cases its military wing, is designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Hamas is backed by Iran which funds it and provides weapons and training.

This happens all over the occupied West Bank, but perhaps nowhere are these scenes more concentrated than in the Old City of Hebron. The once vibrant Palestinian cultural center is now ground zero of Israeli apartheid. It’s also where AJ+‘s Dena Takruri’s family calls home.

In this deeply personal documentary, Dena spends a day in Hebron retracing the footsteps of her father, who was born and raised in Hebron. She talks to Palestinians who are subjected to daily harassment from the Israeli military and settlers. And she is guided through the city by former Israeli soldiers, who tell her why their conscience is now forcing them to speak out against the occupation.

setting foot in my family’s hometown. We literally just got here. We went through the first military checkpoint. And a bunch of soldiers stopped
us, starting yelling at us. I’m in the Old City of Hebron
in the occupied West Bank, a place that once bustled with life. But I’m about to see what Israel’s occupation and settlers have done to the heart of this city - - and to the people who live here. I’m a Palestinian American journalist, and I’ve spent much of my career
reporting on the occupied territories. But Hebron, one of the West Bank’s largest cities, is also my roots. My father was born and raised here. I’ve returned to learn how the occupation
has decimated his beloved hometown, a place he hasn’t been back to in years. I know it's really hard for him to see
this. And so it's emotional for me. So we’re officially on our way to Hebron. My team and I are going to Hebron’s Old City,
which is ground zero of Israeli apartheid. Today, 33,000 Palestinians
live in this part of Hebron, which is under full Israeli military control and fragmented by checkpoints, military
outposts and around 1,000 Israeli settlers who live here in violation of international law. But before we get into all of that, let me back up. It wasn’t always like this. This is my dad. He was born in Hebron in 1947. He lived up the hill from the Old City, where
his father and uncle owned a quarry. The year after my dad was born,  Israel was established in what Palestinians refer to as the Nakba, or ""catastrophe."" That’s because hundreds of thousands  of Palestinians were expelled from their homes to clear the way for the creation of a Jewish state. But the West Bank, including Hebron, fell under the control of Jordan. My dad was 19 in June of 1967, when Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, and began a military occupation that still has no end in sight. My dad was in college in Jordan at that time, so he wasn’t in Hebron to witness that, or to see how Jewish settlers took over parts of the Old City. A few years later, he moved
to the U.S. for graduate school. I was born and raised in San Francisco and grew up hearing my dad reminisce about his childhood, like how he raised chickens and rabbits on
the hill as he watched the vibrant city below. When my family would travel to Palestine in the summers, my dad couldn’t come because of work. Now, even though he’s retired, he
says he doesn’t want to return because he refuses to be
humiliated by Israeli soldiers. He’s only been back to Hebron three times. But I’m returning, to see with my own eyes what has become of the city that made my father and me who we are today. And that all begins with me actually getting there. It's only about 20 miles from
Ramallah, where we're starting out. But we can't, as Palestinians, access parts of the main north-south highway because that's reserved exclusively for cars with Israeli license plates. So here’s another checkpoint. Instead, we have to take narrower roads and cross through several
Israeli military checkpoints. Here’s another checkpoint. That means it takes much,
much longer to get there. We're finally in Hebron. I'm sure my dad knows these
streets inside and out. He used to walk all over here as a child. So, this is literally retracing his footsteps, but it’s very different now than when he grew up. Today, many parts of the city
are off-limits to Palestinians. Alright, gonna go through. Because I'm Palestinian, I’m not
allowed to enter parts of the Old City. So I'm meeting former Israeli soldiers who I
hope will help me access my family’s hometown. Hi, how are you? Ori? Yes. Nice to meet you. I’m Dena. Ori and Joel are with the
Israeli anti-occupation group Breaking the Silence. They used to serve in the Israeli army. But now they give tours of Hebron to expose
the reality of how Israel treats Palestinians. But before they could even start
showing me around, this happened. My Palestinian film crew - who
have the proper credentials - are sadly used to experiencing this kind
of nationalistic harassment and taunting. So I’ve been in the Old City for about five
minutes, and we were already stopped by - We literally just got here. And a bunch of soldiers stopped
us, started yelling at us, started harassing my cameraman. They just asked to see our IDs.
I showed my U.S. passport. To all of a sudden to have like six or seven
armed Israeli soldiers just swarm you, it’s honestly really upsetting that this is how
you get welcomed to your own home city. The former soldiers I’m spending the
day with say this is a typical scene. Finally, the soldiers give us back our IDs. But what a way to start the day. I’m about to learn that what I
just experienced is nothing compared to what the Palestinians
who live here go through every day. This is Fadel, who has lived
in this home his whole life. In the 1980s, Israel set up this
checkpoint in front of his house. Fadel now has to check in every time
he leaves or enters his own home. Wow. Fadel isn’t alone. Thousands of other Palestinians in Hebron are also forced to pass military
checkpoints just to go home. The military also bans Palestinians
from using certain streets, as Ori shows me. All these restrictions help Israel
maintain its hold on Hebron. But they’re also in place to protect Israeli settlers, and the ones in Hebron are known for being among the most
violent in all of the occupied West Bank. The soldiers never protect the Palestinians. This is kind of a common sight here in the Old City. There's a Palestinian family that
lives at the end of this alleyway, above them is an Israeli settlement. And because the settlers
throw garbage down at them, they have to put these nets
here to protect them. The family at the end of
the alley is the Sidrs. Just a few weeks before I arrived to Hebron, nearby settlers accused their
13-year-old daughter, Salwa, of picking a knife up off the ground. So we’re standing here, and I’m
talking to her in front of her home, and every time we hear a noise she looks up. And I asked her, “Are you afraid the settlers
are throwing something down at you?” And she said, “Yeah.” Just talking to her, it’s really
... you don’t feel safe at all. It’s not a life that people should or can accept. So how did Hebron end up feeling
like a prison for its people? After the Israeli occupation began in 1967, Hebron was among the first places Jewish settlements were built. This illegal land-grab captured international attention: Now there's pressure for large-scale Jewish resettlement. And to some people, this looks very much like colonization. Some settlers said that they were coming to Hebron because of its sacred place in Judaism as the burial site of Prophet Abraham and his family. Others said they moved there in response to a massacre of Jews that happened in 1929. That’s when rising tensions over European Jewish immigration aimed at turning Palestine into a Jewish state led to violence. More than 60 Jews were killed, and homes and synagogues were destroyed in the ancient city. But even after the settlers moved in, Hebron’s streets weren’t segregated. Then in 1994, everything changed. An American Israeli settler armed with an assault rifle entered the Ibrahimi Mosque during Ramadan and killed 29 Palestinians. Palestinian fury as the victims of the mosque massacre are rushed to hospital in Hebron. Doctors say most were shot in the back as they knelt to pray. The shooter was ultimately overpowered by survivors and killed. But today, many Israelis in nearby settlements continue to honor him. In response to this massacre and the unrest that followed, Israel punished the victims, closing off roads and choking the economic lifeblood of this Palestinian city. You know, we're just seeing
so many empty houses, empty storefronts. Israeli flags everywhere. Soldiers stationed everywhere, checking us. Since the crackdown, over 1,500
Palestinian-owned shops have closed for good, and more than 1,000 Palestinian families
have moved away from Hebron’s city center. They have decimated the Old City, Israel has. And it's really unfortunate to see. I mean, this should be a thriving,
bustling marketplace right now, and  it's completely empty. She's harassing – she's harassing a Palestinian right now. Just ’cause he’s sweeping. He’s sweeping. Excuse me, don’t- don’t, please don’t touch our camera. That's wild. The settler woman got mad at the
Palestinian for sweeping the street. And then she attacked us and our cameras and tried to block us from filming. Many of Hebron’s settlers moved
here from the United States. Sadio came from Brooklyn a few years ago. Does it bother you that you're living
somewhere so heavily militarized, where Palestinians that have
been here for generations are getting kicked out of their houses
and can't walk on certain streets? So I'll ignore the use of the term Palestinian
since there is no such nation or people. It doesn't bother me at all. Uh, militarization is a thing
happening all across the world. If I'm not up to anything, and nobody's
invading my space for no reason, I don't care. So why do you give these tours? So we're going to attempt to
enter Shuhada Street right now. No Palestinians are allowed to be on that street, only Israelis and foreigners. I'm going to enter on my U.S. passport. Of course, I'm originally Palestinian,
so we'll see how that goes. While all of Hebron’s Old City has
been affected by the occupation, the most striking example
might be Shuhada Street. It used to be the city’s most important, vibrant thoroughfare. My dad went to middle school on this road, and his family owned shops here. But in the years following the 1994 massacre, Palestinians have been banned
from walking on this street, even if they live on it. The Israeli military welded
these Palestinian doors shut. This video shows what it takes for one Palestinian woman to leave her home: She climbs her roof and scales back down to the ground to exit on a backstreet where she is allowed to be. But if you're a Jewish settler, you can walk
out in the front, in front of your front door. This is the old central bus station in Hebron, and they turned it into a new military
base that’s under construction there, and behind it is a new settlement. This is how absolutely devastated it is right now. Settlers came and just ravaged the whole place and destroyed it. This is the old fruit and vegetable market. It was here and now what does the sign say, Ori? The Old City has suffered. Everywhere you look there’s just deserted shops, deserted homes, destruction, broken windows. And
in the middle of it all, there's like schools and settlements and
Israeli settlers just living their lives with the full protection of the military. You know, one thing that's really striking
being here is how incredibly silent it is. The only sound you hear is the flutter
of these little Israeli flags above. I keep thinking about how, you
know, I directly descend from here. Not only is it, like, sad on just a human
level, but there's a very personal element to this street as well. I don't blame my dad for not wanting to
come back, because it's that messed up. So I'm trying to piece together
exactly where my dad grew up. You know, I've pieced together that
that's where my family's home is. And the view is of a bunch of Israeli flags
and a military outpost on the hill over there. And in between them, the cemetery
where my grandparents are buried and the home that my father grew up in. So. Man. I wonder if he's awake right
now. I should FaceTime him. [ringing] Hi, Baba. How are you? I wanna show you, I think
this is where you grew up. Is this? Yeah, this is Shuhada. There's nobody here except for
some soldiers and a few settlers. It's a total ghost town. It's so sad. This is the old vegetable market. Does this look familiar to you? I don't know. I feel really sad. Like, he grew up right there. You know, his parents are buried right there, and I know it's really hard for
him to see this. And so it's emotional for me. My dad wanted to talk to Ori. I’m curious, how did you feel watching me talk
to my dad and then speaking to him yourself? What most haunts you and your conscience
about what you did in your time as a soldier? It's designed to break down the
population of Palestinians and show them who's in charge and humiliate them on a daily basis. All of it. All of it. We saw all of it. It was a heavy day, but before it ended, I
wanted to visit my father’s childhood home. As I stood on the roof overlooking the Old City, I thought about how the landscape
today is completely different from the one he looked out at
when he stood in this same spot. And I couldn’t stop thinking about everyone I met and the price that they’re paying for remaining. It’s hard to shake the idea that this
Palestinian father could have been my dad. I could have been Salwa. This
could have been my life. Hey everyone, thanks for watching this video  from al-Khalil here in Hebron. Let me know in the comments what surprised you most about this experience, about this place. And stay tuned for the rest of our videos in our series filmed here in the occupied West Bank. Next up, I have a video looking at the Palestinian Christian minority here."

Iranian officials helped Hamas plan the attack, giving a green-light to the assault at a meeting in Beirut on Monday, according to senior members of Hamas and Hezbollah.

#Israel #Palestine #WSJ",2023-10-09,5581643,30231,6996,UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ," (airstrike explodes) - [Narrator] The Gaza
National Bank was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike on Sunday as fighting continues in Israel and Gaza. (airstrike explodes) More than 700 Israelis
have been confirmed dead, and 560 Palestinians have been killed after Hamas, a militant group from Gaza, launched an
unprecedented attack on Israel over the weekend. Hamas worked with Iranian
security officials to plan the attack according to senior members
of Hamas and Hezbollah, another Iran-backed militant group. Western leaders have
denounced Saturday's assault and offered support to Israel. - I've just spoken with
Prime Minister Netanyahu to assure him of the
UK's steadfast support as Israel defends itself
against these appalling attacks. - [Narrator] Iranian security
officials helped Hamas plan a surprise attack on Israel, senior members of Hamas
and Hezbollah said. The green light for the attack,
which included air, land, and sea incursions was given at a meeting in Beirut last week. A spokesman for Iran's mission
to the UN said Iran stood in support of Gaza's actions,
but didn't direct them. - Hamas is considered
a proxy group of Iran. The exact nature of how
much Hamas is being led by Iran has always been
unclear, but of course, they receive a lot of
their funding from Iran, a lot of their training from Iran, and a lot of their weapons from Iran. That is according to Israeli
officials here in Israel. - [Narrator] The planning for
the operation began in August. According to senior members
of Hamas and Hezbollah, the direct Iranian involvement
could raise the risk of a broader conflict in the Middle East. US officials say they
haven't seen evidence of Tehran's involvement. - There's a long relationship
between Iran and Hamas. In fact, Hamas wouldn't
be around in the way that it is without the
support that it's received from Iran over the years. In this specific instance,
we have not yet seen evidence that Iran directed or was
behind this particular attack, but there's certainly a long relationship. - [Narrator] On Sunday, more
than 250 people were found dead at a music festival in Israel according to Israeli
state broadcaster Kan. Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, appointed a general to coordinate search efforts for captured and missing Israelis. The mother of a missing woman described a phone call from her
daughter during the attack. - At 10 o'clock, she called us and said, ""Mommy, we will go."" They shot at us. The car was shot. We cannot drive. Everybody here is hurt. There were four kids in the room of kids. They were 23, 25, 30. Everybody was shocked, they were bleeding. - [Narrator] Since the conflict began, world leaders have been speaking out, largely condemning the attacks on Israel. The United States said it would send additional military assistance to Israel, including equipment and weaponry. The US also plans to move a
carrier strike group closer to to Israel Shores and Air Force Jet Fighter
squadrons towards its skies, (airplane engine roaring) a move that signals its
support and aims to deter Iran from taking advantage of the
uncertainty in the region. A Hamas spokesperson said the decision to deploy an aircraft carrier near Israel by the US is participation in the aggression against our people. - The US is sending one of
its largest aircraft carriers to the region, and it's very clear. But that's a message to,
it's not a message to Hamas. It's not a message to
Gaza, that's very clear. It's most likely, of course,
they do not say this publicly. This is a message to Hezbollah in Lebanon. The biggest fear in Israel
really is that Hezbollah, which is a militant group,
far stronger than Hamas, has the means to really wreak havoc in Israel that they could
enter this war any day. Hezbollah is trying to deter
Israel from invading Gaza from creating a ground invasion into Gaza. And on the other hand, Israel and now the
United States are trying to deter Hezbollah from joining this war. - [Narrator] The Israeli
military said that as many as 1,000 Hamas militants entered Israel from Gaza over the weekend,
many of whom were armed. - The Israeli military
is preparing the ground in Gaza for an invasion,
for a ground invasion. They've cleared the communities
around the Gaza border, not only because it's
not safe for them there, but in order to have freedom of operational movement in that area. They have not declared
that they will do it, but they're making very clear preparations that they will do it. And if you listen here to the politicians here in Israel, many of them are talking about removing Hamas
entirely from the equation. There's only one way to do that, and that's a ground assault. That will take a very long time to do. It will be a very difficult
and bloody battle."

But why is this happening, what is Hamas, and who backs it?

The BBC’s Middle East analyst, Sebastian Usher answers your questions.

#Israel #Gaza #BBCNews",2023-10-09,647214,4935,2016,UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA," this conflict is extremely complicated and it's difficult to explain to people exactly what is happening let's uh cross live now to someone who I think can help with all the questions that people have been searching for online and indeed sending us here at the BBC our Middle East editor Sebastian Usher is in The Newsroom very very very very ready as always to help with uh questions Sebastian and I suppose that the first question that we need to ask you is why is this happening at this moment in time well I mean there are quite regularly eruptions in the conflict specifically between Hamas which controls Gaza and Israel the last one we saw was back in 2021 the last really big uh uh uh confrontation was in 2014 but there have been a number of wars that have taken place uh since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 and and Israel uh imposed a blockade which has held ever since so those tensions are always there in the past we have usually seen uh the conflict although it's had terrible consequences in the numbers of people killed particularly in Gaza from the air strikes that uh Israel launches in response to Rockets being fired by Hamas uh but that it it it's been within a certain kind of lines that both sides seem to accept that they don't cross in order to take it into you know Uncharted Territory what we've seen this time is that those lines have been crossed those lines were crossed essentially when Hamas uh Fighters infiltrated into Israel and caused I mean the worst uh uh incident uh for Israel pretty much since its Inception with hundreds I mean at the moment we're saying at least 700 Israelis having been killed so that is the real huge game changer here that is why this is such a serious situation but those pressures those tensions as I say they don't just exist in Gaza as far as the Palestinians are concerned but in the occupied West Bank where we've also seen a major rise in tensions in almost daily clashes between uh is uh uh the Israeli military which mounts regular raids into uh the main towns in the occupied West Bank and they're met often with Palestinian fighters who who who fire back who throw rocks uh EXP exp of devices uh we've seen several hundred Palestinians many of them Fighters but some of them civilians killed over the past year and a half and that so this hasn't come out of nowhere but the surprise is the way that Hamas executed its attack on Israel Sebastian many people uh have been searching this particular question and and it is is Palestine is Gaza an actual country it it it's not officially formally a country as such I mean Gaza is part of a Palestinian territor as as I was just saying there's there's Gaza there's the there's the occupied West Bank and there's East Jerusalem and it and its surroundings which is seen as part of the Palestinian territories um the the the the Palestinian Authority the PLO which uh is essentially the original uh real driving force of Palestinian stat ship declared that it was a state many decades ago and some countries have accepted Palestine as state but uh there are a number of others who haven't the us being perhaps the main one um so what it has at the moment is that the UN it has uh uh Observer status non-member Observer status which is essentially close to being uh accepted as a state but not a state and we still talk about uh the peace process that has been going on for years but it's been stalled for a long time now the main objective through much of that was to create a Palestinian State the so-called two-state um solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict another question many people have been asking Sebastian is does Hamas represent uh Palestine no it doesn't represent Palestine I mean it is one of the two main factions as I say it has controlled Gaza since 2007 holy uh uh um controlled Gaza since then it won the last elections in the Palestinian territories in 2006 it then fought a battle with fata which is the party uh that essentially runs uh uh the occupied West Bank and it drove them out so it's been in control since then it's an islamist organization it's ideology originally comes from a Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt so I mean Palestines themselves uh many of them are not Muslims they are Christians there are face there as well so it certainly doesn't represent the entirety of the Palestinians by any means it does represent for a number of Palestinians not just the islamist uh ideology which some support but also the sense of resistance to Israel seen as the most actively uh uh um the most active in that resistance as we're seeing once again here the pales authority the PLO fata have moved towards in in the past three decades to essentially accepting Israel's right to exist and no longer confronting it militarily h has never changed uh from its military stance towards Israel that it sees Israel as its enemy and it will fight Israel as we've seen regularly uh this being the most extreme example of the of the uh uh that we've seen so far Sebastian another question that is one of the most searched on the Internet is who are the Palestinians can you explain that with to us given obviously there a very long history So within the time frame obviously yes no there is a long history I mean the word Palestine dates back I mean at least 2,000 years it was used in Roman times it was adopted uh in the early days of Islam uh it was Arab sized there was um a Palestine existing uh as I mean again we can't say as a state but as a region for a very long time and people identifying as Palestinians for a very long time the Mandate that existed under the British uh that came before Israel was established at its dependence in 1948 1949 was known as Palestine so I mean Palestine is very much an accepted uh way of referring to that region but there are many problems with that it you know in terms of uh how large a part of that region is seen as Palestine who it should belong to uh these counternarratives that there are I mean many uh Israelis would go back further they would go back to the biblical denomination of many of those areas talking of Judea and Samaria and other words like that so I mean though historically it is a fact and there's no question about uh the sense of there being a Palestine and there being a Palestinian people the actual way in which that's interpreted is still open to question and depending on what perspective people are looking at from s Main's you know a very live debate but certainly for the Palestinians who identifies as pales opinions and that's not just in the palestin territories but beyond the the the huge diaspora both in the w g camps that spread across parts of the Middle East but well beyond that they obviously naturally 100% see themselves a Palestinians even if there is no formal Palestinian State as such at the moment and Sebastian finally one of the biggest uh or the most asked questions online is who backs Hamas well I mean financially one of its main supporters has been uh Qatar but Qatar would make a distinction between supporting the people of Gaza uh who obviously have faced immense problems economically uh it's one of the poorest areas in the world um they would say that the money that they give through Hamas because Hamas controls Gaza is for the people that it doesn't support necessarily the political uh uh um agenda of Hamas it doesn't support what Hamas is doing now necessarily it does believe in um the Palestinian bid for its own State uh for its own identity it supports that 100% it does believe that the Palestinians face huge problems much of them they believe uh resulting from Israel and its occupation but it would not say that it directly supports Hamas as an entity you have other countries such as Iran which do openly support Hamas and what it's trying to achieve and and we've seen since this assault uh happened that Iran has very openly come out and shown its backing and said that it uh uh believes that Israel is essentially reaping the wind uh that it swn so and and also in in military terms in the past maybe not so much now but a lot of the hardware a lot of the missiles that uh G that that Hamas was somehow able to get despite the blockade around uh uh Gaza were Ian made in more recent years they've been able to manufacture many of those themselves within Gaza Syria again the the so-call AIS of resistance and then other non-state players particularly hasbullah for example in Lebanon which did make a gesture um by firing some mortars towards Israel uh in in in uh on on the second day of this assault but hasn't so far committed itself beyond that Lebanon as a country supports again the right of the Palestinians to resist to defend themselves but the government such as it is in Lebanon wouldn't go all out in support of Hamas so there are backers um but it's not hugely widespread I would say the most important would be Iran and cata financially at least Sebastian thank you very much indeed Sebastian Asha there giving a full explanation to all of those questions that you have been uh searching for online"

Music: Spookster - Wayne Jones (From YouTube library)",2018-03-14,9343442,99377,0,UC2Cl2g2xFTZoAEldxYVzQFg," A century ago, a conflict arose which
would quickly become one of the most complex and controversial in the world. A conflict between two very different people for the same territory. To understand its origins, let's retrace the history of the Jewish people on a map. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be explained in a following video. The story begins in 750 BC when the Near East was divided into many small kingdoms and city-states. They were wedged between the Assyrian Empire to the north and Egypt in the south. Among them was the Kingdom of Israel whose people worshipped several gods, including Yahweh. In 722 BC, the capital Samaria fell to the Assyrian empire. Part of the population then fled to the Kingdom of Judah and Jerusalem. But they would be followed by the Assyrian army as they continued their
expansion towards the south. The region then remains under their control for a century until the fall of Nineveh to the Babylonians. Egypt and Babylon would then
compete for territories of the old empire. But the Babylonians quickly take
over and project their power in the region. Jerusalem resists this new rule and rebels. The Babylonian army then returns to besiege and destroy the city. Much of the population is then moved to the capital. In 539 BC, the Achaemenid Persian empire takes over Babylon. The new king authorizes a free passage
for Judeans, prompting many to return to Jerusalem. They would then rebuild the city and organize the foundations of Jewish culture by building the Temple of
Solomon and writing the Torah. In 334 BC, the ambitious young Macedonian king, Alexander the Great, set out with his army to conquer the known world. In just over 10 years, he rakes up a huge territory and builds many cities. But, exhausted by conquest, he died at age 32 in Babylon without an heir of governing age. The empire was then divided by his generals into various Hellenic kingdoms. Judea came under the control of the Ptolemaic dynasty. A Jewish community settles in the new city of Alexandria and the Torah is translated into Greek. Following a war against the Seleucid dynasty, Hellenic and Jewish culture developed friction to the point that one of the altars of the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem was dedicated to the worship of Zeus. A traditionalist, anti-Hellenic Jewish militia is organized and takes control of Jerusalem in 164 BC. The temple is restored and the kingdom of Judea becomes independent. A century later the region was conquered by the Roman army. The Judeans would organize two major revolts against the new regime, which were violently crushed. The first revolt in 66 provoked the siege of Jerusalem followed by the destruction of its temple. The only wall of the enclosure that survived would become known as the Wailing Wall. During the second revolt, the city was razed and a great part of the population slaughtered. This time, the Jews were forbidden a safe passage to Judea. Many migrated to Galilee and
across the empire. Towards the end of the Roman empire,
Christianity was the dominant religion and Jerusalem a place of pilgrimage. The largely well-to-do Jewish community in the Mediterranean Basin began to be persecuted, especially in the Visigoths and Byzantine empires. In the 7th century, following the birth of Islam, begins an Arab conquest. In some cases Jews support the conquest in the hope of better conditions. They are tolerated by the Arabs and only polytheistic peoples are forcibly converted. In Jerusalem, the Dome of the Rock is built, making the city holy to the three monotheistic religions. The Arabs arrive at the Iberian Peninsula, which they call Al-Andalus. Here, 5% of the population is Jewish, ushering in a golden age of culture. Meanwhile in Europe, Jews are not only tolerated as people who witnessed times before Christ, but also as the sole traders between Catholics and Muslims. This allows Jews to gradually establish themselves in all of Western Europe. In the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks, a
Central Asian people, began their expansion and reached Jerusalem. They persecute Christians and forbid pilgrimages to the city. In response, Christians in Europe organized crusades -- military and religious expeditions to the holy city. Along the way, they massacred Jewish communities who they now consider a deicide people, who killed Jesus Christ. In 1347, Genoese merchant boats from Caffa helped spread the Black Death. In five years, the disease wreaks havoc in Europe, killing almost half its population. A rumor spreads accusing Jews of poisoning wells, resulting in their persecution mainly along the Rhine and Rhone region and their eventual expulsion. In Spain, the Reconquista ends. The Catholic kings serve an ultimatum to the Jews to either convert or leave. The majority, who choose to leave, settle
along the Mediterranean coast, mainly in the Ottoman Empire, where they are welcomed. The Poland-Lithuania Commonwealth becomes a haven for Jews from Western Europe due to favourable migration policies. In the 17th century, the region hosts more than 300,000 or about half of the Jews in the world. But everything changed in 1648 with the revolt of the Cossacks Ukrainian peasants against the nobility and the Jews. They accused the Jews of having a
privileged relationship with those in power. More than 100,000 Jewish people
are killed or flee the region. This episode would weaken the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, besieged on all sides by neighboring powers. In 150 years, the region falls and its territory is carved up. The Jewish community is divided and 900,000 of them find themselves in the Russian empire, where they are not welcome. They quickly become the targets of attacks called ""pogroms"" -- a Russian term meaning ""devastation"". Given the lack of response from authorities, these attacks become more frequent and deadly. The Jews then emigrated to the United
States and Western Europe, which in the meantime, has improved their living conditions. It is in this context that the first Zionist Congress is held in Basel in 1897, contemplating the founding of a new homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine. But the Ottoman Empire is fiercely opposed to the project. A few years later, the First World War breaks out. The Ottoman Empire fought alongside
Germany. When the Allies were in trouble and desperately sought further support, the then-British minister of Foreign Affairs Arthur Balfour wrote an open letter, promising a Jewish homeland in Palestine in return for Jewish support. In parallel, they support the Arab rebellion against the Ottoman Empire by promising them independence in the liberated territories. At the end of the war, the map of the Middle East was redrawn and divided up between the European powers. Palestine comes under the British mandate, marking the beginning of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict..."

77,oHlx5fB94bc,Israel at 75 - A nation in domestic crisis | DW Documentary,"The state of Israel is in political turmoil as it marks its 75th anniversary. While there is still no end in sight to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, Israeli society itself is more divided than ever before.

The founding of the Jewish state was a dream come true for Jews around the world. It came just a few years after the genocide of the Holocaust and 2,000 years after the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple and the exile from Israel.

On May 14, 1948, David Ben-Gurion read out the Israeli Declaration of Independence in a small building in the center of Tel Aviv. Ever since its foundation, Israel has had a checkered history. As well as ongoing conflict with the Palestinians, it has seen poverty and hardship, but also economic prosperity and social advances over the past 75 years. In addition, Israel enjoys political and military superiority in the region. At the same time, the state is now going through its deepest-ever domestic crisis. Israel is socially, politically and religiously polarized.

One reason for that are the plans put forward by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing religiously conservative government. The reforms are designed to reduce the power of the Supreme Court. Critics regard the move as an assault on democracy and an attempt to undermine the independence of the judiciary. For months now, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been protesting against the proposals. 

In his documentary, ZDF correspondent Michael Bewerunge investigates what has become of the aspirations of the nation’s founders and how people today are living the Jewish dream.

its Independence Day with a demonstration
of strength. The fighter jets send the message that
this country can master any conflict... All this while Israelis celebrate what
is now the stateís 75th anniversary. They can be proud of the
prosperity thatís been achieved, yet they are still struggling
with unresolved conflicts. Israel has made
some peace deals. But not with its closest
neighbors, the Palestinians. The violent conflict
keeps on erupting. Then, there are the deep
divisions in Israeli society linked to ultra-orthodox
factions and Zionist extremists. Hundreds of thousands have
been protesting government plans to in their eyes
weaken democracy. What has happened to
the dream of a Jewish state? With Israel more polarized
than ever before in its history. Theyíre Israelis, but they
live in the occupied West Bank. New settlements like Kedumim
close to Nablus are set up each year: widely considered illegal
under international law. The Israeli settlers now
number over 700,000. When I came here, there
were maybe a hundred Jews. I see here two million
Jews, three million Jews. Many more millions of
Jews. This is my vision. Weíre on the road
with Daniela Weiss, one of the early settlers here and
a lobbyist for settlersí interests. She co-founded Kedumim, one of
the first Jewish settlements, in 1975. The activist has been vigorously
promoting the Jewish settlement of the West
Bank ever since. Itís a miracle what I
see in front of my eyes. These are new trailers for new
families coming to a new outpost. Your camera is
the first to see it. The new illegal
outpost is called Ori Ad - and was set up by a handful
of families in double-quick time. The settlers
have to be fast. Sometimes, the Israeli army
tries to clear such outposts. Arbel Zak is pregnant
with her fifth child. With her husband
being in the army, sheís doing this almost singlehandedly
- but with utter conviction. We are clearly
on Israeli territory. Of course, itís strange
to see a house like this. You probably wouldnít want to live
in it - with no electricity or water. The settlers have
no qualms or doubts that their appropriation
of the land might be unjust. The reasoning
is religious. We got the word from God to our
forefathers to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob: That the land of Israel will be given
to the offspring of the forefathers of the Jewish
nation - forever. So, I do not have to invent a
reasoning bigger than the bible. The settlements were only made
possible by the Six Day War of 1967. Of all the wars waged between
Israelis and Arab nations, this has had the
biggest legacy. Israeli forces captured East
Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank - territories that had been
largely allocated to the Palestinians under the 1947
UN Partition Plan. But for many Israelis, the
notion of recreating biblical Israel suddenly became
a real possibility. Of course, Jerusalem
was so momentous: That you are now reunited with the
Temple Mount, with the Western Wall, the famous picture of 67
showing the soldiers nearby. Those were deeply emotional - and then
again - almost metaphysical moments for many Israelis, even those
who were completely secular. We are reviving the kingdom
that was truly lost - 2,000 years ago. Over the years, as the
occupation assumed permanence, the likelihood of a
peaceful two-state solution has become
increasingly remote. Instead, more and
more ultranationalists settled in the
occupied territories - and today theyíre more
determined than ever to spread their missionary
vision of a ìGreater Israelî. In this vision of a
Jewish-dominated theocracy, Palestinians only play
an at best subordinate role. People who do not accept the fact
that they will never have sovereignty in the state of the Jews,
in the land of the Jews, they will go to Arab countries where
they can live under Arab sovereignty. Itís a very
clear formula. It says in the bible - and so I
live by it and Jews live by it. Daniela Weiss categorically denies
that the settlers, too, are guilty of violence in various forms
- not just the Palestinians. My people, I mean the
Jewish people, are not violent. They never preach violence.
We have a synagogue here, there. We have 20 synagogues. All that
you hear is peace, peace, peace. And there was no pogrom
from the side of Jews. We drive to
Hawara every day. Myself, my children, my
grandchildren, my great-grandchildren All the family. Never, never, never did we
think of causing anyone any harm. On the main road between Nablus
and Ramallah is the town of Hawara - now a hot spot in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israeli troops patrol the streets
and control the important junctions. The Israelis want their children to
live in peace, security and stability. But I also want my
children to live like that. Iím just as concerned about
the future of my children as the Israelis
are about theirs The army has blocked
roads into Hawara - again. Only settlers with Israeli registration
plates are allowed to pass through. For Firas Dmaeedi and his
supermarket: itís a disaster. For months, the town has been
in the grip of terror and violence. Business has
hit rock bottom. Things are really bad, in
particular the economic situation. As you can see, I own
this big food supermarket, but these days I hardly
get any customers. My sales have slumped by 80% because
of the activities of the settlers and the Israeli army in Hawara. I
used to have 50 staff. Now, just 20. For months, settlers have
been launching violent attacks on the townís residents.
The army rarely intervenes. The settlers donít need
a reason to attack us. Sometimes they just throw
stones at us for no reason. What happened in Hawara was
a reaction to what the Israeli army and the settlers
have been doing. A year ago, we had good relations
with the Jews and the Israelis. On the other hand there
are the brutal terrorist attacks carried out by
Palestinians. Two settlers were murdered
here in the middle of Hawara at the end of February - which a lot
of people here say was understandable. The attacks were a reaction to
Israeli actions against Palestinians. Many people have been killed by
the Israeli army in Nablus and Jenin. Plus: the perpetrators didnít
even come from Hawara. After that attack the
escalating violence exploded. An angry mob of settlers rampaged
through Hawara in retaliation: Stones were hurled at
homes and businesses, dozens of cars and
buildings were torched. Local residents
were hunted down. The violence left one
Palestinian shot dead, and about one
hundred injured. The Israeli army completely lost
control or didnít want to intervene, while saying that it
tried to save lives. One Israeli officer described
the events as a ìpogromî. Surveillance camera
footage shows settlers trying to set Firas
Dmaeediës home on fire. Even weeks after the violence,
the damage is still clearly visible. When we tried to put out
the fire started by settlers, the Israeli army attacked us
with stun grenades and tear gas. The soldiers saw it all,
but they didnít do anything. The next day they came to
me and said: Why are you here? You should return to your own
country, Jordan, or to Saudi Arabia. Those were the
words of the army. Itís a conflict that affects the
innocent and the guilty alike. But violence breeds violence. It seems
impossible to lead a normal life. Firas Dmaeedi doesnít see any
long-term future here for his business, his family
or himself. Iím really worried for my children. I
donít hold out much hope for them. Iím stuck between a
rock and a hard place. Either we leave the country we
were born in to protect our children. Or we sacrifice our children
so we can stay in our parentsí and grandparentsí homeland.
We are prepared to do that. Israel is trying to terrorize
us into leaving this country. Along with these external conflicts,
Israel also faces domestic ones - like that surrounding
Jewish identity. The influence of ultra-orthodox
Jews is increasing. They make up a rapidly growing
proportion of the population - currently 14%. Their
lives revolve around prayer. In school, they study the
Torah, not English and math. Theyíre exempt
from military service. If at all, it tends to be the
women who have regular jobs. Itís like a
parallel universe. Iím sure that one day
the Messiah will come - and when he comes, we will
be delivered from all our troubles. Those who have followed
the Torahís path will triumph. Those who havenít
will disappear. Yoelish Krois has 18
children and six grandchildren. He lives with his wife and the underage
children in the Mea Shearim district of Jerusalem - in two rooms
and something like a sleeping cell. He does
occasional odd jobs. His family live in precarious
economic circumstances. Krois belongs to the Eda
Haredit religious community. They completely
reject the Israeli state. Their hope is that the Messiah will
come and establish his kingdom here. The state of Israel is
the biggest catastrophe that could happen to the
Jewish people. I have no choice. I live here because I was
born here and canít leave. I try to live with it, by not
taking anything from the state. If you donít have any
contact with the state, you can be sure that
you will remain orthodox. But that doesnít stop Krois and
thousands of his fellow-believers protesting against the secular world
out there and its sinful trappings. Ultra-orthodox Jews in general
adhere solely to Kashrut laws - which lay down what
is kosher and what isnít. And smartphones providing
Internet access are definitely not. Only kosher devices are permitted - and
only then for important phone calls. The internet? Itís a waste of
time and is full of bad things. Itís without decency and
morals - and full of evil opinions. It makes you addicted.
Itís led to many divorces. You become dependent
on it and stop living. The rejection of the
modern secular world sometimes leads
to violent protests. Among the targets of the
Eda Haredit groupís anger: A tram passing
through their district. And recently, businesses selling
non-kosher smartphones went up in flames. Another segment of the
ultra-orthodox population is willing to get
involved in politics. The Shas party and
United Torah Judaism are part of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahuís governing coalition. Their communities and
Torah schools receive subsidies in return for
their votes - as well as other privileges
and influence on religious rules. The influence of the ultra-Orthodox
goes back to the birth of Israel - prompting the countryís founders
to cede them significant power and refrain from creating
a written constitution. A mistake thatís come
back to haunt the country. Ben Gurion did
not see that coming. He thought that by firmly
establishing secular Zionism, by almost sanctifying the state
- creating a sort of civil religion - we might find a
good substitute. And there will be some ultraorthodox,
religious and national-religious, but it will really be
on the outskirts of that. Secular Israel - most
prominent in Tel Aviv - feels increasingly constrained
by ultra-religious communities. They, in turn, have long
found the permissive lifestyle of the beachside
city objectionable. I wish the state of Israel would be
governed by more women and gay men. Because neither we nor women
are usually interested in war. On its 75th anniversary, I wish
the state of Israel more tolerance and willingness to accept
the opinions of others. Roy and Ohad have
been together for 14 years. The couple run a bridal
fashion business in Florentin, one of the hippest
districts of Tel Aviv. Ohad got the idea 12 years
ago when he started working as a personal
shopper for brides - acting as their right-hand
man looking after the dress, make-up, jewelry
and hair styling. Now, wedding dresses are the main
focus, but not just any old designs. Weíve taught brides
to become smart brides. Our studio has the most expensive
dresses made by Israeli designers. We sell them
at half price. Instead of the dresses being worn
once and then ending up in the trash, they get worn
a second time. Their second line
of business is Oro: A counselling firm
for shared parenting. Roy and Ohad bring together men
and women who want to have a child without being in a
relationship with one another. After artificial
insemination, mother and father take turns
raising their biological child. Marriage is a model
thatís losing relevance. Nowadays we realize that
getting married and having children donít necessarily
have to be connected. With their children,
RenÈ and Ray, the couple also actively practice
the shared parenting model. Two fathers and one mother
taking turns to take care of the kids. Everyoneís happy. There are two
biological fathers. Gal is the biological
mother of both of them. Ohad is the biological father of
Rene and Iím Rayís biological father. Thatís not a problem in their
immediate social environment. Iíll ask the kids. Does anyone at
kindergarten think itís strange that you
have a father and a father? No... Yet violent hostility is
increasing around the country. Homophobic views have
become socially acceptable. In our liberal Tel Aviv bubble
we donít feel it as much. Though last week homosexuals
got their windows smashed, and gay pride
flags were burned. We have to fight so we donít
lose what we have achieved. There are religious groups
who want to roll things back. They want to
repeal liberal laws. They want to introduce
therapy to convert gay people. And they donít want to fund
medication for transsexuals. Or anything else that
we have achieved. Above all, Roy and Ohad are
proud of how far theyíve come - both personally
and in Israeli society. Weíre a central
pillar of Israeli society. We have put down roots
and serve in the military too. Weíre an important
part of the Israeli mix. Kibbutz communities are
also part of the Israeli mix. This is Yiron in the
northern tip of Israel. The hills on the horizon
are part of Lebanon. Founded in 1949, Yiron is almost
as old as the state of Israel itself - and one of the few kibbutzes that
have made the move into the modern era. I wish Israel to grow and succeed
and to bring good things to the people who live here regardless
of their religion or faith. Simcha Shor runs a start-up
in the middle of the Kibbutz. He wants to revolutionize
farming worldwide. His drones can identify
pests or errors in irrigation or the use
of fertilizers - and can even be used for
spot-spraying with pesticides. Agriculture is under a
tremendous revolution of robotics and artificial
intelligence. Today, people walk in the
fields and they see some plants - perhaps
a hundred. A drone can cover a
million plants in 20 minutes, so we can look at
agriculture like never before. The start-up is housed in
the communityís old cowshed. The kibbutz is also the
companyís majority owner. We are sitting in the dairy farm.
The cows were here since 1949. You can see them here feeding the cows.
This is the building where we are in - it was for the cows and
the milking of the cows. We are now the cows - itís
from dairy farm to tech farm. From a cowshed
in rural Israel, the company advises
farmers across the world. Perhaps this is where we find the
secret behind this start-up nation. Israelís high-tech sector accounts
for some 50% of the countryís exports. Israel is a small country. You
donít have so much water or land. We are not going to
grow food for the world, but as we started drip
irrigation 50 years ago, now is the time to harness the
other power of Israel: the high-tech. The kibbutz still grows fruit and
vegetables using conventional methods. And apart from the high-tech enterprise,
everyone gets the same pay here - from the tractor driver to
the long-serving vintners. But change
is in the air. Now, Yiron is set to join the
vast majority of other kibbutzes and be privatized. And thereís
nothing that can be done about it, according to wine
grower Avner Anava. The socialist ideals
of this and other kibbutzes he says, have
had their day. The idea of the kibbutz
is a community of people who cooperate with one
another, with shared tasks. So the economic factor
doesnít play such a big role. The moment that personal greed
comes along - it gets problematic. ...But it was the first
kibbutz settlements that prepared the
ground for the foundation of the modern
state of Israel. Ada  Feinberg helped set up Yiron
in 1949 and still lives there today. Later, she became a kindergarten
teacher and had a family. After the horrors of the Holocaust,
hopes and aspirations were high. Weíve always thought that we werenít
just founding a kibbutz, but a state. Because the people of Israel needed
a state just like every normal people. We hoped for a socialist
state: a good and noble state. But as it celebrates
75th anniversary, this is a state that risks losing
its good, democratic core. Israeli society
is fragmenting. Hundreds of thousands have
been holding weekly protests against government plans to
dismantle the separation of powers. People from all walks of society:
judges, civil servants, businesspeople - retirees,
students, soldiers - never has such a broad base rallied
behind a common goal like this. Many had never attended
a demonstration before. But this is about nothing
less than democracy itself. The goal is to live in a country
that blends western democracy and liberalism with Jewish
values, blends them together. It works great until somebody
tries to break it apart. Israel Shafir could have just
withdrawn to his retirement residence in Beit Uziel. And do what the
70-year-old pensioner likes doing most: Tending to his olive trees
with his grandson Matan. Shafir - or ìRelikî, as
heís popularly known - is a highly decorated former
fighter pilot and commanding officer. He spent decades serving a
country that is now falling apart. The ideals and the social
cohesion may break into ideas that are not connected together - like
a liberal democracy with a theocracy, orthodox theocracy or even
development of messianic Judaism. Relik took part in many
air battles for Israel - now he once more feels a sense
of duty to fight for his country. As a fighter pilot,
your DNA is to take off and stop any threat coming from
the outside world into the country. And now Iím seventy years old and
thereís another threat to this country - and this time it
comes from another... from maybe within, but
the DNA stays the same. Itís this conviction that has now
led Relik and his former comrades to join the protests on the
streets of Jerusalem or Tel Aviv at least
once a week. We are here today to
support the Supreme Court and the judicial system
against the destruction that is planned
by the coalition, which plans to change the
structure of how Israel is run. The government is indeed
intending to fundamentally alter the judicial-political
balance of power. Under the plans, a majority of Knesset
members would be able to override any Supreme
Court rulings. The government
with its ultra-nationalist and ultra-religious factions also
wants to control judicial appointments. The impact
would be dramatic. The agenda
of this coalition, especially the
leaders of this coalition, is to eradicate this democracy. There
will be no democracy if they succeed. In Israel, as you know,
the only check and balance that you have is the
Supreme Court, nothing else. Eradicate that and
there is no democracy. Clearly, the establishment of the state
in 1948 had a further shortcoming. David Ben Gurion and
Israelís other founders omitted certain checks and
balances in the separation of powers: A written constitution, a second
chamber, a constitutional court. How could that happen
despite the appalling example of the Nazis and
their rise to power? After abolishing democracy
by democratic means. Israeli Zionists felt that somehow
they were immune to that. ëWe have learned that lesson
so well from the outside.í Being the victims often, how
on earth is that even thinkable that we would do the same.
But, of course, that is a fantasy. We are all humans
and we are all flawed. And yet Israelís democracy has
shown strength in this time of crisis. The protesters have
won an interim victory. The government has suspended
part of the planned judicial reform. But in another
section, it still plans to curb the powers
of the Supreme Court and limit the separation of
powers. The protests continue. People know that the situation
remains a precarious one. But events have also given rise
to a sense of shared responsibility. Perhaps that will help to solve
Israelís other problems, too."

#Israel #Palestine #IsraelVsPalestine",2023-10-10,54705,922,246,UCHvGJ-eAV8krPgqofo65WYQ," The recent conflict between Israel and 
Palestine has become increasingly important   to understand where it started and what’s 
happening now. Hey, it’s Dan Zimmerman,   welcome back to Illustrate to Educate. 
In this video we’ll take a look at the   root of the conflict all the way up 
to the current events happening now. The conflict between Israel and Palestine is a 
long-standing and complex dispute over territory,   national identity, and security. At its core, 
it revolves around the historical and competing   claims of Israelis and Palestinians to the 
same land, particularly in the area known   as Israel and the Palestinian territories 
(West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem).   Additionally, the militant group Hamas 
is a significant player in this conflict. The roots of the conflict can be traced back 
to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when   Jewish immigration to Palestine, then part 
of the Ottoman Empire, began to increase.  After World War I, the League of Nations granted 
Britain the mandate to govern Palestine. During   this period, tensions between Jewish 
immigrants and Arab residents grew.  In 1947, the United Nations proposed 
a plan to partition Palestine into   separate Jewish and Arab states, with 
Jerusalem as an international city.   Jewish leaders accepted the plan, but Arab 
leaders rejected it, leading to violence. In 1948, Israel declared its independence, leading 
to the Arab-Israeli War. Arab states intervened,   and a ceasefire was eventually declared in 
1949. This war resulted in the displacement of   hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs, 
creating the Palestinian refugee crisis. Israel has since occupied various 
territories, including the West Bank,   Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, as 
a result of subsequent conflicts.  Israel's establishment of settlements in these 
occupied territories has been a major point of   contention, as it's seen as a violation of 
international law and a hindrance to peace. Palestinians have sought self-determination 
and statehood, with the Palestine Liberation   Organization (PLO) representing their interests.  Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, 
often mediated by the international community,   have been ongoing for decades 
but have made limited progress. Now how does Hamas play into this? Hamas 
is a Palestinian militant and political   organization founded in 1987. It emerged 
as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood   and opposes Israel's existence. In 2006, 
Hamas won legislative elections in the   Gaza Strip and subsequently took control 
there, while the West Bank remained under   the control of the Palestinian Authority, 
which is dominated by the Fatah party.  Hamas and Israel have engaged in multiple 
conflicts, including wars in 2008-2009,   2012, and 2014 and 2021. These conflicts have 
resulted in significant casualties and damage. What’s happening now? Hamas officials 
cited long-simmering tensions including   a dispute over the sensitive Al-Aqsa 
Mosque sacred to both Muslims and Jews,   that led to the surprise attack out of Gaza. Hamas 
also has cited the expansion of Jewish settlements   on lands Palestinians claim for a future state 
and Ben-Gvir, a Israeli religious nationalist’s,   efforts to toughen restrictions on Palestinian 
prisoners in Israel. This attack by Hamas resulted   in the Israeli government declaring war. The 
surprise attack included militants blowing   through a fortified border fence and killing 
civilians and soldiers in Israeli communities   along the Gaza frontier during a Jewish holiday. 
Israel continues to strike back with airstrikes on   the Gaza Strip, including one that flattened 
a 14-story tower that held Hamas offices. On October 9th, Israeli Defense Minister said that 
he has ordered a “complete siege” on Gaza and that   authorities would cut electricity and block 
the entry of food and fuel to the Palestinian   territory. There continues to be captives 
held on both sides and isolated conflicts   arising in the area. Several western nations have 
voiced their support and solidarity for Israel,   while many nations or groups in the 
middle east have shown support for   Palestinians and the resistance of 
Hamas and its fight against Israel. Did you enjoy this video explaining the Israel

rooted in national political territorial cultural and religious factors israelis and palestinians both want the same thing land one side has a state the other one does not it's not just about land but it's about having the right to self-determination this is not a conflict between jews or and muslims or jews or arabs it doesn't go back to the biblical times or the old testament at all this is a relatively modern conflict the origins of the conflict can be traced back to the late 19th century the ottoman turkish empire ruled the land along the eastern mediterranean from 1516 to 1917. judaism emerged in the middle east islam emerged in the middle east christianity emerged in the middle east they shared the same place for hundreds of years under the ottoman empire what changes in the late 19th early 20th century we have jewish nationalism we have british colonialism the ottoman empire fell after the allied powers defeated the central powers in world war one in 1918. it became a british mandate it came under the british rule great britain made conflicting agreements about the future of palestine to arabs and leaders of a nationalist movement called zionism zionism was an ideology and a moment that aimed to establish a jewish state in palestine according to the zionists in eastern europe at the time jews constituted a nation they were not just a religious group but they were an ethnic group and they deserved their own state jews were being discriminated against and persecuted and harassed and oppressed in eastern europe so they said we need to establish our own state to be safe and secure and they chose palestine to do that historians believe zionism is a continuation of the ancient attachment of the jews and jewish religion to the historical region of palestine however there was a big problem palestine where they wanted to create their state in was inhabited by an arab majority who had been there for more than a thousand years great britain made another promise to the arabs living in the region and they said palestine was going to be part of an independent arab state that was going to be established after the war was over in 1917 great britain announced this balfour declaration which is a turning point in the history of the israeli-palestinian conflict the documents supported the establishment of a jewish national home in palestine and the preservation of the civil and religious rights of non-jewish communities it did not mention the political or national rights of palestinian arabs the british rule basically allowed the jews to come in migrate to palestine settle in palestine and to purchase land in palestine in spite of all the arab resistance so there were increasing tensions and hostilities between the jewish community and the arab community in the region a lot of palestinians lost their homes and lost their jobs british efforts to bring the zionists and arabs together failed leading to the arab revolt of 1936 in response the british government restricted jewish immigration and jewish land purchases in palestine in 1947 beerton decided to refer the matter to united nations and they came up with a plan and this partition plan basically said that there were going to be two states in palestine there was going to be jewish states and arab states this plan was not accepted by arabs in palestine because even though only a third of the population was jewish and the jews owned only like almost 10 percent of the land in palestine they were given 55 percent of the territory the u.n partition plan was approved by the u.n mostly because of the american support the jewish community had been preparing for statehood since they migrated to palestine they had already formed organizations and institutions that they needed for self-governments great britain eventually withdrew and gave up its mandate over palestine on may 14 1948 the state of israel was proclaimed the neighboring arab countries declared war on israel to stop it from consolidating itself and it ended with defeat for arabs and israel actually was able to even expand its it's territories israel gained some territory formally granted to palestinian arabs under the united nations resolution in 1947. in israel the war is remembered as the war of independence almost a 1 million palestinians were either forced to leave the region or had to flee to this day palestinians remember this state this war as as al-makbar the catastrophe there were three more wars between israel and different arab countries the war of 1967 is the most important one because at the end of this war israel gained a big victory and it occupied the remaining palestinian territories and this occupation was supposed to be temporary it was regarded illegal by the united nations however the occupations still continues to this day so west bank is jerusalem and the gaza strip are occupied territories which means they are still under israeli occupation all aspects of their lives are controlled by the israeli governments their access to water electricity basic food items basic medical supplies education employment their exits and entrances a lot of palestinians are living as refugees and then there are other palestinians who are still living in israel as israeli citizens but they are also complaining that they're not treated equally and the jewish citizens of israel had more rights we have hamas in the gaza strip hamas came into the picture in 1987. during the 1990s and early 2000s they were engaged in armed struggle against israel they had this like militant wing which was responsible for like the suicide bombings and some of the violence it later turned into a political party and gained power in the gaza strip after the elections of 2007. since 2007 because it's recognized as a terrorist organization by israel the united states there have been sanctions in place and gaza has been under a blockade hamas is the major political actor in gaza right now but it doesn't represent all palestinians israeli government obviously is much more like stronger in terms of like militarily and and financially hamas has unleashed hundreds of rockets and mortars on israel but they have not been able to penetrate israel's so-called iron dome the anti-missile defense system over one thousand gaza residents killed more than six thousand wounded israel has lost 42 soldiers and three civilians the united states is not like a neutral observer the us is currently providing almost four billion dollars every year to israel in the form of military financial aid the conflict escalates every few years but again there are long-term deep-rooted problems on the ground that kind of create the environment for the escalation [Music] you

It altered the political and military landscape, expanded Israel’s territorial claims and confirmed Israel's military dominance in the region. 

This war is known to Arabs as 'The War in June' and in Israel as 'The Six Day War'. It came just two decades after the 1948 'Nakba,' or catastrophe, when the state of Israel was established and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were expelled from their homes and land. 

‘The War in June’ looks at the roots of the 1967 War and documents the actual details of six days of battle, before considering the profound long-term consequences of this conflict.

Israel but this public display of power took place under a dark [Music] shadow the pre day Egyptian president gal Abdul nasar had ordered his forces to take up positions along the borders with Israel 3 weeks later on the 5th of June 1967 Israel launched an allout war against its Arab [Music] Neighbors after only 6 days of fighting it achieved total Victory defeating the armies of Egypt Jordan and Syria known to Israelis as The Six Day War Israel's territorial gains would change the map of the Middle East to this day Israeli occupation of these lands is the main bar to peace in this turbulent region these huge territories which the Israeli Army had conquered it completely intoxicated them everybody was intoxicated no one could even think straight but the story of this war is much longer than the six days of fighting its roots lay years earlier two decades before the 5th of June 1967 Tel Aviv the 14th of May 1948 the day that Zionist leader David Boran declared the establishment of the state of Israel on the day after the Declaration five Arab armies entered Palestine the Lebanese attacked from the north the syrians Iraqis and jordanians from the East but the most serious threat came from the south the Egyptian Army Advanced to the Village of ybaa which is 22 kilm from Tel Aviv we were a very thin line of soldiers who were defending what was practically the last line of defense of T Aviv but the pressure on the israelies was relieved when a un broken truce came into effect the Zionist movement purchased arms on the European black markets the Arab armies of course enjoyed mainstream supplies from States the French supplied the Lebanese and the syrians the British supplied the Egyptians the jordanians and the Iraqis with a constant stream of arms in 1948 the United Nations imposed an embargo on armed shipments to the Middle East and the British and the French abided by this embargo when the truce ran out the israelies now better armed set out to expel the

was a young major gal Abdul Naser with their armies locked in a stalemate Egyptian and Israeli delegations met on the island of RADS under the sponsorship of the [Music] UN after a month of bargaining they reached an amisus agreement well first of all they had to put an end to the fighting I believe that Egypt wanted to get out of there as much as Israel wanted Ed and the negotiation was mostly about evacuating the fuja pocket Egypt had no territorial uh demands from Israel so it was relatively easy to reach a ceasefire by the summer of 1949 Lebanon Jordan and Syria had also signed Armistice agreements with Israel the Jewish State now extended over almost the whole of Palestine Arab territory was reduced to just a few small enclaves Eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank were placed under Jordanian control the Gaza Strip was to be administered by Egypt in the midst of defeat gal Abdul nasar conceived a plan that would change the future of Egypt eypt a movement that would be known as

a matter of life and death to us all our quarrel is not with Egypt still less with the Arab world it is with Colonel NASA he has shown that he's not a man who can be trusted to keep an agreement

much rehearsed operation Focus an aerial strike to destroy the Egyptian Air Force on the [Music] ground in the early hours of the 5th of June 1967 the Israeli Air Force prepared to to deliver the first blow when we wake up in the morning and came to the briefing room we wrote on the Blackboard the hours which was [Applause] 7:45 200 Israeli Jets took to the air they would arrive over Egyptian airfields at exactly 7:45 a.m. to avoid radar detection they flew first North then West over the Mediterranean turning South the Plaines came in from the north not from the East as the Egyptians had anticipated [Music] [Music] now everything is very easy as you trained many many time before his aircraft were located very easy on the ground and not far from the runways it was not a big problem to strike them immediately you saw big torches with smoke over all those airfields [Music] lers by midday the Israelis had successfully attacked 18 [Music] airfields the Egyptians had lost 80% of their Air Force more than 300 planes destroyed on the [Music] ground ironically Cairo radio was carrying false reports of the total failure of the enemy's Air Attack with news coming in of Egypt's apparent success Jordan Syria and Iraq now launched their own air strikes in effective though they were those attacks gave the Israelis a pretext to widen the scope scope of the war operation Focus was extended to cover airfields in Jordan Syria and even a key base in Iraq H3 was the only base from which they could reach Israel and the only base in which we could reach with the last drops of the fuel my third flight that day I attack El maaza Air Base not far from Damascus caught off guard the syrians lost half their aircraft the H3 Airfield in Iraq was put out of action and Jordan's air force was totally destroyed by sunset on the first day of War operation Focus had guaranteed Israel total air superiority in the Skies over the Middle East the Arab armies would now be fighting with no air support the outcome of the war had been sealed I really think that there is no example in the history of world Aviation of such a total strike and a total attack maybe the only time that you can compare it with B Harbor the attack of the Japanese on pear Harbor which was also a great surprise attack which almost decimated the American Fleet in the Pacific on the ground though Egyptian forces were fairing much better they had succeeded in holding up the Israeli armored Advance into Sinai yet the Egyptian Deputy Supreme Commander Marshall Amir was about to take a disastrous decision its roots lay in his attempted visit to the front line the day before miraculously the plane was able to return to Cairo but Marshall Amur had been shocked by witnessing Israel's Air Supremacy at [Music] firsthand the next day Amar ordered an immediate withdrawal of Egyptian troops from Sinai an order which led to the total collapse of the Egyptian front the for by the fourth day of the war Israeli troops reached the Eastern Bank of the Suz canal they had occupied the whole of the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza [Music] St the previous day the Israelis had also tasted success on their Eastern Front ending the short-lived War launched by Jordan's King Hussein by 11:00 in the morning the first day virtually after we destroyed the Egyptian Air Force but usin didn't know it at that time on the contrary NASA called him up and said we are winning we're winning do your own share uh he didn't do a big offensive he wasn't unable to do it but he conquered the hill around the government house it endangered the southern part of Jerusalem his forces were only by now a few hundred yards away from Israeli houses of Israeli citizen [Music] on the afternoon of the first day of the war the Israelis began their assault against the jordanians the battle soon escalated and 2 Days Later the whole of the West Bank and Jerusalem fell to the Israelis [Music] with the war all but over on the Egyptian and Jordanian France and ignoring a un call for a ceasefire Israel's High command now decided to secure its borders with Syria on the fifth day of War Israeli troops began to climb the Strategic goolan Heights and [Music] but on the sixth day of the war Syria had accepted the UN ceasefire with no advanced warning given to troops fighting on the Goan the broadcast fatally undermined Syrian Army [Music] resistance the man blamed for the Army's collapse was the Minister of Defense a man who would eventually rise to power in Syria ha Al Assad the Israelis pushed on and occupied the whole of the Golan [Music] Heights at the end of the sixth day of fighting and only when it had achieved all its goals Israel accepted the UN ceasefire the guns fell silent the Arabs had suffered a humiliating [Music] defeat [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] under heavy popular pressure NASA rended his decision to step down from the presidency and attempts to regain the Lost Arab territories [Music] began Israel had tripled its size capturing the Sinai Peninsula the Gaza Strip the West Bank Eastern Jerusalem and the goolan heights there were songs written there were Victory albums there were the huge intoxication of Victory this huge unique miraculous victory of the Israeli Army in that war was the greatest tragedy in the history of Israel the Israelis basked in an aura of invincibility but their victory was just the start of even greater complications which still plague the Middle East to this day Israel found itself governing and being responsible for a million Palestinians in the newly occupied Gaza Strip West Bank and [Music] Jerusalem I took about 6 months to roam around the newly occupied territories most in the West Bank and Gaza and I came back and I said look there is another people there and they have a national movement so what do we do either we we conquer them and create a sort of an AP paride state or we have the loaf into predominantly Jewish State called Israel and the West Bank and Gaza should be a base is for future negotiations a recognition of their rights to have a state of their own a viable state of their own in the West Bank and Gaza what Israel chose was and Still Remains the first option in the aftermath of the war Israel declared what it called the unification of Jerusalem the entire holy city was placed under Israeli jurisdiction including Christian and Muslim holy [Music] sites we are the government and the only government in the area that is to say that we have obligations and privilege and duties there obligation and privilege to maintain M Law and Order and to provide the people with services and with suitable standard of living as a government like every government world its [Music] citizen furthermore and in defiance of international law Israeli settlers began to move into the West Bank the territory they called Judea and Samaria the lands which they wanted to settle in were the core and Heartland of the Jewish people in biblical times this is where Judaism emerged so it was natural that there would be this Messianic urge to settle those areas even perhaps even clear out Arabs from these areas this didn't happen but Jewish settlements were placed there and this has made things much more complicated for peacemaking here in addition to the West Bank settlements were spreading in the Gaza Strip Sinai and on the Golan Heights and as the Israelis tightened their grip on the occupied territories it became clear they had no intention of returning [Music] them in October 1973 after just 6 years the Arabs aiming to restore their territories and their dignity would launch Another [Music] War Israel was about to receive a sharp reminder of the vulnerability it thought it had conquered forever in the war of June [Music] 1967 [Music]

86,wv8F4NLr4E0,Israel and Palestine Origins with Dr. Benny Morris,"The topic of today's episode is the Israel-Palestine conflict. I've avoided discussing Israel on this podcast for two reasons. First, because I didn't know enough to feel qualified to weigh in on it. Second, because it may literally be the most radioactive topic on planet Earth. A tiny mistake or misplace word can cause a level of backlash that I just don't want to deal with. However, two things have changed over the past few months. I discuss these two factors in detail in the first few minutes of the episode.

I want the first half of this podcast to serve as an introduction to basic historical facts behind the conflict. If you're well versed on this topic, then you may want to skip the beginning. However, on the other hand, there is still quite a bit of interesting material there. The rest of this podcast is about the ethics and the current politics of the conflict. Who is in the right, and who is in the wrong? Is Israel an apartheid state that's oppressing a minority out of pure bigotry? Is it a colonialist, expansionist state motivated by religious belief? Or is it an embattled and legitimate nation-state surrounded by enemies that want only to survive? These are the questions that people struggle with and I brought in Dr. Benny Morris to help me answer them. Dr.Benny Morris has a unique vantage point on this issue. On the one hand, he is an Israeli Jew, and in recent years, he has become a major defender of Israel against global condemnation. On the other hand, he's probably done more than almost anyone you could name, to discover and publicize Israel's historical war crimes. He refused to serve in the Occupy West Bank Operation and was arrested as a result. His academic work on Israel is cited favorably by people like Noam Chomsky, who is all the way on the other side of the issue. Dr. Benny was at one point shunned by the Israeli academic community for being in essence ""a traitor"" to his people. He's one of the few people who can really claim to have battle scars from both sides of this debate.

Therefore, I thought he'd be a good person to help me weave through the complexities of the topic. I have a lot of admiration for Benny Morris, and I hope you find him as illuminating as I did.

topic of today's episode is the Israel Palestine conflict I've avoided discussing Israel on this podcast for two reasons first because I didn't know enough to feel qualified weighing in on it and second because it may literally be the most radioactive topic on planet Earth a tiny mistake or misplaced word can cause a level of backlash that I just don't want to deal with but two things have changed over the past few months first I've crossed some threshold where I've studied the issue enough to feel comfortable speaking about it and also I went to Israel for 10 days on a government-sponsored press trip with a group of journalists we spoke to Israeli journalists police officers politicians Supreme Court Justice military personnel and everyday citizens we went to Jerusalem Tel Aviv the borders with Gaza Lebanon and Syria and many other places now it goes without saying that this trip was structured so as to give us a favorable impression of Israel it was paid for by the Israeli government so some would call this a propaganda trip but the word propaganda is an umbrella term it covers everything from North Korea creating fake supermarkets full of food to show the outside world while their children starve by the thousands to the subtle choice of one word over another enhanced interrogation instead of torture or affirmative action instead of racial discrimination almost every op-ed you read has a perspective to offer that's not impartial just the choice of which facts to include and which to leave out is a kind of persuasion tactic that could be called propaganda I had Renee diresta on this show a while back and she reminded me that the original meaning of propaganda was not even a pejorative propaganda just referred to any material meant to persuade you of a political viewpoint by that standard most of what we read every day is propaganda so where did this Israel trip fall on the spectrum of propaganda well I can honestly say it was nowhere near the North Korea end of that Spectrum for one thing there was no limits on what we could ask anybody we could ask a politician or a Supreme Court Justice why are you guys oppressing the Palestinians in the West Bank and sometimes we could even record their answers that's not something you could do on a press trip in North Korea or in the Soviet Union on the other hand the Israeli government wouldn't sponsor these trips if they didn't believe we'd Come Away with a more positive perception of the country otherwise there'd be no point so was the trip structured so as to deliver the Israeli perspective on the conflict yes and consciously so but calling it propaganda calls to mind a level of lying and spinning and censorship that just wasn't there ultimately I think the word propaganda should be reserved for the really bad cases or else anything meant to persuade you of a Viewpoint becomes propaganda and the word loses all its potency in any event after my trip to Israel I felt ready to weigh in on this topic publicly and I want to do that in two ways first I want this podcast to serve as an introduction to the basic historical facts of the israel-palestine conflict from roughly 1880 until the present and the reason I want to do this is because I've noticed an astonishing level of ignorance around these basic facts when I was a student at Columbia I knew kids that seemed to be very moved emotionally by the plight of the Palestinians in the West Bank but could not tell you when or how British Palestine was partitioned when or how Israel was founded how and why many Jewish settlers ended up there in the first place nor could they tell you even basic facts about the major Wars that have been fought since 1948. so I want the first part of this podcast to serve as an introduction to these basic historical facts if you're well versed on this topic then you may want to skip the beginning but on the other hand there's still quite a bit of interesting material there the rest of this podcast is about the ethics and the current politics of the conflict who is in the right and who is in the wrong is Israel an apartheid state that's oppressing a minority out of pure bigotry is it is it a colonialist expansionist state motivated by religious belief or is it an embattled and legitimate nation-state surrounded by enemies that wants only to survive these are the questions that people struggle with and I brought in Dr Benny Morris to help me answer them now Benny Morris has a unique vantage point on this issue on the one hand he is an Israeli Jew and in recent years she has become a major defender of Israel against Global condemnation on the other hand she's probably done more than almost anyone you could name to discover and publicize Israel's historical war crimes he refused to serve in the occupied West Bank and was arrested as a result his academic work on Israel is cited favorably by people like Noam Chomsky who were all the way on the other side of the issue and he was at one point shunned by the Israeli academic Community for being in essence a traitor to his people he's one of the few people who can really claim to have battle scars from both sides of this debate so I thought he'd be a good person to help me weave through the complexities of the topic I have a lot of admiration for Benny Morris and I hope you find him as Illuminating as I did so without further Ado Dr Benny Morris [Music] Dr Benny Morris thanks so much for coming on my show my pleasure so before we get into your work on the history of the Zionist Arab conflict or the israel-palestine conflict I want to get a little bit of information on who you are so my audience can get to know you if they don't you're someone who has been identified in the past as left-wing and shunned by the Israeli Academy for uncovering many of the war crimes against Palestinians and uh and if I have this right you also refuse to serve in occupied territories and were arrested as a result and uh but you know more recently you've also been called right wing and uh criticized for you know defending some of Israel's more controversial actions so my first question is is kind of a two-part question how did you come to be a historian and how do you identify politically I'm not too sure how I became a historian as a youth I like to read books about history um and when I went to University that was an obvious choice studying history and also philosophy here they do two majors usually um and that just went on from there to do after being a PhD in history because that's what I felt comfortable doing and afterwards I started writing books that's basically what happened and what was the second part of the question and how do you identify politically or how have you identified politically throughout your life I think I've always been on the left the I believe in you know liberal democratic values and um and I've always voted for left-wing parties left center-left parties um and even though some people have accused me of becoming a right winger um I've I've never been a right-winger but I did find fault after I I did find full time with the behavior of the Palestinians and if you do that you're immediately branded the a right-winger by some circles Okay so I want the first part of this conversation to serve as a basically a summary of the history of the conflict for people that may you know may not know all that much about how the whole thing started so if you're deeply knowledgeable about this this may just all be sort of boring refresher but I kind of want to get some of those basic facts on the table and uh there's no one better to do that within you so let's start at 1880. who was living in the the place we now call Israel and how many were there and what was the political entity they were living under well in 1880 or 1881 or two in Zionism began um the land of Israel or Palestine as it was called by by most Christians um was part of the Turkish Empire the ottoman Turkish Empire and they was inhabited the area between more or less the Jordan River and the Mediterranean it was inhabited by something um like 500 000 um Arabs and the 20 30 000 Jews most of the Arabs 90 of the Arabs were Muslims about 10 of them were Christians so it's often said that in ottoman times Jews and Arabs lived in harmony to what extent is that true well it's probably it's a half truth um Jews lived as a subordinate religious minority in the Muslim empire and as long as they accepted their subordination um there was no trouble um when Jews began to assert assert themselves this is when Muslims resented it and this caused Strife eventually but but um Christians and Jews lived as a subordinate subjugated minority in an Empire run by Muslims largely inhabited by Muslims in which Muslims were if you like full citizens if you can call that or at least full subjects of the Empire whereas Jews were a tolerated a minority as Christians were so how did Zionism begin well there's two levels to understanding its Origins one level is that the Jews who had lived in what is called Palestine in the land of Israel two and three thousand years ago and had a sovereign state here under King David King Solomon eventually The Maccabees um were dispersed or dispersed during the first and second centuries under Roman rule they rebelled against the Romans twice and the Romans they expelled some of them and then gradually other Jews drifted away from Palestine moved to other areas North Africa eventually Europe and the the land was emptied of Jews the Jews always in their religion in their faith in their prayers a repeated this sentence next year in Jerusalem in other words they always wanted in some way to return to Palestine and to re-establish sovereignty in the land of Israel as they had once had so this is one level of the origins if you like the spiritual level over two thousand years of Exile of a Zionism or the wish to return to Palestine what prompted in Zionism to emerge as a modern political force at the end of the 19th century was essentially Chris Christian anti-Semitism it will programs large-scale massacres of Jews in the Russian Empire the tsarist Russian Empire in in the 1880s beginning in the 1880s there had been waves of programs before that but the Jews weren't ready for a political movement but in the 1880s with a background of rising political movements nationalist movements in Europe the German nationalism Italian nationalism Serbian nationalism without his background when the pogrom struck in Eastern Europe in in a Russian World Eastern Europe a Jews began to flee most of them fled to America two million moved to a 2 million Jews moved from the Russian Empire to the United States um between 1880 A1 and the 1914 but a small minority of Jews in the Russian Empire under the impact of this anti-Semitism and if you like the impact of of rising nationalism the idea of nationalism said why don't we go instead of rushing to America why don't we go to Palestine the land of Israel the land of our fourth fathers and re-establish a sovereign Jewish State there where we can be protected where we can defend ourselves where we can be safe and this was the beginning of Zionism in the 1880s slowly the Jews began to trickle what were called zionists to he's began to trickle to Palestine establish settlements there by land first established settlements and um began to flourish as a a an Enterprise a political Enterprise inside the Ottoman Empire in the area called a Palestine the land of Israel foreign so what happened when the Ottoman Empire dissolved how did that change Dynamics in uh in Palestine well the Ottoman Empire being a Muslim empire wasn't particularly friendly towards the zionists but it was extremely corrupt and you could actually buy a way into things you could buy the right to buy land to right establish a settlement and so on but the the Ottomans because of corruption and inefficiency didn't really curtail the the emergence of Zionism and slowly the the Zionist Enterprise Grew From uh by the 1914 there were about 80 000 Jews in Palestine in a world war one broke out and uh it pitted the number of powers against each other including Britain and the Ottoman Empire they fought the two empires fought against each other and the British won they eventually conquered Palestine towards the end of World War One um and then um essentially throughout the Turks throughout the Ottoman Empire and so Palestine came under British governance and the Zionist Enterprise which had been supported by the British government um it's a bit queer how the British government came to support Zionism but it did by the end of world war one and a so the Zionist Enterprise flourished under this umbrella of British rule from 1917-18 onwards so can you describe the relationship between Jewish communities and which were growing somewhat rapidly and the Arab communities during this time was it getting worse can you describe a little bit of what what was actually happening well the Jews were a very small minority both in 1882 and by 1914 and World War one they were very small minority in Palestine about a tenth of the population of Palestine by the more or less the end of world war one so the Arabs did not feel particularly threatened and there were economic relations between them the Arabs grew certain crops the Jews bought their produce the Jews sold the Arab certain things helped them in fact in some ways even develop a certain branches of the economy um but um by the end of World War One nationalism had also struck the Arab world and and the Arabs began to think also in terms of nationhood to come out from under the ottoman Turkish dominance and eventually to to try and free themselves also from the Western Powers would won the war and took over the Arab lands either directly or indirectly um and the Jews were perceived as agents or at least as um [Music] being chaperoned by the British Empire and this was resented by the Arabs who as I say wanted to free themselves from the British and didn't like this foreign Infidel entry into the the country of Palestine which they regarded as an Arab area even though they'd never it hadn't been dominant politically in the area for hundreds of years but they regarded it as an Infidel intrusion into an area which was Arab and by 1920 it began to be Arab riots a hostility if you like it towards the Zionist Enterprise which as I say um a burgeon under the British government um so let's fast forward 15 or 20 years to the peel commission what was the peel commission and how did Arabs and Jews react to it okay the the British ruled Palestine and had this large Arab um a population here and the small Jewish but growing Jewish Zionist population hoped that they could somehow get the two ethnic groups over whom they ruled to reach some sort of Moses vivendi some sort of compromise between them the Jews said we want to State the Palestinians said the Arabs of Palestine they weren't yet called Palestinians but Arabs who lived in Palestine said we we believe that the whole of Palestine belongs to us and the Arabs launched their bouts of hostilities against the the zionists and in 1936 they um rebelled um against the British presence and against the the their Zionist Wards 1936 the beginning of What's called the Arab Revolt which lasted for three years until 1939. during this a rebellion the British tried to find the formula to end the rebellion and to somehow and not unite but find them a way to get the Arabs and Jews to live side by side um in Palestine and so they what they did what governments used to do still do they when they have a problem they establish a commission or committee to find a way out um and um so they set up a committee a commission called the the Royal commission for Palestine called the peel commission uh named after the head of the commission which arrived in Palestine at the end of 1936 a met Jewish and Arab leaders met the Arab leaders outside Palestine as well talked to British officials and in July 1937 the appeal commission submitted its a recommendations about you know in a well-documented 400 page a volume it um reported what what it saw what it found what it brought the history of the country was and made recommendations about how to solve the problem here and the appeal commission said essentially the British cannot continue to rule Palestine there's no way of Bridging the Gap between Arab nationalist demands for all of Palestine and the designers demands um for a Jewish state in Palestine or even of all of Palestine what they said then was um in trying to um they said British Britain must leave um the the Jews and the Arabs should divide the countries should partition the country between them the Arabs receiving a majority of the territory most of the territory about 80 percent the British should try and retain Jerusalem and Bethlehem and the corridor to the Sea and and the Jews should receive something less than 20 percent of the country in other words partition between Jews and Arabs um the Arabs rejected a a flatly rejected the appeal Commission in a proposal recommendation for a partition with the establishment of a Jewish and Arab State and said all of the country should be ours the Jews said okay we don't like only 17 or 18 or 20 percent of the country but we accept the principle of partition probably we can't have all of it the British is saying we can't have all of it so let's agree to a small Jewish State um alongside an Arab um majority State and um as I said the Arabs rejected this and the [Music] um rebellion was resumed by the Arabs 1939 that the British managed to crush crush the Rebellion but the appeal commission had established a basic premise for a solution to the conflict in Palestine by laying out the idea of a two-state solution an Arab State alongside a Jewish State and this remains if you like in the west and in most civilized countries it Remains the formula the basic idea for a solution to the Palestine Israel problem a partition of the land between the two peoples who inhabit the land um but as I said uh the Arabs resumed the Revolt the British crushed the revolt and then World War II broke out which sort of caused the six years suspension of treatment of the problem of Palestine until World War One finished in 1945. so let's move to 1946 and 47. now World War II is over and the British have the wherewithal to you know look at their crumbling Empire and get out of places like Palestine and also India which was partitioned at the same time um how's the what was the new Partition plan and how was that decision arrived at well the British at the end of World War what a tour exhausted by by the war Itself by their um loss of blood and treasure in the war um and also were the rising nationalist movements as you mentioned in India and other places including in Palestine um a forced them essentially to look at Palestine and say what can we do and they saw that there was no Bridge as the peel commission had seen there's no way of Bridging the Gap between the Jewish and Arab claims and the Jews had begun in fact to Rebel or some of the Jews the right wing of the Jewish the Zionist movement rebelled against the British started throwing bombs killing British soldiers in Palestine in um and so the British decided 19 early 1947 to Simply throw in the towel give up and leave Palestine and hand the problem of Palestine to the United Nations which was a successor organization to the um League of Nations which had approved in the early 1920s of British rule over Palestine um so the the British handed over the the problem uh saying we're going to leave you take care of the problem you find the solution to the United Nations the United Nations established another commission a new committee to look at the problem afresh this was called the United Nations special commission committee on Palestine unscop and unscop came up with its own solution for a pro for the problem of Palestine um in the summer of 1947. they're a proposal was based in principle on the peel commission proposal of the the partition of the country in the two states one Jewish the other Arab um the Arabs again rejected this proposal the United Nations General Assembly meeting in November 1947 approved the proposal of partitioning Palestine into two states one Arab and one Jewish the Jews accepted the proposal the Arabs rejected it and the Arabs went to war against the Jewish State and against if you like the will of the International Community as embodied in their partition proposal approved by the general assembly so when the Palestinian the 1948 War yes so so the UN approves the partition which gives them both a state this time the state for the Jews is larger than it was in the peel commission 10 years prior um it's it's closer to 50 50 but what were the exact what was the exact split of the land okay the United Nations General Assembly approved essentially approved unscop's recommendation of dividing the country into two states the Jews were allotted in the United Nations partition resolution 55 percent of the country in the Arabs were allotted something close to 45 percent of the country the area of the Jews the 55 percent increase was half of it at least more than half was Desert it was the Negev Desert the southern part the uninhabited part of Palestine the Arabs got most of the center and north of the country in this partition resolution the Arabs of course as I said rejected it but also they said why are we two-thirds of the population of the country being given only 45 percent of the country whereas the Jews only one-third of the population of Palestine were being allotted in over 50 percent the Jews counted as I said we're being given a large part of it is Desert and essentially we're being given land for all the Jews who still want to come to Palestine and don't forget this is after the second world war it's where six million Jews had just been murdered in Europe and there were hundreds of thousands of survivors Jewish survivors of the Holocaust who wanted to reach Palestine or at least the Zionist movement wanted them to reach Palestine so the the Jews said well we need a little more land than our proportion of the population justifies because we need room to resettle all these poor uh survivors of the a holocaust and other Jews and and so that that was the The Proposal the United Nations agreed on this was if you like the will the understanding of the uh um a community of the world's community of Nations as embodied in this proposal and part of the logic behind that that was compelling to the International Community was that there are many many Arab states like there are many states that an an ethnic Arab could go to if he were in trouble and uh yeah there was no Jewish State and it seemed like the the pogroms in Eastern Europe and the Holocaust you know had there been one Jewish state in the world there would have been somewhere for refugees to go to and it seemed like just nowhere on Earth was hospitable to the Jews now in in retrospect as an American when you see a thriving Jewish Community uh you know in New York and in LA and many other places you can Wonder well why didn't they just come to America so can you can you uh address that question yeah I I said originally that one of the major impetuses of Zionism the emergence of Zionism was a the anti-Semitism which the Jews suffered in their lands of dispersion mostly in Europe at the time um this was reinforced the sense of alienation and a a lack of security of the Jews was reinforced during World War II and the revelations of what had happened in World War II meaning the Holocaust in other words six million Jews had been killed the world Community had done nothing to save them and the Jews at last said well this is this is a has been our argument for 50 years the Zionist movement for 50 years why we need a state where we can be safe nobody's going to come and save us we we have to have our own state which can protect us and and the world Community essentially bowed its head and said yes we understand now we understand your argument and that's why the major reasoning behind the United Nations voting most most of the countries agreed this this is what the Jews must have this is if you like in some way compensation for or for the guilty conscience for what we didn't do um during World War II in Saving we didn't save the Jews so now we at least must give them a state the Arabs of course argued at the same time why should we the Arabs pay for um what uh Europeans have done to the Jews over the last hundred years or even the last two thousand years um the Jews as as you rightly point out um said well but you Arabs have some over a dozen states today in fact there are 23 Arab states um you have lots of territory uh in which you are sovereign we Jews want just this little sliver of land along the Mediterranean which used to be our state two thousand years ago that's all we want for our safety and for our sovereignty um Arabs never accepted this argument thank you was there any religious component to wanting that land specifically on the part of the zionists yeah look the Zionist movement was essentially a rebellion again the world of the Jews which was a religious World they basically turned their backs on the the world of their fathers and the religion of their fathers was a very secular movement not the religious movement it was an anti-religious movement essentially Zionism which said we cannot trust God to save us we must do our work maybe God doesn't exist maybe he does exist but we have to do um you know get safety on our own through establishing a Jewish State um but there was always a small minority of zionists who were also religious a very small minority today it's a very large minority of zionists of the Jews in the state of Israel who are religious but this wasn't the case in 1948 in 1948 the religious component among the Jews was probably about 10 percent today as I say it's probably closer to 30 percent but at the time it wasn't religion which was driving the Zionist movement even though there was a religious component in the sense if you like even among the secular Jews that the history of of their people of the Jewish people was connected in some way to God and and God having if you like planted the Jews in the land of Israel um under Abraham and his successors so there was a sort of a connection between religion and a political a life a political interests if you like but but in 1948 when the zionists established the state of Israel in the midst of the 1948 War um a religion wasn't very important on the Zionist side which is one reason incidentally the Jews the the Jews who led the country bengurian Etc all the Socialists who governed the country did not even use the word God in the Declaration of Independence of Israel unlike if you like the American Declaration of Independence hmm so but let me add let me add one other thing but on the Arab side religion I think was very important in 1948 as it has been throughout the conflict since then in the sense that the Jews were an Infidel people that the Jews are not God's chosen people we Arabs we Muslims are the chosen people and their our Prophet is the real prophet and and He commands us if you like to fight against the infidels trying to take over this Muslim tract of territory which is Ours by right that's how the Arab Muslims felt in 48 and many of them feel it they feel the same way today so when uh when the Palestinians attacked uh you know rejecting the U.N partition and then the Jews won that essentially Civil War and then five Arab Nations subsequently attacked every surrounding Nation plus Iraq um uh what were their goals in attacking Israel is Israel's goals in the 48th war was essentially to defend itself in other words the Zionist Enterprise was being attacked by the Palestinian Arab militias and subsequently by invading Arab states Jordan Syria Iraq and Egypt um they were being the the Enterprise was being assaulted and then when they declared statehood the the Jews in on the 14th of May 1948 the following day the Arab armies Invaders from outside and the Jews in both state stages of door their main aim was survival that is the survival of the Zionist Enterprise of the community which had time numbered 650 000 Jews all together in Palestine and the survival of the new state which had just been created this was the main Jewish shame to this I would say that in the course of the war a two additional War aims accrued um a one was um to expand the area of the Jewish State beyond the territory allotted in the United Nations partition resolution um if the United Nations had allotted 55 percent of Palestine to the Jews by the war by War's end 78 percent of Palestine was in Jewish Hands by the time the Jews won the 48th work um and and the Jews and the bengurion also I think essentially there's arguments among the Israeli historians about this the first part is not controversial the second part is more is controversial and the Jews uh the leadership under bengurion I think also sought to reduce the number of Arabs in the Jewish State knowing that the Arabs were fighting against the the Jewish state would not be loyal citizens when they are if and when they remained in the Jewish State he wanted to reduce the number if you like by expulsion um and the number of Arabs in the area which became the state of Israel was vastly reduced about 700 000 Arabs in um were uprooted from their homes they fled in face of battle a few were expelled a few you ordered by their own side to leave the country the area under Jewish sovereignty but then the 700 000 Arabs were uprooted from their homes in the course of the war and these became the Palestinian Arab refugees the Palestinian Arab Refugee problem on the Arab side the war aims are not as clear as I say the Jews main aim was survival simply the survival of the population the Jewish population in Palestine and survival of the state as it was born the Arab borings are not as clear we don't have Arab documentation the Arab archives still remain completely closed to all researchers so we don't know what that government the the Arabian presidents the Arab military commanders Etc what their War aims were um but um one can sort of divine their War aims from the way their armies moved into Palestine and from various declarations they made publicly and in face of in Western diplomats who talked to the Arab leaders so one would say that the Egyptians uh they have some various War aims different Arab governments the Egyptians said they're entering the country invading the country in order to save the Palestinians um [Music] that's part of the explanation and probably isn't part correct as well but I think the Egyptians essentially wanted to take over part of Palestine and Annex it to themselves the southern part of Palestine uh the negative desert they wanted essentially to take for themselves and vaguely they hoped well maybe our Invasion will lead to the the destruction of the Jewish State um so they probably had that at the back of their minds as well destroyed the Jewish State as part of the war aim the same applies more or less to the syrians they also had some territorial Ambitions in Palestine um the Iraqis didn't but they decided they went along with with the program of the jordanians and the Egyptians and syrians in sent an expeditionary Force the fight in Palestine during the war the jordanians were a bit different the jordanians under Abdullah King Abdullah who's incidentally the the great grandfather of the present Abdullah Abdullah was second of Jordan they essentially preferred it sounds a bit strange but Abdullah king of Jordan in 1948 preferred to have a Jewish State as his neighbor instead of a Palestinian State he didn't like the Palestinians he didn't trust the Palestinian leader khajamina hussaini um and so he probably he essentially reached an agreement with the Zionist leadership a secret agreement before the going into the war he did enter the war against the zionists but with a a separate agreement in his pocket which said let's share the land between us instead of a Palestinian Arab State alongside a Jewish State let's have the the Palestinian areas under Jordanian sovereignty so his army essentially entered a Palestine and took over occupied the West Bank you know the area of East Jerusalem and the enablus and the februon um um and a next it to Jordan this was essentially their warring to take a chunk of Palestine for them for themselves if you like expand the the area of the kingdom of Jordan and not so much to attack the Jews in fact they never actually attacked the territory earmarked by the United Nations for Jewish sovereignty um so if you like me like I could sum up the the Arab borings in some way apart from Jordan the Arab states were would would have been happy to see the end the destruction of the Jewish state of Israel when they invaded But I think some of them the leaders were realistic and understood this is not going to be achieved maybe we can get a little bit of territory um for ourselves um um an exit for our own countries the south of the country by Egypt the north of the country by a Syria and so on um in part also the Arab leaders were driven by their own public in other words the public a hearing in in propaganda and the radios and so on that the Palestinians were being beaten by the Israelis in a a the public sort of surged uh into the streets and um um onto the gates of the Palaces where the Arab Kings and leaders lived and sort of forced the leaders to invade Palestine even though the leaders such as King Farouk of Egypt knew that the Israelis were too strong and couldn't be beaten but they couldn't resist their own public which wanted their armies to invade so this was also if you like one of the forces of the Arab invasion of of Palestine fear by the leadership which wasn't very legitimate they were Kings Not Elected leaders they feared their own public um that if they didn't do didn't join the invasion they themselves might be ousted by popular Uprising in their own countries so in the in the process of winning the independence War as you noted Israel expelled uh countless Palestinians from their homes who fled to Arab countries fled to the West Bank which was then occupied by Jordan um and and various other places and the expulsion of of Palestinians from their homes is one of the central grievances to this day against the Israeli State and it's something that you've played a big role in uncovering elements of in the archives which were sealed for a very long time obviously Israel's leaders had a strategic reason to not show the full extent of what was done to to Palestinians but you've also very controversially defended the the expulsion so can you talk about a little bit about how it could be possible that an expulsion of innocent civilians could possibly be justified how do you think about this issue as a historian and uh and ethically foreign expulsion is completely accurate in describing how the Palestinians were uprooted in 48. um a large number of the most of them simply fled their homes in the face of battle and moved to the West Bank or to Lebanon or to Syria or to the Gaza Strip in the face of battle they didn't want to didn't want to be killed by shells Israeli shells Jordanian shells they wanted to move out of Harm's Way some of them a certain portion were actually expelled by Israeli troops from their homes and a similar number probably were also advised or ordered by their own leaders to leave to leave their homes on the assumption that they would return to their homes When The War ended a the expansive part of 48 in terms of Israel's behavior isn't so much the acts of expulsion during the war as Israel's unwillingness at the end of the war to allow the Palestinian refugees to return and the Israelis didn't allow the Palestinian refugees to return at the end of the war the Israelis were six the Jews in Israel a numbered 650 000 in 1948. the Arab refugees were 700 000 had the Jews allowed the Arab refugees to return to their homes in what became the state of Israel at the end of 40 the 48 War they would have been outnumbered by Arabs who were against their state so it's not a matter of justification that the the the the the the the demographics of the situation were such that Israel couldn't have survived with a majority of Arabs as its new citizens as opposed to a minority of Jews in the country but they one mustn't forget that the Jews didn't begin the war the Jews were attacked by the Palestinian Arab militias and then attacked the second time by the Arab states the Jews in defending themselves it's like a man who's in the house and his neighbors come and try and kill him and he throws the throws the the the the killer out of his house that's essentially what happened to the Palestinians you can say that it's unethical that they should have allowed them to stay in the house that they should have allowed them to return to the house but essentially they were defending themselves this is the the if you like it in a sense of justification for the uprooting of the Palestinians they began the war they have to suffer the consequences the Palestinians afterwards said well why should we suffer the consequences okay we tried to throw you out to destroy your Jewish state to destroy your Zionist Enterprise but we didn't succeed okay now we want to come back to our our homes in Palestine and maybe even try and subvert the state from within with the majority of Arabs being in a country which is democratic we would overthrow the Jewish state from within um so the the zionists ever since 1940 have said that is the Israeli government all Israeli governments right-wing left wing have said we can't allow a mass Return of the refugees because this will subvert our state from within they will be not necessarily loyal probably disloyal citizens and they oppose our very existence here why should we allow them back we can't do that so uh let me add something yeah sure there's a problem here in terms of individual Arabs who became refugees one can certainly understand the desire and the ethical thrust of the desire of Arabs who left the country you call them innocent victims well some of them were innocent some of them were less Innocent but the desire of families to return to their homes and lands in Palestine but the problem isn't an individual problem ethical problem it's a national political problem in which as I said if a large number of Palestinian refugees had returned in 48 or 49 or subsequently today incidentally there are six million Palestinian refugees on the United Nations rules um this would mean the end of the Jewish state it would seize being a Jewish state it would become an Arab majority state in other words a 24th Arab state in the world I think the world has sufficient a sufficient number of Arab states 23 is quite a quite a lot in fact it's more than most peoples have hmm so this is a next one is a question from an acquaintance of mine who is an Arab uh Arab Israeli he um you recently co- published a study about uh additional details about the poisoning of the water supply of Palestinians in 1948. can you tell us what you found I I recently published with a um a friend and a fellow scholar Benny kedar an article about in this the Israeli campaign during the 1948 a two poison Wells poison to a pollute Wells with bacteria in in Palestine as part of the war effort against the Palestinian Arab militias and against the invading Arab armies the idea was that if you conquer an Arab Village and you don't want the militias or the the inhabitants to return to that Village If You Poison the Well the the the village as well it will they won't be able to retake or re-re settle in that area and if you poison Wells along the Arab armies a lines of Advance into Palestine through the Gaza Strip or through the West Bank into Israel um if you poison the wells along the Arabs root of March uh you will um create an impediment to the Arab advance and slow down if you like or harm the Arab military the war effort this was behind a this campaign in known as cast eye bread that was the code name of The Campaign which was mounted by the Israeli um military from April um 1948 onwards just as Israel was Facing The pan-arab Invasion The Invasion by the Arab armies um a lot of Israelis at the time had a it was a very secret campaign but um myself found the documentation in the Israeli archives of the the the um development the course of this campaign how it came about they took the who gave the orders how it worked in a in effect it had very little influence apparently on the war itself very little influence on the Arab armies even if that was intended um affected very few villagers and probably had caused very few casualties as far as we can tell from the documentation and a few people died an acre the town of acre but that seems to have been more or less the fatalities caused by this campaign um but we discovered the documents and thought that this is another part of the the history of the 1948 War various Scholars or journalists had written about this but based on rumors based on speculations we found the documents and outlined what exactly had happened so I can't help but as an Americans think of the analogy to our founding and the controversies and the moral controversies around our founding obviously to begin there is the the decimation of the Native American population most of which occurred because of disease but certainly some of which occurred through just through violence and Westward Expansion being being pushed violently toward the west so that settlers could uh form settlements and then there's obviously the issue of slavery and which we often call our original sin as a country um you know at some level you know people people critique these elements of our founding no one really thinks that that they they constitute a total invalidation of America's right to exist as a country in part because they are so far far back in the past but also because it's just totally impractical that America would unwind itself to to apologize for its uh the ugliness that occurred at its Origins but this brings me basically to the question of you know globally if you look at all of the developed nations in the world all of Israel's peer nations in Europe and in the developed nations in Asia America Canada Australia Etc how would you rate Israel's founding on the moral dimension in The Wider landscape of Nations that all of which have some skeletons in the closet would you say it was better than average worse than average roughly average Etc I think it was probably better than average on balance same um if we're talking about what happened in 1948 um more recent behavior in the Israeli occupation in the territories it's a different question but when in terms of the origin of what happened um look the the Israelis the the Jewish community in Palestine was attacked by their Palestinian Arab neighbors and then by the Arab states as Israel was founded the Israelis fought back Israel suffered um one percent of its population killed by the Arabs in the 1948 War that's more or less if you if it had happened to America today if the America lost one percent of its population in an attack by Outsiders that would have meant would have meant 30 30 million Americans were killed in um do I have that right no one percent would be three million Americans killed no yeah three million Americans yes three million yeah yeah that that's quite a large a percent uh you know casualties so a Israel felt it was attacked it had the right to uh repel the Invaders and at the same time to uproot or not allow back um the Palestinian Arabs when you think in terms of actual atrocities apart from expulsion which I don't think is an atrocity but but in terms of the uh chillings and massacres and rapes uh it was very very little of this in the 1948 War I know we all people always talk about Israeli massacres there were also Arab massacres of Israelis during the 1948 War um in fact the first big Massacre occurred when Arabs killed their fellow their co-workers in the Haifa oil refinery in December 1947 but all together all in all Israelis a killed deliberately massacred a something like 800 Arabs in the course of this year-long war which was forced upon them which they they didn't begin the Arabs began it so when you think about the number 800 killed Arabs killed all told in massacres by Israeli troops over a one year long War this is really very very small a very small number of across a very small atrocity or very small number of atrocities the same applies instead of the rapes there were probably a dozen cases of rape in the 48 War as Israel occupied hundreds of Arab Villages and towns if you compare this state to what happened in Yugoslavia in one or two days in Yugoslavia in the 1990s um a serbs killed Saturn 7 000 people in two days in bruniza is 800 killed by Jews in massacres of Arabs in 1948 is a very very small number and as I said there were also Arab massacres of Jews in which several hundred Jews died also in the course of the 48 War so if you wanted me to put give it a a Mark I would say when you if you want to compare it to the the mass murder of Indians by Americans in a in the the drive Westward over the centuries in America's founding or a other aim a country's a treatment of them their enemies um in the years and of their Foundation uh the Israeli uh behaviors are actually pretty good that's my my I know that a lot of people won't like to hear this but when you look at the actual numbers and figures and what happened um Israel's Behavior I think was very good this doesn't mean that I now condone certain Israeli policies and behaviors today there's something else I'm talking about 1948. yeah we'll get to that we'll get to today in a second let's just fast forward and go maybe a little more quickly through the history since 1967. let's actually just fast forward to 1967. what were the motives of the Arab countries that invaded in during The Six Day War what did they want well The Six Day War was caused by mistakes in halations it wasn't an intended War neither by Israel nor by the Arabs um the Egyptian leader a colonel Nasser was flexing his muscles and hoped to re-militarize the cyanide peninsula which had been demilitarized after Israel's withdrew from Sinai in 1957 um and he went further than that not only did he put his troops into the Sinai Peninsula but he closed a an international Waterway the states of the states of The Straits of Kiran and the Suez Canal to Israeli shipping these were acts of War and the Israelis had to mobilize they didn't know if the Egyptians were going to attack or not attack but they had to mobilize to confront the possible assault by the Egyptian Army and then the the generals came to the the government and said we can't maintain the situation of total mobilization and forever it's economically impossible and politically impossible the Egyptians have broken international law and they're forcing us to go to war on the Israeli Prime Minister reluctantly he's told the generals okay attack and so the Egyptian Israelis preempted and attacked the Egyptian Army in Sinai then the jordanians and syrians of their own um bad attacked the Israelis on the Eastern side by on the Israel's Eastern Frontier Israel pleaded with Jordan not to enter the war not to shoot we won't do anything to you we won't attack the West Bank or Jordan in the West Bank for East Jerusalem if you stop shooting the jordanians wouldn't listen and eventually Israel conquered the West Bank in response to the Jordanian attack and that's what happened in The Six Day War so Israel took the Sinai Peninsula the West Bank East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights um um the Israeli government it's not well known but the Israeli government a few days after the war ended in which Israel had one of a wonderful Victory if you like it is really secretly essentially decided that they would give back the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt and the gulan heights to Syria in exchange for a demilitarization of these areas and a peace treaty with these countries and the countries were unwilling to make peace with Israel the Israelis were unwilling because of internal divisions in the inside Israel were unwilling to give back the West Bank and East Jerusalem to Jordan I think this is a terrible mistake but that's what Israel did and they held on to the West Bank which was the origin of course of the present occupation which has lasted ever since 1967. so let's talk a little bit about how the settlements began my understanding from your book righteous victims is that the settlements in the West Bank began almost immediately after the occupation what were the motives of the settlers and were they shared by Israeli leadership well it's it's a complicated question what happened was that within days of Israel's conquest of the West Bank Israeli right-wingers pressured the government to establish Israeli settlements in the West Bank in areas where there had been Jewish settlements before the 1948 War which were destroyed by their jordanians when they took over the West Bank in 1948 the children of the settlers of 348 settlements said well we want to go back to where our fathers had established settlements in the etcion block for example just south of Jerusalem and the Israeli government because it was divided between right-wingers left Wingers centrists couldn't decide and the settlers were basically given their head and they went ahead and if you like settled the places on their own initiative and then the government sort of went along with them and supplied supplied them with their electricity um military protection and so on and eventually a more and more settlements were established so behind the settlement Drive was a if you like an historic a religious uh impetus because the area of the West Bank was um the heartland of the Jewish state of King David and the the the the Jews of two and three thousand years ago places like um in Bethlehem and Shiloh is Sebastian Samaria and so on these were the heartland of the Jews two or three thousand years ago and the East Jerusalem of course and the settlers said well we want to return we want these areas which were our original you know Crucible of the Jewish people we want them to be in Jewish hands um to remain in Jewish hands um alongside that was a the government had a strategic a political considerations were to do to do with the highlands that is the highlands of the West Bank were seen as strategic and the the generals basically said Israel's border should be along the Jordan River in other words east of the West Bank um that's a natural Frontier the Jordan River so there was a sort of a political strategic um motive for settling in the West Bank and holding on to the West Bank in addition to this spiritual historical reason for settling there by the settlers and the the religious right so you also say that especially starting in the late 70s there was a somewhat concerted effort to make life harder for the Palestinians the many Palestinians living in the West Bank in subtle and not so subtle ways to basically encourage them to leave of their own volition uh do you think that that that attitude remains today or do you or or has that changed well the the government didn't want a most of the ministers in the government would have been happy to see the backs of the Palestinians in others to see the Palestinians leave the West Bank but they weren't a going to expel them they they understood that what had happened to the Arabs in what became the state of Israel in 48 couldn't be repeated in the modern world and they maybe they also would have regarded it as immoral but they were willing to make life not pleasant or unpleasant for the Palestinians um to a certain degree and this probably impelled some Palestinians to leave but not very many in other words the the life which same the the way they lived in the West Bank was essentially Live and Let Live the Israeli Army said you don't you don't carry out terrorist attacks against us we won't touch you you can go ahead and live your life but it was a military Administration uh there were a mass arrests when there was demonstrations there was clampdowns there were curfews when there was trouble it wasn't a pleasant life for the Palestinians but they those who um kept their nose out of trouble uh were basically left alone this is essentially what happened and economically they were allowed to prosper and did Prosper Palestinians over the decades since 1967 lived much better lives than they'd lived before 67. hey they prospered if you like alongside the growing prosperity of the Israeli State as well um and and that's that's what happened but as more and more Israelis settled in the territories they began to constrict the living space of the Palestinians in the West Bank itself in a and the the settlers themselves began to make life a difficult if not the Army the settlers began to make life difficult for the Palestinian inhabitants so so you've you've also written that the Palestinian nationalist cause was more or less dead between 1949 and the Warren in 1967 and that Israel's victory in the Six Day War and their subsequent occupation of the West Bank and Gaza reignited the Palestinian nationalist cause and and brought it back from the dead do you think there is anything that Israel could have done in the aftermath of 67 that would have kept the Palestinian nationalist cause dormant yeah I think I think Israel made a terrible mistake in the 67 War they had no choice but to conquer the West Bank and East Jerusalem from which the jordanians were shooting at the Jews who lived in Jerusalem in Tel Aviv suburbs and they had no choice but to conquer the West Bank and the East Jerusalem um but I think in retrospect what Israel should have done was conquer the West Bank beat the Jordanian Army and immediately Retreat to Israel to Simply have abandoned the territory which they just conquered and let the jordanians come back and Rule there had that happened um in the Palestinians it possibly might have um not demanded statehood because they were would have been living again under Arab Muslim Rule and they wouldn't have had the great impetus to to um reach their own statehood and sovereignty over themselves which is what they had following Israel's um a occupation of the West Bank in here the Palestinians were then being ruled by a non-muslims non-arabs by Jews which as you say reignited the Palestinian national nationalist cause and Israel withdrawn immediately let the jordanians back in history might have been different okay so I want to move from the the history of the conflict to the present and the present the present ethics of the conflict uh and I guess I'll begin with this question of the power imbalance between the two sides obviously this power most of the time we've been talking about there wasn't such a large difference between Israel and her enemies I mean like if you count all of the Arab the five Arab states surrounding it and Israel's Army in 48 or 67 or 73. Israel was nothing was never sure it was going to win all any of those conflicts definitely not in 48 and 73 and and and so but today we have a very different situation we have a situation where Israel is one of the most powerful militaries in the world it's backed by America it has no you know none of its neighbors I guess we can talk about Iran later but none of none of its historic enemies can hold a candle to its military um and and so when Israel has an exchange with Hamas or Hezbollah Hamas sends Rockets into Israeli Villages Israel retaliates and what what we've seen is there's often a a ratio of casualties on both sides where Israel is killing more people than uh than Palestinians are right even if Palestinians are beginning the attacks when Israel retaliates you see a three to one a five to one in any given case might be a ten to one ratio of fatalities and many people see this and they say listen Israel is the bully of the situation Israel's the bully the Palestinians are being bullied end of analysis so what do you have to say to someone that sees the situation that way the the David and David and Goliath um image um pertains here um but on two levels Israel which has a population of about seven or maybe today eight million Jews seven or eight million Jews is surrounded by an Arab world of a hundred million or more 200 million God knows how many uh Arabs there are in the 23 Arab states and the whole Muslim World Behind These Arab states supporting these Arab states so in in that sense Israel is the weaker partner in this conflict there's an Israeli Arab conflict even if the government some Arab governments have made peace with Israel the governments of Egypt and Jordan have made peace and now there's a countries in the gulf and Morocco who have made their peace with Israel but the Arab public the Arab world still opposes Israel's existence it hasn't came resigned itself to Israel's existence um and they given the chance so Israelis feel might again gang up on Israel and destroy to try and destroy it so it's true Israel has a large army a strong Army it has probably Atomic weapons so they say um but it still feels surrounded by a large hostile Arab world which doesn't actually want it to exist on the other hand there's an Israeli a a David and Goliath um image between Israel and the Palestinians that is the Palestinians are a small fraction of the Arab world and here is an imbalance with which Israel is 5 10 100 times stronger than its Palestinian neighbors who happen to also be under Israeli or military occupation at least in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip they're at least surrounded by Israel it's not under physical occupation um so whenever there's a clash between Israel and the Palestinians as you rightly say there's always far more Arab casualties than our Israeli casualties because the Israelis are that much stronger they have Rockets which can shoot down the Arab rockets and they have tanks and guns and whatever which they can overpower the Palestinians Israel doesn't really use much force it always fights against the Palestinians when there is an eruption vis-a-vis for example the Gaza Strip Israel fights with its hand behind hands tied behind his back a because it doesn't want to cause such disproportion in casualties which can only ignite more hatred but nonetheless the clashes end up with Israel killing more Palestinians than our Israeli did so this is the reality but but Israelis have to think in both terms they have to think in terms of us vis-a-vis the Palestinians and US surrounded in this area by 100 million Muslims who don't really want us to exist here and might one day gang up on us perhaps with the help of Iran in the future as well another Muslim state so in the in the West Bank um no as you say after the 67 War Israel was mostly happy to Live and Let Let Live unless there was a terrorist threat but that had that situation has evolved very much uh partly because of uh the reaction to the intifadas and now there is a you know a system of checkpoints and a lack of freedom of movement for Palestinians in the West Bank and Military courts that have uh extremely high conviction rates and reports of you know Collective punishment of violence you know punishing someone's cousin because they did something wrong and you know obviously this is the stuff of military occupations at one level you know there's rarely a nice military occupation uh historically speaking on the other hand this occupation has lasted 55 years where most occupations last you know a few years or you know five or ten at the most and because of how long this one has lasted people have labeled it labeled Israel as an apartheid state so I'm curious what do you make of the designation of Israel as an apartheid state well Israel has seven million uh Jewish citizens and 1.5 or 1.7 million Arab citizens Israel's Arab citizens have full rights they vote they have knesset members they have even occasionally a member of the in the cabinet they have Supreme Court Justices a a Israeli Arabs enjoy full essentially full full rights compared to Israeli Jews so in this sense there's no apartheid Israel isn't an apartheid state Arabs can move freely they were limited in their ability to move and where they worked for the first decade or so of Israel's existence but from the 1960s on they lived as equal citizens inside Israel the problem is that there is a occupation of the West Bank and in the West Bank a Arabs do not have rights they're not enfranchised they don't have the vote they're not citizens they have as you they suffer from roadblocks from curfews if there's terrorism a collective punishment exists there were times when a suspects were tortured by the Israelis security authorities maybe still are um um it was a military occupation it's not apartheid because in South Africa the population the small white minority population ruled over disenfranchised inhabitants of South Africa not a military occupation but these were the inhabitants simply weren't given rights Israeli Arabs are given rights but um in the territories which are considered a occupied um and are occupied the Arabs have no rights and this is a terrible situation the problem is Israel since 67 has essentially been caught in a terrible dilemma those Israelis who would like to give up the occupation and get out of the West Bank and maybe even also East Jerusalem um are constrained by the problem of security if you leave if Israel leaves the West Bank the Arabs in the West Bank will probably vote for Hamas into power and the Hamas the extremist a fundamentalist Muslim organization will start shooting Rockets into Israel from the west bank and then what do you do you reoccupy the West Bank um the Hamas might inviting a foreign armies to come in and base themselves for instance Iranian troops in the West Bank what do you do do you reoccupy the place so that's the Dilemma you leave the West Bank which you want to do because you don't want to occupy another people you don't want to Lord it over on other people but on the other hand your Security will be mortally endangered if you leave the territory and this has been essentially the Israeli dilemma of those who want to leave now our Israelis don't want to leave the West Bank they want to continue to rule rule over the the people who are the Palestinians who live there and to um settle more and more of the land in the West Bank and turn it into Jewish a a land um but but um so they don't maybe care about this dilemma but they also understand that there is a security dilemma as well you know they understand that if the territory is handed over to a Palestinian control and the Hamas as they did when they had elections wins take control over the territory it will it threatens Israel's existence it's a terrible dilemma but I don't think the word of apartheid applies it's not it's not it's not the situation hmm so the Israeli public has moved to the right rather significantly over the past 20 years and the recent government is the the most right-wing government in its history and some some are calling it racist and fascist or at least some elements of the government why has the public turned to the right I know there are many causes but in your view what are the causes there's two two main causes why Israel has drifted the Jewish population of Israel has drifted rightwards one is continued Arab in transitions that is the Arabs the essentially the Palestinian Arabs have been unwilling to reach a territorial compromise prime minister in the year 2000 offered the Palestinians with the support of President Clinton offered them a two-state solution have a state in the West Bank part of Jerusalem or large part of Jerusalem in your hands as your capital A that'll be your state we'll have Israel here and the Palestinian leadership under Arafat rejected the the this a compromise and the continued rejection by Arab leaders including the Palestinian leader today Abbas the rejection of this two-state idea as a basis for a compromise has forced Israelis many Israeli is to say well we have no partner so we have no choice but to continue in this occupation and basically to vote right the other reason which is probably even more significant is the demography in Israel of the Jewish population a religious right-wing um Jews have more children than secular a liberal left-wing Israelis they simply have more children a secular Israelis have between two and three children per family religious families in Israel who are essentially right-wing have five six seven eight children per family and over the years because Israel is a democracy maybe this is unfortunate but it is a democracy they have more and more voters each successive election and by by the year 2022 now they simply have more votes than a secular a liberal or left-wing Israelis and that's why Israel is drifted because of this demographic imbalance between a secular and religious and right-wing Israelis and it seems to me that this problem of demography is huge and it it makes a two-state solution less and less likely with each passing year obviously you know two-state solution has been unlikely from the start I think primarily because uh Palestinians don't want it or Palestinian leadership doesn't want it or the Palestinian leaders who do want it would be killed by the terrorists who don't that's the primary I think impediment right if one side doesn't want the thing then then how do you how do you get that but on the Israeli side with each passing year as the religious right-wing minority just grows at a you know seven to two birth rate over over the rest it seems like it just becomes you know you know I'm looking at 2050 if there were a kind of Palestinian Sadat to arise like someone that really could convincingly say that he wanted peace would it would it matter at that point would it be too late have the opportunities been permanently missed because of how demography is likely to change in the future I think you're right and unfortunately I agree with you I think that Israel's drift to the right is a permanent situation and it's only going to get worse with more and more right-wing voters receiving the vote um [Music] um and in addition to that the continued growth of the settlement uh Enterprise in the West Bank makes less and less territory in the West Bank available for a Palestinian Arab state to emerge um but on the other hand I think that the Palestinian leadership still haven't agreed to the principle of a Juris state next to a Palestinian State they reject reject that so sorry um so so I think from both ends the likelihood of a two-state solution a compromise based on two states a has grown unlikely and is going to grow even more unlikely as the decades um progress so if that's true if a two-state solution is just receding further and further into the rear view mirror um what what is the whys and just policy towards the occupation I mean I could picture someone just saying listen I know Israel cannot just leave the West Bank look what happened when Israel left Gaza it probably life became worse for the gazans in in the long run and it also became worse for Israelis living on the border with Gaza so who benefited other than Hamas from from the the retreat at some level that argument makes sense to me and it could just be doubly true with the West Bank because it's so much larger um but is there is there a a way is the proper view that the occupation should just become less uh less Draconian is there a way to make the occupation in other words is everything Israel is doing in the occupation in the West Bank is it all justifiable in the name of security or is there excess I'm sure there's excess I think excess is probably built into the idea of a military occupation military rule is excessive by Nature it's it's it's I don't know about Draconian but certainly based on force and often brutal this is this is what happens in in military occupation but I don't see it getting any better I can see there might be Israeli leaders who would try and make it less brutal but they on the ground the troops will react as they will react to terrorism they will have curfews they will have a collective punishments they will shoot a at Target same justifiably or sometimes unjustifiably and kill people who are actually innocent this happens in occupations among troops who feel threatened by terrorists and that's how they regard the Arabs who shooted them um I I don't see I don't see any way of making the occupation any less suppressive any less oppressive um the occupation has to end but how you end it when you have a population here which doesn't want to end it in Israel and in the Arab population which doesn't want to accept Israel's existence um I I don't know how you get out of it I just see more of the same in the coming decades so there's one argument that people on the Palestinian side or sometimes on the BDS side of this conflict make so you look at Hamas you look at how Hamas prosecutes their war against Israel they shoot Rockets from High civilian areas hospitals uh school buildings so that when Israel retaliates against the militants they can't help but also kill women and children essentially which is just unacceptable to watch from the point of the International Community but they intentionally do this you know and they when they send Rockets they you know most of the Rockets are sending out or they're sending out Villages right they're sending out Villages full of women and children rather than military targets so these are the tactics of terrorism these are not the tactics of a just War and and yet some people you know some people are tempted to not necessarily defend this but one argument goes that the reason Hamas uses tactics of Terror is because they don't have a state you know if they have if they had a state they would liberalize someone they would they would not you know part of of the ruthlessness of how how they operate is a function of their statelessness and their current status and shouldn't be used as an argument not to give them a state what do you make of that argument uh as a historian who studied Hamas and their views it's a problem look you're right they're not a state they don't have an Air Force they don't have a military with tanks and artillery they can't fight Israel on the the same playing field same level of the playing field they they have to they have to use a terrorism or certainly rocketry and so on if they want to harm Israel um on the other hand though Hamas happens to be a Fundamentalist terrorist organization it's not it's it's also a political party but it's a terrorist organization it believes in Israel's destruction this is one of the principles it's most important principle in a its Charter and its founding if you like the Declaration of Independence they want to destroy Israel that's what they say uh this is an Infidel State uh they hate Jews it's an anti-semitic organization that in its Charter it blames the Jews for igniting World War One World War II and establishing the United Nations if this all sounds like nonsense but but that's the way they see the Jews and that's the way they see the state of Israel which is the Jewish State um and this organization uh clearly aims at Israel's destruction in addition to Turning of course all of Palestine into a fundamentalist Muslim entity um and this is a problem it's not a it's not an organization which is going to reform itself or become moderate this is not something anybody who understands from us uh will will expect to anticipate do you think that Netanyahu wants really wants a two-state solution with security assured I don't know I have no idea hey look he comes from a right-wing family he has writing views he's also an opportunist and occasionally pragmatic he's also somebody who's tried to avoid Wars um he knows it Wars never end the way you want them to end um but on the other hand he's the right winger so I I don't know what he wants he says he's paid lip service to the idea of a two-state solution but I think he understands it's not something which is going to happen and therefore he is no longer pressing it so the philosopher Sam Harris I remember in his engagements on the Israel topic years ago uh made a point which seems ethically important to me which is what would each side do if it could do whatever it wants or there's another way of framing the ex this point as a kind of thought experiment say there were you know a pill that just was administered to all Israelis such that for some reason the whole IDF laid down its arms and just couldn't do anything right became essentially zombies right what would happen if this pill was administered to all of Israel and Hamas could have its way and then what would happen on the other hand if Palestinians were administered this pill and Israel and the IDF could have its way um I mean like so I you know I made this point earlier about the power imbalance between these two sides there also may be an intention imbalance like what what do both sides want if they could do if they could do whatever so how would you answer that question I have a feeling I fear that there's an asymmetry here I think if the IDF laid down its arms and the Hamas was allowed to do what it wanted it would simply kill all Israelis or at least subjugate them and turn them into Servants of the Islamic State but probably they would try and expel most and perhaps kill the rest um if the Hamas were to lay down their arms and the Israelis were allowed by the International Community to do what they wanted most Israelis probably wouldn't want to kill or drive out most of the Arabs but some Israelis might and that's how I put it but most Israelis were probably not not have the will the the desire the ability um to do this to the the willingness to do this but but so I think there's an a an asymmetry here in intentions or what would be the intentions were they given a free hand hmm so another question I wanted to ask you is about the notion of Aliyah which is basically the right of any Jewish person by some definition and sometimes there are proposals to change the definition and so forth but the right of any Jewish person somehow defined to immigrate to Israel and be granted more or less automatic citizenship that's a that's a policy that I mean it's it it makes a lot of sense in 1948 given that you know Jews are getting persecuted and killed anywhere in the world and the whole point of this state is that they can come here and they'll be safe uh in 2022 that's a policy that increasingly seems from the Western liberal eye to just be ethnic chauvinism without a clear security purpose right it seems like yes there's anti-Semitism anti-Semitism in America but there are not pogroms and there probably aren't going to be um so has like what do you make of Aliyah as a as a policy does it seem uh justifiable to you still or do you think it's it's it's backwards and should be jettisoned well I have a completely different take on this um I think that um a open-ended Aliyah in other words the opening of the borders to any Jew who wants to come here a is a mistake now Israel is overcrowded it's an overcrowded country the traffic jams here are terrible there's no place to live there's not enough room to build um Israel should end all immigration to Israel both of Jews and non-jews but essentially we're talking about Jews I think this is a terrible mistake to have continued this for so long in the past decades um that that's on one level on the other [Music] um this is the Jewish State and I can understand Jews um the Jewish leadership of the country wanting to allow any Jew who feels persecuted to come and live here and become automatically a citizen incidentally this writer as far as I remember exists also in some other countries like Germans going back to Germany or whatever are given automatic citizenship you know people of German origin I think the same might apply to Ireland as well I'm not sure about this um but the idea that the Jews anywhere have the ability to come here um for safety's sake should they feel persecuted or should they actually be persecuted somewhere there's nothing really wrong with that except as I say on the level of demographics is simply too many people here in this country should basically close its doors to anybody who's not actually under threat foreign so I want to ask one question about the the settlements today now this is an area where I you know the there's so much journalism uh you know politicized on both sides about what exactly is happening with with settlements in the West Bank it can be hard to discern exactly what's true many people many journalists say that uh you know Palestinians are getting kicked out of their homes um and and the the you know settlers are violently attacking them in some cases um people on the other side will say you know something like 90 something percent of the settlement expansion you hear about is actually upward expansion on already existing settlements rather than horizontal expansion that's displacing Palestinians what is your perception of what is true currently um and how do you view the ethics of settlement expansion well I've always been against the settlement Enterprise I think it's counterproductive it's not going to get What It Wants in other words the idea of the settlements uh was to assure Israel's security and for those who want to expand Israel down to the Jordan River to expand Israel's borders I don't think both things are realistic any longer um on the other hand the settlers the settlements are expanding both horizontally and vertically and a lot of settlers are right-wing Fanatics not a lot some of the settlers are right-wing Fanatics and they are violent towards their Palestinian neighbors cut down olive trees attack Palestinian Olive Pickers this is a not a controversial matter for dispute this is what is happening in the in the on the ground in various areas of the West Bank um um the settlements are a terrible impediment to peace this is has been true ever since there the Enterprise began if you were a young Israeli today would you would you also refuse to serve in the occupied territory would you do that again probably yeah okay my final question for you uh I want to end on a optimistic note but it may or may not be an optimistic note depending how you answer it you know say it's the year 2100 probably both you and I will not be alive um and there is peace between Israel and Palestinians reverse engineer this for me what is the plausible path what was done in the intervening 80 years that uh that made this unlikely piece possible well I as I mentioned before I think what Israel did in 67 after winning the war was a mistake they should have immediately withdrawn from the West Bank and allowed the jordanians to reoccupy and rule the West Bank this might have made a historic difference in the evolution of the conflict since 67. beyond that I'm not sure there are people who've criticized Israel's leadership in 48 myself included for not being generous a post 48 and 49 for example and not being generous enough um in offering concessions to the Arabs in order to make peace but in hindsight I think that the 49 in 1949 nothing really could have changed because the Arabs weren't ready after they're humiliating defeat in the war to make peace with the Jewish state so nothing could have really changed I think um I don't know what else could have been done but in 67 that was the point in which something different could have been done and changed the course of history my question though is sort of asking you to speculate about an optimistic future this is uh obviously I'm not optimistic about the future I don't see the point in speculating about it because I don't see anything good Happening Here in the future fair enough so before I let you go can you tell my audience where to find your work which which books of yours you would remember you know recommend as an entry point to your work and where they can follow you well um I don't know I think I think my book righteous victims which you can get easily in Amazon righteous victims is a history of the Israeli Arab conflict I think it's a fairly reasonable balanced history of what happened here since 1881 until the year 2000 but essentially most of the conflict yeah I think that's a a reasonably good book and I think my book on 1948 which is called 1948 about the most important of the Israeli Arab Wars a history of that war is also a reasonably good history of the war those two I think I would recommend okay Benny Morris thanks so much

regions in the world: Currently there are 4 failing states and 3
wars, with major powers increasingly taking opposite sides. Countless armed militias and terrorist groups
are spreading violence across borders. The region has seen conflict after conflict
going back well into the 20th century. But among all the uprisings, civil wars, and
insurgencies, two countries always seem to be involved: Saudi Arabia and Iran. They’re bitter rivals, and their feud is
the key to understanding conflicts in the Middle East. The Saudis and Iranians have never actually
declared war on each other. Instead, they fight indirectly by supporting
opposing sides in other countries and inciting conflicts. This is known as proxy warfare. And it’s had a devastating effect on the
region. Countries, especially poor ones, can’t function if there are larger countries pulling strings within their borders. Both the Saudis and the Iranians, see these civil wars as both tremendous threats, and also potentially enormous opportunities. The Saudi-Iranian rivalry has become a fight over influence, and the whole region is a battlefield. It’s why the rivalry is being called: a
Cold War. The most famous cold war was fought for 40 years between the United States and Soviet
Union. Looking forward to the day when their flag would fly over the entire world. They never declared war on each other, but clashed in proxy wars around the world. Each side supported dictators, rebel groups, and intervened in civil wars to contain the other. Like the US and Soviet Union, Saudi Arabia
and Iran are two powerful rivals - but instead of fighting for world dominance, they’re
fighting over control of the Middle East. In order to understand the Saudi-Iranian rivalry,
let’s go back to the origins of each country. In the early 1900s, the Arabian peninsula
was a patchwork of tribes under the control of the Ottoman Empire. After World War I, the empire collapsed, leaving these tribes to fight each other for power. One tribe from the interior, the al-Saud,
eventually conquered most of the peninsula. In 1932, they were recognized as the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia. 6 years later, massive oil reserves were discovered in Saudi Arabia, and, in an instant, the Saudi monarchy was rich. That oil money built roads and cities 
all around the desert country - and it helped forge an alliance with the US. On the eastern side of the Persian Gulf, another country was emerging, but having a much harder time. Iran also had massive oil reserves and an
even bigger Muslim population. But constant foreign intervention was creating chaos. Since the 18th century, Iran had been invaded
by the Russians and British twice. In 1953, the US secretly staged a coup, removing the popular prime minister, Mohammed Mosaddegh. In his place, they propped up a monarch, Reza Shah, who was aggressively reforming Iran into a secular, westernized country. But he harbored corruption and terrorized
the population with his secret police, the Savak. By the 1970s, both Saudi Arabia and Iran had oil-based economies and had governments heavily backed by the US, but the feelings among each population were very different: Ultimately at the end of the day, the
Shah of Iran, powerful as he was, simply did not have the same control over his people
or ultimately the same legitimacy and affection that the Saudi people felt towards their monarchy
at that point in time. That’s because Iran’s Muslims felt stifled
by the Shah’s reformations and by the end of the decade, they finally fought back. Iran's Islamic revolution overthrew a powerful regime, that boasted military might. It’s really in 1979, when Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic revolution overthrow the Shah, that the real tension
between Saudi Arabia and Iran begins. Ayatollah Khomeini was a Muslim clergyman,
who preached against Western-backed secular monarchies. He advocated for a government that popular, Islamic, and led by the clergy. And In 1979, he led a revolution to establish just that. It was a massive international event that
prompted reactions around the world especially in Saudi Arabia. The Iranian Revolution terrified the government
of Saudi Arabia. They were fearful that Ayatollah Khomeini would inspire their populations to rise up against them, exactly the way he had caused the Iranian population to rise up against the Shah. There was a religious threat too. Up until now, the Saudis had claimed to be
the leaders of the Muslim world. Largely because Islam’s two holiest sites,
Mecca and Medina are in Saudi Arabia. But Khomeini claimed his popular revolution
made Iran the legitimate Muslim state. There was another divide; Saudi Arabia’s
population is mostly Sunni, the majority sect of Islam, while Khomeini and Iran are mostly
Shia. Westerners always make a
mistake by drawing an analogy between the Sunni-Shia split and the Protestant-Catholic
split within Christianity. The Sunni-Shia split was never as violent. And in much of the Islamic world, when Sunnis and Shia were living in close proximity, they got along famously well. So, while the Sunni-Shia split was not a reason
for the rivalry, it was an important division. After the revolution, the Saudi’s fears
came to life when Iran began “exporting its revolution”. This CIA report from 1980 details how the
Iranian started helping groups, mostly Shia, trying to overthrow governments in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Saudi Arabia. And they prompted the Saudis to redouble their efforts, to fight against Iran. They bolstered their alliance with the US
and formed the GCC, an alliance with other gulf monarchies. The stage was set for conflict. War in the gulf. Iraq invaded Iran in seven areas. With a 5:1 superiority, Iraqi forces moved quickly The rise of Iran as a regional power threatened other neighboring countries as well. In September 1980, Iraq, under the rule of
dictator Saddam Hussein, invaded Iran. He was hoping to stop the Iranian revolution,
gain power, and annex some of Iran’s oil reserves. But they didn’t get far. The war bogged down into stalemate complete
with trench warfare, chemical weapons and heavy civilian casualties. When Iran started winning, the Saudis panicked,
and came to Iraq’s rescue. They provided money, weapons, and logistical
help. So it becomes critical to the Saudis that
they build up Iraq, and build it up into a wall that can hold back the Iranian torrent that
they have unleashed. The Saudi help allowed Iraq to fight until
1988. By then, nearly a million people had died. Iranians largely blamed the Saudis for the
war and the feud escalated. Fast forward 15 years and Iraq again became
the scene of a proxy war. In 2003 the US invaded Iraq and overthrew Saddam Hussein. Neither Saudi Arabia or Iran wanted this to
happen, since Iraq had been acting as a buffer between them. But problems arose when the US struggled to
replace Saddam. The United States has no idea what it is doing in Iraq after 2003. And it makes one mistake after another, that creates a security vacuum, and a failed state, and drives Iraq into all-out civil war. Without a government, armed militias took
control of Iraq, splintering the population. Sunni and Shia militias suddenly sprang up
all over the country. Many were radical Islamist groups who saw
an opportunity to gain power amidst the chaos. These militias were readymade proxies for
Saudi Arabia and Iran, and they both seized the opportunity to try and gain power. The Saudis started sending money and weapons
to the Sunni militias, and Iran; the Shia. Iraq was suddenly a proxy war with Saudi Arabia
and Iran supporting opposing sides. That trend continued into the Arab Spring,
a series of anti-monarchy, pro-democracy protests that swept through the Middle East in 2011. This had very different consequences for Saudi
Arabia and Iran: That is terrifying to the Saudis who are the ultimate status quo power. They want the region stable, and they don't want anbody rising up and overthrowing a sclerotic, autocratic government, for fear that it might inspire their own people to do the same. The Iranians are the ultimate anti-status quo power, they have been trying for decades to overturn the regional order. Each country threw their weight behind different
groups, all over the Middle East. Just like in Iraq, the Saudis began supporting
Sunni groups and governments while Iran helps Shia groups rise up against them. In Tunisia, the Saudi’s backed a dictator
while the Iranians stoked protests. In Bahrain, Iran supported Shia leaders seeking
to overthrow the government. Saudi Arabia, in turn, sent troops to help
quash the unrest. Both got involved in Libya, Lebanon and Morocco As Saudi Arabia and Iran put more and more
pressure on these countries… they began to collapse. Now the feud has gone a step further, with
both countries deploying their own militaries. In Yemen, the Saudi military is on the ground
helping the central government. They are fighting the rebels, called the Houthis,
who are an Iranian proxy group. The reverse is happening in Syria. The Iranian
military is fighting side by side with militias, some of them extremists groups like Hezbollah,
in support of dictator Bashar al-Assad. They are fighting rebel Sunni groups, who
are Saudi proxies. The more civil wars that broke out in the
Middle East, the more Saudi Arabia and Iran became involved. Neither the government of Saudi Arabia nor the government of Iran are looking for a fight. But the problem is these civil wars create
circumstances that no one could have predicted. Both the Iranians and the Saudis feel that their vital national interests, are threatened, are in jeopardy, because of different things happening in these civil
wars, things they blame each other for. Now the cold war is drawing in other countries. The Saudi government is threatening Qatar, a tiny Gulf state that was developing ties with Iran. Meanwhile in Syria and Iraq, the terrorist
group, ISIS is nearing defeat and both the Saudis and Iranians are angling to take control
of that territory. It’s a Cold war that's becoming incredibly
unpredictable. As the Middle East continues to destabilize,
its hard to say how far these countries will go."

To better understand its reasons and underlying issues, let's retrace the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on a map. We are in 1917, during WWI. The Central Powers were opposed to the so-called Triple Entente and its allies. Both sides suffer heavy losses and desperately seek additional support The then-British foreign affairs minister Arthur Balfour wrote an open letter promising a Jewish homeland in Palestine in return for support from the growing Zionist movement. Meanwhile the British tried to weaken the Ottoman Empire by supporting the Arab rebellion and promising them independence in liberated territories. At the end of the war, the Ottoman Empire
was defeated and its land carved up by European powers. The British give more
independence to Iraq and Transjordan It is in what remains of Palestine that
Britain wants to create a Jewish homeland where the Jewish community was a small minority. But immigration grows rapidly due to the tense situation in Europe. Especially in Germany where the anti-semitic Nazi Party came to power In September 1939, Germany invades Poland. Britain and France respond by declaring war, sparking the beginning of WWII In five years, the conflict claims more than 60 million lives including almost 6 million Jews targeted by the Holocaust. Following the war, Jewish immigration to Palestine grows, increasing tensions with Arabs. Overwhelmed by the situation, the British begin their withdrawal from the area. The UN takes over and proposes to divide the region into two states with Jerusalem being given a special status of an International zone. The proposal was accepted by Zionists but rejected by Palestinian Arabs, followed by a civil war between the two communities. The Arab League puts together a liberation army of several thousand volunteers who fight against the Zionists. For their part, the Jews organized an army by giving military training to its population and sending agents to Europe to retrieve WWII military stocks and sign arms contracts. On May 14th 1948, Britain completes its
withdrawal from Palestine, while the Jews proclaimed independence of the State of Israel. In response, the Arab League declares war. During the conflict, 2 truces would allow the Israeli army to strengthen its position and gradually take over. Finally, the Armistice Agreements were signed. Israel cedes new territory including Western Jerusalem. Egypt receives the Gaza Strip, and the West Bank was annexed from Transjordan to form Jordan. This conflict causes large-scale displacement. On the one hand, more than 700,000 Arabs were expelled or fled Israeli territory to refugee camps. On the other, Jewish communities in Arab countries, sometimes with a history of over two thousand years, are forced to take refuge in Israel or elsewhere in Europe. Eventually, many European Jews were reassured by the victory of Israel and choose to settle there. In 1967, following tensions with its neighbors, Israel declares war on Egypt, Jordan and Syria. In six days, Israel dominates the war and triples its territory by seizing the Egyptian Sinai, the Syrian Golan Heights and the West Bank. Israeli settlers begin to move into Palestinian territories. The UN reacts and adopts resolution 242 condemning the Israeli occupation. Six years later, Egypt and Syria launch a surprise attack to try a recover land. Initially, the Israeli army is routed and fails to repel the attack. Under the influence of the Cold War, the Soviet Union and Arab countries support the offensive, while the United States sends emergency
supplies of 22,000 tons of weaponry to Israel. With this boost, the Israeli army further continues to push its borders. After a ceasefire, oil-exporting Arab countries decide to punish the US and Israel's allies by increasing the price of oil by 70% and decreasing production by 5%. This causes the first oil crisis of 1973. Israel under international pressure ceded Sinai back to Egypt and a part of the Golan to Syria, but retains control over the Palestinian territories where colonization accelerates especially in East Jerusalem. In 1980, Israel proclaims Jerusalem as
its indivisible capital but this decision was condemned by the UN Security Council. In the West Bank, tension mounts over water supply as Israel has the upper hand on resources which are unevenly distributed between
Israeli settlements and Palestinian areas. In 1987, the Palestinian population rebels and takes to the streets, mostly armed with stones. This was the beginning of the first Intifada, an Arab term meaning uprising. In this context arises Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist movement fighting Israel. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, set up in 1964 by the Arab League and in
exile in Algiers, proclaims an independent state of Palestine on November 15th 1988. Jerusalem would be its capital and Palestine would progressively be recognized by 136 states. After six years of conflict, a fragile peace is signed with the Oslo agreements which provide for mutual recognition. It also lays the foundation of introducing autonomy in the Gaza Strip and the city of Jericho. In 1995, a West Bank partition plan was signed, providing for Palestine-controlled areas, mixed areas and the rest under Israeli control. But the two parties are unable to agree on thorny issues, such as a status of Jerusalem and the return of Palestinian refugees. Negotiations fail and violence reignites. In Jerusalem, a visit by the head of the Israeli opposition to the holy site of the Temple Mount triggers the second Intifada, marked by numerous suicide bombings. Israel begins construction of a wall in the West Bank to protect the country, but in doing so encroaches upon Palestinian territories. The wall is declared illegal by the International Court of Justice. To try to calm the situation, the Israeli government, in 2005, decided to remove Jewish settlements from the Gaza Strip. But retains control over its borders. In the years that follow, tensions focus
around the Gaza Strip, mainly against Hamas which came into power. Israel imposes a blockade in the region, while Hamas regularly fires rockets into
Israeli territories. Several clashes take place and violence by both sides builds up under 2014, when Israeli warplanes pound the area and destroy 50,000 houses, a hundred schools, dozens of hospitals and the region's only power plant. The population stuck in Gaza faced a humanitarian disaster. Today the situation remains complicated
and lasting peace is nowhere on the horizon. On one hand, the West Bank is divided up between Palestinian towns and villages and more than 150 Israeli colonies. So striking a deal to carve out a Palestinian homeland seems more complicated than ever. Then there is the status of Jerusalem, which both sides view as their capital. In 2018, the United States announced it would move their embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing the city as the capital of
Israel. This decision was condemned by the UN by a large majority, while the Palestinians announced that the United States no longer has a mediator role in the peace process which at present seems indefinitely stalled."

Today, we're going to focus on more recent events, and look specifically at the role groundwater plays in preventing a pathway to peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Groundwater makes up the largest portion of available fresh water on Earth, but as we'll see, access isn't always fair and its availability doesn't always line up neatly with political borders.

#CrashCourse #Geography #Groundwater",2021-08-30,124379,3614,78,UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q," When some of us think of the Middle East and North Africa, we might picture images of sand dunes stretching as far as the eye can see, or giant oil rigs pumping black gold from the ground.  But for the people who live here, the most critical resource is water. To some geographers, the map of the world’s precipitation is the most important map for understanding life on Earth, and nowhere is this more true than in the Middle East and North Africa -- or MENA -- which includes vast deserts like the Sahara. With maps of precipitation and available water on the Earth’s surface, we can think about why people are clustered where they are -- and the conflicts water can create. While controlling surface water -- like lakes and rivers -- gets a lot of attention, there’s an invisible source of water creating tensions and challenges too. In fact groundwater stored in the ground supplies nearly half the world’s drinking water. And in the Middle East and North Africa, an estimated 90% of freshwater – whether in rivers or underground aquifers -- crosses one or more international borders, involves multiple stakeholders and political conflicts, and is embedded in a complicated physical geography.  All of which make managing water -- especially
water we can’t see -- an extraordinary challenge. I’m Alizé Carrère, and this is Crash Course Geography. INTRO Over the last two episodes we’ve been exploring
water and the different ways we’re connected to it, and in this final water episode we
tell one more part of water’s story. Like rivers on the surface that unite and
divide us, whether we use groundwater to control others or choose to share can shape our path
to peace. In fact, only about 2.8% of all the water
on Earth is freshwater, or water that doesn’t contain a lot of salt that we can use for
drinking and growing things. All the other water on Earth is saltwater
in the oceans. Of that freshwater, over two-thirds of it
is locked up in ice sheets and glaciers, and a tiny amount is found in rivers and lakes. The rest lies beneath Earth’s surface. So groundwater makes up a little more than
half of a percent of all the water on Earth, yet it’s the largest potential source of
freshwater we’ve got in the entire hydrological cycle that moves water between the four Earth
systems. Looking at a map of groundwater use, we’d
see that’s not such a great thing for large parts of the Middle East and North Africa, which is the most water scarce region in the world.  Several countries have a groundwater stress
rate of more than 100 percent, which means we’re using up the groundwater resources
faster than they can be refilled or recharged. You see, groundwater is the part of the hydrosphere
stored within the lithosphere. But it’s still connected to the other spheres
on and above the surface. Precipitation that absorbs into the ground
before reaching a river can recharge aquifers and other underground reservoirs. So groundwater isn’t an independent source
of water, like we saw last time in Jakarta. And this connection between groundwater and
precipitation is specifically an issue because the Middle East and North Africa sits under
the subtropical high pressure belt. Which means very little rain falls and the main way we’d describe the climate is “arid,” or dry.  There can even be a moisture deficit, which
is when the amount of moisture that evaporates is more than returns as precipitation. When it does rain, any extra water that absorbs
into the ground moves through a zone of aeration where the rocks and soil aren’t fully saturated
and there’s both air and water. As gravity pulls it deeper, the water eventually
reaches the zone of saturation which is the layer where every space in the bedrock, regolith,
and soil are filled with water. We call the very top of the zone of saturation
the water table, and this sort of imaginary line can shift depending on where we are. The water table might be deeper or shallower
depending upon the physical characteristics of the region, the input from precipitation,
and the output into lakes, streams, and marshes, or during periods of drought. Like in the Middle East and North Africa,
precipitation patterns and rivers like the Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates guide where there’s
agriculture and where people settle. But life can also flourish in oases where
erosion has lowered the land surface, and a relatively high water table means the zone
of saturation is close to the surface. How much water can be absorbed in the zone
of saturation -- or its porosity -- and whether or not it’s permeable and lets water flow,
depends on the make-up of the soil and rock. That includes the mineral composition, how
the particles are arranged, their grain size, and what’s between them. In fact aquifers aren’t big pools of water beneath the surface. They’re really permeable rock masses that easily store groundwater and act as a water supply.  Like the groundwater that supplies those oases
is often recharged by rainfall entering other aquifers far outside the desert. The groundwater very slowly moves down and
horizontally through porous soil and rock in mountainous areas. In general, layers of sedimentary rock like
sandstone or limestone or deposits of sand and gravel are good aquifers because they’re
permeable and can hold a large amount of groundwater. But on the other hand, clay and shale beds are relatively impermeable and are called aquitards.  So though we can find groundwater at almost
every location on land that receives rainfall, the amount of precipitation, the rate of evaporation,
the character of the ground, the amount and type of vegetation, and the porosity and permeability
of soils and rocks make it a vastly unequal resource.  And where major water resources like aquifers
and rivers are actually distributed is complex, especially when they cross one or more international
borders. Take the Arab-Israeli conflict, which is the
ongoing political tensions and military conflicts between Arab nations and Israel and one of
the longest and most complex disputes in the world.  It’s often seen as a conflict over land,
but it’s also about life-giving water on and beneath the land. This includes the eastern Mediterranean region
often called the Levant where highly productive aquifers made of limestone and dolomite that
cross boundaries create some unique challenges. There’ve been many ancient civilizations
in this region, and some of the earliest references to water use, laws, and management can be
found in the Code of Hammurabi written in approximately 1780 BCE. But today we’ll focus on more recent events,
though for a more thorough history you can check out that episode from Crash Course World
History 2. The Six Day War between the countries we call
Israel, Egypt, Syria, and Jordan in 1967 rearranged not only the region’s political landscape,
but the water resource landscape -- particularly in favor of Israel. Among other land, Israel gained control of
the entire West Bank from Jordan, including sources of water vital to Jordan, Syria, Lebanon,
Palestine, and Israel. In particular, the Western Basin, the Northeastern
Basin, and the Eastern Basin which make up the West Bank’s aquifer system. Together these basins make up the Mountain
Aquifer, which is a shared Israeli-Palestinian groundwater resource that lies under both
Israel and what the United Nations calls the Occupied West Bank where many Palestinians
live. It’s replenished mostly by rain and snow
absorbing into the ground in the West Bank and flows north and west towards Israeli territory
in one direction and east towards the Jordan River in the other direction. The Mountain Aquifer is the largest and also
one of the most important groundwater resources for Israel and the sole remaining water resource
for the Palestinians. But since 1967 when Israel began occupying
the West Bank, strict water use policies have come into effect creating an inequitable system
in which Palestinians’ access to this shared resource is highly regulated and restricted. Under the interim Oslo II Accords of 1995,
Israel retains control of all water resources. They utilize 80 percent of the water from
the aquifers under the West Bank limiting Palestinians to 20 percent. This allows the average Israeli to use about
300 liters of water per day, while the average Palestinian in the West Bank uses an average
of 73 liters. For reference, the World Health Organization
says a minimum of 50 liters per person is needed for health and sanitary standards. And in all fairness, the average American
also uses over 300 liters per day. Palestinian water use continues to decline
as the Palestinian population grows, forcing households to spend as much as 20 to 39% of
their income buying water from Israel. Though that doesn’t include all the water
needed for agriculture or manufacturing. Palestinians of the Jordan River Valley have
traditionally been farmers and herders, but they’re currently unable to cultivate the
land. By contrast, the access to water in Israeli
settlements has allowed for high tech dairy farms, vineyards, and orchards. Similarly, the part of Palestine called the
Gaza Strip uses water drawn from the Coastal Aquifer located under the coastal plain of
Israel and the Gaza Strip. But this aquifer is polluted from over-extraction
and sewage infiltration, and it’s estimated that 95 percent of the water supply is not
fit for drinking. So as we saw in the American West, particularly
for Native Americans still fighting for their water rights, discriminatory water policies
and practices that restrict or deny people access to water ultimately block development
and lead to unemployment and poverty. Political leverage and control over water
like this is called hydropolitics, and it’s one of the most difficult problems preventing
a path to peace in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, which is part of the broader Arab-Israeli
conflict. Hydrological features like aquifers and watersheds
don’t often line up with political borders, and here in this part of the Middle East and
North Africa, that’s complicated even more by the fact that the political borders are
also contested. So without clear spatial boundaries, and with
multiple layers of human-environment interactions, water access and water stress is a huge obstacle
Palestinians face. Worldwide there are 366 aquifers that cross
boundaries, and the political, socio-economic, and cultural difficulties between countries
make sharing groundwater challenging. And aquifers are being pumped beyond their
recharge capacities or contaminated when water percolating through the soil carries pollutants
like fertilizers, pesticides, and feces and reaches an aquifer. Which has huge ramifications for food security. Groundwater is largely unseen, but it may
have the largest implications for all the ways freshwater intersects in our daily lives
– from the water we drink and clean with, to the hidden freshwater that we need to process
and produce a commodity. By measuring the commodity’s water footprint,
or even the groundwater footprint, we can see the amount of hidden water used. For example, beef cattle need 4650 liters
of water for us to produce a 300 gram steak. So when we eat high on the food chain, we’re
also drinking high on the “water chain” and placing enormous pressure on ecosystems,
agricultural systems, and the communities who live where the product is actually produced. But any solution that would lead to sustainable
groundwater use requires local and regional level cooperation -- which continues to be a massive hurdle not just in the Middle East and North Africa. Each aquifer has a different set of social,
economic and political frameworks guiding how we value groundwater and regulate it. As physical geographers we have just the right
skills to observe and understand the physical processes at work that create groundwater
and aquifers. We also have the tools to see how different
spaces and places fit together on different scales – from personal water consumption
to regional water sharing agreements. And human geography can help us understand
how shifts in power across the watershed and aquifer basin over water rights impacts the
cultural use of water -- which we’ll discuss more in the second half of the series. Next time we will see that water isn’t the
only resource that crosses boundaries and creates difficult geopolitical situations. The poles are thawing, changing spaces and
places on the entire globe. Many maps and borders represent modern geopolitical
divisions that have often been decided without the consultation, permission, or recognition
of the land's original inhabitants. Many geographical place names also don't reflect
the Indigenous or Aboriginal peoples languages. So we at Crash Course want to acknowledge
these peoples’ traditional and ongoing relationship with that land and all the physical and human
geographical elements of it. We encourage you to learn about the history
of the place you call home through resources like native-land.ca and by engaging with your
local Indigenous and Aboriginal nations through the websites and resources they provide. Thanks for watching this episode of Crash

91,kbPnF8Hvj0I,Americans in Jerusalem Are Helping Kick Out Palestinians,"What’s a guy from Virginia doing building a fence outside a Palestinian family’s house?

In exclusive footage obtained by AJ+, a group of Americans were filmed installing wiring and a fence around the land just outside the Salem family home in occupied East Jerusalem.

The incident happened just days after the family was served an eviction notice by settlers who are linked to U.S. charities.

In this report, we explore how the effort to displace the Salems has been decades in the making.

footage obtained by aj plus you're watching a group of americans build a fence outside one palestinian family's home in shaykh smile and they were hired to do it by the founder of a u.s registered charity where are you from why are you doing this understand what you are doing in the last decade u.s charities have funneled millions of dollars to settler groups and these donations are tax deductible meaning americans are effectively subsidizing settlement activity which is considered illegal under international law now palestinians are appealing to people in the us to stop funding their oppression [Applause] and that call is being answered as the families impacted wage a relentless battle to stay in their homes for now their fate remains undecided in this report for aj plus we explore the links between the settler movement in israel charitable giving in the u.s just one question rabbi please and the people who are participating in it what's a guy from virginia doing building a fence around a palestinian family's home [Music] this is a palestinian neighborhood in east jerusalem that was occupied by israel in 1967. it's against international law to push palestinians out of this area but that hasn't stopped settlers from using israeli courts to do just that you are stealing my house and if i don't steer that someone else is going to steal it no the viral video of the accord family confronting jacob the settler is a crude example of how an american from long island could be directly involved in efforts to remove people from their homes this is not your house yes but if i go you don't go back so what's the problem what are you yelling at me i didn't do this i didn't do this and he's not alone aj plus is following attempts to evict another family from and what we've found is a network of israeli settlers tied to charity donations from abroad and americans themselves who are connected to efforts to displace the salem family the salems have lived in this home for over 70 years 11 family members live under this roof and the head of the household fatima was born here [Music] is my home [Music] of the 200 families living in this neighborhood at least 93 are facing eviction according to the israeli ngo peace now [Music] hey in early december city council member and right-wing settler yonatan yosef and the deputy mayor of jerusalem arya king delivered an eviction notice to fatima arya king is a central figure in the settler movement he founded the israel land fund a group that advertises and facilitates property sales exclusively for jewish residents the israel land fund is dedicated to putting the land of israel back into jewish hands on its website which has since been updated you could find investing opportunities for quote ideology properties but instead of it's called the hebrew nakalat shimon in one listing it said plots were being squatted on by arabs who have built on them illegally or are renting in an interview with aj plus king was unapologetic about the israel and fund's mission benefits [Music] from 2011 to 2017 almost all of its donations were from the central fund of israel a new york-based non-profit and the israel land fund's director is this man ben packer a nationalist rabbi from virginia who also runs a youth hostel in jerusalem that's been called out for its ties to extremism just days after the salem family received its eviction notice ben packer and a group of young americans were caught on camera fencing off the land adjacent to the salem house what are you doing where are you from i'm israeli where are you from why are you doing this [Music] with the tacit support of israeli police the americans and israeli settlers installed wiring and a fence around the land just outside the family's home getting good pictures oh you're american and this is how israeli settlements begin nearly every government in the world thinks projects like this are illegal israel does not fatima sons pleaded with the police to recognize that this has been their family's home for generations 700 000 palestinian refugees who were violently forced from their homes during israel's creation in 1948. as the salem family resisted their efforts the american crew led by packer refused to stop building the fence the group's efforts were punctuated by moments where they played up to the camera and listened to music on their phones settler work relies on a wide range of government and civic support and americans coming to israel to participate in projects like this is just another part of that process a bystander in the crowd even tried to call them out yeah you come into somebody's neighborhood do you decide you're going to put up a fence on a piece of property that hasn't ever been fenced because you think it's yours this is this land isn't yours everybody knows this land is it yours how long have you guys been here how long have you been here well 12 years the cars look look at this guys so you you fenced in this territory because of the car it's a parking lot that belongs oh it belongs to you soon a key player in the settler movement shows up to the site it's arya king we were able to identify several of the americans who showed up to the salem family house aj plus reached out to them for comment none of them responded we also sent several requests to speak to ben packer but didn't hear back so when we learned that he was in the u.s to raise money we went looking for him we've just landed in charlotte north carolina because we've learned that rabbi ben packer is here giving a series of lectures so we're gonna see if we can find him and ask him some questions after waiting around for a few hours in a parking lot we spotted him hi rabbi packer hi hi i'm angie from aj plus hello hi i've been trying to reach out to you for an interview see if we could talk do you have a do you have a couple minutes now before you go in just answer a few questions just just one question rabbi please [Music] rabbi can i tell you that we've seen footage of you with the salem family property and we just want to know what's a guy from virginia doing building a fence around a palestinian family's home what was the purpose of the fence [Music] rabbi do you want to tell us who you were working on behalf of when you put the fence up the outspoken rabbi who in palestine screamed in the faces of the people trying to stop him was to us almost completely silent it's really unfortunate that we couldn't get any answers tonight back in shaykh the work to evict this family continues and it's happening because people like haim silverstein can use israel's legal system to forcibly remove palestinians a new jersey registered charity called keep jerusalem it's played a pivotal role in influencing policy and public opinion on issues of land ownership at the site he ignored the [Music] here's how this eviction is happening documents revealed here show that heim paid roughly one hundred thousand dollars to buy the land from the descendants of the jewish family who lived here before the arab israeli war in 1948. and this is key because jewish residents have a legal process to reclaim land palestinians do not he later transferred the property rights to another man who transferred it again to yonatan yosef remember yonatan is a member of the israel land fund who showed up with arya king to hand deliver fatima's eviction [Music] documents reviewed by aj plus confirm that haim and arya's operations have relied heavily on u.s charities and american tax deductible donations and arya deny using charity money to acquire land yanatan did not respond to our request for comment we reached out for interviews haim agreed it's now a secret that we see jerusalem as the eternal capital of the jewish people where did the money come from to make the purchase for lot 47 that's not for for disclosure publicly i don't think that's it would be right to share information about where funds came from to buy properties did you use funds from any of your charities to pay for that plot of land i never use any funds from any of our charities to to participate in land reclamation my charities the charities that i run are only educational we only do advocacy work i'm just trying to clear this up because it was my understanding that you're the person who bought the property you're listed as the trustee i was originally a trustee simply because the the investor at the time was not in the country to sign the contract and therefore i signed for him as a trustee but i did not buy it i did not did not use my own funds i simply at the time signed the contract temporarily until the the purchaser could take over the property legally the goal here is to let original owners or people that are sympathetic to the cause to to reclaim these properties back to the jewish people but the original owners aren't moving back in and as a result of his actions palestinian families are forced from their homes crimes charity has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the us and canada and its mission is to secure a jewish majority in jerusalem in presentations available online keep jerusalem says it's petitioned to demolish homes every settler organization has its own strategies but what unites them is the belief that jewish people have a biblically ordained right to the land at the expense of palestinians and in clear violation of international law and that's why activists from the defund racism coalition are calling on new york state to strip the charity status of pro-settler non-profits if you stand against the displacement of the palestinian people you have to stand for these organizations to have their 501c3 tax charitable status revoked people who donate to these charities can write it off their taxes so american taxpayers end up subsidizing it for them the fact that we pay for this the fact that our tax is funded and the fact that these zionist organizations run rampant all over our city opening up headquarters operating freely absolutely makes it our duty and responsibility to call them out and to say that we don't want our money kicking palestinian people out of their homes and we don't want our money building and expanding israeli settlement at least 10 of these charities have addresses in midtown manhattan and protesters marched along a route to point some of them out it's that building right over there so when we approach it i want us to be as loud as possible because i want them to hear us up [Music] new levels of provocation continue outside the salem home this time a far-right member of the knesset set up a makeshift office outside the family's home declaring quote we are the landlords seventy-year-old fatima was injured and later hospitalized during confrontations that followed still her palestinian neighbors remained defiant and prayed in front

BUT THE CONFLICT TODAY AS WE KNOW IT'S BEEN STIRRING FOR YEARS. WILL: LET'S GO OFF THE WALL ONCE MORE TO UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY AND HOW THIS STARTED SOME OF THE BACKGROUND BETWEEN THE STATE OF ISRAEL PALESTINIANS AND HOW IT ERUPTED AND WHILE WE COME AT THIS HUMBLY IT IS COMPLEX, AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT SETS OF FACTS. WE THINK HISTORIC CONTEXT CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON IN ISRAEL. PETE: YOU CAN SPEND GRADUATE SEMINAR COURSE ATTEMPTING TO BREAK THIS DOWN AND UNDERSTAND IT WE'RE GOING TO DO IT IN FIVE MINUTES AS BEST WE CAN. SO THE AREA KNOWN AS ISRAEL NOW -- WAS CONTROLLED BY THE EMPIRE 400 YEARS AND PART OF THAT AND THAT EMPIRE JOINED AND THAT LED TO DOWN FALL. THAT SOLIDIFIED DOWNFALL AND BEGUN TO FALL APART PRIOR TO WORLD WAR I AND OTTOMAN EMPIRE FROM AFRICA DOWN THROUGH THE MIDDLE EAST TURKEY AND IN INTO EUROPE. BUT AS PETE POINTED OUT FOLLOWING WORLD WAR I THIS STABILITY THAT WAS PROVIDED BY THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE DISINTEGRATED. WE PLACED BY A DIFFERENT FORM OF STABILITY BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT SHOWED INTEREST IN ESTABLISHING A JEWISH STATE. THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT CALLED THE BELL FOUR DLEARGS IN 1917 THAT LED TO BRITISH MANDATE. WHERE THERE WAS FLOURISHING AND YOU LOOK AT IMAGES OF JERUSALEM BACK THEN BUT CONFLICT LIKE WITH ROMANS THERE IN THE BIBLE BIBLICAL AREA AND IT DIDN'T -- THINKING AS THE NATION STATE BUT FOLLOWING WORLD WAR I BRITAIN THROUGH LEAGUE OF NATIONS GIVEN CONTROL OF THE AREA AND THEY BEGIN TO CARVE UP THE MAP. THEY BEGIN TO CREATE JORDAN AND SYRIA, AND THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE NATION STATE. PETE: I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE -- OF THE AGREEMENT BUT A LOT OF THE CONSTERNATION ACROSS MIDDLE EAST GOES BACK TO WINSTON CHURCHILL AND OTHERS THAT DREW STRAIGHT LINES ACROSS AREAS THAT LED TO NATION STATES THAT HAVE DIFFERENT GROUPS I THINK OF IRAQ WITH DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE YOU CERTAINLY SEE THAT IN ISRAEL. NOW, THERE WAS A VERY SMUL PERIOD A LOT OF ANTI-SEMITISM. REGIMES PREDICATED ON THE DESTRUCTION OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE. MOST SIGNIFICANTLY ADOLF HITLER AND NAZI JM AND HOLOCAUST LED TO DEATH OF 6 MILLION JEWS A LOT OF JEWS LEFT EUROPE AND CAME BACK TO ISRAEL. WILL: JEWS LEAVE EUROPE HEAD BACK TO ISRAEL THERE'S PALESTINIANS LIVING IN ISRAEL AND THUS BEGIN YOUR TENSIONS LET'S FOCUS ON THE GEOGRAPHY AND PETE HAS BEEN EXPLAINING CURRENT ENVIRONMENT BUT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A SCOPE OUT BUT STILL FOCUS ON ISRAEL. ISRAEL ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF NEW JERSEY. WEST TWO LARGE PALESTINIAN AREAS WEST BANK ALONG WEST BAKE OF THE JORDAN RIVER AND GAZA STRIP WHERE OUR FOCUS IS THIS MORNING AND THROUGHOUT THIS LATEST DISTINCT. PETE: A LOT OF FOCUS OF THE PAST HAS BEEN -- THE SO-CALLED WEST BANK OTHERS WILL CALL IT JUDEA AND HISTORIC HOME LAND OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE AS WELL SO WORDS ARE A BIG PARTED OF THIS COMPLICATION INSIDE THAT AS WELL SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT GAZA STRIP A LOT SMALL AREA, LOTS OF PEOPLE. YOU LOOK AT THE WEST -- THE WEST BANK, JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE THIS IS WHERE JERUSALEM IS AND YOU'VE GOT WEST JERUSALEM AND EAST AND A LOT OF RELIGIOUS SITES WERE CAPTURED IN 1967 WHICH WE'LL GET TO. BUT WHEN YOU THINK OF WEST BANK THERE'S A LOT OF SITES IN THIS LOCATION OF SIGNIFICANCE TO JEWS AND CHRISTIANS YOU'VE GOT THE TRADITIONAL BAPTISM AND BETHLEHEM. >> GOOD COMPARISON FOR THE WEST BANK TO CONCEPTIONIZE IS DELAWARE WITH A THIRD OF THE POPULATION ROUGHLY THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC SITE BUT QUICKLY TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT LOOK HOW SMALL GAZA STRIP IS FOR FOLKS 140 SQUARE MILES 2 MILLION POPULATION. PETE: COMPARE SIZES AND POPULATIONS ARE SIMILAR IT IS EXTREMELY DENSE. WILL: COMPLEXITY GETS WORSE IN MATERIALS OF THE TENSIONS OVER THE PAST 75 YEARS IN EXISTENCE OF ISRAEL. ISRAEL AS WE POINTED OUT AS JEWS BEGIN TO REMIGRATE BACK TO ISRAEL 1947 IS A MARKING POINT AFTER WORLD WAR II -- WHERE THERE'S THE FIRST ATTEMPT AND ULTIMATELY IS SUCCESSFUL IN CREATING THE STATE OF ISRAEL. >> ULTIMATELY SOON AFTER THERE WAS A WAR AND ISRAELI WAR EFFECT I-LY EGYPT YOU SEE JORDAN, THEY ALL COALESCE ON SAY NOTHING, WE DON'T WANT JEWS IN A STATE OF ISRAEL HERE. JORDAN BEING VERY SIGNIFICANT JORDAN MOVED UP TO JERUSALEM CONTROLLED MUCH OF THAT UNTIL 1967 SO DISPUTED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. AND HAS BEEN FOUGHT OVER IN THE MODERN SENSE OF THE NATION STATE SINCE 1947. THE U.S. BY THE WAY THE FIRST COUNTRY TO RECOGNIZE ISRAEL 11 MINUTES INTO THEIR EXISTENCE HARRY TRUMAN DID SO. WILL: THAT WAR FOLLOWED ESTABLISHES STATE OF ISRAEL IN 1948 AND PETE AS WE POINTED OUT WARS THROUGHOUT TIME BUT WITH LARGELY STATE ACTORS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT JORDAN, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EGYPT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SYRIA. THAT HAVE FLASHED UP SINCE THE 40s IN TWO MAIN POINTS 1967, SIX-DAY WAR WAS ONE OF THOSE AND, IN FACT, IS ONE OF THOSE MANY PEOPLE ARE POINTING BACK TO TODAY. AS A MARKING POINT OF HOW EXTREME WHAT WE'RE WATCHING TAKE PLACE TODAY IS. PETE: THAT WAS A REALLY, REALLY BIG ONE BECAUSE STATE OF ISRAEL A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT OKAY ENEMIES WANTED TO WIPE IT OFF ITS MAP. INSTEAD IT WENT ON COUNTEROFFENSIVE AND CAPTURED GAZA. CAPTURED JUDEA AND WEST BANK CAPTURED GOLAN HEIGHTS AND THEY WERE ON TEMPLE MOUND QUICKLY GAVE IT BACK. BUT ULTIMATELY THAT REDREW LINES ALLOWED ISRAEL THE OPPORTUNITY TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THE AREAS FOR THEIR OWN SECURITY. SOMETHING THAT CHANGED IN 2005 AND IS TO OUR DISCUSSION WHEN THEY GAVE THE GAZA STRIP TO PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY. >> YOU BROUGHT THAT UP BIBI NETANYAHU SAID THIS IS WAR. THAT WAR WORD HAD SPECIFIC MEANING NOT AN OPERATION. SPECIFICALLY A WAR, WHY? BECAUSE IT IS 50 YEARS SINCE A WAR. 1973, THE YOM KIPPUR WAR LAST TIME THAT TYPE OF LANGUAGE MIDNIGHTSET APPROACH HAS REALLY DEFINED THE PALESTINIAN AND ISRAELI CONFRONTATION. BUT AFTER SEEING 600 WE'RE RIGHT NOW BY THE WAY AT 600 CIVILIAN CHILDREN, WOMEN, GRANDMOTHERS DEAD -- AND THIS HAS BEEN DECLARED WAR. PETE: THIS BASICALLY SETTLED THE NATION STATE ASPECT OF THIS AND AFTER THAT YOU SAW UPRISINGS LED BY THE PLO LED BY HAMAS AND TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. TRYING TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS INSIDE THEIR REGIONS YOU SAW BUSES BLOWING UP INSIDE AND THAT'S WHY YOU SAW BORDER FENCES PUT UP ACROSS JERUSALEM AND GAZA AND OPERATIONS THAT LED TO DEATHS OF ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS. WILL: THAT BRINGS US TO TODAY TALKING ABOUT HORRIFIC NATURE OF IT BUT HISTORICAL NATURE OF THIS -- OF THIS -- CONFLICT IN TIME BETWEEN THESE TWO AND WHAT IT CAN MEAN FOR THE FUTURE. PETE: BY THE WAY I WANT TO POINT YOU TO FOX NATION TO BATTLE IN THE HOLY LAND ON FOX NATION I DID IT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. BUT IT IS A BREAKDOWN OF THE DYNAMIC POLITICAL CULTURAL RELIGIOUS THAT LED TO THIS MOMENT IN TIME ALSO BATTLE IN THE HOLY CITY SPECIFICALLY ABOUT JERUSALEM BUT WE GO TO OUTSIDE GAZA INTO WEST BANK IN"

96,cGZE6Yh0X6M,A Concise and Entire History of the Palestine Conflict,Mohammed Hijab interviews Abdullah al Andalusi on the history of Zionism in Palestine,2023-10-31,264396,11012,2295,UCHDFNoOk8WOXtHo8DIc8efQ," Alum how are you guys doing and welcome to another podcast where I'm with a very esteemed and very accomplished guest who is Abdullah lusi an individual now as a researcher for the I3 Institute and we're here in the I3 Hub in Canada where we've had events where we've spoken about the Palestine issue um first of all a quick one what do you make of the whole issue from the you're looking at this and your what's your assessment of it all okay um so the current situation in Gaza is a continuation of a very consistent Israeli historical policy of um of aggression uh expansion and settlement and so the because Israel was has always been consistently initiating Wars fighting uh putting using pressure tactics by maintaining even at times of Peace a lowlevel uh amount of military operations and police and security operations uh despite the fact they might agree to cease fires and this always inevitably antagonizes uh the Palestinians and others um to to uh retaliate um or to protest in some way or form and then this Israel used as a pretext to advance it its Territorial and strategic goals further okay well well I do want to delve a little bit into the historical analysis with you because I know that you've done a lot of research on that and before I do so I just want to make um it clear that the importance of this is actually on the information War that when say for example Pro Palestinian activists Muslims and others are making the case that they should be making a case using solid and sound argumentation and so what you're going to do hopefully today is not you're not going into elaborative detail but you're giving them a taster of some of the historical give the skeleton of what's happened historically if they're interested obviously they can go and do their own research so let's start with u i mean when when do you want to start when do you think is a good time to start historically I I think that first we need to make a very basic AR argument that I think Muslims need to know and anyone who advocates for for the Palestines needs to know which is this the Zionist narrative is that they own they're responding to attacks against themselves but they never explain and never can it be explained uh what is the motivation of the opponents they're claiming is that are attacking them because they'll say oh they just hate us or they want to wipe out um Israel's political entity or or kill Jews or Hamas or they'll say look uh the Hamas is a terrorist organization they're trying to it's all their fault but remember they always uh kind of explain the motivation as just this inexplicable evil but human beings don't work like that right human beings have um usually make rational choices depending on how how to achieve their objectives and their object objectives more or less when it comes to collectives um are what they would deem to be reasonable or attainable MH so if zionists arguing that Hamas or others are just want to wipe out all Jews from the face of the Earth or wipe out all Jews in Israel which is their narrative um how would that make sense by just firing a few Rockets or just doing um a one-way suicid or Raid into just neighboring um uh settlements and military bases that's not going to destroy Israel that's not going to harm its strategic or have no strategic effect actually on Israel so if that doesn't make sense which it doesn't we have to ask further question what's going on what's Happening that is not so reported on the scene that is making uh either the fat the or the palestin Authority or Hamas or the average Palestinian uh respond in with anger and and being upset or even responding um with either protests or violence because of course before 1987 there was no Hamas and in the West Bank there is no Hamas so um even now until this time so going into the historical analysis removes Hamas essentially from the assessment the analysis well I mean just this year there was a major Israeli Security operation uh that killed that killed tens of Palestinians in the West Bank and there was no Hamas there exactly right so we have to ask this question as to what's actually going on what is Israel actually doing to the Palestinians um which is not as report it's not reported and it's usually a day-to-day um just their normal experience of life for the Palestinians what's happened to them to make them react with such outbursts right so tell us some some quick facts in terms of historical facts of people might not even understand what is the beef going on here I mean who are the natives to the land of Israel um is it the Palestinian Arabs are they the Jews is a combination of both what's the beef about when did it start I'm not going to go all the way back into ancient history here let's keep it contemporary what would you say to this well the the argument from the Zionist narrative is um that the uh the ethnic group which they represent which which they're trying to they claim they represent they don't represented of course many Jews uh condemn a significant majorities condemn um Zionism but their argument is that Jews are not Invaders of Palestine or then and zionists not Invaders of Palestine because um Jews are natives of Palestine they were there uh 2,000 years ago they're just coming back home after 2,000 years okay so this this really is it's a side point but they use it as a justifying narrative so we have to discuss it of course so if we're just going to discuss it from a purely uh just a historical uh analysis um the oldest historical record which has some coroporation um in some parts not entirely but has some coroporation is the the the Torah the Tanakh um the Old Testament as Christians call it and if you look at that and you also look at archaeological evidence we see that the Israelites haven't always been there um the Israelites being the 12 tribes of Israel Judah is One Tribe of Israel which then was used to mean to call the Jews Jews um they invaded the land the the people that lived there were called Canaanites or the land was called Canan or Canaanites um with with the inhabitants and they were invaded and there was a kind of genocide of them uh by the invading Israelite tribes as reported in the Bible in the Old Testament right yeah yeah so if you're going to be historical just purely historical um the Israelites were Invaders of the land um approximately uh they said they say about roughly we historians think about 1200 BC and um they remained in the Land There was uh you know Wars with rival Empires and things and they were you know moved around and things like this um but at some point um after 70 uh ad or so as they say um or the commer CE y uh you know many Jews immigrated Al They Jews they immigrated actually before that I mean Rome is reported to have 50,000 Jews uh at least 100 years before well 50 to 100 years before the 70 CE uh they most economic migrants they were going for um you know better prospects in in Rome and so on and so forth so Jews left for various reasons like Jews would like people would leave for any reason you know uh better prospects what have you and of course you know it was it was a land that was in in a Crossroads so there was many walls and things it was very unstable place to be you made a really good point before when we did this uh this this segment I'm not sure if people remember but I do uh if you want more information we've done a reaction before on the Jordan Peterson discussion with Netanyahu yeah yeah and you made a very very good point which I remember which is that if you really count the years of let's say the Arab majority in that area versus the Jewish majority in that area you were saying it's more with the Arab majority okay so so basically why I mentioned the um the habitation of uh Jews who would L be called ashkanazi Jews so let's just call it say say EUR European Jews for short so ashkanazi Jews left that region um before there was uh an uprising by uh Jews against Roman occupation and so and they were there for even hundreds of years even after 70 CE the zionists always cite 70 CE as the time that Jews were kicked out without their will and consent that that's historically not true um there was no Mass kicking out there was there was further rebellions you can't have further rebellions in a place where there's no people to actually rise up you know so that's not true um and there was an expulsion though of course in 70 AD right uh no there was a capture of of many of many Jews who were part of the uprising and they were enslaved and sent to Rome but there were already Jews in Rome a significant proportion who were just m economic migrants not slaves yeah that that's the point and they were Jews there there was still significant majority of Jews residing in Palestine afterwards now here's the thing right so ashkanazi Jews um if you count the amount of so if you count if you take 7c as a basis what you'll find is that if you count the amount of time that Israelites have been in that land in total so up to that points let's say let's take 1200 12 1300 uh years yeah and the amount of time they've been out outside the land since 70 so let's say for Asi Jews they came they started to come in greater numbers in 1800s yeah so they've been outside the land for 1,800 years and they've only ever been inside the land in ancestrally speaking for 1300 years very interesting point so they they were Invaders In the first they were Invaders at the beginning yes and they okay let's say even if we even if we consider see they got kicked out which they didn't yes um the majority of them weren't kicked out but they've been living outside the land for longer than their their ancestors ever lived inside the land so how are they natives then yes CU now we have to go to what what is native what is being na indigenous to a land excellent so that's a really good background let's get to the Mona now because okay okay so so you know like Fast Forward um so the land has had many people in it um you know just want to make a point that DNA studies on both Palestinians and so on have showed that Palestinians um have about 60 to 70% DNA tra traced to kenites right oh interesting yeah and because many kites May might have converted to Judaism and then convert to Christianity and then convert to Islam right but they speak Arabic so they just called Arabs you understand because as you know an Arab is anyone who speaks Arabic um there's also um analysis done on Lebanese people and it showed that they were like about 90% Canaanites really so so the people that live in that region are more or less their that L there for and that's by kite up to 4,000 years ago so they it's pretty old so now we've established that cuz Palestines are often said that they're just Arabs that invaded from Arabia in the 7th Century uh no um just because they called Arabs doesn't mean they're they're Arabians sure yeah they're just Arabic speakers okay um now there were Palestinian Jews which which resided for that time not going to you know they and they they were called Palestinians along with everybody else by the British and others um okay so now we get to kind of more um the 18th century and so on you have uh political zionists rise up in Europe they are complaining about how um Jews are treated in in Europe yeah in Russia there's programs um there's discrimination Western Europe there's no programs anymore around about that time but what year are we here so we're talking about the 19th century the 1800s up to the mid middle middle 1800s so there was issues of um you know Jews are are discriminated jewi the Jewish problem it was called isn't it uh in in various Western countries yeah yeah they were because they had they were viewed to have different Customs you know different beliefs um and so they were viewed to be this you know a minority that couldn't really blend in very well by by many races at the time um but there was no prgrams or um massacres in in France England not just yet yeah well yeah of course um United States of America Canada of course there and in fact um you know Jews received quite a lot of Rights in in in England and um America and so on so forth which either are America being a melting part of different ethnicities or immigrants okay so uh what happened was that there was argument by political zionists that the only way to solve this the problem of um of discrimination and racism and so on so forth is that Jews need to control their own land right they have to have a land and they have to be in control of it the ones who control the power their ethnicity not other the ethnicities or no America you have rights there's no pogroms against Jews never was yeah um but that was not really discussed right but this was an age of nationalism so this is the time where people like you know Theodore Herzel and um ch and others would send correspondences with the British Empire asking them for land and then the British Empire would come back and say for example hey you got Uganda for as an example with ch mman or Argentina with Theodor herzo and they were like no it has to be and these These are primary sources which anyone can can can get very easily and they were like no it has to be Palestine it can't be Uganda and it can't be Argentina U and so this is these are kind of conversations happening obviously this is right before the Bel for declaration in 1917 so so to fast forward to that now yeah yeah we've got all this Zionist you know jargon or let's say narrative so so so to raise the point so basically at first um there were different types of of zionists some were cultural zionists they just wanted uh a a central Hub in the world where you can have a cultural hub for Jews um they weren't they weren't talking about politics they didn't really care about politics so much so they they began immigrating to Palestine and under ottoman rule so Ottomans allowed Jews to come to immigrate um into Palestine um but but when there was caught wind of of political Zionism as an ultimate goal there was them some issues like well are you coming here just to be part of the people no problem but are you are you coming here uh to take over the place and become um and and make an ethnonationalist State that's something else that's a different discussion so so uh Jews began immigrating into Palestine under the ottoman under Islamic ottoman caliphate yes um but it was only when the British invaded and and and of of course just prior to that Invasion where there was an agreement between uh some uh Rich influential uh kind of uh Jewish uh um uh bankers and others in England uh with of course the the F British establishment to say look uh we can basically uh we would like to to to reside in that land as a as a Homeland for ourselves as a as an ethnonational state for Jews and the British made that deal right so when we take it over we will be committed to as the Baff declaration we be committed to establishing Jewish homeland for you the benefits for Britain was was um it's bit longwinded but in essence um it was useful for them to have um those that be willing to cooperate with them having a strategic Outpost to control a strategic region so Britain wanted to use uh the zionists to be an outpost uh for British strategic interests so we've covered the the kind of the um the the genetic history if you like and then we moved into like say the 19th century we talked about kind of very briefly and of course this is just superficial but trying to get the main points here for people to have a clear timeline in their minds and then we we're here at the bord exploration 197 and the British man mandate for Palestine which is effectively Britain's control of Palestine it was called the British mandate at that time so let's move a little bit forward now maybe through to the 30s and 40s right of course before World War II um where there was mass immigration of Jewish people into uh the land of Palestine of course there was lot of things that happened there so so I mean the Bala declaration is basically an agreement um between Walter Rothchild um who was a Jewish backer to to the political Zionism and of course after ball so once then the British um kind of finally conquer um Palestine and with the with the help of uh uh kind of Arabs from Arabia from under Sharif Hussein and others um they had initially promised to give the land uh to Sharif Hussein there was a an agreement you could say with Shar husin that actually pre was was two years before the balford Declaration this is important because people claim that then legally speaking the Bal declaration is a legal document that gives ownership to Zionist but techn because it was in agreement with the with the occupying power but the British actually made a prior agreement uh to actually give Sharif Hussein all of um almost all of al-sham that was about 1915 right yeah 1915 so on so forth that's just slight but um so they uh once the British control Palestine um they they create they create a mandate so the Mandate of Palestine where they're meant to be supervisors over it and to it can become an independent state much like they did in in different um parts of the Muslim World cutting into pieces making nation states but they then start increasing migration allowing a mass migration of um o of of Jews from Russia who are escaping persecution so on so forth political zers from countries are not where there wasn't prosecution like Brit Britain and and and so and so for um interestingly enough uh many Jews came to uh Palestine and then use it as a jumping off point to actually go to America because America was better prospects and it was you know promised freedom and rights so they said why are we going to go to this more desolate area you know and it just that's just that has already indigenous population who are not too happy about British occupation why am I going to go here why not America and there's that's why the second most populist place in the world where Jews reside is United States of America only a few million difference between the amount of Jews that live in America and Mal that live in in um the land of Palestine as these people are coming in now the Jewish people are coming into Palestine now we're seeing a population or demographic change and and this if you like it really does go up exponentially in the 1930s doesn't it yeah and and then you've got things like the Arab Revolt which take place which is a very key time and place which which forced the British people to take note uh Chamberlain for example who was the then prime minister at the time then moved on to like you know the white paper and stuff maybe I think that was 1938 or something like give us a little bit of going what's happening here so so basically um the the the political zionists were initially naive IE they didn't care about the population the native population what they would say or do thinking that they would just exceed to whatever the British um give give to the the Zionist yeah so they didn't think there's going to be any resistance initially right they think that or it could be easily just dealt with so this is very sorry sorry but this is very important so Palestinian resistance effectively starts in the 1930s I mean we're talking about New Age Palestinian resistance where there's violence and or if you like um protest action and there's there's an action against uh both the Zionist groups and the British mandate well yeah from 1936 to 39 there's basically called the Arab Revolt uh where they they Revol against the British uh the British occupation and the British um kind of attempt to uh create a an ethnonationalist state for Jews and there was no Hamas at this time was there there there's no Hamas so this is the people that there they're not happy now now the argument initially is that designers were coming and just buying land and they weren't forcing they weren't um you know forcing people off uh but this is not exactly entirely the the full story uh the full story is is that um they would there would be a kind of a one-sided Market where they would come uh Arabs who were selling their land because everyone's buying and selling you have an equilibrium buying buyers and sellers so what they do is they they the Jewish National Fund would be set up or certain types of of of zist funds would be set up they would buy any um you know land from any Arabs who were selling and even if that through sometimes a proxy they'd get an Arab intermediary to buy it because many people didn't want to sell to Zionist so they got an AR intermediated to to buy it then they would buy the land now the land has people working on it right you might have people who are um tenant farmers who are renting and so on if they were Arab they would they'd all be kicked out right cuz I'm the new landlord now is actually the Jewish National font you're going to be kicked out and replaced with uh Jewish tenant Farmers yeah now imagine someone buys a a house of flats okay and let's say the house of flats is in is in the part of London or what have you where it's like 60% afroc Caribbean let's just say right so one you they get a new landlord and they say right then um you know everyone who's afro Caribbean I'm going to kick you out and I'm going to replace you with white people right and only white people what would you say that's pretty racist of yeah and you're ethnically you're not killing or people per se but you are in a sense ethnically cleansing you know by other means yeah of course so that was happening yeah and the the Arab the cities in palestin became filled up with uh with Arabs who were landless because they had been kicked out of their land uh they were tenant farmers and they didn't know didn't know didn't have anywhere to go and this became a problem such that the appeal commission was invest was um commissioned by Britain to investigate what to do about all these Arab tenant Farmers what year was this pill commission so the the pill commission I mean kind of happens after the the Arab revolt and the white paper is produced which gives a solution to um the problem that's by Chamberlain and that was at at first very much taken badly by the Zionist groups who after that had been released because it wasn't as favorable as they wanted it to be then started to ramp up the terrorism isn't it and at this time you had the uron and the Levi and other groups which were effectively Jewish terrorist groups who started to uh act in a manner to kill non-combatants Didn't They yeah so yeah so 1937 pill commission um like uncovered these these problems of um and they they recommended that the best solution would be maybe to partition land and uh kind of deal with maybe sty Mass migration because one of the issues that the the the locals were having problem with that all this Mass migration was coming into their land uh to the point with with the express intention of creating an ethnonational state where they would then be a minority on their own land of course okay so anyone who lives who's a native of their own land wouldn't like uh the the to to to know that basically they're being in in essence rendered a deliberate minority uh and they would never achieve um kind of political sovereignty for themselves of course right so then okay so then the British tried to then plate the Arabs in this to this extent they had white papers released and they Implement a policy to to uh reduce migration to more manageable Liv they don't stop it completely but they reduce it and how did the the two kind of major groups uh major you could say military groups of the Z because they actually had militant groups or militias so the hagana and the the hag and the the which is the main one which would late become the Israeli Defense Force and of course you had theun and then you also had the the the Le Ley and and Stern gang so these start kicking in um Terror operations against the British of course ha had much more of a considered tone in this in this whole thing they weren't as Brash and Brazen Asun and uh lihi would you agree with this well I mean like initially they even worked with the British to suppress the Arab Revolt so they were trained they had weapons and so on and so forth uh but then they began um doing deliberate um uh Terror attacks against Britain yeah to force them to resume uh the Zionist plan which is to uh increase Mass migration and with the hope that eventually they can uh the Zionist can get a Jewish majority in Palestine uh and then create a a Jewish ethn nationalist state where they are the majority and probably the most prominent example of that was 1946 King David Hotel bombing wasn't it with 91 people that were killed civilians including uh Brit actually there were British civilians for the most part there some Arabs that did die but this was an attack on British people wasn't it oh of course I mean uh but not just that the uh they were um by the way Sor ships just to cut off very interestingly uh just like we're seeing nowadays with the Israeli Army saying that this you know this hospital or this hotel or this thing is housing the terrorists they made the same kind of argument they said this is the headquarters for the British Empire or the headquarters for the British and we have to bomb it because uh they're there and in fact they did the same tactics with the same tactics of warning uh the people in the hotel that there's going to be some kind of an attack on there and they they attack they killed they killed the Civ they killed the people there the non-combatants and others in the same way and these were white people and I want to make it very clear that the same tactics that the Israeli Defense Force is employing now with Palestinian people the Zionist uron which was their if you like predecessor um employed with with white English people yeah and and also what people don't realize um because some people say well um because the urun and lei and so on they were pretty um they they would be kill killing outright uh and regardless of whether the the media would ever at the time would would cover it they'd be outright just um killing um women and children palestin Arab women and children the hag at least attempted to try to to not appear to do so yeah but uh when in reaction to the the white paper the British white paper in October 45 they actually all officially joined forces to call themselves The Jewish resistance movement right so they so these hug were totally happy to un with these people right to fight the British and and and there were even um kind of refugee ships or ships that had uh kind of Jewish refugees uh where the British tried to kind of turn them around from Palestine to send them to to elsewhere in following the white paper and um the hug bomb these these ships with with with Jewish people on these ships sunk them and killed Jews to make a statement the statement was that uh you must allow uh you know these migrants to come to the state of Palestine don't send them elsewhere and what's really powerful and interesting about this is that some of the key figures of these Jewish terrorist groups ended up becoming Prime Ministers and presidents of the of the state of Israel thereafter like M mcin for example mahay and mcin and mongan of course was part of hag and he was the Prime Minister of Israel and a leading figure in the wars that Israel done with the Arab states which we're going to cover next well in in the history of Israel you never see um uh any Zionist uh terrorist who was even declared to be terrorist uh by the British and so on so forth um ever and were actually did commit crime war crimes you could say ever be prosecuted by Israeli courts you get Nazi war war criminals being prosecuted by Israeli courts but you never get um former members ofun or Lei or someone ever being prosecuted but they did call them terrorists and that's something we're seeing which is different when they were killing the white man they were happy calling Ur Le and Stern gang terrorists and this was very clear in the front page newspapers of almost all the British outlets at the time but when the same kind of operation is done to people of a different ethnicity they don't want to call them terrorists because now they're they're State and they're not killing white people they're killing Palestinians um do you know what's what's the irony is that these when the hag and lei and St and were basically Mar Mosley uh were getting weapons and and ammunition and the British was trying to stop this yes so they would they would smuggle weapons in and they would hide them in civilian buildings um in hospitals underneath and so on so for they ACC they ACC Hamas of they did exactly themselves well I mean you just mentioned they they didn't mind uh their own effectively Jewish people being killed in in the ships I mean and we we should also put point out that um these groups and so on they also me they always mention this this Mahi of uh of Palestine having discussion with Hitler but they don't mention the fact that Theon had a pact with the Nazis which is known in peerreview journals and they both have the same United objective which was to get rid of Jewish people from Europe and bring them to Palestine so they had a reason to unite so in many ways the uron and the Nazis uh I mean they did collaborate didn't they well I mean what most people don't realize firstly so just just to explain the context so um uh especially Benjamin Netanyahu he claims that the grand Muti of Jerusalem at the time of 947 uh um spoke with prior to 947 of course had had met with Hitler that's true and had Hitler wasn't really intending to kill Jews uh in a holocaust but but this Muti gave him the idea to do so which there's no evidence for it's completely ridiculous and there's evidence to to there's well-known evidence to show that this was the plan that Hitler had well before before that so he's trying to create a narrative isn't it he's trying to create narrative to blame the Holocaust on Palestinians basically and the grand Muti of Jerusalem doesn't is not the ruler of the Palestinian the Palestinian didn't have a central government yes of to represent them right right the the hag and the the um uh the well they were called the yesu uh the those who were these these these zionists who were basically settling in Palestine they had a kind of centralized kind of semi-government system alongside the British government that was occupying the land the Palestinians were never never had were never United under any kind of uh one government or one rule or any of this kind of stuff that that's what led them to being so so vulnerable uh to both the British and um the hgab prior to establishing the state of Israel there spoke about just to just repeat the timeline so maybe people taken notes on this and I do recommend that people take notes of this that we spoke about kind of like the 1800s the late 1800s 19th century then we spoke about you know the bord Declaration 1917 we spoke about then the British mandate to govern uh all over the 1920s and then in the 30s we we mentioned uh 1936 in particular which is the Arab revolt and then we mentioned the white paper which I think is 19 the appeal report was 1937 and then you mention of course the uh white paper which I think is 1939 nille Chamberlain um the pm at the time in England and then we went into the 1940s and we discussed some of the things the terrorist action that because of the anger of some of these Zionist groups including but not limited to Stan Lehi and so so on they decided to take action and we went all the way up to 1946 with one of the most egregious um actions that was taken against white people which is the David uh King David Hotel bombing in 19 uh 46 now we're kind of at the precipice of the Inception of what is referred to as the St of Israel which which was incepted in 1948 in May the 20th so tell us what's going on around there so let's start now let's start from when um the UN resolution in November 1947 is is adopted to recommend partition of course so partition now the Zionist would claim that well the Arabs didn't accept it and but we were we accepted it so um but because they didn't accept it it's not binding on us um first first and foremost they they had no intention of honoring any part partition so um Ben gurin himself mentions yeah that uh they would initially they would initially um Ben Goran who is he oh sorry yes sorry so Ben grian would like later on become the leader well he is he at this point he's he's um he's the leader of the the kind of the Jewish government um prior to the establishment of state of Israel and then he becomes the leader of hag right oh well he he's the commander of it obviously and then he became the PM of the yeah he became the prime minister of just for the people to there's it's a semi-presidential system in Israel so they have a president and a prime minister at the same time yes yeah and the Prime Minister has more power than the president yeah cuz the president is just basically like a figurehead um for ceremonies and symbolic so so Ben gurian um uh then kind of relates uh in uh we see these discussions uh of meetings he had with his with his cabinet and all the people um so we see him discussing that basically the partition was just a stepping stone yes uh so they initially uh okay the partition will happen right that means that that allows them to create a state in the partition the Jewish partition areas what is a partition just people don't know what this word so the partition was the initial un plan was to partition um uh Palestine into two areas which are which roughly approximates to allowing the full the West Bank to Palestinians and Raza to the Palestinians and uh Jews to kind of uh uh be uh partitioned to have the majority settlements and cities uh through most most Parts prior to n the 1967 borders but not exactly not exactly like that cuz the north was still for Arabs um like yafa and so on and so forth okay so uh then what happens I mean the the proposal was more land than is currently given of course to uh Palestinians now in terms of territories I mean the the initial partition had more land that was proposed to the Palestinians than is for example now under the or Hamas and all the uh Palestinian Authority um it was much more land it was much more land uh but then benur kind of admitted um in in his plan and uh for for what they would do after the partition has been accepted yes is that they would they would then um demand from the from the Arab Palestinians that Jews should be allowed to settle uh in in significant majorities to make a majority uh in like the negative and trans Jordan he me you mentioned this negtive and trans Jordan and that if the if the AR inian say look um we look uh we we we don't want to be a minority in our own land um and so we don't accept that we don't won't accept any deals any Financial inducements or anything like this then they said they're prepared to use Force yeah to until they can settle and on the entire land of Palestine are we now before or after the establishment of the CATE of Israel are we have we established the this is just prior to sure yeah U so this is showing about Communications benan was like let's only going to accept the partition yes um just so that people um give us the space to create a a formal State military apparatus a state once we have that we're not going to stop at the partition so someone will say okay that's a that's a pretty tall claim what's the source for this have you got any information any Source academic citations yes yes yes I um I have the evidence right here um so um Ben gurin kind of um uh clearly admits that in in a meeting with the the Jewish agency executive the Jewish agency was the the government you could say um of the uh of the zionists in Palestine so it's in in June 1938 uh in a in a meeting minutes he argued that he talks about um uh where someone says to him you know uh shall we uh shall we like expand our population and transfer the Arabs out of uh Palestine by force so he says that initially wants to do by says mutual agreement with them uh when they'll see that they can't stand up to us when they see we give Financial incentives but here's the thing he says so let us assume that the negtive for example which is um currently uh under occupation by Israel of course in in the internationally recognized borders quote unquote uh so he says let us assume assume that the negative will not be included in the Jewish state it would then remain Barren the Arabs are not capable or of or or no need to develop and build it they have their fair share of deserts and they lack the human resources the money and the initiative this was typical colonialist mentality looking at these natives they won't develop it like we would and it's very likely that in exchange for our financial military and organizational scientific assistance the Arabs will agree that we develop and build the negative it is also possible they will not agree uh people does not be always behave according to logic common sense and best interest so they think well these natives don't see that that us we that kind of giving it to us or allowing us to develop it is in their best interest uh then and here's now comes what the the alternative is um so so just like so he's talking to this guy called Amos just like you I feel a contradiction between your mind and your heart so it's possible that Arabs will act according to sterile National nationalist emotion and will tell us we want neither your honey nor your sting it is better for the negative to remain Barren than to be populated by you and then he says and then we will have to talk to them in a different language and we will have a different language which we will not have unless we have a state because we cannot stand to see such large areas of unsettled land capable of absorbing dozens of thousands of Jews remain empty uh so this is what he he says and then he says and then we will have to use force and we will use it without hesitation uh though we only if we have no other choice we we do not wish and do not need to expel Arabs and take their place our aspiration is built on the Assumption proven throughout our activity there's enough room in our in the country for both ourselves and the Arabs but we will have to use but if we have to use Force um to guarantee our own right to settle in those places then we have Force at our disposal so here was his point was that they first going to accept the partition to establish their state when they have the state they have an army now they have an army uh they can they can now give the Arabs a choice they say now you let us settle and build settlements on the Arab partition areas and take those lands and you can be with us and you can benefit from the finances and so on so forth we won't we don't want to kick you out initially as long as you allow Mass migration but if you don't then we're going to take those lands by force and um and uh but not primarily to expel they said initi not primarily to expel the Arabs uh but so that they can settle any everywhere throughout the land of pales I mean there are more explicit of course uh statements like for example beIN MIM I can't pronounce his first name but beIN who be who became a president of the of the state of Israel he had a book called Revolt the revolt and in it he's very very clear about expelling with Force killing the people in The Villages the hate he has for the Palestinians this is something you can get online you can get a PDF copy of this particular book um of course when the state of Israel was established um you had uh formal you know legal things which you can you can find like for example plet and of course plet was I mean I'm let me ask you what what is plal for those who don't know and tell us now the exception of say of Israel and then the subsequent neba that happened what what's going on with that what is planal okay so so then uh so Ben grin first thought that once he you have a partition and uh and zionists can then have a state and the state can have an army and then they can in essence um diplomatically first try to make an agreement to take over the remaining part of Palestine but if the palestin Arabs don't agree to that then by force so they're always going to take it over yeah however um because in 1947 uh because then the um the Palestinians basically U you know they were not going to accept this uh what happened was they used the pretext so they said okay um since the there the partition has been declared and since then there is um we need to have an the Arabic you know states are not accepting this the Palestines are not accepting this uh you know we need to we need to kind of get reinforce our state as much as possible make it stronger as quickly as possible uh we need to make to take strategic land quote unquote uh and so they accelerated their plans to take over the Arab partitions so in essence they launched a war um in 1947 uh beginning in December 1947 ending in March 1948 uh went to do clearing operations and there was a plan called plan dalit which was a plan that was given to all military commanders of the Hagar that they would go to um Arab Villages and towns which are in strategic areas quote unquote which is basically um most of of Palestine uh and they would um they would assess the town if the town uh is in a strategic area they would basically clear out the population all right uh through any means right generally but uh there there was unofficial communic Cas things that are not recorded in such official plans uh where in essence the the Hagar leaders understood that if the state of if Palestine was to be made um a state uh one whole state like not separated but every everyone being equal citizens the Arabs already had a majority still they were still a majority of of that land and even in the in the Jewish partition areas um that was given to zionists um there was still a significant proportion there was 40% Arabs so the first thing they were going to do is they're going to clear out they're going to change that demographic Ben gurian even cited that how can we have a Jewish State even with only 60 60% Jews even there're still the majority but it's the the the the Arab minority is still too big right so this led to basically uh they called clearing operations they would go uh either they'd give an ultimatum or they would uh if there was any resistance encountered from any Arab Village encountered or town encountered uh they were given full reain to to just go in guns blazing literally um and uh and wipe him out if possible and obviously a good book for this is ilam pape's ethnic cleansing of Palestine it's one of the staple books that want someone wants more information on that let's go forward because I think a lot of the you know the Israeli and Zionist historians make it out as if okay now you got the establish what it is is you got the UN who have put this this uh partition plan has been accepted you got the establishment of the state of Israel and then you had all this antagonism you had all this provocation you had all these attacks starting with 1948 with all these Arab states attacking Israel Israel have always been defending themselves of course what we've already shown right here is that everything's been aggressive so so how would you defend yourself against something like that 1948 the Arab states came and attacked Israel so as I said so the the UN partition plan was never respected by the zionists um like before they even established a state right so this is again in 47 they launched attacks to take to do land grabs in areas that was meant to be a portion to the Palestinians it now this is this is this is without the involvement of the Arab armies around without the involvement in the Arab states the Arab the pisans didn't have a a formal Army of any kind they didn't have a centralized Command right in many cases each Village had its own separate militia right there was no initiation of an invasion or even a land grabbed by Palestinians into the Jewish apportion area or the zist a portioned areas that didn't exist okay it was the only people that had an army and a centralized command were was the the the Zionist um kind of settlement settlers there under the hag yes the the Jewish agency as it was called they're the ones that had a centralized government I see so they they could launch offensive operations and they did into the areas that were me to be Arab partition land and they made the excuse well the Arabs aren't accepting the partition mhm yeah but they're not they're not invading the Jewish partition area so to speak that was given to Zionist so uh but they just said well you know they're not accepting it and so they started to invade that was that you could say the initiation of um an aggression other than from the British Invasion you could say this was where the Jewish agency which would then become the Israeli State or the government uh was the initiate of invasions of in actually itself invading and taking land right so we've got 1948 and then you've got the 47 till March to March 48 this already kicks out 100,000 Palestinians out out of their lands right so tell us about the nakba what is the nakba now okay well technically speaking this is the beginning of the nakba right which is the great catastrophe disaster where Palestinians are ethnically cleansed from the from towns and cities and so on so forth um and then we have uh then we have the kind of the uh declaration of the state of Israel on the 15th of May 1948 now this is where um you know like planned dialect was already formulated by this time to clear out it wasn't in a response to the Arab armies coming in the Arab armies it wasn't response Palestines weren weren't uh uh streaming out of that's a good that's a good point because they could say well that that was Plan D it was a response to the Arab invasions which would be historically correct was planet was was even before the Declaration of the state of Israel as as an independent State and the Arab Army's response and the and so on so forth so um so they so they declare uh so the day before the end of the British mandate on the 15th of May on the 14th of May Day Before Ben gurin and the the Jewish agency estab declare the establishment of a Jewish State um now the Arab states protest against the um the separation of Palestine into partition to you and they submit a formal letter and what their letter offers is that they say look don't cut into pieces make it all one state okay they didn't talk about saying we must kick out Jews no no no no they said one state everyone is becomes a citizen and minority rights are protected under a democratic State that's what they offered right which means that well there were Jews living there of course after the migration but they were still a minority right but the the Arab states said look look let's not create ethnonational States you know uh the the man the British man is about to end is going to end so let's just make a a one state solution everyone equal citizens how about that yeah of course the UN didn't accept that of course and of course the the Zionist would never accept that because their whole point of their existence is to create an ethnon naist state that whereby Jews are a majority in a democratic State and therefore by de facto uh their ethnocultural group determines the the the the laws the nature of the state and so on and so forth right I I say ethnocultural group uh because they've always had this very specific Vision even when they they established this law called The Law of return you know uh where they would allow Jew anyone who claims Jewish ancestry to come and to return back to the land of their ancestors right in that law and I ask everybody to read it because people don't read that law okay um yeah if you if you can claim Jewish ancestry uh significant Jewish ancestry so your mother is is Jewish for example you can then claim the right of return uh you you can be Jewish you can be atheist because Ben grian was atheist they were socialists as well the the the political zionists weren't religious yeah they didn't believe in God didn't didn't care about that stuff but if you are a Jew with ethnically Jewish with a mother who's Jewish but you become a Muslim or you become a Christian you're not given the right of return to so this shows you that the Zionist um uh kind of uh uh goal wasn't just to return people who had an ancestry back to the land yeah they don't they certainly don't care about Palestinians they're not included in that it's an ethn cultural group must predominate so racist a parttime g uh racist and even uh religious discrimin because you discriminatory because you could be ethnically Jewish but be a Christian and Muslim and you don't get to the right of return to go back that anyway so that that's a point what's happening tell us about that because so so then um do you have all these Palestinians screaming out of Palestine you have uh you have massacres occurring against Villages that get widely publicized um uh you have mass like deren and others which uh where women children were blatantly uh killed this is no no one denies that uh and just shot and or grenades were chucked into people's houses so the the Arab regimes around and and certainly their populations are very angry about what's happening right so the Arab regimes um are pressured by their people and they make a complaint the Arab League makes a complaint to the UN saying that you have to stop this this is like you like you're seeing a massacre of Palestinians happening right now we we're not they haven't even gone in yet they haven't even no entry nothing like this right so then in response to that they say right well uh they they gave that official letter to un saying that uh establish a unitary state where everyone has equal citizenship and uh if you're not going to do that then we going to do that yeah they don't want to kick out all the Jews they didn't say that they said no no eth no national state one unitary state everyone's equal citizen and we have to rescue those who are being ethnically cleansed in that land so that's was the pretext by which they said that we we need to go and intervene and that was that was after all these refugees are banging on their door yes trying to come into their land like please help and save us and and what have you it wasn't they were saying no don't worry uh leave first and then we will uh come in whatever didn't exist or these claims that there was radio broadcast that people that was telling the Palestines to leave their lands and so on um is is is was was false yeah so now after this you've got a series of wars that take place yes we can't go into each of them in great detail we've got the SE 1956 SE Canal Crisis yes not really a war more maybe I don't know how maybe it is a war well I mean I mean look like like like this it's quite we go this very quickly which is basically yeah that um you know the Arab states sent only a token amount of army they actually were outnumbered by the Zionist are you talking about 1956 here no I'm talking about the the 1948 War when they come in okay um a further 600,000 Palestinians are made refugees yes after they kicked out um there are cities which were which even benan ordered themselves to be depopulated like you must you must leave yeah uh I'll give you an interesting story in in Bethlehem Bethlehem as they say um the uh when the the Zionist forces were were reaching there they were going to do the same thing they were going to do any everywhere else to clear it out benan personally intervened to say oh wait wait wait wait guys uh we we have the the the records of this no one denies say this he says no not that it's a majority Christian town and the eyes of the world the the superpowers are mostly Christian they're going to react very negatively if we if we kick out people out of Bethlehem right so in that they personally intervene which shows that benur knew what a lot of his hak commands were doing anyway because we know because he he'd intervened specifically tell him not to do it you know when when to make make it the exception so this shows you that they had a infite cleansing policy back then yes all right so um now4 the Arab armies failed to to uh to uh to create a a unitary state in Palestine and that the state of Israel is created uh they were outnumbered throughout the whole War the Arab armies they were IL equipped um to to take on that they were outnumbered by their enemy which is ridiculous why would you send all these armies when only regimes would only send a minority amount of soldiers who were outnumbered by the enemy shows that they weren't really interested yeah they were just making a token gesture to Plate their population but it's different discussion okay so then um so then fast forward then uh so the Israeli state is established but it doesn't control the West Bank it doesn't control Gaza the Gaz under control of Egypt the West Bank is under control of Jordan right so then um in 1956 as you as you know uh the you know the Egyptian regime wants wants to nationalize the swest canal swest canal is was was kind of kind of co-owned by British and French interests um the the Egypt said look this is on our territory uh we want to nationalize it for the the interest of the Egyptian people state it shouldn't be owned by foreign powers okay so then Britain in cahoots with France and Cahoots with Israel coordinate a invasion of the sin and the Takeover of the of the S okay uh there was no provocation against Israel what's Israel going to do with this yeah but um this shows that Israel's main function has always been to to further the Strategic interests of the West its relationship with the West is that it fulfills its strategic interest in the Middle East it's a it's a launch pad well I mean this this is the time where a lot of historians say that there was a shift in terms of superpower St of course is after World War II yes and when America intervened it's effectively telling the other guys that look why didn't you get why didn't you get me involved in this and kind of put them aside and and that's how the situation was maybe resolved many historians would say this is when really the United States of America solidified its status as the world superpower yeah I I mean also I mean I mean this is when now America starts to take over from Britain right so Britain uses its it's your pet project and it becomes now under you know it makes a deal with America it found it found a better a better sugar daddy you could say yeah for it yeah and so this is this is the relationship between Israel and America but this shows you I this is the the thesis that you're putting forward that there was I mean effectively you can't make the argument that Israel is defending itself here because they're incahoots with two other major powers of the world ex Empires and the biggest empires in the world to interfere in the internal affairs of another country of a neighboring country which had which was nothing to do with anything that threaten Israel absolutely so then then you've got something which is very well known which is the sixth day war otherwise known as 1967 war yeah so then um now like Fast Forward of course people can research these things in their own time we're giving them a bit of a you know we went for from the 1800s now in 1967 so we're giving them a superficial a skeletal if you like timeline so they can do their own reading but it's very important for people to know at least the timeline right so so yeah like almost a decade later um so basically the um uh so is Israel is is uh obviously not just doing nothing right uh there is having clashes with uh it neighboring countries but not just clashes in the sense of like they just fight Army to Army because because Jordan's not fighting Israel Syria is not fighting Israel Egypt's not fighting Israel Lebanon Army is not fighting Israel uh Israel is launching raids into um uh Jordan uh into uh Egypt but Jordan quite a lot uh destroying Jordanian Villages like the village of Samu for example um and uh and actually destroying the village not just going in to to fight but they're actually destroying the whole village they're claiming that this is a retaliation against Palestinian militants now the issue is this that um what most people don't realize is that there was UN observers the UN observers of the time said that we've we there was no known activity for uh from uh the Jordanian controlled West Bank by Palestinian militants secondly Jordan itself was trying to maintain the Peace by fighting the Palestinian militants itself and they actually killed more Palestinian militants than Israel had right it was it was any if it detected any would it would it would destroy them right so clearly Jordan was was clearly Jordan had was was basically suppressing um any potential or any um militant quote unquote militant activity by by Palestinian argued of course someone can say well on the on the flip side you got gab ABD nasar in Egypt and he was very fiery and in his anti-israel opposition and the 1967 war was nothing but a preemptive strike uh that attacked the artillery of a nation which was hostile towards uh Israel couldn't someone make this point well you see um here's the here's the issue right yes um so uh Israel is attacking uh uh you know the West Bank already all right under Jordanian control in 19 66 one year before the 1967 war and they are massacring whole village and and Villages attacking bombing constant raids yeah so Jordan complains to the UN saying like do something about this because this is like really horrific what they're doing right Jordan didn't even react militarily right it because it doesn't want to provoke Israel because it knows Israel's just waiting right just waiting it wants to provoke Jordan uh then it because it because the zers have a permanent interest the whole land of Palestine as Ben gurin kind of admitted many years ago the whole land of Palestine is their target they want to take all of it right they don't care about partitions are just a starting off point yeah but Jordan knows this okay doesn't want to uh antagonize yeah but the Arabs the world are angry look you know Israel's massacring whole uh Arab Villages what you know what to do so the Naas is under pressure yeah because he's viewed as you know as as the leader of the United Arab Republic which is you know an alliance between you know Iraq and Syria and Egypt to become a kind of one state kind of but they're still separate in a way um so he's under his pressure so he kind of he rattles Sabers he says like don't do this and so he closes The Straits of tyan if you if you see that in the Sinai it's just it's on the on the uh east side of of Sinai there's the there's the Straits of Tyran that leads to to the south of Israel the South tip of Israel um the Israeli State and he he closes it off as a gesture and he and he moves some army forces next to the border of um Israel to say like like you know don't do this and then of course America comes in swoops in other ways say okay I'm going to deescalate we're going to negotiate with NASA there's good possibility that he will open it up with negotiations he's made his point so on so forth and of course there is there is cumul the case by mosad by um the the the Israeli defense minister of the time by American intention agencies that NASA doesn't actually want any war with with Israel because any fight with Israel because the 1956 War showed them that they they might they would most likely lose such a war one-on-one so but they but they they they couldn't let the massacre of Arab Villages go so they were going to do a show of strength yeah but there was no it wasn't an invasion Army coming there was it was the Army was too small to invade you you have to have mobilization of your population Mass mization frankly one can say even if they did want to invade after all that's been done it would have been totally justified I mean yes but the Zionist argument was that they were they were existentially threatened by Egypt yes at this point even though all their communic all the the mosad all the intelligent agencies and their own defense minister um admitted afterwards in their well in their Memoirs but we also have the the um classified cables that they said that NASA is not intending to fight NASA doesn't want to fight can one argue that well why did NASA go to the Soviet Union and um get armed by you Czechoslovakia at the time they were arming them they had new military hardware and so on if they didn't really want to fight why they why are they doing all these things well I mean Israel s was was getting weapons by Checkers of Vue too you know they're buying weapons they're buying arms to because 1956 War showed them that Israel could Israel took siai like that with the help of British if you're Egypt and these PE people can just wal into your country at will you're going to want to defend yourself you're going to want to arm up but but that was never argued that was was the existential threat right but then here's the thing and this what Illustrated that what happened next was Israel's own initiation was Israel said okay they did a a preemptive strike on on Egypt but they took the Egyptian Army completely by surprise exactly yeah so if if there was this is this is a great argument because if they were under existential threat and the Egyptians were trying to attack the Israelis then how could it be a surprise that the Israelis hit them first it's like look imagine I'm angry at you I say I'm angry at you I'm going to beat you up and I come at you fist clenched you know you've seen me limbering up you I'm going you I'm going very angry you and youch me the face yes why' you punch me in the face yeah how could it be a surprise it wouldn't be why would it be a surprise if I'm ready to face you how are you punching me going to surprise me cuz I mean the way in which all these you know these um air airplanes and stuff like were destroyed in 6 days it you cannot argue that this was done it wasn't even EGP it was Syrian airfields it was Jordanian airfields there was an Iraqi Airfield that was just next to the Jordan border that got obliterated too even the Iraqis got obliterated it's consensus even on those on the Z side I mean they they they'll gloat and Bast the the fact that was a surprise so sure now now so so then what what what Israel did is now because of that they they taking the pen they took the Sinai Peninsula a second time and they wanted to hold on to it they took Gaza they took the sign Peninsula but now they then they used that as a penin for those who don't know is a massive Mass massive of land yeah yeah it's a few times bigger than Israel the Israeli States own controll imagine now they're taking new land yeah yeah you know which is illegal under international law yeah and because now now Jordan was under a defense Packa with Egypt and Egypt's being invaded right so Jordan basically just fires a few artillery shots into into Israel to say like like to make at least a gesture that it's honoring its defense pact with coming to Egypt's help yeah cuz EGP Egypt is actually being invaded at this point yeah of course and then Israel goes ah now we got what we wanted so then they invade the West Bank yes oh now you're shooting us now we've got it now we got what we wanted a pretext and they they and they had a pre-prepared plan to invade the West Bank so that's F forward now there's a lot of anti-israel so this is how Israel Justified its Invasion it also invaded the the Golan even though um Syria has um had announced a ceasefire it's not stop it's stopping it operations it didn't want to fight it declared it didn't want to fight and they said no we're going to take the Golan as well the Golan Heights as well so now at this point you know when does the pl come into play the the Palestinian Liberation Organization otherwise known as fat when when does that initiate okay so um this really I mean this this this kind of stuff really occurs um uh really towards uh the uh the end of of the um kind of Jordanian control of the West Bank now cuz you have a whole bunch of Palestinians now now are now under occupation by um the Israelis so what year are we talking here like so I mean this this this begins after 1967 war this is when um a whole bunch of these are people who had already left their homes they they still remember the nbar so this is 20 years before the establishment of Hamas oh I'm only I'm only keep I'm only repeating this point because people are going to scape go Hamas but Hamas didn't even exist at this time yes so um when Israeli attacks start start you know attacking Palestinians and wiping out Palestinian villagers uh even before the 1967 war um you know the Palestinians are are all trying to organize a a resistance against this this happens in 1964 okay the PLO is established in 1964 to be both a political organization uh to um for Palestinian rights yeah right and and they're Nationalist and secular just to be clear right yes yeah yeah they're not they're not based on any motivated by any religious considerations they have mixture of Christian Arabs as you know 10% of Palestines are Christian yeah so um so in this actually they even get recognized to some extent by the UN in 1974 as uh having Observer status so they get recognized as a national movement um by the UN now the the issue is that they uh they became political party in 1965 andless is a political party yeah uh to get you know Palestinian nationhood right for themselves a separate State uh but once Israel occupies the West Bank and Gaza and you have a whole bunch of Palestinian refugees did you know that more refugees were created now they they were kicked out and pushed pushed more eastwards in the West Bank so they were already people that had were refugees 20 years ago and they were pushed even further away or kicked out to or they left or they were forced out and went to Jordan other places like this Jordan became so overcrowded with Palestinians it would seem like about 50% of the Jordanian population itself was Palestinian at one point right so um they they uh begin uh resistance and Insurgent operations against the against Israel because they are now under direct occupation right before they were under Jordanian control where at least with the jordanians they weren't getting uh racial discrimination they weren't facing racial discrimination racial harassment or so on so forth but but under Israeli control that's when that begins and that's when the Insurgency uh occurs so this is where then Palestinians are facing facing that the zist would say what about the 1973 War wasn't that a war that was for our survival uh we were extensionally um threatened uh but again that was reclaiming sin wasn't it that was that was yes it's false the Egyptian Army uh wanted to reclaim s afterwards they argued that they they had to regain the National Honor because this was a big slap to their face that they lost to sign absolutely I think there there was there was a lot of like anti-israel sentiment at this time the Egyptian population was absolutely outraged about what happened yeah g ABD Nas came out in 1967 and he basically apologize to the public he was talking about reclaiming siai and stuff like that you know it built up all the way up to the 1970 when G died obviously Arad at that time had taken power and and it was his thought and he started negotiating with the Americans with kissing and so on and what what is narrated by primary sources is that he effectively said to him we can't do anything to you or for you unless this becomes a crisis in the Middle East which means that you effectively need to have some something to negotiate with with that an Sadat and others decided to go into Sinai and not take the whole thing over just a portion of it so that they can have something go to negotiation with Syria um in um invades quote unquote their own land the the um the Golan yeah they they want that back and Egypt just invades Sinai which was their land they they have very limited objectives they only want to take that those areas of land right and even then I mean even in that war the Israelis actually penetrated Egypt itself I mean arel shiron he went into what Mal went all the way up you know so it wasn't it wasn't some passive War yes I mean most would say that especially in the Egyptian context that Egypt got wanted in terms of you know objectives of war and got the sign Peninsula back but now we're talking about Camp David and so we move on in in 1978 yeah so now there's this Camp David agreement yeah so um all right so so you know Israel was never ever really exti threatened since 1948 ever and um any of all the things that it does is never because it's existentially threatened it's because either it there's an opportunity to expand more land um or it to suppress anyone that um is is identifies as a resistance to it even if they're not actively fighting with them at that point in time yeah so I mean Israel regularly um flies Jets into Syria and bombs Hezbollah targets no one ever talks about this right Hezbollah is not currently fighting um you know uh the state of Israel quote unquote right they're not in active War since since the Lebanon war the more recent one but they bombit regularly they say this was Hezbollah shipment of Arms from um the Iranian re revolutionary guards in Syria okay well what Syria does in its own territory on your business right uh but they they say well this this is giving arms to a group that we don't like well but the group you don't like you're in a ceasefire with them you're in you're not you're not actively fighting with them but you're still bombing them and that really shows Israel's policy is that say if we don't like you they say we're just going to keep bombing you whe the difference between active War and Peace time is just the level of military operations that Israel does against you sure that the only difference let's get to this point of so we' because we want to kind of maybe wrap up now this is there's a lot we've spoken about in terms of the history and there's a lot that people have that can take as like I say it's a sceletal historical timeline we've started from the 1800s and we're all the way here in 19 let's say 80 now I think cam David was 198 1978 if I'm corre correct in that the agreement between the Egyptians and the the Israelis and then you have SI given back in exchange for uh peace Everlasting peace with Egypt and and Israel so this takes place then you have from 1978 effective that let's just say you've got the the peace that you wanted with the big countries around you all the way up to let's say 2023 which is our year now and of course uh fat have you know the Oslo Accords and these attempts to try and Forge peace uh through negotiation and so on all of that uh as we've we've heard from Palestinian Liberation Organization Representatives has not been fruitful and the Palestinians are becoming more and more angry about this and then 1987 you have the establishment of Hamas and so tell us now from the establishment of Hamas until this time what are the notable things that we should know maybe the inter fathers some of those things right I mean well like okay so so basically um you know Israel doesn't just do nothing right uh it if you look at the history it's it's invaded its neighbors multiple times since yeah so it's invaded Lebanon three times yeah uh everyone forgets that you know Lebanon doesn't have an army to conquer anything but because there's PL organizations there uh and then later on the last one there was Hezbollah they basically invaded and they invaded again usually as a response to a retaliation to their own low-level military operations cuz once they say don't they don't like you they're going to um they either do lowlevel attacks against you or high level attacks against you so in when in peace time quote unquote they just do they maintain this constant background hum of of assassinations bombing targeted strikes uh Commander raids this is what they call Peace yeah or ceasefire and so when people say I'm sick look I I don't like your ceasefire cuz your ceasefire is killing us literally uh we're going to protest by shooting a few rockets that are not going to re really strategically do anything per se and then is goes at pretext then raise up to high level military things to they say let's see if we can destroy this whole organization or or TR change the Strategic balance of Lebanon so this is basically what they they did um like now Hamas Rises up in the midst as in the issue of the Lebanon war and is actually encouraged by Israel so so basically the Lebanon Lebanon war starts at 1982 and um it was initially uh targeted at that clearing out um the the the PLO from Palestine but they commit many outrages Israelis and they use local nationalist Christian forces uh to to fight so um they the Hamas was found in 1987 and it is you know it it as a response to the Israeli occupation of of Lebanon which was which was ongoing at this point in time and and it was originally funded by the Israeli I think at one point wasn't it uh well Israel kind of gave uh secretly gave support to it as a rival to Fat because fat was secular yeah PL by the way yeah and and so Hamas is is is it's more religious in orientation quote unquote uh it was deemed to be a rival to weaken the PLO yes yeah by creating a by supporting a rival organization which would then later on it just they lose control of of course because it would then get its own support now Hamas is actually meant to be a political organization it's its military Wing the one that actually does the fighting is called the isan brigades yeah and they were actually formed in 198 1993 see yeah so that's already 5 years after Hamas was formed soas is a political party and five years later it forms has a a military Wing that does the actual uh Insurgency and fighting so this is this is where this happens now obviously see um then you have the interf fathers and so on yeah so so um meanwhile in Israel and in the West Bank occupied territories um you know Palestinians are under military rule so they don't elect governments they don't not represented by any governments they don't have their own leaders that uh can can uh uh approve building permits so they can they can house their own children in the Next Generation that stuff they are stifled and restricted and face police harassment brutality uh killing um on slightest uh pretexts and so on so forth so uh in 1988 to 1993 they initiate the first in from the Arabic were to kind of shake off they wanted to shake off the occupation um it leads to uh 1,962 Palestinians dead 270 Israelis uh dead um due to the OCC the occupation of West Bank and Gaza that's the key issue Israel could have simply returned the 1967 um uh kind of borders and not give it back to Egypt or to uh to Jordan uh but just give it to the Palestinians who are too weak to make in the Army and we never threaten them ever but they don't want to give it back and the question is why not Jordan already relinquished the West Bank says I don't want to have anything to do with it any anymore if any uh anything that happens with the West Bank will be between you and the Palestinians that was what it said to Israel basically and there are two iners right so this is the first one that you mentioned yes when was the second one okay so so we have uh you know we have then the oso cuse that happens at 19 93 um which starts to talk about giving zones of control um to the Palestinians then you have Oslo to the the taba agreement um that happens in 1995 which talks about areas of disengagement so they tried to um uh kind of uh so Israel makes this agreement with the Palestinians and the Palestinians this is the espe P the Y arat it's very they're very naive on this but they're quite desperate and this is like this which is we're going to split the West Bank into three zones Zone A B and C Zone a the Palestinians will control the security of it and the laws and the rules and regulation Administration um Zone B uh the Palestine Authority uh which will be set up by p b the P becomes the palestin authority will control um the administrative and laws but they don't control the security of it so basically person government but Israeli police right basically and Zone C which is 60% is controlled both by U military rule yes and by the the Israeli Security Forces so the Palestinians go are offered a few areas of the West Bank where they can actually control their own destiny so they jump at it because they never been offer that before uh but it's a trap because it then justifies it has a signature of a palestini authority to the Israeli control of the vast majority of the West Bank the area C which is 60% and of course area B where where they control the military uh and the security operations of that so the Palestinians have it was kind of a trap because they've actually signed their own occupation they've actually given consent you could quote unquote to their own simp point is that you don't have them you're not allow the military there is you're not the pales are not allow the military but the the the the Oslo Accords were not meant to be a permanent thing it was meant to be phases of disengagement yes so Israel would say Okay area a is yours but eventually once things are calmed down we see that it's all working then we'll give you area we'll give you full control of area B and then eventually we'll see about area C it was meant to be zones of disengagement yeah but they could use any pretext to stall it and say oh there's you know one person state of emergency yeah um one Palestinians guy's dog bit an Israeli soldier or looked at the soldier funny this means there's still insecurity this means we can't disengage International Jim Crow laws really isn't it yeah yeah and and it allowed them to control um the the the the Palestinian life in the West Bank um and and in in razza right so let's let's move forward now to so second in Father occurs um you know year 2000 there's a second Uprising because seeing there the failure of of the Israel to St stick to its word to disengage yes and give back land in the West Bank to the Palestinians as it promised in stages so this happens between year 2000 and year 2005 America commissions the Mitchell report to see how they could uh how they could stop the interfa um how people you know di on that one um uh well in 3,000 dead Palestinians I mean with the current conflict there's already there's already more dead Palestinians this shows you that this we're really living in a historical moment aren't we there's there hasn't been this many dead Palestinians in a short period of time since uh arguably um 1967 or even before yes you know in in such a short amount of time probably even yeah even or even before that 1948 the the actual NAA massacr that occurred okay so um but in response to the second in father at dissatisfaction that Israel is not sticking to its word into disengaging because they never intended to disengage and there you've probably seen that leaked footage of Benjamin Netanyahu um where he would talk about how to build how to kick out Palestinians in area sea he'd say that the agreement said that the Israeli Army is allowed to make military bases yes in area C uh and they can declare any way they want in area C according to need so Ben Netanyahu in a in a leaked recording said that it was actually um he he actually defined as military areas and they could be as big as he wanted okay and then then he can and that was used to to further kick out Palestinians out of the West Bank so this is what this is what's happening and then eventually yeah um in reaction to the second inter father the the Israel used this as a pretext to start building walls enclosing area A's area a um parts of the West Bank and in and and uh by the way they had already begun building settlement since 1967 and 196 7 was when uh you might say more religious zionists got involved uh there was an argument before that saying that you know the you can't make a state of Israel until the Messiah comes but when the 196 67 War happened it was argued that this was divine favor on Israel and then Many religious Jews started to support Israel and that's when they started to be you see the beginning of settler activity religious religious settlers really willing to settle into the West Bank and make settlements there anyway so um then you've got two more like before the the the mowing of the lawn kind of every two to three years you have I'm thinking here and maybe correct me if I'm wrong you have two more major events which is the Lebanon war is the second Lebanon war with heah yeah yeah so uh okay so so basically what what we see is that um there's there's uh called let's go to 2006 sure so 2006 2005 um the the Israeli forces disengaged from gazah mhm uh because they had settlement settlers there they it was hard to protect and disengagement doesn't mean that they no longer have effective military control because they control a lot of these Israeli pundits and Zionist you know uh people propagandists they would say well look we're not occupying Gaza because we disengaged in 2005 but the truth of the matter is disengagement is not prerequisite for non uh effective military control in fact most of the international law prerequisites for occupation is that if you're control of the airspace and you control of the sea and you control of the population which Israel maintains and had maintained since 2005 uh of the entire area so they've got what it was referred to in Natal laws effective military control even since 2005 the fact that they removed their the the settlements from there could even be said to be strategic because every 3 to four years they're going to bomb from the sky that would be the new strategy wouldn't it be yeah so um uh uh basically there's been actually sorry uh four in involvements of Israel in B Lebanon not three uh there was OB Al South Lebanon war that that occurred um I forgot to mention but there was a more one more Reon to ask which is the 2006 level on war so in 2006 Israel does two things um the the Palestinians of Gaza elect Hamas via Democratic elections so um Israel imposes a blockade over Gaza limits their fishing limits their getting supplies uh and so on so forth and then invades um Lebanon in 2006 right to destroy Hezbollah it says this is this is already after of course um again Hezbollah responding to Israeli attacks raids and so on so forth into Lebanon and so there's this low-level conflict that's that's always that didn't stop between um the Israeli Army and uh the Hezbollah but they said okay we're going to destroy hisbah once and for all so they go in and it's a shambles they end up losing lot you know a lot more Fighters than they anticipated and uh they withdraw in August 2006 so that so they've invaded Lebanon four times uh in this in this point in time um an army that a country that can't strategically threaten them it's not an existential threat at all whatsoever uh and then the blockade of Hamas begins and here's what you have to understand that um Hamas is and the Palestines of Gaza have been living under uh conditions where their infrastructure gets regularly bombed under this low-level uh ceas fire or peace agreement with the the Israelis so um Israel has this policy um called mowing the lawn yes right and what they will do is they will um because Hamas is now the government of of Gaza they have to keep Gaza itself weak and uh and uh well unable demoralized subdue them well weak subdued enable to fight yeah so they would regularly bomb infrastructure um they would regularly bomb um uh Hamas political targets and there are so many we know this is recent history now there are so many different um so operations that have happened 3 to four years and this is it brings me to a point which is if you're if you've got like you know protective Edge and castled and 2014 and 2021 and every 3 to four years you've become predictable and you've you I mean you're you're going against what onzo said which is don't um you know push your enemy when it's desperate or something to that effect being a desperate enemy 3 to four years they know you're going to bond them anyway so in many ways what you're doing is you're creating an atmosphere for the kind of responses that they're getting really isn't it well you know what like um one of the the tactics designers do when they argue this is they say they say well you know um like this recent uh response by Hezbollah or they when they fight Rockets or what have you uh we didn't attack Hezbollah within the past couple months or at least least exactly well least the past month if you go if you go back a few months you say oh actually we did when we Bon this we took out one target or a drone strike but they said we didn't do it recently within the last month but what they trying to do is they try to separate from the West Bank because as far as Hamas and fat concerned these are one Land one people so anything that Israel does to West Bank um Hamas considers to be done to them as well and and and likewise the Palestines on the ground as well and so on so um and of course likewise the West Bank Palestinians feel the same for the the Palestinians in Gaza so in response to to um Israeli clearing operations uh where they would clear the the Temple Mount and mus AA when they have visits by settlers or visits by right- Wingers and and especially those who've been implicated in killing Palestinians what people don't realize is see it's a Muslim Mosque okay Muslims go to pray the mosque it's um it's the custodians of it are the Jordanian Authority right yeah it's meant to be a wakf under Jordanian Authority but it's for Muslims to use so when when Israel or organizes a visitation by people who are usually right-wingers or others who do it deliberately they have to uh first clear out the mosque so they say right all you Muslims going to pray uh usually uh usually um men mostly but basically they might keep kids with there or very old people but they actually go with send them their security forces to clear everyone out Israeli Security Forces enter the mosque to clear it all out right so I think you've done a really good job in summarizing the historical points obviously the other things that we know I mean all these operations and many people have lived them so they'll know about them what we wanted to do in this episode was to give people a brief historical timeline a skeleton that they can go like from all these things we've had to kind of rush it a little bit because we've got flight to catch you know but what I will say is is is the following is that the the thesis or the idea or the proposition that Israel's been defending itself all this time knowing full well the facts that we've presented here is an untenable one wouldn't you say yeah look just to kind of summarize everything we've been saying yes which is the Zionist project was to create a a majority ethn nationalist group in eth nationalistic State yes that would represent their ethnocultural one distinct ethnocultural Group by a majority population so zionists have always been concerned about demographics they've always been wanting to say make sure that the state the whole land of Palestine all of it is one is is a ethnonationalist state state for Jews primarily yeah okay now to achieve that there were many tactics and strategies depending on on on the situation at hand and they've always been interested in expanding beyond that some even said beyond into Jordan it's as well as the Sinai and even into South Lebanon yeah now historically speaking what we've seen is a very consistent policy from um Israel which is it's been using Force projection in the region it regularly invades its neighbors um even those people that oppose uh Israel but have ented into ceasefire agreements Israeli peace or ceasefire looks like lowlevel military operations yeah so uh so basically if you say look I I disagree with the Zionist project but I'm going to I'm going to have peace because I don't want my people to be killed and I don't want to we want to be attacked are still going to be killed and attacked by Target operations by raids by drone strikes by air strikes and so which happened in Lebanon which happens in Syria right even in Syria right now even up to Damascus Airport got bombed um you know uh regularly um so this kind of happens on a low level yes and add to the fact that if you're a Palestinian in the West Bank um you know the experience of living under Israeli occupation is like being in a vat of acid absolutely yeah you can say no one can say well you're in a vat of AET but who's punching you it's not the punching that is that is the issue it's me being slowly dissolved absolutely Yeah by um um uh police harassment by um uh denying building permits uh for my for your your family and so on so forth to when you because over the time you have children they need to find place to live it's by um just being shot by by police for for the slightest uh concerns that you might be security risk regardless of even whether you're a child or what have you um even just recently like the previous month up to 20 30 palestin kids in the West Bank have been killed yeah that's according to un reports even right like like like forget about you know uh uh I think and bombings and so on so yeah so so when you when when this is your existence where uh you know peace with Israel is a continual is is a continual continually killing your people if you're Palestinians right um You and and not peace of Israel is you're just being bombed and and and massacred and and being pushed out and people say that Israel wants to push out and take half of Gaza now yeah um you you can see that Israel has always been the aggressor absolutely because it always has had the same goal always which is a majority ethnonationalist State on the whole land of Palestine and currently speaking in the whole land of Palestine there's 50/50 Palestinian Arab and and and Israeli Jewish citizens so this is not a demographic that designers are going to accept and they're going to aim and they're always going to continue to pressure the Palestinians force them to go eventually by continue harassment continue bombing continue so until they give up and they just leave so that they can get their majority ethn nationalist State over the whole land of Palestine as Ben gur as they sent them right from the very beginning which is why they would never accept Gaza and the West Bank as part of Israel because then they'd have Democratic rights for those 2.2 million Palestinians in in Gaza and however many millions 3 million or more than that in uh in the West Bank which would would maybe make them a majority in fact over 50% would never give those the West Bank and the Gaz and Palestinians equal citizenship cuz that's be% they have to now be between a rock and a hard place they can't be part of the state but they they have to be uh attacked and the moon the the the grass has to they have to be pressured so that slowly over time Palestinians will leave yes and they can get a uh and they they always hope there' be more Jewish migration So eventually that they can get a majority 80% ethnonationalist State over the whole land of Palestine well if people have been watching this and I thank you so much for joining me people have been watching this is a very brief historical timeline each and every single one of those things that we spoke about could have had many many voluminous and encyclopedic chap books and chapters written on them um from the 1800s to all the way to 1920s to 1930s and 1967 war 1973 War we want to give people a basic education on this and I think in the time that we've had we've done a very good job I thank you for joining me I think with this honestly

#TED #TEDTalks #IsraelHamasWar",2023-10-10,1801335,27039,4965,UCAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug," Helen Walters: Hello, everybody. Two days ago, on October 7, the Palestinian Sunni-Islamic
fundamentalist organization Hamas attacked Israel,
overrunning two military bases, occupying territory, killing hundreds of Israeli citizens
and taking dozens more as hostages. It was the most significant
breach of Israel's borders since the Yom Kippur War of 1973. The attacks were clearly
long- and well-planned, and they sent shock waves of fear
and panic through the region and the world. Obviously, it's two days later. It is way too soon to understand
all of the ramifications of these attacks. But we can try to understand
how we got here and the implications of this awful moment. So we asked our community
to share their questions and to answer them,
I am joined by Ian Bremmer, president and founder
of political risk research and consulting firm Eurasia Group. Hi Ian. Ian Bremmer: Helen, great to be with you. HW: Alright, so let's get right to it. We've had a number of our community
who really want you to explain the very simple question
of how we got here. So can you share the historical
context for this moment? And if you like, give us
a bit of a Gaza 101. IB: Well, I mean, Gaza,
we've got a population, a Palestinian population
of just over two million, 2.2 million, exceedingly poor. And, you know, without sovereignty,
without statehood, and a part of the Palestinian
occupied territories, also the West Bank,
more people, 3.5 million. The West Bank run not very well
by the Palestinian Authority, which recognizes Israel's right to exist. Gaza, run really badly,
with very little resources, run by Hamas, which does not recognize
Israel's right to exist. Now we've been talking about a two-state
solution for a very long time. For the idea that the only way
you end up with stability between the Israelis and the Palestinians is if the Palestinians have some ability
to govern themselves, have some control
over their economic trajectory, over their foreign policy,
over their borders. That is not where we stand right now. And indeed, the idea of a two-state solution
has kind of lost the collective interest, imagination, traction, for two reasons. First, because the Middle
East has moved on. A bunch of countries around the region have found that they are interested
in developing direct relations, some formal, some informal, with Israel, and that they're willing to do that irrespective of resolving
the Palestinian question, the Palestinian problem. And we've seen that
with the Abraham Accords under the Trump administration, where the UAE, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco all directly
established diplomatic relations with Israel. If you go to Dubai or Abu Dhabi today, you will see Israeli tourists
like you wouldn't imagine. And they’re having a great time
and they’re spending money and they're taking in the sites and they're very welcomed by the Emirates. Unimaginable that was going
to happen 10 or 20 years ago. In fact, Saudi Arabia was very close, not within weeks, it wasn't imminent, but certainly within months
of signing a deal with Israel that would allow for them
to open diplomatic relations. And there's already been a number of high-level diplomatic
relations informally between Mohammed bin Salman
and Prime Minister Netanyahu. So, in other words, across the region,
you had Israel, frankly, in the strongest geopolitical position
that they've been in decades. They've been surrounded by enemies. Well, now they're increasingly surrounded
by countries they can do business with. In fact, just a couple of weeks ago, there was an announcement of a deal where the United Arab Emirates
was investing massively into solar power for Jordan, which would then be given to Israel in return for desalinized water
processed by Israel. Even five years ago, inconceivable
a deal like that could happen. So the Israelis, technologically
very sophisticated, an advanced industrial economy, are only standing to make more money by doing business
with all of these countries. What's been happening
with the Palestinians? Nothing. The answer is nothing. They're not benefiting economically. And all of these deals for Israel
have happened without any consequences, any contingencies for the Palestinians. And indeed in Israel, you know, there have been
a lot of headlines. Israel's made a lot of news this year,
but not because of the Palestinians. Israel has made news because of their own
domestic constitutional crisis, an effort by the Prime Minister,
Netanyahu, and his right-wing coalition
to engage in judicial reform, an Israeli judiciary
which is very independent, which has, in the context of democracies, a very surprising amount
of authority over making but also interpretation of laws in Israel. What can and what cannot be considered
a reasonable law to be executed. And for a country
that doesn't have a constitution, not surprising perhaps,
the judiciary is so powerful. And Netanyahu facing corruption charges and with a very weak right-wing coalition
relying on far right, extremist right party
as part of that coalition, was pushing for these reforms. Now, why am I talking about that? Because for the last six months, there have been unprecedented
demonstrations across Israel, peaceful demonstrations, but bringing out the entire country. Because they were concerned
about a constitutional crisis. Kind of an irony for a country
without a constitution. If Netanyahu persisted, went ahead with these reforms. No one was talking about the Palestinians. And indeed, large numbers of troops
that had been in the south were moved to the West Bank as the Netanyahu government was expanding
the settlements in that territory and responding to Palestinian reprisals
against those settlements. So they weren't focused on the issue. They took their eyes off the ball. Israel had other priorities, and the Palestinians were in a position
not only to lose their friends around the region but also increasingly an afterthought
for the Israeli government and the Israeli people. That is the backdrop
for where we are today. HW: So let's dig in a little bit
into the idea that you bring up of the kind of the troubles
that have been roiling Netanyahu and the Israeli government themselves. So I think one of the things
that has been brought up is the massive failure of intelligence
and defense systems in Israel that allowed this attack to happen. What happens next? Do you see Israel uniting
around Netanyahu? Do you see this fracturing even worse
with anger at what happened in the lapses in defense
and intelligence insights? Or what happens next? IB: Well, the first point I should make is just for everyone to understand
what has just happened to the Israeli consciousness. It is unimaginable that, you know, certainly someone
in a developed country could have any understanding of what the Jewish people in Israel
are presently going through. This feeling that, you know,
after the Holocaust and, you know, the land being provided to them
to have a safe haven to create an independent Israeli state. And the need to defend their borders, the historic fights
they've had with their neighbors, the war in 1973, when a number of Arab nations
decided to fight against them. And, you know, the continual
sense of besiegement with missiles from Hezbollah,
for example, terrorist operations. This is not like a bolt from the blue when the United States
experienced 9/11. Israel’s 9/11 is both massively greater
in the impact on Israel but also comes for a country
that was supposed to be prepared for this. I mean, Israel represents
the gold standard on border security around the world. Not like the United States,
where you've got, you know, all sorts of people running across and ""build the wall""
becomes a clarion call precisely because nobody understands
how to defend the border, no. And also, intelligence collection,
surveillance, digital surveillance, human intelligence collection
on the ground, especially in the occupied territories. This is what they do. And the fact is that right now, today, Netanyahu's legacy will not be anything
that he has done to date. It will be this failure
and how he responds to it. Period, end of story. Nothing else is close. So what that means for Israel is that all of the issues
that have roiled this country over the past year, all of the political polarization, and it's not a two-party country, it’s a many, many-party country. You know, the joke is you get
three people together in Israel and, you know, you form
a new political party. And if you go to
the coffeehouses and the rest, everybody's talking politics. Everyone reads the newspapers. This is a highly politically literate
and divided population. But as of right now, priority one, two and three
for the entire Israeli people is to respond to these attacks,
these terrorist attacks. And how are they going to respond to them? Well, number one, they've got to find a way
to get their people back. There are 100-plus, and we don't know
the exact numbers right now, hostages that are being held in Gaza,
most of whom are civilians. And they will do everything
to get them back. And they may well have direct American
support in trying to accomplish that. And then it will be to go into Gaza, to remove the leadership of Gaza, to disarm the militias
in the territory of Gaza, and to do everything they can
to try to ensure that this cannot happen again. And making that happen
is a very, very tall order. It might be a taller order
than the Israelis can accomplish, and certainly the knock-on consequences
will be grave even for just Gaza. And that is before we talk
about any potential expansion of the war. But for now, the Israeli people
will stand together. And there's already talk of a government
of national emergency that would bring together Netanyahu
with the leader of the Israeli opposition for the purposes of fighting this war so that everyone in Israel
is together collectively, ensuring the national security
of the people of Israel. And I think that for the course
of the coming months, and let us remember, this is not just, you know, an attack
against Israel and now they respond. It is very likely
there are Hamas operatives on the ground inside Israel right now that the Israeli government
has to find and neutralize. It is also true that, you know, you're still actively expecting that there are going to be
additional attacks, whether those are missile attacks or whether those are direct incursions, nobody knows, but given the level of planning
that was required by Hamas to make these strikes over the weekend, which nobody in Israel thought
was possible, no one expected it, right now, that level
of concern would be higher than anything else
on the political agenda. And again, that will not move
for the foreseeable future. HW: So I want to talk more
about all of that and expand this to obviously the broader
geopolitical implications of this. But I want to just play out the 9/11
reference a little bit if you can, because obviously 9/11
happened some time ago with the attack on the United States. But we know with retrospect,
with hindsight, that some of the decisions
that were made after that were misguided, they were misjudged, they actually led to terrible harm. How and who is going to make sure that these types
of decisions are not made? And how can Israel avoid making decisions that will be bad? IB: As someone who was in New York on 9/11 and saw the second tower go down and saw how the city rallied together,
how the country rallied together, President Bush, over 90 percent
approval in the country a couple of months after 9/11, how the world came together
to support the United States, the coalition of the willing,
well beyond NATO. I mean, poor countries that had no business caring
about what the United States was up to providing troops on the ground
and support for the Americans. Russia, Putin's Russia, calling up Bush
and offering, you know, the former Soviet republics
in Central Asia as bases to support
for logistical operations for the war in Afghanistan. I mean, the level of support
for the United States after 9/11 was singular. And there's no question
that the outpouring of concern, I mean, when I saw in Berlin, shining on the Brandenburg Gate, the Israeli flag with the star of David in Germany, in Berlin, in Germany, and given the history and given what that means and given the Alternative für
Deutschland doing well in East Germ -- all of that, I mean,
this is a singular moment in the relationship between
Germany and Israel. The European Union suspending
aid to the Palestinians, the support for Israel is extraordinary. Narendra Modi In India. It is not universal for every country, but it is absolutely wide-ranging. And I got a readout, I spoke to several of the folks involved in the Emergency
Security Council meeting at the United Nations this weekend. The condemnation of these attacks,
everyone but Russia. And again, so in that regard,
this is very, very similar to 9/11. Now, the broader question
that you're asking, Helen, which I'm also very sensitive to, is in 2023, looking back on 9/11, the Americans made some horrible,
horrible, long-lasting mistakes. And some of those mistakes
were in the United States. I mean, if I think about how much money
was spent and wasted in the Department of Homeland Security, on personal security
and safety in the airlines, how much money was wasted, how much economic inefficiency
as a consequence of overstating the terrorist
threat in the US, everything else secondary to that. But also, the rights
that were stripped back for, in some cases, all Americans in terms of surveillance
and the Patriot Act. But also targeting Muslim Americans
across the country and so much mistreatment
of American citizens as a consequence of that. But that's nothing compared
to the mistakes made internationally. A war of choice in Iraq, responding to 9/11 with trillions of dollars wasted and lives, millions of lives destroyed. Afghanistan, 20 years on, a failed war with the Taliban returning to power and a failed state. Yes, bin Laden was killed, and I think people
around the world cheered that, not just in the United States, and Al Qaeda was destroyed
at the highest levels and in many cases uprooted completely. But no one can look back
on the 20-plus years since 9/11 and say that the American response
with the war on terror was successful. You can't do that. And Israel is not the United States. The Americans have extraordinary
strength and resilience in its national security capabilities
and the size of its economy, also in where it's located geopolitically. Israel certainly has the military
strength in the region, but the the country is small. The territory is small. And certainly it is not in a geopolitical
space that is comfortable. And so I think the danger here is that as the Israelis
respond against Hamas, as they should and as they must, and as they work to destroy the leadership
of that terrorist organization and disarm the militants that are involved
in the attacks against Israel and pose an ongoing threat. But that is certainly not the only
knock-on consequences of Israel's decision making. And the potential for this
to become a broader war that would envelop
the Middle East in conflagration and that ultimately could even end Israel is real in a way that the war on terror
could not have threatened the United States existentially. And I, as a consequence,
I certainly believe that a unity government
will make it less likely that the Israelis overreact in that way. I certainly believe
that the United States, in providing very strong
and committed support, but also notes of caution
in what can be done and what should not be done, will hopefully restrain
the worst impulses. And, you know,
in the early moments, again, we all understand why Israel
would feel the need to react in the harshest possible way. But I certainly worry when I see the Israeli defense minister refer to the attackers as inhuman animals and announce a siege
on the entirety of Gaza, which means no food,
no electricity, no water. And this is a territory
that already has 50 percent poverty, already has fewer
than half of its population with access to clean water. I worry about what that is going to mean for the Palestinian people as well as for Israel long-term. You know, I think
it was Golda Meir who says, ""I won't hate you
for killing our children. I will hate you for making me
kill your children."" Ultimately, the Israeli population
is most threatened by what the terrorists of Hamas
unleash from Israel. HW: So do you think that was part
of the incentive for Hamas in doing this? Because surely they knew
that the response would be swift. And surely they knew that the world
would rally around such atrocities. So what do you think was their motivation, and do you think that they
underestimated what might happen? IB: Oh, I don't think they
underestimated what might happen. But it's a compelling question. It's really hard
to put yourself in the mindset of someone like a Hamas leader. But, you know, I had to do that just a few months ago when Yevgeny Prigozhin was marching
with his Wagner forces on Moscow. And people were asking me,
""What is going through this guy's mind?"" Because it's clear
he's going to get killed, right? I mean, you turn
against the Kremlin and Putin, you’re not walking away from that. And when he cut the “deal” and everyone said,
""Oh you know, he cut a deal"" -- He's dead man walking. Like, literally, that was the reality. And as soon as the Hamas leaders decided that they were going
to commit these atrocities against Israeli civilians, they're dead. There is no future for these people. So I think there are two
different things going on. The first, and this is
analogous to Prigozhin, is that Hamas felt themselves in an increasingly untenable environment, that they were losing
their support in the region. And even the Saudis
were about to normalize their relationship with Israel. They had no influence in ability
to get anything done, no leverage with the Israeli government, which was only becoming harder
and harder lined against them. And in that regard, they were increasingly in a corner. Their options were increasingly all bad. And, you know, we know that people that find themselves
only with horrible options frequently do irrational things. And I would not underestimate that in driving the decision of Hamas
to take that action. It's kind of like why would 77 percent
of a Gaza population in the last elections they had,
which was some time ago, why would they vote
for an organization like Hamas? Well, I mean, they wouldn't
if they had economic opportunities. They wouldn't, if they had education, they wouldn't if they could come
and go from Gaza as they please. But the worse the situation gets, the more they are willing
to vote for an organization that is prepared to burn it all down. And by the way, there's a lesson in that, even for those of us in very wealthy, very stable countries. So I think that's one set of motivations, but another set of motivations certainly is an ideological effort of Hamas to insert themselves as more dominant
in the conversation, to radicalize the Israeli population, to undermine the Palestinian
Authority in the West Bank. Because if this fight, you know, gets the Israelis to kill huge numbers
of Palestinian civilians, and by the way, Hamas
will facilitate that, right? I mean, Hamas is absolutely going to be
engaged in operations, you know, in residential buildings. They do that intentionally. They're not going to make it easy
for Israel to take them out. They want to make it bloody. They want to paint the Israelis as just
as bad as Hamas, if not worse. They will take human shields. The IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, usually gives warnings about when
they're about to attack a building. They ask the civilians to leave. Well, Hamas tells those civilians
that that's disinformation. They do everything they can to make the Israelis seem complicit with the kind of indiscriminate
attacks against civilians that Hamas engages in themselves. They want to bring
the Israelis to their level. And they also want to radicalize
the Palestinians in response, not just in Gaza but also in the West Bank. And they want to radicalize
the Arab street. They want people across
the region to be, you know, in uproar against Israel and in solidarity with the Hamas cause and in solidarity
with the destruction of Israel. They want Arab leaders to be saying what the Iranian supreme leader
was posting on social media this weekend, calling essentially for a genocide
against the Zionist regime. That is ideologically what Hamas
is trying to accomplish. And again, Israel must do
everything in its power not to allow Hamas to drag them there. HW: It’s interesting, in your talk
in Vancouver this year at TED2023, you were talking about the rise
of different orders, and I do just get the sense
that everything is connected. You have Russia,
you have Ukraine, you have Iran. There are these ideological battles
that are now becoming real-world wars. And so I wonder if you can,
especially the mention of Iran, I don't think it's confirmed yet,
the intervention of Iran in this, but certainly the ""Journal"" was
reporting that Iran had been involved, deeply involved
in setting up these attacks. What does this mean? What does this mean
for the world at large? And then I also have
a follow up question, which is, what do you think the US should do? IB: So let's talk in terms of the world
at large and starting with Iran, certainly that ""Wall Street Journal""
piece over the weekend drove an enormous amount of news. It was saying, hey,
the Iranians basically planned this. I will tell you, that was a very
lightly sourced piece, relying on Hamas. And I would not have gone
to print with that if I had been ""The Journal."" HW: Yeah, the US has not
confirmed that at all. IB: In fact, the US has actually said that there is not
hard evidence at this point that fingers Iran
as having directly orchestrated or ordered these attacks. Now, let's be very clear. The Iranians have publicly expressed strongest possible
support for Hamas. The Iranians have historically funded and provided military support
directly for Hamas. So they clearly are not innocents in this. And I would be surprised to learn that the Iranians had no idea
that this was going to happen. I suspect that they were aware. But awareness and orchestration
are two very different things. Now, since the attacks occurred, Hezbollah, which of course,
is also very much aligned with Iran and gets a lot of direct military support
and training from the Iranians, they have, I say only,
but in this context, is only, they've only engaged
in some missile strikes, some rocket strikes
against an Israeli military -- not base, but military outpost. A soldier’s outpost. And the Israelis, in response, immediately engaged in strikes
back against Hezbollah. That's it. If the Iranians were behind this
and wanted to be seen as behind this, Hezbollah would be involved
in these attacks. They are far more capable than Hamas. The Iranians have claimed
that they have had no role, that this was an autonomous
Hamas operation. And indeed, Iran has been doing
better geopolitically of late. The Chinese facilitated a breakthrough in Iranian relations with the Saudis. The Iranians have engaged
with the United States, and six billion dollars of Iranian assets
are set to be unfrozen, have not been unfrozen yet,
but are set to be transferred to Iran. Five American civilians
that were held unjustly as hostages in Iranian jails
have been released and sent to the United States. The Iranians have reduced
the top level of uranium enrichment and some of their stockpiles,
allowing inspectors in. Now, this is not a return to the Iranian
nuclear deal, the JCPOA, but certainly on the basis of all of that and even some high-level discussion that the Iranians might be willing
to engage directly with the United States diplomatically
through the good offices of Oman, none of that seems aligned at all with the Iranians pulling the trigger
on an attack against Israel that would almost certainly lead
to massive retaliation once the Israelis found that out. So I am sitting here saying I would be surprised, not with a high level of confidence, and, you know, the Iranian regime
has a very old supreme leader who is also dealing
with internal instability and a transition that is coming. So never say never. But I would be quite surprised
if we found out that the Iranians directly ordered this. Now, it is useful that the United States
has both sent a fleet off of the Israeli coast
to show stalwart support and will be providing a level
of at least military coordination and operational intelligence,
may well do much more than that. We can get to that when we talk
about the United States, but is also very publicly saying ""We do not yet have any evidence
that the Iranians are involved."" In other words, the message
from the United States is very clear: do not expand this war into Iran, because the consequences of that
are 150-dollar crude at a minimum. The consequences of that is the world
goes back into global recession. The consequences of that
are conflagration in the region. And I think, I do believe that the Israeli government
is quite aligned with the United States in not wanting to go there. HW: I keep coming back
to the human cost of this because the reality is
that people are suffering, people are being killed, and many more people
are likely to be killed. If, indeed Hamas has kind of
hijacked this story with extremist action, I wonder what you see
from the Palestinian side of kind of a more moderate type of push
towards trying to get understanding, trying to get peace in this nation or trying to get peace in this area. IB: I mean, that's the most
tragic piece of this, is the ability of Hamas
to successfully hijack big pieces of the political spectrum
for the Palestinians. I mean, there are so many people
in the West right now that view the Palestinians
as equivalent to Hamas, and nothing could be further
from the truth. But that reality, that perception is going
to make life so much worse for the people
that have suffered the most. They are the powerless. The Palestinians are the stateless. They lack resources. They lack a proper military. They lack the capacity
to defend their own territory and to defend themselves. And we've already seen, even over this most tragic
weekend for Israel, that the number of deaths
and casualties for the Palestinians are almost as much
as they were for the Israelis. And when you go back
over the past 20 years, who've had the most deaths, who've had the most casualties, consistently, it's been the Palestinians. Who's going to suffer
the most going forward? Consistently, it will be the Palestinians. Who suffered the most
from the US war on terror? It was, of course, the Iraqis
and all of the tribes in Afghanistan. This should not surprise anyone,
but it is the unfortunate reality that of course, Hamas leadership
will be destroyed. But the biggest damage
that they will have done would have been to their own people. To the Palestinian people, who now will face almost
unfathomable deprivation. And there’s very little that the rest
of the world is going to do about it. HW: Do you see a movement within Palestine
to step up if Hamas is done? IB: I certainly believe that the Palestinian Authority
will try to see this as an opportunity to push
for more international engagement from the region to take seriously a cessation
of illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank, a rolling back of the territory
that is presently occupied and a revival of peace talks that would bring about
a two-state solution where the Palestinians, less land than perhaps they would have gotten
in the days of, you know, Arafat and Rabin, but nonetheless, something that feels sustainable, a country that one might be able to raise
children with a sense of hope. There is no one in the occupied
territories of Palestine that could say that for themselves
for their children today. So I think that is the hope. But, you know, clearly right now
is not the time for that. Not because we don't want it, but because events
will overtake it immediately and have already overtaken. Now, the hope is that the violence
that will spread in the West Bank can be contained. That we do not see a war in Gaza
become a war in the West Bank, that we do not see an occupation of Gaza
become an occupation of the West Bank. That is, I think, the priority now. You have to know sometimes when you actually have
a trajectory for peace, and when you have to do
your best to avoid war expanding. We do not have a trajectory
for peace right now. We are at war. There were plenty of opportunities
over the past years to take off ramps, to engage more seriously. They were ignored. And it is precisely that reality that has brought us to a point
where we now are on defense, where we are hoping that this
does not get much, much worse. That is the story
of the Middle East today. HW: Do you think Israel will annex Gaza? IB: I think the Israelis don't know. Again, don't underestimate the shock, the emotional shock that all of the Israelis are facing today. They are not making long-term strategic
decisions right now. They are making immediate,
short-term decisions. What can we do to make sure
the country is still defended, our borders are still secure, that terrorists are not, you know, right now running around in our midst,
planning further atrocities? That is priority number one. And very close to it is getting those hostages back and safe and I'd say unharmed. They've already experienced a lot of harm. That's beyond the realm
of possibility right now. There will be, in the coming weeks,
and there's also some shock and awe, you know, Netanyahu immediately posting, some buildings getting demolished in Gaza and saying we are, you know, at war. That is, I mean, they’ve engaged
in these sorts of airstrikes before, and we already know of families
that have gotten killed, entire families in some cases of nine,
of 13 people, lots of children, this sort of thing. We will see that. But in terms of what's the nature
of the long-term objectives, the occupation, the Israelis are not close
to making that decision. And I also think that other countries
that Israel trusts and Israel needs will have some ability
to have influence over Israel in making that decision. I'm not just talking about the US now. I'm also talking
about countries in the region that Israel would like
to maintain relations with. So there needs to be very active
multilateral diplomacy behind the scenes, quietly, high-level,
with the Israeli government in the coming days and weeks. HW: I want to talk a little bit
about the media coverage of the attacks and of what is happening right now. A lot of the people who had
written in with questions for you are really confused
by the rhetoric that they're seeing. They're not sure what to trust,
who to trust, what to believe. And I want to get your sense,
you're a very online person. And so what is your take on this, and how can we think about how
to understand what's happening, especially in such a kind of,
real-time situation? IB: Well, first of all,
there's always the fog of war. There's always disinformation
from both sides actively trying to promote a narrative that is more effective for them, that they're doing better
than they otherwise are, and that the other side
is engaged in greater atrocities than they actually are. You see lots of that, lots of immediately
fake videos putting out of buildings that are being destroyed, people that are being killed, you know, sort of, people that are providing,
you know, sort of, support for, sort of, ""kill all the Jews""
and ""kill all the Palestinians"" that actually came
from previous conflicts, not from the present one. There's plenty of that. This time around, there's also so much more hatred. There's, on social media especially, there's so much more willingness
to promote, algorithmically, opinions that you would never
hear in your family, that you would never hear
in your community, in your school, but it's being bombarded. And this is very different
from the so-called mainstream media, whether it's the BBC or the Deutsche Welle or it's Fox News or CNN. No, no. Social media has become a far more greatly
polarized and hate-filled space. I've received at least 30 death threats over the last 48 hours from complete randos. A few people that I actually
could track if I really needed to, most anonymous accounts. But clearly people
that are writing me directly, some of whom are really,
really pro-Israel, some of whom are really,
really pro-Palestine and some of whom are probably
just trolling for the lolz, as they like to say. It is increasingly very hard
to navigate this space without becoming incensed and deranged. Having said that, as much as I find Twitter/X a space antithetical to civil society, I also know, as someone who does analysis, that some of the best real-time
information from sources on the ground is being passed through on X
and is not found in other places. It will not come through
in mainstream media. So for the average person, you need to spend a lot more time
filtering and figuring out where to go and who to follow. But it still is the one place
that you can go. And you know, it really does, the whole thing profoundly worries me because when you're in an environment that you can no longer know what is truth, what is real information, it is really hard to maintain
a society that is human. When you have people that are saying that all Israelis are X
and all Palestinians are Y, and that is where much of social media, I mean, a strong majority
of social media is there right now, you cannot have dialogue,
you cannot have solutions, and you can very easily tilt into war, into radicalism, into fascism. This is something we all need
to be guarded against. And I truly believe that the social media companies
need to be regulated on this. They are acting as if they have no
responsibility for what's on their sites. That, you know, it's just
like the phone company. That if you and I, Helen,
are having a conversation about blowing something up, well, we're responsible for that. But the phone company
isn't responsible, and I accept that. But, Helen, if you and I are having
a conversation about blowing something up and then the phone company
takes that conversation, identifies everyone else that might be interested in blowing
something up or has considered it, and takes that conversation
and promotes it to them, then you, the phone company,
are responsible, you are liable, you should be taken down. And we are in a war right now, and the social media companies
are actively fanning the flames. They are spraying fuel on the flames,
and they’re doing it globally. Globally, so much so that countries
like China that are authoritarian and control their media space actually have sort of an intrinsic
political stability advantage in ""information warfare""
over open societies that should be the most resilient. That’s crazy, and we can’t keep
going down that path. HW: The ironies are writ large. OK, so we are coming on our time, but I wonder if you can
leave us with a sense of what should we be watching for next? What should we be looking for? IB: First, we need to look for Lebanon. This is the issue of Hezbollah, which so far has been the dog
that has not barked. Is that going to continue? It is the place that you are most likely
to see tipping point escalation if it were to occur. And you have Hezbollah operatives
of many different stripes. They are loosely organized, they're well-trained. But that doesn't mean
that they're all following, you know, marching orders from one direct leader. The potential that this could -- you could see escalation with some
Israeli farmers getting killed, and then the Israelis respond. And before you know it,
you're in a much bigger firefight. Lebanon's involved, Hezbollah is involved,
and then it knocks on to Iran. That is sort of the gateway drug
in the Middle East even if nobody wants that fight. That's one thing to watch. Second thing to watch, of course, imminently is what happens
with these hostages. Do the Israelis get them back? Historically, that has always
been the top priority, and it is today. But Hamas has control over that. And, you know, if the Israelis
are not prepared to negotiate with Hamas to release militants presently
in Israel prisons, and it's very hard for me to imagine
in today's environment they would be willing to do that, well, how exactly do they get them back and how many of them
can they actually free? Again, you know, the Israelis
and the Americans have far, far better tradecraft on the ability
to get these hostages out than Hamas have to take them. But Hamas has exceeded expectations
over the past 48 hours, and I would worry very much about that. That would be the second thing
I'd watch most closely right now. And then finally, the nature
of the Israeli government itself. Do we have success in putting together
a unified national emergency government, in which case we will have more
stability in governance and decision making that comes from Israel and also greater willingness to consider
longer-term engagement with those Palestinians,
particularly in the West Bank, to start, at least, that might be looking
for a more constructive path now that they are back on the agenda. I don't have a high amount of optimism
that that's going to happen. But you asked me for something hopeful,
that would be something hopeful. HW: Ian Bremmer, we are so grateful
for your time and for your insight. Thank you so much
for joining us, stay well. IB: My pleasure Helen."
98,H7FML0wzJ6A,Al-Nakba: The Palestinian catastrophe - Episode 1 | Featured Documentary,"Al-Nakba: The Palestinian catastrophe

""The Nakba did not begin in 1948. Its origins lie over two centuries ago….""

So begins this four-part series on the 'nakba', meaning the 'catastrophe', about the history of the Palestinian exodus that led to the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948, and the establishment of the state of Israel.

This sweeping history starts back in 1799 with Napoleon's attempted advance into Palestine to check British expansion and his appeal to the Jews of the world to reclaim their land in league with France.

The narrative moves through the 19th century and into the 20th century with the British Mandate in Palestine and comes right up to date in the 21st century and the ongoing 'nakba' on the ground.

Arab, Israeli and Western intellectuals, historians and eye-witnesses provide the central narrative which is accompanied by archive material and documents, many only recently released for the first time.

For Palestinians, 1948 marks the 'nakba' or the 'catastrophe', when hundreds of thousands were forced out of their homes.

But for Israelis, the same year marks the creation of their own state.

This series attempts to present an understanding of the events of the past that are still shaping the present.

This story starts in 1799, outside the walls of Acre in Ottoman-controlled Palestine, when an army under Napoleon Bonaparte besieged the city. It was all part of a campaign to defeat the Ottomans and establish a French presence in the region.

In search of allies, Napoleon issued a letter offering Palestine as a homeland to the Jews under French protection. He called on the Jews to ‘rise up’ against what he called their oppressors.

Napoleon’s appeal was widely publicised. But he was ultimately defeated. In Acre today, the only memory of him is a statue atop a hill overlooking the city.

Yet Napoleon's project for a Jewish homeland in the region under a colonial protectorate did not die, 40  years later, the plan was revived but by the British.

their homes for israelis that year marks the creation of the state of israel as a filmmaker and as a palestinian this documentary series was my way to understand the events of the past that are still shaping the present do our story starts here in 1799 outside the walls of acre in ottoman-controlled palestine an army under napoleon bonaparte besieged the city all part of a campaign to defeat the ottomans and establish a french presence in the region in search of allies napoleon issued a letter offering palestine as a homeland to the jews under french protection he called on the jews to rise

napoleon's project for a jewish homeland in the region under a colonial protectorate did not die forty years later the plan was revived by the british this time as a means of thwarting the rising power of egyptian governor muhammad ali in 1840 british foreign secretary lord palmerston wrote to his ambassador in constantinople urging him to convince the sultan and his entourage to open palestine for the immigration of jews at that time there were estimated to be no more than 3 000 jews in ottoman-controlled palestine over the years jewish immigration to palestine increased helped on by wealthy benefactors one of these was the french aristocrat baron edmund de rothschild he began visiting palestine in the 1880s and became one of the jewish community's leading sponsors he spent over 14 million french francs to establish 30 jewish settlements the most important was richard led zeon founded in 1882 today the remains of baron de child lie in a mausoleum in northern israel it's a popular site for israeli school children learning about the wealthy patron who bankrolled jewish settlement building in palestine over 100 years ago in 1885 the term zionism was first coined by austrian writer nathan birnbaum it's derived from the word zion one of the biblical names for jerusalem zionism came to mean the establishment of a jewish homeland in palestine but not all jews supported this money yeah in 1896 theodore herzl an austro-hungarian journalist wrote a book called the jewish state it is considered one of the most important texts of early zionism herzl envisioned the founding of a future independent jewish state during the 20th century his colleague max nordau sent two rabbis to palestine to investigate the prospects for a jewish state there their report concluded the bride is beautiful but she is married to another man the rabbis understood that palestine's spouse was the palestinian society rooted in its soil in 1897 herzl with birenbaum and nordau convened the first zionist congress in the swiss city of basel the congress adopted a programme for the establishment of a homeland for the jewish people in palestine within in 1907 the british government set up a committee to devise a strategy toward the muslim arab population of the ottoman empire the committee's report submitted to british prime minister henry campbell bannerman in 1907 recommended establishing a so-called buffer state in palestine the report proposed this state be hostile to its neighbors and friendly to europe the aim was to divide the region and so assure britain's continued imperial dominance home in 1907 heim weissmann a chemist who had emerged as a leader among british zionists visited palestine for the first time he set out to establish a company in jaffa to develop the land of palestine a practical means to pursue the zionist dream of building a jewish state his venture was supported by baron de rothschild within three years a major deal was struck the jewish national fund set up to buy land in palestine purchased some ten thousand dunhams in the maj bin amer region of northern palestine the sale to the jewish national fund had dire consequences for the thousands of palestinian farmers living on the land foreign a more uh drastic form of colonialism than the average classical european colonialism in the sense that their purpose was actually not so only to exploit the locals but to drive them out from the very early moment the zionist movement targeted palestine as the the place for jewish independence and statehood and it was clear that there were palestinians on the land uh zionists leaders and common people alike were got used to the idea that the only way of making palestine a jewish state is by causing the palestinians leave a jewish militia known as hashemer was established to protect the growing number of jewish settlements jews held demonstrations to demand the recognition of hebrew as an official language under ottoman rule surya a palestinian pharmacist began publishing a newspaper called al carmel in it he warned of zionism as a movement aimed at displacing the palestinians he wrote the jewish state would be a poisonous dagger in the heart of the arabs the outbreak of world war 1 in 1914 created new opportunities to um in 1915 a secret memorandum was presented to the british cabinet under the title the future of palestine it was drafted by herbert samuel a british politician and zionist committed to palestine becoming a home for the jewish people in the document samuel advised that the time was not right for the establishment of an autonomous jewish state in palestine he recommended instead that palestine be annexed to the british empire describing this as the most welcome solution to the supporters of the zionist movement he expressed the hope that under british rule and over time more jews would settle in the land and grow into a majority among what he called the muhammadans of arab race samuel's recommendations were taken into account in the secret british french agreement formulated by british politician sir mark sykes and french diplomat francois georges pico the sykes pico agreement opened the way for the establishment of a jewish state in 1917 the british cabinet headed by prime minister david lloyd george pledged to establish a homeland for the jews in palestine the pledge came in the form of a letter from the british foreign secretary arthur balfour to the influential british zionist lord walter rothschild britain had no moral or political or legal right to promise the land that belonged to the arabs to another people so the balfour declaration was both immoral and illegal a month after balfour's pledge a meeting took place in london to celebrate the declaration speakers included lord rothschild herbert samuel mark sykes and haim weissmann just several days later on december the 11th 1917 the british army commanded by general edmund allenby captured jerusalem entering the holy city alongside allenby was a jewish military unit established under british auspices one member of this unit was david ben-gurion who would later be israel's first prime minister the unit also included zev japotinsky a future zionist leader as well as nehemiah rabin soon to be father of young boy yitzhak rabin within a month general allenby welcomed heim weissmann in jerusalem there were approximately 50 000 jews in palestine at this time 10 percent of the population among half a million arabs the great war ended in 1918 and preparations were made for a peace conference in paris president of the united states woodrow wilson commissioned an investigation into the non-turkish areas of the former ottoman empire the commission was headed by the academic dr henry king and the politician charles crane when it was eventually published the crane king report proved to be political dynamite the report stated that the non-jewish population of palestine nearly nine tenths of the whole was emphatically against the zionist program the report went on to warn that anti-zionist feeling in palestine and syria was intense and not likely to be flouted it divulged conversations with british officers who suggested a force of not less than 50 000 soldiers would be required to initiate the zionist program the authors judged all this as evidence of what they described as a strong sense of the injustice of the zionist program the report concluded jewish immigration should be definitely limited and the project for making palestine distinctly a jewish commonwealth should be given up the crane king report fell on death ears at the paris peace conference in 1919 britain was represented by prime minister david lloyd george and arthur balfour a delegation from the zionist organization attended headed by haim weissman they presented a map seen here proposing the area to be allocated for a jewish homeland the map included both palestine and the east bank of the jordan river as well as parts of what are today southern lebanon and syria parallel to the conference the leader of the arab delegation prince faisal bin hussein signed with the zionist delegation's leader what became known as the faisal weissmann agreement it outlined faisal's approval for a jewish homeland in palestine and an arab nation in the larger middle east the agreement was mediated by lieutenant colonel thomas edward lawrence known as lawrence of arabia faisal signed adding in his own handwriting that the agreement be dependent on the arabs gaining their independence is habilihood in 1920 the first british high commissioner for palestine was appointed controversially london selected herbert samuel for the post samuel was a committed zionist many suspected he would set out to implement what he had proposed five years earlier by favouring jewish immigration to transform palestine into a jewish homeland in 1922 the league of nations formalized british rule in palestine the second clause of the british mandate document approved by the league of nations stipulated the british mandatory shall be responsible for placing the country under political administrative and economic conditions that will secure the establishment of the jewish national home british high commissioner herbert samuel decreed hebrew as an official language of palestine alongside arabic and english the letters e and y were added to the word palestine in hebrew as an abbreviation of the words eretz israel meaning land of israel britain provided the muscle um under which they could simply emigrate i mean they couldn't have immigrated were it not for the british presence because the um the crucial battle in the early stages was simply getting jews into palestine and acquiring land they couldn't have done that without british government's sponsorship palestinians viewed the british mandatory authority and british troops on the ground as siding with the jews more and more palestinian farmers expelled from farmlands began to join newly formed revolutionary groups in 1921 palestinians organized large demonstrations against jewish immigration at that time the palestinian leadership was in effect hereditary within one family the grand mufti of jerusalem amin al-husseini inherited his position at the age of 25 following the death of his brother who had in turn succeeded their father the leadership sent successive delegations to london to discuss the palestinian question is the changes on the ground in palestine can be noted in the british government's report to the council of the league of nations in 1925. the document reported the immigration of more than 33 000 jews who were granted palestinian nationality this was three times the figure of the previous year thirteen new settlements were built according to the report a jewish labor union called the histadrut had been set up under the direction of david ben-gurion and the jewish town of tel aviv was accorded municipal autonomy in addition the hebrew university was officially opened in 1925 at a ceremony attended by british high commissioner herbert samuel the former british foreign secretary arthur balfour and the head of the zionist organization heim weissmann as weissmann's guest balfour visited a number of jewish settlements in jerusalem he met with samuel and alan b the two men who had helped implement the policy he himself had laid out eight years earlier in the famous balfour declaration the palestinians went on strike to protest against balfour's visit they raised black flags to signal their opposition to the policies balfour had set in train the palestinians were in somber mood not so the zionists say weissmann congratulated samuel for his work towards the establishment of a national jewish homeland the zionist movement was active in its propaganda this film in french showed the map of palestine with areas highlighted as land the zionists claimed to have acquired as of 1925. the film also shows the areas zionists planned to acquire within the next 25 years in the summer of 1929 ardent zionist groups organized a gathering at the wailing wall in jerusalem known to the palestinians as al-buraq the incident ignited violent demonstrations called the burak revolt led by a palestinian farmer named farhan al-sadi more than 100 arabs and jews were killed on both sides sir john chancellor the new british high commissioner in palestine issued a strongly worded memorandum calling for all those who took part in the revolt to be severely punished three palestinians were arrested and accused of participating in the revolt they were fuad hassan hijazi from safad atta ahmed al-zir from hebron and muhammad khalil jamjum whose picture could not be found the three men were jailed here at acre prison the british sentenced them to death arab delegations pleaded for their sentences to be commuted but on june the 17th 1930 the british authorities had the three men executed a cemetery in acre still contains the graves of the three men in a final statement before their execution they had written at the end of our lives we say to the arab leaders and muslims all over the world do not trust the foreigners we lived and died for the arab cause such sentiments of anti-colonialism and pan-arabism would become increasingly common in subsequent decades during the first 10 years of the british mandate the number of jews in palestine more than doubled to reach 175 000 zionists all over the world we're proud of their achievement i am here today to ask you my fellow zionists which attitude shall we take which of the possible attitudes that we face shall be our own i would say to england though i am only an american jew but an old time reverencing admirer of great britain i would say to england if i could an arab palestine is a threat to great britain and a menace to the world a jewish palestine is an asset to great written and a blessing for the world god with heim weissmann beside him former british prime minister david lloyd george reaffirmed his own zionist credentials it is as your german has reminded you it is nearly 16 years since he recruited me to the zionist movement palestine baron and malarial swamps have been converted into happy settlements science has been harnessed to water which had been running wild in waste since the early days of creation without vegetation and without life empty desertion that is palestine british news bulletins at the time described palestine as akin to a desert the reality was very different happy british politicians of the early 20th century had a distorted view of palestinian society frequently labeling it as [ __ ] despite the population including over 100 000 palestinian christians they did not regard them as yet belonging to either an arab national group in general or to local national groups uh the only way they were able to view them was as a religious uh group of believers so i think they they missed the point for instance that christians and muslims actually founded a new identity and not a religious one but the national one is for by 1933 protests against jewish immigration were becoming ever more frequent in palestine women took part side by side with men the british authorities cracked down on demonstrations and arrested thousands many were killed and wounded the 80 year old former mayor of jerusalem was beaten by british soldiers during a demonstration in jaffa he later died of his injuries the british authorities became ever more heavy-handed this letter was written by a palestinian policeman condemning the behavior of his british senior officer john faraday a number of other complaints were filed against faraday the officer was never charged four years later faraday was awarded the king's police medal for his valuable services in palestine in only still images of the palestinian demonstrations are available in the archives movie cameras did capture jewish life in palestine as well as british pomp and ceremony this footage shows the star of david flagg over the tel aviv municipality building this is footage of work in the diamond factories of tel aviv and this footage shows the flow of new immigrants and the building of new settlements footage of palestinian life in the early 20th century proved more difficult to find a palestinian film archive had once existed but had since been lost or gone mysteriously missing we spent months searching for pictures of palestinian lives eventually in the vaults of the british library we found glimpses of this bygone era most of the palestinians intellectuals leaders journalists were still unaware how determined the zionist movement is of dispossessing them from palestine in the 1930s the number of jews immigrating to palestine began to increase significantly from 4 000 in 1931 the figure jumped to 9500 the following year in 1933 the number rose to 30 000 in 1934 42 000 and in 1935 a further jump to 62 thousand that same year palestinian poet abdul raheem mahmoud wrote a poem which he read aloud to prince saubin abdul aziz of saudi arabia who was visiting jerusalem he asked did you come to visit the holy axa mosque or to bid it farewell before it is lost foreign a revolutionary group to strike at zionist and british targets in 1935 in the hills near janine he and a small band of men were surrounded by british forces making a defiant stand al qasam and those with him were killed the palestinian political leadership came under pressure to halt negotiations with the british palestinian poet ibrahim tukan addressed a poem to the leadership in 1935 a poem dripping with iron oh you sincere patriots you who carry the heavy burden of the cause only a fragment of the country remains for us so please step down before the remaining parts fly away on april 19th 1936 palestinian anger boiled over protests erupted in the city of jaffa in coordination with a general strike the wave of anger spread throughout palestine the reasons for the protests were explained by a spokesman for the palestinian political leadership the main case of the arabs is against the british government's policy in palestine a policy which if continued will surely have as a result the replacement of the arabs by the jews against all principles the british government imposed the balfour declaration which is abhorred by all arabs in the near east and on favoring the establishment of a national home for jews for god intentionally to safeguard the civil rights of the non-jewish population the arabs who decided on a general and a complete strike until the total and immediate stoppage of jewish immigration is brought about and until the government introduces an essential change in its present qualities utility the 1936 revolt shocked the british mandatory authorities who carried out harsh punitive actions anyone suspected of links with the revolutionaries was arrested their homes destroyed in jaffa alone more than 200 houses were demolished as a collective punishment demolitions in other villages and cities followed the british insisted that destroying palestinian houses was justified as a means to end the revolt foreign foreign during the arab revolt david ben-gurion then a prominent leader of the zionist movement reportedly made a startling suggestion to the british high commissioner arthur warhol ben-gurion is said to have suggested all palestinians expelled from their land by jewish settlement building should be resettled in neighboring trans jordan the british high commissioner is reported to have replied that this was in his words a good idea
99,ffRfIfGgjmw,Israel Palestine War | What is Happening? |  Explained by Dhruv Rathee,"On October 7th, a significant escalation occurred between Israel and Palestine. Hamas launched thousands of rockets from Gaza into Israel, leading to casualties on both sides. Israel retaliated with 'Operation Iron Swords', targeting Hamas assets in Gaza. The international community, including India, the US, the EU, and others, have expressed their concerns and stands on the issue. A major point of discussion is the failure of Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, to predict such an attack. While the Palestinian cause has historical roots and deserves attention, the use of terrorism is condemned. It's essential to remember our shared humanity and hope for a peaceful resolution, envisioning a united Israel-Palestine with liberty and equality for all.

----------------------------------------------------",2023-10-10,14009131,537179,70055,UC-CSyyi47VX1lD9zyeABW3w," Hello, friends! Another conflict has broken out 
between Israel and Palestine. At 6.30 AM on the morning of 7th October, While most of the Israelis were 
sleeping soundly in their homes, suddenly, the air raid sirens began blaring. In a short while, thousands of 
rockets were fired at Israeli cities. Israeli Defence Forces estimate that 2,200 rockets were fired. However, the group Ham_s claims that 5,000 rockets were fired. Israel has an Iron Dome system. It is one of the best air defence systems in the world. Whenever rockets are fired on Israel, it uses the latest military technology to intercept the rockets 
and destroy them midflight to keep the country protected. But here, 5,000 rockets were fired within 20 minutes. This Iron Dome system failed. Thousands of people were k_lled and injured 
in Israel because of these attacks. This surprise attack is the biggest 
in the last few decades that has been seen in 
the Israel-Palestine conflict. And it reminds us of the Yom Kippur War. Exactly 50 years ago, in October 1973, Egypt and Syria had launched 
a similar surprise attack on Israel. After that, a war broke out Known as the Yom Kippur War. And this attack is no less 
than a full-scale war. In addition to the rocket strikes, Ham_s launched a multi-pronged attack from the ground, sea, and air. The boundary wall on the Israel-Gaza border was broken down by a bulldozer. Many Palestinians were seen 
entering Israeli territory. Some on motorcycles, some using motor-powered hang-gliders to enter Israel through the air. Apart from this, Ham_s also attacked Israel 
from the sea using speedboats. Many events took place within a day. A military base on the Israel-Gaza border 
was also attacked. An Israeli tank was captured. Many Israeli soldiers were captured and held hostages by the Ham_s group. And the Israeli villages and cities on the border were infiltrated by arm_d t_rr_rists of Ham_s. Many innocent civilians have been k_ll_d here,  many are being held as hostages and Israel has declared a state of war in response. The Israeli military carried out airstrikes in Gaza, In which thousands of Palestinians
were k_lled or injured. Let's take a look at the map 
to understand the context of this situation. Israel and Palestine are located in the Middle East. In the North is the country of Lebanon. In the Northeast, there is Syria. In the East, there is Jordan. In the South West, there is Egypt. And in the West, is the Mediterranean Sea. If you zoom in on both countries, the area in the middle is the country of Israel. And the territories of Palestine are divided into two parts. One is the region of the West Bank, which is in the west of Jordan and the other is the Gaza Strip which is in the south-west of Israel and borders Egypt. There are many Israeli settlements 
in the Palestinian territory of the West Bank. They are under Israel’s control. And are considered illegal by the United Nations
and many other countries. The Palestinian territories in the West Bank are administered by Palestinian Authorities under the control of Fatah. A political party. On the other hand, the Gaza Strip is controlled independently by Ham_s. There has been a separate conflict 
between Fatah and Ham_s historically. Ham_s is an extremist Palestinian organisation which is considered a t_rr_rist organisation 
by most countries. Canada, the European Union, Israel, Japan, Australia, the USA, and the UK designate Ham_s as a t_rr_rist organisation. On the other hand, it is not considered
a t_rr_rist organisation by Brazil, China, Egypt, Iran, Norway, Qatar, Russia, Syria, and Turkey. There are also some countries 
that consider only Ham_s' military wing as a t_rr_rist organisation. Like New Zealand and Paraguay. This is geopolitically relevant because you will see how differently these countries 
are reacting to the current situation. If we look at the map of the current conflict, we can see that the Gaza Strip is shown in red colour. And the extent to which Israeli territory has 
been infiltrated by the Palestinian milit_nts is shown in blue colour. Ham_s' military commander Mohammad Al-Deif has named this attack 
Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. And said that Ham_s is doing this because Israel has committed atrocities on the Palestinians. And that this is specifically a response of what happened in Al Aqsa mosque. If you want to know about the issue
regarding Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, I talked about it in this video 2 years ago. I will put the link in the description below, you can go and watch it. For the Indian nationals present in Israel the Indian embassy in Israel has issued an advisory that you can see on the screen. In case of an emergency, they can call this number or can send an email to this id. Israel launched its own attack in response, which was named Operation Iron Swords. Israeli Defense Forces, 
also known as IDF in short, have deployed their Navy, Air Force, and Ground Forces. Along with that, they launched drone strikes in Gaza. Israel's Energy Minister signed an order to cut the electricity supply in Gaza. To a large extent, electricity was
 supplied through Israel to Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a television address, ""Citizens of Israel, we are at war."" He said that the en_my will have to 
pay an unprecedented price. The defence minister stated that Ham_s has made a huge mistake and Israel will win this war. A big talking point in this conflict is how Mossad, the world-famous Israeli intelligence agency, failed to intercept this attack. It is said that Mossad is one of the most powerful intelligence agencies. They have informants even in 
the Palestinian military groups. They are in Lebanon, Syria, and in different parts of the world. In the past, it has been seen that Mossad agents have carried out precise timed as_as_inations of major military leaders. Sometimes by placing GPS trackers on vehicles, sometimes by using drone strikes, or sometimes by using mobile phones. If you want to know more about Mossad, I would suggest this audiobook on Kuku FM. It has been explained in great detail. If you don't know Kuku FM, it is India's largest audio-learning platform. It has more than 1.5 million

And now, coming back to Mossad, the question is, despite being such a powerful agency, how did they not know that thousands of rockets were being stockpiled in Gaza? The fencing on the Gaza-Israel border has cameras, ground motion sensors, and regular army patrols are carried out there. Why did these smart barriers fail? Domestically, the Israeli government 
is facing a lot of criticism. The former head of the Israeli Navy told the Israeli TV channel, Channel 12 that this is a huge failure on the part of the government. The entire country is asking about the whereabouts of IDF, police, and security. He told the BBC that a major 
investigation has already begun regarding this intelligence failure. Look at this article from The Times of Israel, According to it, Egypt's intelligence officials had warned Israel repeatedly that something major was about to happen. And allegedly, those warnings were ignored. On the other hand, talking about international reactions, American President Joe Biden condemned this attack and said that he shows 'rock-solid and unwavering support' in favour of Israel. The foreign policy chief of the European Union also said that he strongly condemns this attack and says that according to international law, Israel has the right to defend itself. They said that Israeli hostages 
should be released immediately. Iran, which has been one 
of the main supporters of Ham_s, their foreign ministry said that the attack by Ham_s was an act of 
self-defence by the Palestinians. The foreign ministry of the neighbouring
country Egypt said that it is talking to Saudi Arabia and Jordan in an attempt to diffuse the Israeli-Palestinian tensions. The Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, told to the official news agency WAFA that the Palestinians have the right to protect themselves 
against the t_rr_r of the settlers and foreign troops. As I said, he is from the Fatah party which governs the West Bank. And historically, there have been 
conflicts between Fatah and Ham_s. 2 years ago I made a detailed 
video on the Israel-Palestine conflict in which I explained their long history. In it, I talked about how Jews were persecuted in Europe for centuries and to save their lives they migrated to Palestine and now Palestinians have been reduced 
to refugees in their own country. So Palestine's cause obviously deserves support but not by supporting t_rr_rists. This has been the stance of
 our Indian government, historically. India has always supported the
 Palestinian cause of self-determination under various Prime Ministers, be it Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Manmohan Singh or Prime Minister Modi. ""But the situation in the Middle-East is clear, the land which is occupied by Israel has to be vacated."" Prime Minister Modi has actually 
been the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Palestine. Now the statement from PM Modi has expressed shock at the t_rr_rist attacks and he expressed solidarity with Israel and Israel's innocent victims and their families. And this is not surprising because Ham_s' actions here is nothing but t_rr_rism. Many disturbing videos have come up where Ham_s t_rr_rists have treated 
women and civilians in a way that cannot even be described in this video. It is a very shameful that some people see them as freedom fighters. It is true that there has been injustice 
against the common people in Palestine, but k_lling the common people in Israel, such t_rr_rism can never be justified. I'd like to repeat what I said in the previous video. Ham_s is a designated t_rr_rist organisation. And Israel is a powerful country with a proper democratic government. This is why Israel should use its powers responsibly. Some comm_nal big_ts are very
offended by such statements. On one hand there are people who want 
complete erad_cation of Palestine. They celebrate the attacks on Palestine. Saying that none of them should surv_ve. Without thinking about the common Palestinians and what they go through. On the other hand, there are comm_nal 
people celebrating Ham_s t_rr_rists. They are happy to see Israel being attacked. They want Israel to be destr_yed. And that Israel should not exi_t as a country. When you come across such 
comments on social media, remember that you are a human being, not a vampire thirsty for blood. War-mongering is very easy
 when you are sitting far away. But think about it, if you were in the midst of this war, think about what the ordinary Israeli and 
Palestinian families are going through. For life to come to a halt. And to live in fear that a rocket might hit your building at any moment. Israel is also trying to show that they are carrying out their counter-offensive responsibly. Recently, there was an airstrike on
 a 14-storey building in Palestine. But before the airstrike, Israel
 had issued a 10-minute warning so that the people living in 
the building should evacuate it before the b_mb could hit it. Such warnings have been given before, like the warning given to Fatima Bashir's family before the Israeli airstrike in May this year. Or in August 2022, a 15-minute 
warning was given to Gazans before an Israeli airstrike. Although Israel claims this but the truth is that in Israeli airstrikes, many Palestinian civilians have been k_lled. We hope that there can be long-lasting peace 
between these two countries. But looking at the current situation, it seems that this war is going to continue for a long time. I would suggest that you 
understand the historical context of the conflict between Israel and Palestine. What is the real reason behind it? I have explained it in detail in this video. You can click to watch it. Thank you very much!"

video's next part covering the entire history of the wars and fighting between Israel and Gaza from the 1980s to the current conflict today on the 29th of September 2023 the United States national security adviser who reports directly to the president Jake Sullivan was speaking at the annual Atlantic Festival listing all of the accomplishments that the Biden administration had achieved in the Middle East after years of brutal Warfare that had resulted in more than 300,000 deaths a 19-month long truce in Civil War torn Yemen was continuing to hold the long-running civil war in Syria was beginning to stabilized and settle down as well while Bashar al-assad the longtime Syrian dictator was finally being welcomed back into the Arab League again after more than a decade long suspension over his handling of the war in Syria that had claimed the lives of more than half a million people people brokered by China Saudi Arabia and Iran had finally agreed on restoring their relations in March of 2023 after having been severed 6 years previously brokered by America Saudi Arabia and Israel were also on the cusp of normalizing their relations Iran's attacks against American military bases had stopped and there was a general sense in much of the world that the chronically violent and unstable Middle East was at last beginning to calm down and enter into a new era of Peace Jake Sullivan himself summed up the general foreign policy mood in the region during that speech on the 29th of September when he said the following and the middle east region is quieter today than it has been in two decades now challenges remain Iran's nuclear weapons program the tensions between Israelis and Palestinians but the amount of time that I have to spend on crisis and conflict in the Middle East today compared to any of my predecessors going back to 911 is significantly reduced it would only take 2 weeks for those words to immediately come back and ha on him on the 7th of October 2023 various Palestinian militant groups led by Hamas the organization who rules in the Gaza Strip launched a highly coordinated surprise land sea and air offensive against Israel they managed to fire at least 5,000 Rockets against Israel while around 2500 armed Hamas Fighters managed to break through the walls surrounding Gaza and infiltrated into multiple Villages of Israel itself where they massacred at least 1,400 Israelis and other citizens in a single day we wounded more than 5,000 others and took around 200 Mor as hostages back into Gaza the attack represented the single bloodiest day in the entire history of Israel and the first time since 1948 that a hostile outside military power managed to break into Israel proper it all came as a profound shock to the state of Israel which has since responded with an unprecedented declaration of war against Hamas and Gaza that was followed up by the rapid mobilization of 300,000 Israeli Reserve troops the largest and quickest callup of reserves in Israel's entire history the 16-year long Israeli blockade of Gaza then subsequently transformed into a complete and total Israeli Siege of Gaza with the Israelis blocking off all electricity fuel telecommunications water and medicine from passing into Gaza through any of their territory by land sea or air the Israeli Air Force began initiating a punishing aerial campaign across the Gaza Strip that saw more than 6,000 Israeli bombs dropped across the territory within only the first 6 days of the War beginning more than double the amount of ordinance that the United States L Coalition dropped in an entire month in the war against Isis as the Israeli air strikes continued on the 13th of October Israel ordered that more than 1.1 million Palestinians immediately evacuate from the northern Gaza Strip towards the southern Gaza Strip within 24 hours or be potentially considered as enemy combatants and then 2 weeks later on the 27th of October the Israeli Ground Forces launched their fullscale Invasion into the northern Gaza Strip and as of the production of this video have Gaza City the biggest city in Palestine with a pre-war population of More Than 560,000 People completely encircled once the Israeli ground forces push into Gaza City they will likely experience what many military analysts believe will be nothing less than the most ferocious Urban combat seen in history since the second world war while Israel's stated military objective going forward is to completely destroy Hamas has an institution and its estimated 40,000 Fighters held up in the Gaza Strip while securing the release of the more than 200 hostages that they continue to hold and in pursuit of those War aims the Gaza Health Ministry run by Hamas claims that as of the production of this video the Israeli air strikes and ground Invasion have already killed nearly 10,000 Palestinians within the Gaza Strip and wounded nearly 25,000 more in addition to the estimated 1,000 or so Hamas fighters who were killed within Israel during the initial October 7th Invasion a truly catastrophic War has thus once again returned to the Middle East and the longer that the war continues the longer it risks spreading like a contagion to drag in multiple other powers into an even greater Middle East Wide War the brief era of peace and stability in the Middle East has once again been shattered and in order to understand why this is all suddenly happening right now you only have to go back a few years ago to 2017 and in order to understand how the countdown to war in October of 2023 began originally ticking by the time that 2017 rolled around the deao geopolitical situation of the area was roughly the same as it had been for the past decade ever since 2007 how it got there in 2007 was a very very complicated story but to cover through it all very quickly the British Empire acquired this territory in the Eastern Mediterranean known as mandatory Palestine after defeating the Ottoman Empire in World War I who had ruled the area for centuries before hand most of the people who lived in the Mandate at that time were Arabs but Jewish immigration to the land was increasing in scale as the Zionist movement in Europe sought to flee increasing anti-Semitism in places like Russia and later Germany by establishing an independent Jewish state in the land of their ancient ancestors the British openly stated that they would support the creation of a Jewish state in mandatory Palestine through the Bal for Declaration of 1917 though with vague and undetermined borders as more Jews increasingly came to mandatory Palestine especially after the Nazis Rose to power in Germany the Arabs of the territory resented seeing more of their land getting taken over and so they revolted in 1836 the British squashed that Rebellion but they attempted to Plate the Arabs by restricting further Jewish immigration and land purchases within the Mandate but this policy angered Jewish groups in the Mandate and so Jewish militant groups formed who launch their own rebellion and violence between themselves and the Arabs escalated even further by 1947 the birtish decided to give up and withdraw from mandatory Palestine altogether and so they submitted the matter of what to do with it to the United Nations who in the wake of the Holocaust in Europe faced growing International pressure for the creation of an independent Jewish State they came up with a 1947 un partition plan which called for partitioning mandatory Palestine into three separate states an independent Jewish State an independent Palestinian Arab State and an internationally run city state in Jerusalem the Arab side in particular resented this proposal at the time though as they argued it was too heavily biased towards the Jewish side who were GR in most of the mandates land despite only representing about onethird of the mandate's population at the time the Jewish side meanwhile had misgivings about the plan as well since most of the big cities and the actual arable land went to the Arab State while Jerusalem itself was surrounded by Arab territory but nonetheless the Jewish side ultimately accepted the plan while virtually the entire Arab world condemned the UN plan and rejected it and the violence between the Palestinian Arabs and the Jews in the Mandate only worsened in 1948 Israel declared its indep dependence from the Mandate based on the 1947 un plan boundaries but the Palestinians in a coalition of outside Arab states refused to recognize them and immediately invaded determined to overturn the UN partition plan that they saw as just another form of colonialism seeking to steal more of their land but Israel ended up winning that war and agreed on an Armistice with the Arab states who attacked them in 1949 the so-called Green Line marked the military front line between the Israelis and the Arab states as it stood when that Armistice agreement was signed and though all of the Arab states at the time were very clear that the green line did not Mark any final or agreed upon borders it did marked the de facto border between themselves and Israel nonetheless at the same time the Gaza Strip fell under the control of Egypt the West Bank fell under the control of Jordan while Jerusalem itself became divided between Israeli control in the west and Jordanian control in the East Israel's own expansion well beyond their originally accepted 1947 un partition plan area also put them in control over large swaths of Palestinian Arab lands which resulted in about 700,000 of them who either fled or forcibly pushed out in an event that became known as the nakba or the catastrophe with many of them fleeing towards the Gaza Strip in the West Bank and others towards Jordan Syria and Lebanon and so an independent Palestinian state was immediately extinguished at the same time in 1949 there were approximately 1 million Jews of misrahi and Safari ancestry who lived all across the Muslim world their ancestors had for thousands of years but over the decades that followed as Israel established itself further the vast majority of them were either forcibly expelled fled or voluntarily migrated away in a mass Jewish Exodus away from the Muslim world and largely towards Israel as a result fewer than 30,000 Jews continue to live in the Muslim world today down from around a million in 1948 today these Middle Eastern and North African Jews who left and their descendants comprise more than 50% of the Israel Jewish population and represent the country's single largest ethnic group today while another 32% of the Israeli Jewish population are of ashkanazi ancestry from Eastern and Central Europe who represent the second largest group ever since that time both the Palestinians and the Israelis have struggled defining where one of their territories begins and the other ends within the overall territory of the former British mandate and have struggled with achieving Universal recognition by the outside world Israel's mostly International recognized boundaries today consist of that so-called Green Line dating back to 1949 but there were also the additional territories that came under Israel's control during the later Six-Day War of 1967 that lay beyond the 1949 armist to Green Line territories that are usually referred to is either the post 1967 territories or the Israeli occupied territories they include the Sinai Peninsula seized from Egypt the Palestinian inhabited territories that Israel seized from Egypt and Jordan the Gaza Strip the West Bank and East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights that were seized from Syria after Israel seized all of these territories back in 1967 the United Nations security Council passed resolution 242 which effectively considered them all as occupied territories that the Israelis should immediately withdraw from while the Arab League convened at carum in Sudan where they proclaimed the 1967 cartoon resolution explicitly laying out their foreign policy towards Israel going forward no peace with Israel no recognition with Israel and no negotiations with Israel a policy that became known as the Arab world's three knows and the foundation upon which no Arab state would recognize Israel's existence in any context or shape for decades over the decades that followed from 1967 Israel treated each of their post 1967 acquire territories very differently Israel agreed to return the Cai Peninsula back to Egypt in 1979 in exchange for a formal peace treaty with Egypt an Egyptian recognition of Israel's right to exist marking the first time that an Arab state would ever do such a thing and the first time that an Arab state would violate the three NOS agreed upon by the Arab League back in the 1967 cartoon resolution Israel then unilaterally decided to Annex all of East Jerusalem in 1980 and subsequently proclaimed to unify Jerusalem as its own Capital City something that the United Nations would immediately declare as legally null and void under international law with resolution 478 the considered East Jerusalem to still be an Israeli occupied territory and which also called upon all UN member states to withdraw their embassies from Jerusalem in the aftermath which everybody eventually agreed to do by the time 2017 rolled around there wasn't a single other country in the world outside of Israel who recognized Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem or Jerusalem as the sole capital of Israel Israel also decided to unilaterally Annex the Golan Heights outright back in 1981 an action that the United Nations similarly declared under the passing of resolution 497 immediately afterwards as null and void and without International legal effect the Golan Heights would continue to be universally recognized by the entire International Community as Israeli occupy territory of Syria for decades and this also continued to remain True by 2017 that left the West Bank and the Gaza Strip which Israel has also treated very differently from all of the other post 1967 territories Egypt renounced its claim to the Gaza Strip in the peace treaty with Israel in 1978 while Jordan formerly renounced his claims to the West Bank in East Jerusalem a decade later in 1988 before becoming the second Arab state to make peace with Israel and recognize Israel's existence in 1994 those renunciations by Egypt and Jordan to the Gaza Strip the West Bank and East Jerusalem and Israel's continued internationally unrecognized occupation of all of them left them each effectively as Palestinian inhabited territories trapped in a state of permanent legal limbo for decades as thousands of Israeli settlers began moving into all of them and displacing and angering the Palestinians who lived within them even further after Decades of violence between the Israeli authorities and the settlers on one side and the Palestinians on the other in both the West Bank and East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip the Israelis and the Palestinians eventually AG agreed upon the Oslo Accords of 1993 and 1995 which established the Palestinian Authority as an interim Palestinian government body that was eventually assumed would one day take over full Authority in the entire occupied West Bank East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip as the eventually fully independent state of Palestine but in the interim until then the Israeli and Palestinian sides agreed on what originally was supposed to only be a temporary division of the West Bank into three distinctly different areas with varying levels of control between the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli military and state area a would be the territories assigned entirely to the civil and Security Administration run by the Palestinian Authority area B would be the territories assigned to only the Civil Administration run by the Palestinian Authority but with the security administration that would continue to be run by the Israelis and then there was also area C which would continue to be entirely run by both the Israeli civil and Military authorities without any influence from the Palestinian Authority at all which effectively placed area C under the continued deao control of Israel area C consists of approximately 61% of the West Bank's total territory and is presently the home of all of Israel's settlements and settlers in the West Bank wedged all in between the Palestinian authorities area a and area B and ringed all around Jerusalem where more than 99% of all the land is either strictly off limits or heavily restricted for Palestinians to access area C is also completely contiguous in area while the Palestinian authorities admin territories in areas A and B are not contiguous and divided between 165 separate enclaves in between the contiguous isra administered area sea that is chalk full of Israeli settlements in a situation that has sometimes been referred to as the Palestinian archipelago of the West Bank and a system that has been very frequently compared to the system of aarthi that white ruled South Africa and forced upon their black population until 1994 it was initially intended by the Oslo Accords of 1994 5 that all of area C would be gradually transferred by the Israelis over to the Palestinian authorities Administration but to date that has never ended up happening within one week of the Oslo 2 Accord being signed on the 28th of September 1995 that established the system of Aras A and B in the West Bank and granted the Palestinian Authority limited control the Israeli Prime Minister who signed them yit saak Rin was assassinated by an Israeli right-wing extremist who is opposed to the concept of any independent Palestinian entity and the next election that came the following year in 1996 brought Benjamin Netanyahu into the office of Israel's prime minister for the first time which resulted in a stalling of any further negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel the supposedly temporary divisions within the West Bank agreed upon in 1995 immediately before yit saak R's assassination have remained indefinite ever since and the pace of Israeli settlers moving into area CA has only continued at the current date in 2023 it's estimated that around 230,000 Israeli settlers live in the post 1967 territory of East Jerusalem while another 470,000 Israeli settlers live within area sea of the West Bank across at least 132 separate settlements and more than 140 separate outposts where they have full civil and political rights like every other Israeli citizen does and representing a fourfold increase in Israeli settlers in the West Bank since the Oslo Accords were initially signed in 1995 this is in comparison to around 300,000 Palestinians who also live within area sea and are subject to Israeli military rule another roughly 2.8 million Palestinians who live confined within the Palestinian archipelago of areas A and B under the Palestinian authorities Administration in the West Bank and another 362,000 Palestinians who live within the Israeli annexed East Jerusalem all of whom have almost zero say over how they are actually governed Israel's continued control over area sea in the West Bank for decades and hundreds of thousands of settlers that they have allowed to move into the territory since the 1990s have been frequently labeled as a violation of article 49 of the 4th Geneva Convention which plainly states that quote the occupying power shall not Deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory that it occupies in this case being the West Bank Meanwhile by 2005 Israel maintained about 8,000 sellers across 21 different settlements in the Gaza Strip but by then the situation was becoming untenable at only about the size of Washington DC the Gaza Strip was geographically much smaller than the West Bank was but with a population of 1.4 million Palestinians back then it was also substantially more densely populated and urbanized than the West Bank was as well the high cost associated with defending only a few thousand settlers in this crowded urbanized territory was becoming too costly for Israel to bear and so in 2005 they decided to unilaterally withdraw from the Gaza Strip altogether all of the 21 Israeli settlements inside of it were destroyed all 8,000 Israeli settlers within Gaza were either evacuated or forcibly withdrawn while the military withdrew as well and for the first time the entirety of the Gaza strips land territory was passed over to the Palestinian Authority although Israel continued maintaining control over virtually all of gaza's land Crossings with a fence they constructed around the entire territory back in 1994 along with continued control over all of gaza's airspace that included Israel's destruction of the only airport in the Gaza Strip back in 2002 and then finally came the Palestinian legislative elections of January 2006 shortly afterwards in which the political party known as Hamas achieved an unexpectedly decisive Victory before then the Palestinian Authority had been always controlled and dominated by the secular socialist and Palestinian Arab nationalist party known as fat who had initially seek Israel's total Destruction and the establishment of a secular Palestinian Arab socialist State over the entirety of the former British mandate area in its place but it subsequently made peace with Israel during the Oslo Accords and then restricted their Ambitions to establishing an independent Palestinian State limited only to the West Bank East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip instead by contrast Hamas was a Sunni islamist and Palestinian nationalist party who argued that fah had become too complacent and too Cooperative with Israel and had abandoned the true original Palestinian cause Hamas continued to be fully committed to Israel's total Destruction the same way that fatah had used to be prior to the Oslo Accords and separately from fah Hamas advocated for the eventual establishment of a Sunni islamist Palestinian State across the entirety of the former British mandate area once Israel had been completely destroyed after a brief Civil War within the Palestinian Authority between Hamas and fatah Hamas emerged Victorious within the Gaza Strip and pushed fah out completely by the middle of 2007 which has ever since led to a continuous division within the Palestinian leadership the Sunni islamists of Hamas based in the Gaza Strip who are fully dedicated to Israel's total Destruction and the eventual establishment of a Sunni Islamic State across the ENT entirety of the former British mandate in its place and the secular socialist and nationalist fah based in the Palestinian archipelago of the West Bank willing to work together with Israel to eventually establish an independent Palestinian State based on the entirety of the West Bank East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip while recognizing Israel's own borders based on the 1949 Armistice Green Line the same way that Egypt and Jordan do but Israel responded to hamas's uncompromising takeover of the Gaza Strip in 2007 by initiating a complete Land Air and sea blockade over the territory that harshly limited the ability of Palestinians or Goods to exit or enter a blockade the gaza's other neighbor Egypt agreed to fully participate in on their side of the Border as well the 1994 era fence surrounding Gaza by land across Israel in Egypt was then extensively upgraded into the modern system of high walls barbed wire motion sensors and even robotic machine guns while the Israeli Navy enforced a maritime noo Zone around the Gaza Strip by sea while the Israeli Air Force enforced to no-fly zone over the Gaza strip's airspace Israel's stated aims of enforcing the blockade over the Gaza Strip were to restrict the ability of the Hamas Le government inside from being able to import weapons from abroad to use against Israel and to economically strangle the hamas-led government and apply pressures on it to either moderate its position or face a slow grinding collapse with a permanent scarcity of resources and supplies generating unrest amongst the Palestinians they were elected to govern but for the past 16 years that have followed this blockade of Gaza a beginning Hamas has neither moderated its position nor collapsed from Power while frequent fighting is consistently erupted between them and Israel ever since and so the joint Israeli Egyptian blockade has continued on without a pause now for the past 16 years that have followed ever since 2007 a situation that has been frequently labeled as one of the 21st Century's vastest humanitarian catastrophes Israel's 16-year ongoing blockade of Gaza has been frequently labeled by human rights Advocates as a form of Collective punishment applied to everyone who lives within the Gaza Strip while Israel has always counter maintained that the policy is necessary to protect their own citizens from attacks coming from Hamas notably gaza's population has increased from about 1.4 million people when the blockade began in 2007 to about 2.2 million people today in 2023 meaning that about 800,000 of the Palestinians within the Gaza Strip or about 40% of the entire population right now are currently children 16 years or younger who have been born during this total blockade and who have literally never known anything other than life confined within the walls enforced by the Israeli military and stuck under hamas's continued uncompromising leadership and all of the accompanying poverty hunger resource scarcity and occasional ferocious violence that has come with it at only about twice the size of Washington DC the Gaza Strip has since become one of the most crowded and densely populated places anywhere in the entire world and surrounded by high walls and a naval blockade on all sides and an enforced no fly zone above it where hardly anyone is ever allowed to leave for any reason at all it has also frequently been referred to ever since as constituting nothing less than the world's largest open a prison wherein the highest Ambitions for any of the millions of people within the prison to have aspired towards for the past 16 years have been limited only to either escaping from it or becoming the prison's new Warden this was the extremely complicated geopolitical state that Israel and Palestine both found themselves in between 2007 and 2017 with Israel effectively managing its post 1967 Acquired and occupied territories with a suffocating blockade enforced around the Gaza Strip increasing the numbers of its settlers in area C of the West Bank accompanied by frequent talks of annexing parts or all of it directly and prior outright annexations of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights that nobody else in the outside world recognized as being legitimate at the same time Israel was maintaining International recognition based on its 1949 Greenline Armistice borders with most of the world's other countries though with very notable exceptions continuing in the Arab and Muslim worlds who had largely never recognized Israel's existence ever since the end of the British mandate in 1948 along with several anti-colonial or anti-western socialist States like North Korea Cuba and Venezuela by 2017 the only Arab states that had ever recognized Israel's existence and made peace were Egypt in 1980 and Jordan in 19 1994 with all the others continuing to hold ranks in solidarity with the Palestinians and the three NOS of the 1967 cartoon resolution the state of Palestine meanwhile based on its claims to the entire West Bank East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip from the Oslo Accords in 1993 and 1995 and represented by the faled Palestinian Authority was recognized by most of the outside world as well and was granted the status of a permanent Observer at the United Nations in 2012 though very notably lacked any official recognition across most of the western world including none from Israel the United States Canada Australia Japan and most of Western Europe and despite its continued desure claims to sovereignty in the entire West Bank East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip the Palestinian Authority really only maintain deao authority over the Palestinian archipelago within the West Bank with the rest of the West Bank and area SE under continued Israeli Colonial and military rule East Jerusalem being annexed directly into Israel itself and the Gaza Strip of under the control of its rival Hamas government completely blockaded by the Israelis and Egyptians with frequent violence erupting all around it this was the General situation that remained more or less the same between 2007 and 2017 until things finally started rapidly changing even further in favor of the Israelis after Donald Trump assumed the American presidency in January of 2017 within his first year of assuming office in December of 2017 the Trump Administration extended official US recogn of Jerusalem as the capital city of Israel which effectively extended formal us recognition to Israel's unilateral annexation of East Jerusalem as well an action that had previously gone unrecognized by the entire International Community since 1980 the day after the US announcement was made the UN Security Council called for an emergency meeting where 14 out of the 15 members universally condemned the American decision but it was vetoed and overturned by the sole remaining member of the council the United States itself the vast majority of the world's leaders sharply condemned the American decision because it effectively meant that the United States would never recognize East Jerusalem as being a part of any future independent Palestinian state to date only a handful of other countries have followed the Americans lead in recognizing a UniFi Jerusalem as being exclusively Israel's Capital Guatemala and Honduras and the only partially recognized state of Kosovo being the only other ones Hamas still blockaded within the Gaza Strip immediately seized on the opportunity to demand a new Palestinian indata or Uprising be launched against the Israelis in response to the American decision on the 14th of May 2018 the United States officially transferred its Embassy to Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem with the new embassy's grand opening which sparked Mass protests organized by Hamas within the Gaza Strip near to the Israeli border wall that went on for every single Friday for nearly an entire year and a half until the end of 2019 the tens of thousands of Palestinians particip ated in and which the Israeli Defense Forces responded to harshly with frequent tear gas and sniper fire that resulted in the deaths of at least 223 Palestinians and more than 9,200 injuries and in the same month that America recognized Jerusalem as Israel's Capital the Netanyahu administrations ruling L could party in Israel passed a resolution that instructed Israeli legislators to finally begin pursuing the full unilateral annexation of the West Bank next an action that Israel had long resisted forign normally doing ever since 1967 largely out of the fear of what the international backlash towards them would end up being then after becoming the first outside country to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in 2017 the United States under the Trump Administration chose to officially recognize the 1981 era Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights next in March of 2019 making the United States the first and so far only other country besides Israel itself to recognize the Golan Heights as fully Sovereign Israeli territory rather than a Syrian territory under the occupation of Israel these American recognitions of Israel's sovereignty over East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights were each continued forward with the Biden Administration after 2021 as well and it has since become a policy that is widely viewed by countries all around the world as an act of enormous hypocrisy on the part of Washington as America has recognized Israel's unilateral annexations of territories that the entire rest of the world considers to be occupied and which America itself considered to be occupied for decades while America simultaneously has fiercely rejected Russia's unilateral annexations of territories in Ukraine that are also considered to be occupied like Crimea hiran zapia Donetsk and luhansk it has since made it appear to many outside observers that America isn't actually serious about upholding the Norms of international law but is only interested in selectively applying it to its Rivals like Russia when they occupy an Annex territories while ignoring it for their friends and allies like Israel when they occupy and Annex territories then it was in the following year during a White House Press Conference on the 28th of January 2020 when the Trump Administration alongside the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed what they each refer to as the deal of the century better known as the Trump peace plan the Trump administration's political proposal to finally resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict once and for all the plan envisaged an independent Palestinian State composed only of various separated enclaves within the West Bank though Contin to be divided and completely surrounded by significantly expanded Israeli territory well beyond the mostly internationally recognized 1949 armis Green Line the plan also completely rejected a Palestinian Capital based on East Jerusalem proper which the Trump administration had effectively recognized as fully Israeli territory back in 2017 instead the plan proposed that a new Palestinian Capital would be exiled to the outskirts of Jerusalem and be separated from Jerusalem proper and all of Jerusalem holy sites by the Israeli constructed West Bank wall that now fully encloses the city from the rest of the West Bank the plan even further demanded that these limited concessions allotted to a future independent Palestinian state would only be accepted by Israel and the United States if the Palestinian side first agreed to a status of total demilitarization and disarmament and agreed to completely Abandon All International legal action against Israel and the United States as well and then even further during the press conference that was announcing the the plan in the White House Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli Prime Minister declared that the Israeli government would be immediately annexing the entire Jordan Valley and all of the Israeli settlements within the West Bank this would have effectively resulted in an Israeli annexation of 30% of the West Bank's territory and the third formal unilateral annexation of the Israelis in the post 1967 territories that virtually the entire world beyond the United States and Israel consider to be occupied territories the 20 Trump peace plan was ultimately resoundingly rejected by virtually all Palestinians and even many Israelis alike along with most of the rest of the world Joe Biden and every other leading Democratic 2020 presidential candidate labeled the plan as a smoke screen for the Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank the UN rejected the plan and reaffirmed its own commitment to a two-state solution within the former mandatory Palestine based on Israel's pre-1967 Green Line borders and a Palestinian state in the entire West Bank East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip Mahmud abas the longtime undemocratic leader of the fatah party and the Palestinian Authority since he won his only election in 2005 showed a map of the Trump peace plan at the United Nations security Council that he famously described as turning Palestine into swiss cheese and naturally both his own government and the Palestinian archipelago of the West Bank and his rival Hamas government in the Gaza Strip rejected the plan as being too heavily biased towards the Israeli side moreover even the israeli's Yesa Council an umbrella organization representing the hundreds of thousands of Israeli Jewish settlers in the West Bank rejected the Trump peace plan as well on the simple basis that it granted the Palestinians an independent state at all which they were completely opposed to even in this extremely limited context but as it became clear that the 2020 Trump plan defining an enlarged Israeli State and a shrunken Palestinian state would never be implemented over the vast disagreements on all sides involved the Trump Administration began making significant ific advances for Israel on the Diplomatic front anyway behind the scenes the Trump administration had been mediating negotiations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates that suddenly resulted in a shocking joint statement between them on the 13th of August 2020 Israel agreed that they would indefinitely suspend all of their plans for annexing parts of the West Bank like the Jordan Valley and their settlements in areas SE well in exchange the United Arab emirat agreed to fully normalize their relations with Israel with the first ever Direct commercial flights launching between them by the end of the month it was a shocking announcement because it represented only the third time in history since the British Mandate of Palestine expired in 1948 that an Arab state had ever recognized Israel after Egypt had done so back in 1980 and after Jordan had done so in 1994 from 1994 onwards for the next quarter of a century none of the rest of the Arabs would officially break Rank and make peace with Israel sticking on paper to the 1967 3 NOS agreement that they had all agreed upon back in cartoon all that long time ago but now all of a sudden in the summer of 2020 seemingly out of nowhere the United Arab Emirates had become the third Arab State overall and the first Persian Gulf State to openly violate the 1967 cartoon resolution and make peace with Israel without the final status of the Palestinians being resolved first and it would be far from the last to do so in a series of subsequent negotiations they came to be known overall as the Abraham Accords the Trump Administration was able to almost immediately convince Bahrain after the United Arab Emirates to become the fourth Arab state to fully normalize their relations with Israel in September of 2020 then just 3 months after that in December of 2020 during the closing days of the Trump Administration the United States was able to convince Morocco to become the fifth Arab state to fully normalize their relations with Israel as well that one was accomplished by Washington offering that in exchange for Morocco recognizing Israel the United States would extend its formal recognition to Morocco's unilateral annexation of the disputed territory of Western Sahara a territory that Morocco had previously unilaterally declared to completely Annex as their so-called Southern provinces all the way back in the late 1970s but which remained unrecognized by anyone else in the outside world for decades afterwards with the United Nations having always considered the Moroccan annexation like all other unilateral annexations that have come following World War II to be legally null and void so in exchange for Morocco's recognition of Israel then the United States became the first country in the world to ever recognize Morocco's unilateral annexation of Western Sahara just as it become the first country to ever recognize Israel's unilateral annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem in the couple years beforehand all of which would ultimately provide even more Hefty diplomatic ammunition to countries like Russia to blast the United States with later on over Washington's hypocrisy regarding his selective applications of international law approving unilateral annexations of un recognized occupied territories whenever Israel and and now also Morocco do it but fiercely rejecting it whenever Russia does the same thing in Ukraine 3 years later in 2023 Israel would return the favor granted by Morocco by becoming the second state in the outside world to formally recognize Morocco's annexation of Western Sahara as well and then on January 6th 2021 on the very same day that a mob of prot trump supporters stormed the American Capital Building in Washington DC another event of monumental geopolitical importance with simultaneous ly taking place over on the other side of the world within the symbolic capital city of Sudan carum the very location from which the Arab League had previously proclaimed its three noose policy towards Israel more than 53 years previously that day on January 6th in that precise symbolic location the Sudanese government became the next Arab government to formally sign on to the Abraham Accords as well which initiated the process of full Sudanese normalization with Israel as well in order to convince them the Trump administration had agreed to remove Sudan from America's State sponsor of terrorism list and provided them with a $1.2 billion loan to help clear Sudan's government debt to the World Bank and just like that the Trump Administration was able to increase the pace of Israel's recognition in the Arab world from only two across 72 years of History to four more in fewer than 5 months bring the total up to six of them by 2021 and all without the underlying issue of Palestinian statehood being resolved first that had long prevented Israel's recognition by any of the Arabs by the time the Biden Administration assumed office in Washington it was seeming as if Israel was indeed going to be able to both eat their cake and still have it too the Palestinians themselves were fully contained divided or scattered with an uncompromising hamas-led government still dedicated to Israel's total Destruction blockaded in Gaza a mostly Co-operative and collaborating falet government isolated and divided across areas A and B of the West Bank several million more completely removed Palestinian refugees scattered across Jordan Syria and Lebanon and about 1.6 million Palestinian citizens of Israel itself who comprised a minority of only about 20% of Israel's citizen population despite Palestinians total population across all of the former mandatory Palestine area today remaining a slight majority at about 51% of the overall population compared to the Jews at about 47% to say nothing of the several million additional Palestinian refugees beyond the former mandatory Palestine in Jordan Syria Saudi Arabia Qatar and Lebanon who have consistently argued for a right of return to the area of the former British mandate that they or their ancestors fled or were forced out from a right that represents a major component of Israeli Palestinian negotiations that has always been refused by the Israeli side from the Palestinian perspective if more and more outside Arab states continue normalizing their ties with Israel despite the Palestinians dire situation on statehood it could eventually have reached a Tipping Point where the Israeli government would eventually feel secure enough in a region with fewer overtly hostile enemies to finally begin the process of formally annexing territories in the West Bank like the Jordan Valley and their numerous settlements if not the entire West Bank allog together something that has long been a goal of numerous right-wing and farri Israeli parties for decades but which has so far always been resisted out of fears of what the international response towards them would end up being but if the fear of a harsh interal response was removed than what other deterrent would there have ever been for the incoming Biden Administration in 2021 the next goal for continuing on the Abraham Accords even further and achieving the biggest prize of all would be convincing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to become the next Arab country to normalize its relations with Israel as well by this point in time to most of the monarchist gulf Arab states Israel was already naturally starting to be viewed as less of an outright hostile enemy and more of a potential ally that they could maybe cooperate and do business with the Theocratic Islamic Republic in Iran ruled by the Ayatollah and their ideology of radical Shiite Islamic revolution had long espoused a foreign policy that advocated for the eventual unification of the entire Muslim World beneath the authority of their own Shia dominated clergy which included three initial objectives to accomplish first in very specific orders of importance number one destroy and remove all American and Western influence in the Islamic world that was perceived as a lasting vesage of the age of colonialism and corruptive number two completely destroy the state of Israel that is similarly viewed by Iran's regime as a foreign Western colonial power occupying lands that are historically and rightfully Islamic and number three spread the Islamic revolution and the authority of Iran's Shiite clergy to the rest of the Muslim World which necessitates overthrowing and toppling all of the various monarchies that exist across the Muslim world that Iran's clergy deemed to be heretical and contradictory to where Authority within Islamic States should truly lie with the clergy and not with the nobility thus ever since the Islamic revolution of 1979 Iran has been consistently opposed to Israel's entire existence and to the existence of the Sunni Muslim monarchist regimes reigning in Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Bahrain and Jordan just before 2020 when the Abraham Accords began rapidly accelerating Israel's recognition across the Arab world the Iranians were making significant geopolitical gains against the Arab monarchy specifically they had successfully backed the Shia adjacent houthi movement in Yemen and kept them in power over most of the western side of the country immediately opposite from Saudi Arabia's Shia majority and unstable Southern border and directly across from the Strategic bab Elman Deb straight through which a large amount of Saudi Arabia's oil exports flow through despite the Saudi spending nearly 265 billion dollar in a yearslong military intervention to crush the houthis that failed Iran's Shia militia organizations were going increasingly powerful and influential in Iraq after the destruction of Isis Bashar al-assad's government was winning the civil war in Syria against the Saudi supported side Hezbollah was growing even more powerful and more heavily armed than the Lebanese government itself while the Gaza Strip ruled by Hamas remained a thorn in the side of both Israel and the anti-islamist regime in Egypt of Abdel fatile CCE these pieces carefully positioned by the Iranians over decades across the board of the Middle East represents what teron likes to call its axis of resistance and Saudi Arabia was beginning to feel like the axis was encircling them and then in 2019 Iran itself or its proxies even fired cruise missiles at Saudi Arabia that blew up the Kingdom's biggest oil processing facilities at ABC and koreas that temporarily knocked half of the country's oil production offline an attack that the Kingdom's historic Defender the United States refused to retaliate over the Saudi monarchy quickly calculated after those attacks and after their military Quagmire in Yemen then in order for them to have the best shot at surviving the coming inevitable confrontations with Iran over the rest of the century they could no longer continue relying exclusively on their status as the world's biggest exporter and supplier of oil to keep the United States interested in defending them a country that was becoming increasingly self-reliant on their own oil production through the Shale and fracking revolutions they needed to lock down an ironclad Mutual defense treaty with the United States just like the ones Washington has with their closest allies like NATO Japan South Korea Australia and the Philippines that would legally bind the United States to come to the Kingdom's defense if they were ever to be attacked by Iran or their proxies again and to help lock that treaty down they began to also recognize that the enemy of their enemy could also end up becoming their friend and that friend was potentially Israel a country they had long opposed on the basis of solidarity with the Palestinian Arabs but a country that POS no serious existential threat to the monarchy in the Saudi Kingdom the same way that revolutionary Iran and its AIS of resistance dead that's part of the context that contributed to the Sunni monarchies in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain agreeing to both recognize Israel with the Trump administration's mediation in 2020 and it's been a heavy part of the calculus that has been going on with the Biden administrations attempts to mediate a further normalization agreement between the Saudis and the Israelis next and thus across 2022 and 2023 the Saudis the Israelis and the Americans were all negotiating And discussing this process to jointly solve all of their own unique problems of the 2020s going into the negotiations the Saudis were deliberately artificially cutting their own oil production lower and lower to the point where their spare oil production capacity reached 3 million barrels of oil per day by October of 2023 meaning that essentially within a single month's notice the Saudis could hypothetically decide to just flip a switch and unleash the spigots and dump an entire Brazil's worth of oil production onto the World Market again which would of course dramatically reduce Global oil prices greatly taper Global inflationary pressures and fuel prices leading into the upcoming American presidential election while simultaneously harming Russia's ability to continue financing its war in Ukraine as Russia being the second largest oil exporter in the world overwhelmingly relies on selling its own oil and gas reserves to fund their own government and Military expenditures and the lower Global oil prices are the less money Russia has to continue funding its war in Ukraine the Biden Administration obviously would greatly desire this outcome of the Saudis unleashing their Taps and to sweeten the deal even further the Saudis would be willing to fully normalize their relations with Israel as well granting the Biden Administration a historic political achievement that the Trump Administration before it wasn't quite capable of acquiring all they were asking for in return was for Washington to solve all of their own problems an ironclad Mutual defense treaty permanently committing the United States to the Kingdom's future to defense against Iran and American nuclear energy technology to enable the Saudis to establish a nuclear energy industry that would include the ability to enrich their own uranium that in a pinch could enable the Saudis to rapidly develop their own nuclear weapon in the event that the Iranians suddenly developed one first to the Biden Administration in the United States a deal enabling greater cooperation between the israelies and the gulf era monarchies was also highly desirable for multiple reasons it was well known by the point that America was attempting to finally withdraw most of its military forces from the Middle East in order to focus on countering what Washington views as the far more pressing geopolitical challenges of the decade Russian military aggression and expansion in Europe aimed at Ukraine Georgia mdova and likely elsewhere in the former Soviet world and Chinese desires to fully and finally dominate Taiwan and East Asia the Biden administration's commitment to finally withdraw from America's military presence in the region to focus more aggressively on these other theaters was most infamously symbolized by the disastrous American withdrawal from Afghanistan in the summer of 2021 and the ensuing Taliban Blitz Creek that immediately catapulted the Taliban right back into Power again that undo nearly all of America's trillions of dollars thousands of lives and Decades of efforts spent trying to dislodge them Washington knows that Iran and its aess of resistance remains its most potent geopolitical threat in the Middle East who is the most capable force of throwing the entire world economy into chaos by launching wars in the Persian Gulf and all around the world's most critical oil and gas trade routes the consequences of which would be spiking Global oil and gas prices that would most immediately benefit the Russian war machine that is still raging across Ukraine this is why the United States now more than ever needs its local allies in the Middle East who have historically not cooperated well together because of the Palestinian issue remaining unresolved to set aside their differences and finally begin coop operating to contain Iran and its AIS of resistance while Washington's own forces relocate to focus on containing China in the Pacific and Russia in Eastern Europe This is why the United States wants Israel and Saudi Arabia its two biggest Partners in the Middle East and the two greatest Middle Eastern military Powers Beyond Iran and turkey who have never had any formal relations before to finally begin working together along with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain against all of their Mutual enemies in the region Iran's aess of resistance and then to Israel Saudi Arabia of all countries extending their recognition to the Jewish state would be a permanent GameChanger Saudi Arabia is the leading oil exporter of the world and with that comes enormous economic power dominated by its World leading oil exports Saudi Arabia wields what is by far the largest economy in the Arab world that is more than 2 and 1 half times larger than the Egyptian economy despite having only a third of Egypt's population potion the Saudi economy is indeed so outsized compared to the rest of the Arab world that it represents nearly 1third of the entire Arab League's combined economy all on its own Saudi Arabia is thus most often thought of as the premier leading Arab state today despite having only the sixth largest overall population in the Arab world and it's not just because of Saudi Arabia's outsized economic power either but for the religious legitimacy within the worldwide Islamic faith owing to their control and stewardship over the two holiest cities and sites in Islam Mecca and Medina if the Saudis recognized Israel's legitimacy then there's no telling how much further their heavy weight would have carried with influencing even more Arab and Muslim countries around the world to recognize Israel next especially in the context of Sudan Morocco Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates all recognizing Israel immediately beforehand too but the Saudi monarchy knew that simply recognizing Israel without addressing the underlying question of Palestinian State Hood at all would have been a deeply unpopular move among their own people who continue to overwhelmingly value their solidarity with their fellow Palestinian Arabs more than the cold geopolitical calculus that the ruling family prioritizes for the sake of their own Survival and so Riad was also demanding some limited and relatively small concessions from the Israelis relating to the ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank in order to save some face and appear to continue being the Arab world's champion but this was proving difficult for specifically the new Israeli government of 2023 to accept because it was a brand new coalition government largely composed of Hardcore right-wing Israeli nationalist parties who wanted to completely Annex the entire West Bank outright the preceding November 2022 legislative elections in Israel had resulted in what has been called the most far-right government in Israel's entire history a byproduct of years worth of of higher fertility rates among Israel's most religious sect of Judaism resulting in a shifting of demographics further towards the religious right that is expected to continue for decades to come leading into the negotiations on normalization with Saudi Arabia Benjamin Netanyahu was already considered to have been fighting within Israel for his continued political survival his new coalition government in 2023 consists of pro-settler parties like Jewish power and the religious Zionist party that favor deporting Palestinians considered to be disloyal from Israel and favor further Israeli annexations in the West Bank the Coalition agreement between netanyahu's own lud party and the religious Zionist party that followed those elections in November of 2022 specifically stated quote the Prime Minister will work towards the formulation and promotion of a policy whereby sovereignty is applied to the Judea and Samaria Judea and Samaria being the Israeli right-wing term for the West Bank as a result in February of 2023 the Israeli defense Ministry agreed to transfer most of their administrative powers in the West Bank over to a West Bank settler named bezel smotrich the leader of the religious Zionist party and the brand new Coalition government's appointed minister of finance a move that effectively appointed smotrich an avowed jewish supremacist who openly opposes any Palestinian statehood at all and denies the existence of the Palestinian people as the deao governor of the West Bank and while the move might not have been accompanied by the same kind of pump and Circumstance that went along with Russia declared unilateral annexations of occupied territories in Ukraine this Israeli transfer of authority in the West Bank from military rule to civilian rule effectively amounted to a quiet desure Israeli annexation of the West Bank anyway and further cemented Israel's long-term designs on incorporating the territory even further at the expense of the Palestinians and in contravention to the agreed upon Oslo Accords of 1993 and 1995 and thus for Netanyahu to compromise on any plans of further incorporating the West Bank into Israel would mean betraying his own Coalition Partners who were keeping him in power which significantly tied his hands on the negotiations with Saudi Arabia who is wanting to see at least some symbolic progress against the occupation of the West Bank being made but progress was still being made nonetheless with the Saudi Crown Prince himself saying in September of 2023 mere weeks before hamas's attack on Israel that every day the prop ects of normalized relations between the kingdom and Israel were getting closer all of this buildup to War Began coming to a head in 2023 when Iran and the Saudis first negotiated a full Restoration in their own diplomatic relations in March with the mediation of the Chinese a clear attempt by Iran to present itself in its axis as being less threatening to Riad in order to disuade the Saudis from seeing the need to Ally any further with Israel clearly Iran does not want its two biggest self- declared enemies in the region Israel and the Saudi monarchy actually cooperating together against them Iran would prefer to divide and conquer and prevent Israel and the Saudis from being able to cooperate against them divided they are easier targets for ter Ron and their access to work against independently one at a time whenever they believe the times are right any deal between Tel Aviv and Riyad that would disrupt that capability would have thus been anathema and unacceptable to teran's regime ultimately as of the production of this video it's still not precisely clear if Iran and ended up having any direct influence or not on hamas's Attack on Israel that was launched on October 7th but Hamas and Iran do have a very long relationship Iran somewhat supports hamas's regime in the Gaza Strip because they share at least one core aligned goal the total Destruction of Israel as a state but Hamas is not just a total proxy of Iran that answers directly to the Ayatollah in the same kind of way that Hezbollah and Lebanon does Hamas and Iran have core ideological and ideological differences that matter Hamas is a militant Sunni islamist and Palestinian Arab nationalist organization while Iran envisions the ultimate establishment of a pan islamist State ruled by their own Shiite clergy that would assumingly one day include all of Palestine as well of course differences in ideology haven't stopped Iran from cooperating with other regimes in its axis of resistance before such as the Arab Nationalist and nominally secular Assad regime in Syria but the differences between Hamas and Iran are still notable nonetheless Hamas has historically cooperated with Iran and the rest of the axes of resistance in a sort of marriage of convenience not because they do so enthusiastically but because there's basically nobody else in the world who will actually directly support them against Israel as Hamas is recognized as a terrorist organization by basically the entire Western World in Egypt Hamas knows that Iran views them as essentially a Pawn on their Board of the Middle East a pawn that can be sacrificed to achieve strategic outcomes like like finally crashing the Israel Saudi normalization process once and for all but Hamas has been left with no other choice but to operate as Iran's pawn and even independently of Iran's reasons and influence Hamas had their own motives to launch their attack on October 7th as well by provoking Israel into launching a massive retaliatory invasion of the Gaza Strip it puts Saudi Arabia into a very uncomfortable position would they as the self-professed leader of the Arab world and advocate for the Arab people continue normalizing relations with Israel in the midst of cataclysmic suffering of the Palestinian Arabs in Gaza continuing to do so would have fundamentally undermined the Saudi monarchy's own legitimacy with its people and with Arabs and Muslims the world over and so potentially with them deciding to stop the deal the Saudis and Israelis wouldn't end up being able to cooperate together against one of hamas's biggest supporters Iran the pace of continued recognition of Israel in the Arab world from the Abraham Accords May finally be stopped the unresolved question of pal Palestinian statehood May finally return back to the Forefront of political discourse in the Arab and outside worlds International pressure on Israel may continue to grow and perhaps the Israeli government would feel less secure in their looming plans to Annex the West Bank and potentially even feel less secure in continuing on with their 16-year long blockade of the Gaza Strip so far it appears that many of these objectives have begun to already be achieved Muhammad bin Salman the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia has already announced that the talks of normalizing relations with Israel will be put indefinitely on hold until the war in Gaza is over and he has begun increasing his demands of Israel for a deal much further than he was before now the Saudis are demanding that in order for the normalization agreement to be made after the war is concluded Israel must fully withdraw all of its hundreds of thousands of settlers from the West Bank entirely something that the hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers themselves in the increasingly far right Israeli demographics and parties Who currently govern the country will most likely never be willing to accept and that means that it's highly doubtful that Israel and the Saudis will be able to actually work out a deal and fully cooperate together against Iran going forward moreover Washington strategic plans for a new security arrangement in the Middle East to cover for the reshuffling of forces to focus on countering China and Russia now appear to have failed with the future cooperation between the Israelis and the Saudis against the Iranians in the axis of resistance now appearing to be in patters Iran will continue to be emboldened to whittle away at the Israelis and Saudis one at a time and at a time in place of their own choosing while Iron's increasingly close Ally Russia will be strengthened by the deal falling apart as well because now the Saudis have very little incentive to turn back online their spare oil production capacity of 3 million barrels of oil a day which will likely keep oil prices higher for longer and which will keep allowing the Russians to continue earning more money on their oil exports to keep pushing back against against American influence in Ukraine and Europe moreover America now might not be able to afford to turn its full attention away from the Middle East like they had previously hoped to do meaning that America's own forces will have to pick and choose their battles of support between a rotating cast of Israel Ukraine and Taiwan as the increasingly close Partnership of Iran Russia and China choose when to strike against Global American hemman Next as the Israeli ground forces are now invading the Gaza Strip and are dedicated to H Lo's complete destruction it becomes apparent that sometimes you have to be willing to sacrifice a pawn in order to bait your enemy into making a strategic mistake and it seems like tan has played their piece knowingly or not extraordinarily well of course there's a lot more history in context to the many many wars fought between Israel and Hamas that eventually led up to the current War that's ongoing today the current conflict is actually the fifth war that they have fought between each other with previous large- scale wars being waged between them in 2021 in 2014 in 2009 and in 2008 and skirmishes and attacks between them being fought all in between that have all contributed even further to the buildup of Total War that began in October of 2023 but unfortunately due to the inherently violent controversial and recent nature of discussing how an organization like Hamas was able to catapult itself into power in the Middle East and how all of the many wars between them and the Israelis have gone ever since the next part of this video would almost certainly cause the rest of the video that came before it to become demonetized and age restricted which ultimately would mean that YouTube's algorithm would have never promoted any of this video to you and you would probably never have gotten to see any of it but thankfully I was still able to produce that next part of this video anyway because of the power of nebula where you can go and watch the next fulllength part covering exactly how Hamas managed to rise to power in Gaza and how the many wars and conflicts between between them and the Israelis have been fought ever since if you want a broader context behind this conflict with information that this video didn't quite get into like what the Gaza Strip really is what Hamas is and how the conflict between Gaza Hamas and Israel has constantly

office were to Arab and Israeli leaders and on day two the president made former Senator George Mitchell his special Envoy for Middle East peace Mr Obama wants to shore up the ceasefire in Gaza but a lasting peace really depends on the West Bank where Palestinians had hoped to create their state the problem is even before Israel invaded Gaza a growing number of Israelis and Palestinians had concluded that peace between them was no longer possible that history had passed it by for peace to have a chance Israel would have to withdraw from the West Bank which would then become the Palestinian State it's known as the two State solution but while negotiations have been going on for 15 years hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers have moved into to occupy the West Bank Palestinians say they can't have a state with Israeli settlers all over it which the settlers say is precisely the idea Daniela Weiss moved from Israel to the West Bank 33 years ago she's been the mayor of a large settlement I think that settlements prevent the the the establishment of a Palestinian state in the land of Israel this is their goal and this is their reality though settlers and Palestinians don't agree on anything most do agree now that a peace deal has been overtaken by events Dr Mustafa baruti is a former candidate for Palestinian president while my heart still wants to believe that the two-state solution is is possible my brain keeps telling me me the opposite because of what I see in terms of the building of settlements so in a way these settlers are destroying the potential peace for both people that would have been created if we had two-state solution Andy told us Israel's invasion of Gaza all the death and destruction convinces him that Israel does not want a two-state solution I am very worried that what Israel has done has furthered us much further from the possibility of two State solution Palestinians had hoped to establish their state here on the West Bank an area the size of Delaware but Israelis have sliced it up with scores of settlements and hundreds of miles of new highways that only settlers can use Palestinians have to drive or ride on the older roads when they want to travel from one town to another they have to submit to humiliating delays at checkpoints and roadblocks there are more than 600 of them on the West Bank why did do the Israelis have so many checkpoints I think the main goal is to fragment the West Bank maybe a little bit of them can be justified because they say it's for security but I think the vast majority of them are basically to block the movement of people from one place to another here's how they blocked Dr barudi he was born in Jerusalem grew up in Jerusalem and worked in a hospital there for 14 years four years ago he moved to a town just 10 mil away but now because he no longer Liv lives in Jerusalem he can't get back in ever one minute you cannot go to Jerusalem at all can't you get a permit to go I asked for uh the a permit to go to Jerusalem during the last year the last two years about 16 times and 16 times they were rejected like most Palestinians I don't have a permit to go to the city I was born in to the city I used to work in to the city where my sister lives here's what he's up against scores of his Israeli settlements dominating the lowlands like Crusader fortresses many are little cities and none of them existed 40 years ago the Israelis always take The High Ground sometimes the hills sometimes the homes and sometimes Arabs are occupied inside their own homes this house for example the highest house on the highest hill overlooking the town of nablas we learned that Israeli soldiers often Corral the four families who live here and take over the house to monitor movement down below we're going into an apartment owned by Mr nasif here in nablas we understand that Israeli soldiers came in this morning and without any notice without any invitation came into the apartment and have been there ever since we cannot speak with you there's a soldiers there soldiers yes what are they doing here we are prison here what's happening they are keep keeping here and the soldiers is upstairs we cannot move we cannot speak with you you can't leave the house they told you that yes I can't breathe how long are they going to stay I don't know are they paying you any money you are kidding I'm kidding Abdul naif the bank manager said he had to get to his bank to open the safe but the soldiers won't let him go he told us when the soldiers come they wake everybody up and her them into a kitchen for hours while soldiers sleep in their bedrooms they can't leave or use the phone or let us in he sent us downstairs to see if his brother would open the door so we could ask the soldiers why they keep taking over this house you want to come yes uh just open the door and then they the soldiers closed the door from the keys they they take the keys so we left and and that night so did the soldiers but when we returned 2 Days Later the soldiers were back for more surveillance this time they kept the women under house arrest but let the men go to work and the children go to school when the children returned we caught a glimpse of two armed soldiers at the top of the stairs then more children came home but the soldiers wouldn't open the door again they say if you don't go back uh behind the wall the children will not enter the house but this is where the children live yeah but you need to go away from the door so I can let the children come in okay who are you he's a commander here he's the commander here can we talk to you no well we're talking to you now why don't you tell us what you're doing here have you lost your voice well they've closed the door now they've closed the window so I guess um if the children are going to get home we have to um we have to leave so that's what we'll do an army spokesman told us the soldiers use the nazif's house for important surveillance operations then thees told us the soldiers usually stay for a day or two always coming and going in the middle of the night when they do go the AES never know when they'll be occupied again it could be tomorrow next week or next month the only certainty they say is that the soldiers will be back another crippling reality on the West Bank is high unemployment now about 20% so some Palestinians can only find jobs building Israeli settlements they're so ashamed to work here that they asked us not to show their faces the settlers now number about 280,000 and as they keep moving in their population keeps growing about 5% every year but the 2 and2 million Arabs have their strategy too they're growing bigger families demographers predict that within 10 years Arabs will outnumber Jews in Israel the West Bank and Gaza without a separate Palestinian State the Israelis would have three options none of them good they could try ethnic cleansing Drive the Palestinians out of the West Bank they could give the Palestinians a vote that would be the Democratic option but it would mean the end of the Jewish state or they can inflict a parthe have the minority Israelis rule the majority Palestinians but apartheid regimes don't have a very long life unfortunately and uh I have to say to you that apartheid is already in place apartheid is already in place absolutely apartheid Israel is building what it calls a security wall between the West Bank and Israel the Palestinians are Furious because it appropriates 8% of the West Bank not only that it weaves its way through Palestinian Farms separating Farmers from their land they have to wait at gates for soldiers to let them in Settlers get a lot more water than Palestinians which is why settlements are green and Arab areas are not moderate Israelis who deplore the occupation used to believe passionately in a two-state solution no longer Marin Ben venisti used to be deputy mayor of Jerusalem Israeli leaders and Palestinian leaders are negotiating a two-state solution what do you think the prospects are prospects are nil the geopolitical condition that been created in 67 is irreversible cannot be changed you cannot unscramble that egg does this mean that the settlers have won yes and the settlers will remain forever and ever I don't know forever and ever but they will remain and will flourish the settlers the attitude that I present here this is the heart this is the pulse this is the past present and future of the Jewish Nation so you're saying basically that you and your fellow settlers are immovable I say that we and the settlers here are immovable we will stay forever but one very important Israeli says she intends to move them out she's foreign minister Zippy Livy a candidate to become Prime Minister in elections next month she's also Israel's Chief negotiator with the Palestinians and she told us peace is Unthinkable with the settlers where they are can you really imagine evacuating the tens of thousands of settlers who say they will not leave it's not going to be easy but this is the only solution but you know that there are settlers who say we will fight we will not leave we will fight so this is the responsibility of the government of the police to stop them as simple as that Israel is a state of Law and Order and disorder here's what happened 3 years ago when the Army evicted just nine families from a West Bank settlement called amona it was chaos the first time since the creation of the state that Jews were in pitched battle against Jews to Israelis of all Stripes it was not a pretty picture and it made the government loathe to try again officials fear that more battles to empty settlements could rip Israel apart they're afraid that religious officers in the Army and there are an increasing number of them would disobey any order to evict settlers there willn't be a mutiny in the Army a mutiny in the Army I think a mutiny against such an illegal order will make our army only stronger the Army is evicting Arabs from their homes in East Jerusalem which Palestinians hoped to make their capital outraged Arabs tried to save their homes but the Israelis had the guns Israel demolished more than a 100 Arab homes in the past year ruling they'd been illegally built Arabs say this is just another tactic to drive them out but officials say they also knocked down unauthorized Jewish buildings on the West Bank they're put up by youngsters the next generation's campaign to populate the land Daniela Weiss told us they will not be stopped the Army tore this down this morning yes and now you're rebuilding yes and we will have the upper hand I have but the Army will tear it down again so we will rebuild it the experience shows that the world belongs to those who are stubborn and we are very stubborn stubborn she says because they were ordered to populate this land by no less in Authority than God this is the the mission of Our Generation the most important point is this to hold strong to the soil of the Holy Land Jerusalem is one of the holiest cities on Earth for Jews for Muslims and for Christians it's also one of the most difficult issues at the negotiating table as Palestinians and Israelis struggle to continue the peace talks the challenge is how to divide the city between the two sides back in 2000 then President Clinton came up with some parameters for how to do it areas populated mostly by Jews would remain Israeli those populated mostly by Arabs would become the new Palestinian Capital that meant that for the most part East Jerusalem would go to the Arabs well it's not so simple anymore in the decade that's elapsed more and more Israeli settlers have moved East into the Arab populated areas one place where it's gotten especially complicated and volatile is the Arab neighborhood of silwan the complication in soan involves an Israeli archaeological dig called the city of David go to Jerusalem today and you'll likely visit the city of David one of the world's great archaeological wonders where diggers are sifting back through time scores of workers filling hundreds of buckets unearthing thousands of years this tunnel is 3850 years old and this was the way it was this is exactly original look at these Stones you can even see the Chisel marks along on the walls donon Spielman is the site's International director of development this is the original old flooring this these are more ritual bath or water ssts he led us down to an Ancient Waterway carved out of the hard Stone the whole beginning of life in ancient Jerusalem happened from this little spring which is nestled in this little cave we were taken down excavated tunnels no human eye has seen for two Millennia and shown the process of removing the layers of History sandbag by sandbag from when the city was sacked by the Romans and before them the Babylonians this was the first time I'd ever done an interview in a Canaanite Fortress so this structure was here when Abraham was here that's right he saw it with his own eyes he saw this he saw this that's a bit of a stretch archaeologists tell us that no one has found any evidence that Abraham was ever here it's controversial that the city of David uses discoveries to try to confirm what's in the Bible particularly from the time of David the king who made Jerusalem his Capital people believe that when King David captured the city he snuck Underground through this tunnel which led him underneath the city wall up into the city half a million tourists visit the site every year with guides who try to bring King David to life there's an implicit message that because David conquered the city for the Jews back then Jerusalem belongs to the Jews today today I've seen scores and scores of soldiers coming through it's part of their culture Al day to try to learn about what they're fighting for and when we bring them here they understand that they're not just fighting for today they actually represent the return of the Jewish people to Israel after thousands of years so Archaeology is being used as a political tool maybe I'm a hate to use the word but indoctrination almost I wouldn't call indoctrination I would call giving meaning to life giving meaning to why we're here but for all the talk of King David one thing is glaringly missing here at the city of David there's actually no evidence of David right there's no doubt that this is the city of David from the Bible there's no doubt that the Bible took place here proof of David himself until we find the actual name we can't say another problem is An Inconvenient Truth that biblical Jerusalem is not located in the western half of the city it's right under the densely populated Arab neighborhood of San and according to the Clinton parameters San should be part of a Palestinian state to remedy that organizations that move Jewish settlers into Arab areas have infiltrated silan under heavy security a group of settlers live in this seven-story building they barricaded themselves in and refuse to leave with some 450 Jews living among tens of thousands of Arabs silwan is now at the center of the battle to keep all of Jerusalem under Israeli control so how does the city of David tie into this well while a government agency oversees the excavations the Dig and the site are largely funded and run by something called lad Deron Spielman works for elad which claims they're not a settlers organization though people we spoke to say they are I think that'd be correct to call us an organization who believes deeply in the history of Jerusalem so it's all archaeology archaeology and rebuilding a Jewish neighborhood so elod is doing archaeology and settlements we are doing archaeology and we are buying homes and buying land but is it l od's goal to ease the Arabs away from right where we are right now put it this way if there's a home that an Arab wants to sell and I have the money to buy it and I can move enable a Jewish Family to live there and I can dig archaeologically underneath it then I think that's a wonderful thing to do the Arabs say it's a a provocative thing to do devout Jews yonatan and d'vorah Adler live in one of the houses elad bought elad has raised tens of millions of dollars half from the United States and buys these homes on land the Palestinians claim for a future State the adlers rais their six kids here on the actual dig the city of David is where Jerusalem began this is where prophets walked this is where half of the Bible was written this is what we're talking and yet when when you see those Maps it's over in the Palestinian side yeah well maps are written on paper this is written on our hearts but it is one of the proposals on the table I'll tell you Jerusalem cannot be divided uh Jews would never allow it the adlers say they don't mind living behind Gates and having guards on their roof they would never consider leaving but you're like a soldier on the front line I don't think we see ourselves as as soldiers at all we see ourselves very much as regular everyday people living in a very very special place Palestinian jawwad samam was born in this very very special place and says he can trace his roots here back 930 years he's pessimistic about the Palestinians ever having their own State what will happen to this Village if there's a two-state solution I don't think there will be a two-state solution there's not possible to do it today the settler groups are much stronger than before the settler groups in Jerusalem they are controlling he's angry that elad bought his grandmother's house and moved a number of Jewish families in so he's become an activist leader in silwan where there have been a string of escalating confrontations in this protest at the city of David Jawad got into a shouting match with a sight worker behind a gate and you will be rubbish of the history there is no proof that King David was here you want to take our some of the incidents have become violent like this one just 9 days ago boys were throwing stones at passing cars Watch What Happens Next as two of the boys get hit by one of the cars the driver was of all people the head of elad he later went to the police and said he hadn't stopped because he felt his life was in danger both boys survived one with a broken leg fighting often s here with Israeli guards brought in to protect the settlers clashes are daily inside silan between the Villager and settlers and the gun guards for the security there the government pays for the gun guards it's tax money it's I Bay it everyone who is paying taxes is B you pay taxes and that money goes to pay for the guards to guard the settlers of course so you're helping guard the settlers yeah I'm I'm a fan of the settlers of of the gun guard jaad says that L uses the Dig's archaeological Prestige to hide its aim of moving the locals out and he believes that the tunneling is a way for alad to extend its reach deeper into silwan they think you're digging under their houses it does at points GNE homes deep underneath the ground which is why we have these metal supports around us but it's under Arab homes it's under Jewish homes Arab homes and a road what concerns these residence LLY is not the tunnel it's where the tunnel's going it's what the tunnel means that concerns them well where's the tunnel going the tunnel one day will open into the Western Wall Plaza and you will have undergone an experience that shows the Jewish temple was important 600 years before Muhammad to understand why this is so explosive you have to understand the geography silwan lies in the shadow of some of the holiest sites in the world judaism's Western Wall an Islam's Dome of the Rock and a Locka mosque there's a feeling of encroachment the Arabs feel it there's no other place in the world that Jews want to live more than here the Arabs have Mecca they have Medina and they may also be interested in Jerusalem but for the Jews this is our only home that feeling of Jewish encroachment has been heightened by the mayor of Jerusalem near Barat who is doing all he can to make sure East Jerusalem remains under Israeli sovereignty we have to maintain a United Jerusalem the m brought us to a Hilltop over silwan to show us his latest project called King's Garden this is the most important area in the world in the whole world definitely and in the valley right there below us is where King's Garden was he wants to create a Bible theme garden and turn it into a tourist Park adjacent to the city of David but as with the dig the local Arabs see this as another attempt to gobble up their side of Jerusalem building the mayor's Park requ requires demolishing 22 Arab homes in silan if you began to demolish these houses it would be explosive wouldn't it that's why you have to be very smart and sensitive dealing with an area so important in the city of Jerusalem he says that area is a slum in which the houses were built illegally and his plan will fix that but the locals want to stay in their homes I heard you wanted to evict people where are where are those houses that's just not true to if you make a park then those houses can't be there anymore they mustn't have been there in the first place so so you will evict you will EV not evict when you improve their quality of life the right word to say is that you're dealing with Improvement of quality of life his Park he says will upgrade the area and he'll allow the people who will be evicted to build new houses nearby but locals tell us the only way to do that would be to build on top of other homes in silwan the European Union the United Nations has criticized this plan to get rid of these 22 homes public opinion especially while the peace talks are underway is is looking at this and saying um you're trying to get rid move Arabs out ofus but that's the way it looks and my question is why not wait till the peace talks are settled do the facts are wrong those structures are illegal they're sitting in an area that the world the world wants to be part of a city that is flourishing that is clean that is beautiful so what I'm saying here is get your facts right before you bash Israel before you bash Jerusalem but my question was why now that's the question what do you mean why now because it's on the table at the peace talk listen I'm committed to bring more tourism to the city of Jerusalem now this plan is a plan that I started a year and a half ago you say that Jerusalem must never be divided but most of the rest of the world says that if you want peace that may be the price that you have to pay Leslie it's not going to work um you have to understand that for a city to be functional to increase tourism to be able to see the sites that you've seen it has to be a United City meanwhile in the city of David the excavations are continuing in full force you can say they're digging in settlements have been a stumbling block in peace negotiations of the past and what your organization is dedicated to doing could become the stumbling block again we are looking LLY to go down and uncover history if coming back to my home after 3,000 years is a stumbling block to peace and I think that that is not a very good piece Christianity may have been born in the Middle East but Arab Christians have never had it easy there especially not today in Iraq and Egypt scores of churches have been attacked hundreds murdered in Syria Revolution seriously threatens Christian communities the one place where Christians are not suffering from violence is the Holy Land but Palestinian Christians have been leaving in large numbers for years so many the Christian population there is down to less than 2% and the prospect of holy sites like Jerusalem and Bethlehem without local Christians is looming as a real possibility this is what the holy land looks like today Bethlehem where Jesus was born Nazareth where he grew up Jerusalem where he died and where Christians believe he he was resurrected Nazareth is inside the state of Israel Bethlehem is on the Israeli occupied West Bank the Christian section of Jerusalem is also under Israeli control we know the area well know that it is arguably the most fought over piece of real estate in the world sacred to half of humanity still when we decided to do the story last year we did not realize it would become so controversial Our Story begins in Bethlehem Where it All Began we went to St Catherine's in the Church of the Nativity for local Catholics this is their Parish Church the day we went a confirmation was underway father maranas of Franciscan LED one child after another up to the altar watched by proud parents the church was so crowded it was difficult to believe that Christians now make up only 18% of what was for centuries an overwhelmingly Christian town we are the living stones of the hly land from here it all started and it had to continue it's a must it must continue if there is no people no Christians here it will never continue here in Jerusalem the numbers are even Bleaker than in Bethlehem inside here famous Church Theophilus III the patriarch of the Greek Orthodox has lived through the decline his church the Church of the Holy supplier is the most sacred site in Christendom he took us up to the roof you've got to know a patriarch to get here come in so you are in the Holy SE inside the holy SE just inside here is the tomb that is the tomb which covers the site of the Resurrection when you first came here in 1964 what was the per percentage of Christians in the old city there were around 30,000 of Christians living in The Old City and now how many are there very few so few some 11,000 Christians out of a population of almost 800,000 just 1 and a half% religious leaders are afraid Jerusalem could become a museum a spiritual theme park a great place for tourists and pilgrims but not for the Arab Christians whose Roots date back to the church's very Beginnings Christianity started here the only thing that Palestine was able to export so successfully was Christianity Mitri Rahab is a Palestinian a Christian and a Lutheran Minister from Bethlehem he runs schools cultural centers and health clinics Christianity has actually on the back a stamp saying made in Palestine Palestinian Christians once a powerful minority are becoming the invisible people squeezed between a growing Muslim majority and burgeoning Israeli settlements Israel has occupied the West Bank for 45 years if you see what's happening in the West Bank uh you will find that the West Bank is becoming more and more like a piece of a Swiss cheese where Israel gets the cheese the that is the land the Water Resources the archaeological sites and the Palestinian are pushed in the Halls Behind the Walls Israel built the wall over the last 10 years which completely separates Israel from the occupied West Bank the wall was built to stop Palestinian terrorists from getting into Israel and it's worked terrorism has gone down 90% at the same time the wall completely surrounds Bethlehem turning the little town where Christ was born into what its residents call an open air prison you remember the day they put up the wall yeah actually it was in 2003 and I was about um 14 years old I went to school one day and came back and found the wall surrounding the house chrisy anastas lives with her mother Claire her father brother and sister in this house which is surrounded on three sides by the wall how do you live with this well it's not easy actually but you get used to it because you have to the anastas family lives on the third floor this is the view from the kitchen from the master bedroom and bathroom the children's room has a good view of this Israeli guard Tower the family runs a souvenir shop on the ground floor sells Christian artifacts on what used to be the busiest Commercial Street in town now it's a dead end members of your family have already left yes and they have asked you to leave too yes what do you say to them I told them we have to stay we need to stay and struggle and fight this is our cross for all Palestinians just leaving Bethlehem is a struggle getting to Jerusalem only 7 miles away whether it's to pray go to a doctor visit family members or work means going through this Israeli checkpoint that can take hours but before Palestinians can get even this far they need a permit from the Israelis which can take weeks or months to obtain and is frequently denied we regret any inconvenience caused by the security precautions but it's their inconvenience it's our survival Michael Orin who used to be Israel's director of interreligious Affairs is Israel's ambassador to the United States we have to protect our our our country but sometimes you have to do what you have to do in order to survive for Palestinian Christians the survival of their culture is in danger in towns like Bethlehem which used to be distinctively Christian Muslims now are a clear and growing majority the veil is replacing the cross but inside Israel in Christian towns like Nazareth Arabs are Israeli citizens and according to Ambassador aurin they're thriving the reason Christians are leaving the West Bank he says it's Islamic extremism I think that the major problem in the West Bank as in elsewhere in the Middle East is that the Christian communities are living under duress and this duress is coming from Muslims not from the Israeli occupation I believe that the major duress is coming from that great selling point easy to sell to the American public zahi hurri is a Palestinian businessman he owns the West Bank Coca-Cola franchise I'll tell you I don't know of anybody and and I probably have 12,000 customers here I've never heard that that someone is leaving because of Islamic persecution Harry  one of Israel's most respected columnists believes Christians have become Collateral Damage I think this is a land that has seen in the last century terrible struggle between political Judaism and political Islam in different variations and the Christians are being squeezed in the middle between the Jews and the Muslims absolutely should Israel be concerned about that I think we should all be concerned about it political Judaism and political Islam are rocky they are harsh and the friction the clash between them is very violent in 2009 this group of Christian activists did something unprecedented they published a document called kyos criticizing Islamic extremism and advocating nonviolent resistance to the Israeli occupation which they called a sin against God it was endorsed by the leaders of 13 Christian denominations including Greek Orthodox Roman Catholic Lutheran and Anglican these are who have been exceedingly critical of the state of Israel and sometimes to the point of going Beyond legitimate criticism and so what does that mean to go beyond accusing us of um of crimes that would be very I think historically associated with anti-Semitism and um it was actually so inflammatory Bob that we didn't many of us didn't even bother responding to it they are fearful of this document because they are afraid this might influence the Christian World Reverend rahb who helped write the document says it's anything but anti-semitic this document is doesn't ask for violent it doesn't ask for Revenge the most powerful thing in this document actually is that asking for hope and love and faith do you think the Israeli government ever thinks of the fact that if Christians aren't being treated well here and America is an over overwhelmingly Christian country that this could have consequences Israel is not persecuting Christians as Christians the Christians in the Holy Land suffer from Israeli policies that are a result of the overall tragic situation and this of course has has consequences for everybody for Israel there could be serious Economic Consequences according to Israeli government figures tourism is a multi-billion Dollar business there most tourists are Christian many of them are American that's one reason why is reles are very sensitive about their image in the United States and that could be why Ambassador Orin phoned Jeff fager the head of CBS News and executive producer of 60 minutes while we were still reporting the story long before tonight's broadcast he said he had information our story was quote a hatchet job it's seemed to me outrageous completely incomprehensible that at a time when these communities Christian communities throughout the Middle East are being oppressed and massacred when churches are being burnt when one of the great stories in history is unfolding I think it's I think it's um I think it got me a little bit mystified and who was a reason to call the president of chairman of CBS News Bob I'm the ambassador of the state of Israel I do that very very infrequently as Ambassador that's that's an extraordinary move for me to complain about something when I heard that you were going to do a story about Christians in the holy land and my assum and and had I believe information about the nature of it and it's been confirmed by this interview today nothing has been confirmed by the interview Mr Ambassador because you don't know what's going to be put on air okay I don't true Mr Ambassador I've been doing this a long time and I've received lots of reactions from just about everyone I've done stories about but I've never gotten a reaction before from a story that hasn't been broadcast yet well was the first time for everything Bob this land has seen just about everything over the centuries the ritual in the Church of the Holy SRE the day before EAS Easter hasn't changed in more than a millennium we went into the church with patriarch Theophilus and watched thousands jostling to get as close as they could to the tomb from which they believe Christ was risen pilgrims have been coming here since 1106 ad to wash themselves in the Holy Fire to celebrate the founding Miracle of Christianity they'll certainly continue to do so but how many will be coming from the neighborhood that's not a religious question anymore it's [Applause] political we went looking for a place of calm in the Middle East a place not racked by violence anxiety torment not an easy Mission these days but but we found one in the unlikeliest of spots Israel's largest city Tel Aviv bordered on all sides by danger Tel Aviv has been through rough times over the decades Bloodshed bombings scud missile attacks and today the situation looks dicier than ever revolutions Civil Wars Islamic extremists are just a few hours drive away in every direction and if Iran ever builds that bomb Tel Aviv will be well within range so Anything Could Happen anytime but somehow telian have learned how not to worry about tomorrow for them the only time is now and the best place to spend now 12 months a year is the beach you would be forgiven for thinking this is Miami on the med thousands of miles from The Madness of the Middle East this is an island of Sanity in this country and an island of Sanity the island of Sanity in this country and in the Middle East the island is very big Ron huai who fought as a fighter pilot in three Wars has been mayor of Tel Aviv for 13 years he just started a bike share program if I look behind you pointing to Gaza there are hundreds of rockets coues pointing in Tel Aviv you look that way there are thousands of missiles from Hezbollah pointing in Tel Aviv how do do with that this is our life what else we can do when you go out of your home in in in New York you have the chance to get a car accident yeah you have a chance to get a car accident but you know that New Jersey doesn't have missiles pointing at you but in life there are a lot of risk always always Iran today Iraq yesterday during the first Gulf War Saddam Hussein reigned scuds on on the city soon after that the streets of Tel Aviv became killing zones as Palestinian suicide bombers blew up buses and cars and clubs but the bombings didn't stop Tel avians from going to the beach by day and the Bars by night Eric kneller lived through it all do you ever feel like you're dancing on the Titanic sometimes maybe part of the reasons people dance on on the tables is because they believe that tomorrow t is going to be attacked and they really do live as if it's the last day of Pompei and they want to grab every second of it and many do there are more bars than synagogues in this city of the Jews and remember Tel Aviv is not that far from where Moses came down the hill with those Commandments Tel Aviv wasn't always a Latter Day sadome 20 years ago Tel avivian were in the Vanguard of the peace movement cheering Israeli Prime Minister itak Rabin an as he shook hands with Palestinian leader yaser Arafat at the White House negotiations began but then stalled so the activists went home and retreated into apathy years ago people in Tel Aviv were passionately political they're not anymore what happened they're tired part of is that they tired people have said to me that they've become numb yeah there's a feeling of stagnation in that sense there's a feeling that there's not really hope there's no political debate in Israel there's no debate almost about anything Gideon Levy is a columnist with one of Israel's leading newspapers it's all about the next vacation the next Jeep the next restaurant and the good life in Tel Aviv enables you to ignore the real question question is it bad taste to bring up politics at a dinner party absolutely why to spoil the party why to spoil the party this ongoing party with politics who needs it when life is so beautiful when life is so short when women are so pretty and food is so tasty and when the economy is booming the recession pass Tel AV by there's low one employment everyone can afford the basics but there are wide income gaps in what used to be a fairly egalitarian society property prices have soared more than 70% in the last 3 years rentals are so high it said a starving artist doesn't even have a place to [Music] starve but for the elite and there are more of them every year life can be glorious wealth is rampant and yessi VY has it he owes it he says to making a modest investment in an idea proposed by his young son they called it instant messaging that was the foundation wasn't it it was early it was pioneering it was successful then after 18 months a came and bought the whole company how much according to the Press $47 million in 1996 vardy is now called The Godfather of what has become a vast software Empire Tel Aviv this startup city has more high-tech startup companies than anywhere outside Silicon Valley it is so far ahead of the curve you can barely see the end of it why does Israel have so many startups well some people say it's because of the military some people say it's because of the universities the level of Education some people say it's because of the level of Technology what do you say I say it's a cultural phenomena and the secret Source behind it is the Jewish mother every startup kid here has a Jewish mother which drive him crazy which will push them and challenge them and ins Inspire them and Inspire young people from all over Israel and the world to flock here for the good life Lonely Planet that hip travel magazine has voted Tel Aviv the third hottest city in the world complete with cops patrolling on roller skates and City officials giving interviews in places where American politicians wouldn't dare to be seen outside a trendy bar we ran across Tel aviv's Deputy Mayor Asaf zamir what are you drinking this is vodka soda because I'm on a diet and there aren't any people who would be watching you on television and saying what the hell is our Deputy Mayor doing drinking outside a bar or two in the morning this is what I'm supposed to be doing I've done this I've been doing this before I got elected this is my way of life and most of the young people in Tel Aviv uh we go out every evening and I think the people that vote for me will find it fine Tel vians love to think of themselves as Avant guard the art scene is vibrant new openings every week fashion is Cutting Edge along with music and dance and theater and compared to the rest of Israel Tel Aviv is not only more Cosmopolitan but more tolerant people seem to get along religious and secular soldiers and civilians Straits and gays in a poll published this year the city was voted the best gay destination in the world those old closet makers are going out of business and that's just fine with actress Noah tishby it's such a non-issue in Israel that's the thing being straight or being gay is a complete non-issue I mean gays in the military what's the problem here it's not don't ask don't tell it's don't ask who cares who cares exactly don't ask ask tell me I don't care grab a gun go fight I don't care all Israelis men and women are drafted into the army when they're 18 G shusi did his three-year service in the late 70s today he's a gay activist and a columnist for one of Tel's hippest magazines in many parts of the world parents definitely including Jewish parents are not happy when their kid turns out to be gay is it the same here no here it's a little different because you know Israel is a war zone it's been a war zone for many years it's very hard to raise a child here they can die in the army they can die in a suicide bombing so the whole feeling of an Israeli parent is that it's it's a big war to keep your kid alive till 21 so if at 22 he come or any age he comes and says okay I'm gay you know this is it's not as bad and that chronic War continues the very week we were there in the bubble of safety that is Tel Aviv less than an hour away Palestinians and Israelis were going through their rituals on the occupied West Bank rituals which have been going on for decades and are as routine as a dinner and a dance downtown Gideon Levy says that for Tel avivian the West Bank could be on another planet they have no idea what's going on there this is their dark backyard to which they will never go to which they have no interest about which they know so little and Tel avians don't really care not only they don't care they don't want to care they really want to close their eyes and Levy says they've succeeded he's one of the very few Israeli civilians who has any contact with Palestinians covers the West Bank for an Israeli newspaper and every day when he gets back to Tel Aviv from the occupied territories that's when he's reminded that he lives in a bubble because this is what a bubble is about the illusion of the moment the life for the present and for the very very short run future it can work for a while until it will blow in our faces and it will blow in our faces for the most part Tel avians have become fatalistic many feel there's just not much they can do about anything the Arab Spring Palestinians a nuclear Iran there's a lot of uncertainty now of course but that's all there's ever been uncertainty do you ever worry that this will still be a home for your great-grandchildren look I will not uh tell you that everybody is sitting here like an idiot don't worry about the the future we have this damn conflict that I hope we will finish one day and I hope we will do peace but in the meantime look what we created you like it [Music] here I don't like it here I am a dick to this place not only like I love [Music] it"

third episode this is my third episode the first two very controversial a lot of discourse around it a lot of carping back and forth a lot of anger a lot of commentary tonight I'm done with it tonight is perhaps an Amo bu a trifle something light tonight we discuss Israel pal kid me are we who wrote this well I legally have to read what's in the prompter so here we go we're going to take a look in our new and probably NeverEnding segment yes somehow the audience knew but tonight we discuss Israel Palestine any discussion of Israel Palestine is not meant to endorse or Justify all the action of your side mention Hamas that fail to condemn Hamas do not mean we don't condemn Hamas do not listen to the segment if you're predisposed to antisemitism or islamophobic common side effects of discussing the least are depression anxiety infections of parum and craving hus well folks uh uh this is an awful situ we're we're coming off uh on five months of a brutal bombing campaign brought on by a horrific Massacre and hostage taking and we seem no closer to ending anything but the Reigns of a couple of Ivy League presidents well this weekend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu finally laid out his plan for peace Benjamin Netanyahu is calling for complete demilitarization of Gaza as well as Israel taking over security and controlling entry and exit points to Gaza so your peace plan is a Siege a military se you really think a military solution ends this cycle Victory is Within Reach and you can't have victory until you eliminate Hamas but okay but your plan to eliminate Hamas by destroying all of Gaza doesn't that just make more Hamas is that the plural of Hamas hamai I mean it's an idea Palestinian Liberation is an idea unless you have a bomb that kills ideas do you have a bomb that kills ideas I mean how long would it even take to bomb the out of an idea the intense phase of the fighting is weeks away from completion not months weeks away from completion oh dear God if you insist on this plan if you think that ends Hamas I believe we in the United States have a banner you can use um it's a little wind damaged but equally delusional look the United States is Israel's closest Ally Israel's big brother in the fraternity of Nations Israel's work emergency contact maybe it's time for the us to give Israel some tough moral love this is shameful there has to be accountability for these war crimes no targeting civilians in war stop the war crimes and the atrocities and end the war today it could happen right now right now thank you these atrocities must be sorry I'm being told the administration was talking about Russia bombing Ukraine I apologize also a war crime uh but I'm sure they're giving equally Stern advice to Israel the Biden Administration is urging Israel to be much more careful to be more cautious how Israel does this matters Israel must do more to protect innocent civilians we want to see the government of Israel take steps to minimize civilian harm be more Surgical and more precise be more careful hey Israel take it turn the N could you please be more careful with your bombing it's good advice but really couldn't the United States have told Israel that when we gave them all the bombs We There are bombs there's this is like your coke dealer coming in with an eightball and going don't stay up all night don't sleep is very important you got to sleep you don't want to it's and breakfast is an important part of the day so look the Israeli position doesn't seem so tenable perhaps I can find some diplomatic leeway in the Hamas position Israel is country that has no place on our land we must remove that country does that mean the annihilation of Israel yes of course I cannot find diplomatic leeway in the Hamas position well this is when we need the world the Civilized World of Nations to come together and stop this madness a resolution calling for an immediate immediate ceasefire in Gaza has just failed to pass a un Security Council draft resolution to allow Aid delivery has been vetoed Russia and China used their veto against an American resolution condemning Hamas immediate ceasefire in Gaza has failed Western Nations voted against it it was delayed four times this week draft resolution has not been adopted why do you even have aing building why why do you we could use that we have a housing crisis give us back our building this is not right what is what is the United Nations even what are you just a support system for a diverse and pleasing food court what are you that cannot be the un's food court by the way that is that is clearly just a mall in Long Island doesn't anyone care about the suffering of all these civilians what about a good neighbor Saudi Arabia the Palestinian cause is the Arab world's most important cause I want to see really a good life for the Palestinians thank you Saudi AR thank you and while Saudi Arabia does not accept Palestinian refugees and Egypt doesn't either for that matter the Saudis are the richest country in the region and they've given this can't be right uh on average about $200 million a year to the Palestinians Jesus are you kidding me the Saudis have given just as much money to Phil mikkelson is that true I assume I assume to promote the equally important cause of the melian people so Israel the United States the United Nations the Arab Nations no one seems to be incentivized to stop the suffering of the innocent people in this region now I didn't want to bring this up but there is another player small religious startup out of Bethlehem I think it might have began as a Carpenters Union but has gotten big do they have a plan for the Middle East there will be the battle of Armageddon Jesus Christ is going to sweep over that Battlefield and to annihilate that army of 200 million people the blood will flow to the bridal of a horse so that's the plan for the Prince of Peace is that so I am not an equestrian expert uh but if the blood goes all the way to the bridal that's an enormous amount of blood no unless uh are we talking about the mini horses because that's still it's a lot of blood but more manageable and adorable look I think I think we have to get real here the status quo cycle of provocation and retribution is predicated on some idea that one of these groups is going to go away and they are not if we want a safe and free Israel and a safe and free Palestine we have to recognize that reality and I know that there is a twisted and much contested history in the region that has brought us to this point but we are at this point and anything we do from here has to look forward so tonight lucky you I'm going to do that with not one not two but a three solutions for peace number one along the shores of Pleasant Lake in Maine 95 Israeli and Palestinian teens are trading rockets for rackets the goal of seeds of peace is to open these young minds okay that one hasn't been scaled up yet and may take longer than we have unless we just bring the whole region to Maine how fast can we make 14 million rackets but that's just my opening offer that was just one piece plan people don't abandon me yet number two let's just ask God it's his house he's the one who started all this just ask God he can tell us who is right is it the Jews is it the Muslims is it the zoroastrians if it's the Scientologist a lot of us are going to have egg on our faces but given God's lack of communication over this past let's say millennia all right here's another one and heaven forbid I actually think this last one could work starting now no preconditions no earned trust no Partners For Peace Israel stops bombing Hamas releases the hostages the Arab countries who claim Palestine as their top priority come in and form a demilitarized zone zone between Israel and a free Palestinian State the Saudis Egypt UAE cter Jordan they all form like a NATO Arrangement guaranteeing security for both sides obviously they won't call it NATO it's the Middle East treaty organiz it's me too it's let's tweet it out me too tonight people let's get this region me tude now obviously I have not worked out the exact verbiage but anything is better than the cluster cycle we have now because honestly what is the alternative the Trump of God sounds and the Rapture happens we're gone in the twinkling of an eye we're just simply not here poof indeed sir poof [Music] indeed
104,a34zpFaoBoM,Putin breaks silence on Hamas attack on Israel,"CNN’s Frederik Pleitgen reports on Russia's reaction to the Hamas attack on Israel and Kremlin's growing ties with Iran at Israel's expense. CNN’s Erin Burnett discusses with Danny Danon, former Israeli ambassador to the UN. #CNN #News",2023-10-11,2912975,18213,13691,UCupvZG-5ko_eiXAupbDfxWw," And welcome back to a special edition of OUTFRONT live from Israel. We've got breaking news. We are now learning that the death toll from the Hamas attacks on Israel has gone up significantly. That number is now at least 1200 people, according to an Israeli public broadcaster. And we have been saying about a thousand. So that number going up by at least 200 here. And it comes as as questions grow about who was behind the attack. And today, Vladimir Putin had a very tepid response to Hamas's attack, which killed at least two Russian citizens. Fred Pleitgen is OUTFRONT. But it was a double foot high after hundreds of Israelis were slaughtered by Hamas near Gaza. Condemnation and condolence is poured in from around the world, but not from Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Even now, in his first comments, instead of empathy, Putin blasting the U.S. yet again. This is a clear example of the failure of the United States policy in the Middle East, which tried to monopolize any settlement between Israelis and Palestinians. She also visited Nero in Kiev, the Kremlin controlled TV following suit, mocking both America and Israel for allegedly being caught off guard by Hamas's attack. Yes, not no. Mozart's VI is the meaning of the contrast with Mozart and its famous counterintelligence, as well as the U.S. and its CIA slept through Hamas's invasion. It's the biggest Israeli failure in security since 1973. Russia has long been allied with Israel's staunchest adversaries and Hamas's most important backers bombing Syrian rebels in support of pro Iranian fighters battling on the side of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during Syria's civil war. But Russia also maintained strong ties and security arrangements with Israel. Putin meeting Israel's prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on many occasions. We in no way underestimate the importance of measures that would ensure very strong security of the state of Israel. But since Putin launched his full scale war against Ukraine, Tehran has become a key ally for Moscow at Israel's expense, fostering economic and military ties with Iran. While Tehran provides the Russian army with scores of showerhead drones. The Russians used to hit Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, Kiev says, even though Tehran denies it. Ukraine's president Vladimir Zelensky, claiming Moscow's allegiance in the Middle East has shifted towards Tehran. But when we are crises Kiev propagandists, we see how Russian propagandists are gloating. We witness how Moscow's Iranian allies openly lend support to those who attacked Israel. And, Aaron, the Kremlin has denied Vladimir Lewinsky's allegation that the Russians are trying to inflame the situations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. However, the former chief rabbi of Moscow, who, of course, fled Russia about two weeks after the full on invasion of Ukraine, he today said that the lack of show of support of Russia for Israel is an ominous sign of deteriorating relations between those countries. Erin. Fred, thank you very much. And OUTFRONT now, the former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations and Israel's former deputy defense minister, Danny Danon. And I really appreciate your time. Ambassador, so friends reporting Russian citizens are killed in the attack. Putin silent really for days. Many Russians live in Israel. There are very close ties between those two countries as well. And yet Putin showing virtually no sympathy at all for Israel. Nothing at this point. Why do you think that is unacceptable? We have witnessed the whole attack against Israelis. 1200 people were killed, butchered in a daylight. So we expect more than a leader. We saw President Biden's speech and we appreciated the speech. It was very emotional. It was a remarkable speech, I have to tell you, because we are still digesting those attacks. It was very hard for us. The pain is still in our stomach and we are grateful for the support coming from the U.S.. For you, hope for more almost all over the world. I cannot explain Putin's behavior. So the Fred Pleitgen Pleitgen pointed out Russia has long been allied with Iran. And, of course, we've seen that intensify. If I could use that word with the Ukraine war as well. Iran is a key backer of Hamas. Do you think that if Iran had any advance knowledge that Russia would have had advanced knowledge? I mean, do you see any ties here that you're starting to tie together? Well, Iran is very involved in what's happening here. They are funding Hamas and Hezbollah for years. They are training Hamas operatives. We know that Hamas experts went to Tehran to get training about explosives and other things. Do we know what Iran is involved in? Maybe. I don't know for sure. But maybe what we saw in the last few weeks, the relationship between Israel and Saudi Arabia, it wasn't very good for Iran. So maybe that is the reason for the timing, because it wasn't until a vocal attack against Israel. Nobody can find logic for the timing of this vicious attack. So how how involved do you think Iran was? I mean, the White House has been careful. They they've sort of said that there's ambiguous ties, that Iran is broadly and complicit, but that there's no intelligence directly linking Iran to this actual attack. Do you buy that? No. When you fund the Hamas and you give them a hundred of billions of dollars every year, you control Hamas. So basically, both Hamas and Hezbollah are proxies of Tehran. They control them. And that is why we are sending a very clear message today to Hezbollah and to Tehran. Watch very carefully what we will happen in Gaza. Don't mess with us. We are not playing anymore. We will not hunt down Hamas. And if anyone will try to play with us, either from north or somewhere else, it will be under our guns as well. So as you are massing IDF forces, paratroopers, snipers along that Gaza border, is there anything that will be off limits when if I assume at this point is when Israel goes in, we will do whatever is necessary to eliminate Hamas. We going to come from the sea. We're going to come from the land. We're going to come from the air. We're going to hunt them down. They butchered 1200 Israelis and they went to the communities. We did not attack soldiers, attacked women. Today, we we actually saw the pictures of innocent babies that were tied up and burned alive. Those are animals. We have to fight them. We have to hunt them down. And we are committed to do it. You know, we are still in in pain, in shock. And I think in a few days, we will start to show the might of the IDF, the strength of the Israeli people. We put politics aside. Now we are united and we going to go into war against Hamas. Ambassador Danone, thank you very much. I appreciate your time."

B: you mentioned Jerusalem-- - Listen, you can't tell me that.
Please don't say that. - When it comes to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I think I'm mostly emotionally sad. - I think it's not fair that, you
know, a country that is peaceful be in a situation where
we have to be threatened. - Being an Arab girl living
inside of the Israeli state, it's pretty hard for me to
find exactly who I am. - We're the Palestinians. We still live under occupation,
so we have no power. - I believe that every person,
Jew, Christian, Muslim, should be full equal citizens
under Israeli sovereignty. - We need just to end
this conflict between us. It's because we don't need the other
generations to live the life that we live in. - If we continue to do
what we did until now, it's probably going to stay, and
we need to do something else. - My name's Hannah Ziad. I'm 24 years
old and I'm an Arabian YouTuber. - My name is Dorit Saadon. I'm 25 years old and I'm
a Jewish Israeli Zionist. - My name is Bara'a Doh. I'm from Nablus, 25 years old, studied
public relations and communications. - My name is Tchelet Zohar. I'm from a small town called Giv'at
Ze'ev right outside of Jerusalem, and I'm 24 years old. - My name is Arab al-Ameen. I'm 24
years old and I'm from Jerusalem. - My name is Ran Bar-Yoshafat. I'm 34 years old, and I
work as a deputy director of a think-tank that deals
with law and economics. - Can I have my Israelis on the left,
my Palestinians on the right. - The first statement is: - Okay, my father was
murdered by two IDF soldiers. It hit us hard, especially for my family. We're only girls, and inside of the
Arabic nation, that's really hard. - My friend when I was 10 years old, an
Israeli sniper shot at her on her head. So, that was really hard for us. - Well, I grew up during
the Second Intifada. I carry a list with me of all my friends
who were murdered in terror attacks. So I have a list of 27 people, they
were actually very close to me. In Israel, we have a memorial today,
so I have always a dilemma to which grave to go to. - On the 16th of January, 2007, an Israeli
soldier shot and killed my sister, Rabir. She was 10 years old, in front
of our school, and I was 13. We were six kids in the house. After that, we became two
sisters and three brothers. - All of the people that I know have
lost someone to the war in some way, and I think like grief is
such a universal emotion. And like, really, I want to hug all of you. - I served in the IDF. I still
serve in the Army Reserves. Combat. I was very combat in the Second Intifada and I feel your grief and I Understand it but I have to say that I never got an order to shoot someone the order was only to shoot if someone is Thirty rely for a third to someone else's lives I also served in the IDF and they really do just teach us to defend ourselves If we're not defending ourselves, and we do kill someone we go to jail. That's not true. That's not true. I can tell you something The soldier that killed my sister. He didn't spend one day in there. Neither did my father both of them that murdered him did not stay one day in jail. Okay, I think the Palestinian they will not stop saying that we we want we want a country so in the end if we Got to the point that we have our state and they have a state. So no problem This is gonna be better for us to live all of us together which is no state like Palestine no state like Israeli only together and having peace together like there is no walls and there is no Checkpoints which is happened Brent right now. I'm with you one state under Israel's sovereignty and everyone's full equal citizen Alright, okay, but under Israeli sovereignty because right now I why is that a problem? Why should it be on one? Why should one religion control? It's not a religion, it's a nationality. It's my nationality So if if we all want a state with the Palestinian the Palestinian they control it you can live under it. No, so Because A: it's not your land; and B: you mentioned- You you can tell me that, please. Don't say that- I'm saying 100%, Palestine used to maintain- Okay can I ask you one question? Please, answer it. Your grand, grand, grandfather. You know where he is? Yes. Where he is? How many how many graves you want me to count? Seven before. Seven before I know, yes. Where? Seven before is in Hungary. In Hungary. Nine before (for me) is in Palestine. Don't tell me it's not my land- I'm saying it's not your land. It's our land that and it will still and will be. Like how do you determine this is our land and it's not their land based on what? History, international law, and interest. Yes. How about empathy? I I have empathy I'm just not willing to live to give up on my identity in what I believe is mine When I say that, I'm afraid what I basically mean is I'm afraid of going into Gaza Because I know that if I will go into Gaza, I might get shot. Someone might kill me I think I hesitated a little bit because I don't think I'm afraid of the people on the other side I think I'm afraid of the gap and sort of Almost equally afraid of like you know that side Taking all of the responsibility for what is happening or this side taking all of the responsibility for what is happening? Which is obviously not working. Well, that's fair enough. I don't believe that all Palestinians are terrorists because that doesn't make sense But I do believe that who is in charge They're leading the Palestinians to you know, hating us and in a way that you know, it is really unfair I'm against, against what you said. They're not the Islam because Islam didn't didn't say kill killing people or having a blood don't believe that The radical Muslims that come and do these things what do you have to say? They're not part of us. We never accept them as Muslims because they're teaching hate and in a way I accepted what you just said about There's a big problem with our governments. They don't know how to talk to each other and in my idea I really think the people or the ones I should be talking to each other I agree and I have to say also don't think there's an issue with Muslims But I disagree with you about the fact it's about plans. There are several peace talks. They were offered 97 percent of the land 98 would have done it. They they disagree But after deciding with the land they came and they built more settlements. What's wrong with that? What's wrong with Jews living in Judea? That's not the problem. The problem is is that we actually talked about this land being for these people and in the end when we see Israelis coming in and actually Building houses that's showing us you guys don't want peace I serve in the IDF so first of all I trust myself and my officers. I do think that a lot of the information I'm getting is not accurate Which is why I've tried to compare it with different sources and I also try to see it from from people, what they think what they feel I don't trust everything I see on the news that's for sure I do believe again There are two sides to every single story but I do see things that are happening for instance You know things like the the rockets that are striking or the stabs that are happening Those things I do trust because I can see that they're happening and they're just unfair Like I see the the narrative being written I was like I watch TV I know how important and how powerful language is and how it can create Reality and like I can I can see it. Like this is really dangerous like on both sides it's really dangerous. If you see is media that I see they're always against Israel for things that are not necessarily our fault I find it very funny because we look at it as and start saying that they're really with Israel, which is funny. But no I seriously do find the information that we're getting has more as an agenda to it from both sides I don't believe in social media like from the Israeli side I'm gonna support Israel and from the Palestinian side gonna support Palestinians People gonna be very confused and I'm gonna be very confused about the reality So the question was the sources so it doesn't have to be just social media and The reports like this like I also trust the reports that the Israeli security forces publish Don't trust them. In their ideas not about the reality and the situation but their ideas, how do they are see this situation? It's not really what happened If we continue to do what we did until now it's going to continue as it was now and I don't see it getting better Our leaders should have our lives and and the best for us in their minds and so it's not compromising like peace is never compromising. The Palestinian politician they were they in the end they want peace for they selves and for the people But they have no power Because the power it's not in their hand. It's the in the other side. I would like for us to compromise only if you will be able to compromise It doesn't make sense that every time that we have a war. It's always started by your side the other day I just heard about you know over a thousand eight hundred acres of crops have been burnt by You know Hamas who have been sending it over to Israel. Instead of you know, spending all that money in order to ruin us Why don't they spend it on taking care of Palestine? Just one second. You're talking about Hamas. You're talking about the Gaza. Gaza, it's so far from us We don't know what's going over there. We don't know if you can ask me about The West Bank I'm gonna I'm gonna answer and I think you as well But here's the way I see it when you're talking about compromise. Hamas' charter says murder the Jews wherever they are in the You're going back to Hamas- Hold on, hold on. But the PA- We're not talking about- stating authority- But then- -Let me finish! It was the authority that are the moderates they're saying it's a death sentence if you sell your house to a Jew Are there racist people Israel? Of course. Are racist people everywhere in the world? Yes, but we condemn people who are acting violently and the other side glorifies it If you're going to Attack Israel. Then Israel is going to defend themselves. And that means when it comes to Certain things maybe not you specifically But again to the radical Muslims, we have to, because if we don't then there's not gonna be a state of Israel anymore. I don't think it's a matter of Israeli Arabs or Jews Christians. Sometimes we have to, you have to use violence. I hope it'll be close to zero as possible But if I see someone about to murder someone else and I think it's okay for me to use violence to stop that. I think violence is not allowed for a political goal. I think that's a bad place to use violence I prefer talking and having a discourse. Okay, I didn't grow up with with a lot of violence with the zero violence, but what I went to say the same as you said Who comes to my house to broke the door to take my father? Of course, I will defense for myself So it's called violence, but I wanted defense for myself First of all, I am against violence 100% It's a freaking circle It's going to keep on happening over and over again. For me if you're gonna react for the violence with violence, so here we go. We're having like the same problems the same generation who's Raised with hatred and violence love blood which is not acceptable I think that Israel needs to be our homeland because if we won't have a homeland No one else is going to accept us anywhere else, especially because there's a lot of racism and anti-semitism As well, so if we're not gonna be here, where are we gonna go? Okay for me as a Muslim the Holy Land it's why it's so important, first of all. Because I was born here I have no place that I don't replace Every single person around the word had the right to live in the place that they were born in and that the right for Palestinians also for if we're gonna talk about refugees also they have the right to come back here to their lands to their homes and have their places The fact that we came back to our homeland and that we do have a Country and a government here for me like it does feel like a miracle But I also think that the fact that we do have the power now gives us more responsibility and that we can't just base it on the fact that it's our homeland and not Hear other voices saying we feel the same about the same place All the time requests if it's more dialogue more force more Conversations more social media. I always ask myself What is the best thing? I tend to believe that the best thing is human interaction. A lot of times I take a step back from like the political argument about the conflict and all of that just because I feel like Unworthy and that I don't know enough So my way I've always known what I what I am in this conflict, I always knew I wanted to fight for peace That's all I knew and that's all I will ever know I never was in the idea of this conflict until my father passed away and Then I had to think for myself. I always was asking my father why I was born. And his answer, not to kill to live to be in life and when my sister she got killed, I went back to him, to dinner He told me I was born to live Not to kill, but my sister she was born to die The Palestinians, they didn't kill six million Israelis and the Israelis still didn't kill six million Palestinian there is a German Embassy in Tel Aviv and there is a German Israelis Embassy in Germany so It's a big hole, it's always gives me hope when I'm looking at this and thinking a little bit about this I gotta say I think it's it's nice slogans. They just I don't think that's the case. Israel has a peace treaty with Egypt Because Egypt was willing to have peace with Israel Israel has a history with Jordan because the Jordanians were willing to have peace with with Israel Also from one to one, it's it's different how the way you think- I agree, which is exactly why I don't believe in a In a peace between the two sides because in my understanding of reality the whole concept of Palestinian nationality- Because you don't accept Palestinians. I accept human beings I'm saying that the whole concept of Palestinian nationality is one goal. And that is the annihilation of Israel When Jordan took over Judea and Samaria, when Egypt took over Gaza, no one asked for a Palestinian- But you're combining everyone you're combining everyone into one ideology Which is not right. Why, what do you mean? You're saying because they're saying that they're Palestinian. This is what they want, which is not true I'II take it back. I'm saying the government, I'm saying the authority There. I agree it's different Okay, because I don't refer to the Arabs as being Samarians Palestinians I refer to them as being Arabs of Judea and Samaria If we were gonna live long Long age or long years, we're gonna see, we're gonna see each other Great! Yeah. And we, we're gonna have it You can have it Nobody's no, I'm talking about peace. We're gonna have it here Hello I'm Johnny. Hi Johhny. Shalom. There's on top some passion fruit juice which gives a kick So, how was the experience guys? For me it was Perfect was good and it was a Good meeting It was topsy-turvy. It was upside down The beginning yeah Because like you don't know who's in front of you, you don't know their ideas their ideology what they think about you I think we did come to some sort of an agreement that we both do want peace. I want security freedom and prosperity You're talking about legal peace. I don't want a piece of paper that says peace. I want to live in peace I don't want a piece of paper says we have a peace treaty Okay but we don't agree because I don't believe in a Palestinian state and You think you should have like a two-state solution so we don't agree No, but we did say we wanted a one-state of solution. Israel with everyone equal. I'm fine with it. Exactly Well, I learned from you that you have a lot of sympathy for outside as well even though Your, your sister passed away, which is terrible. She didn't pass away She was murdered but I can see that you also have sympathy for the other side and you actually are trying to you know Communicate with us even though you went through everything that you had to go through on your end And I definitely learned that we can learn to love your side as well or I could learn to love your side as well. I Think this is the main point for our maybe conflict, that we did not hear from each other So I think it's important to hear from each other, not just keep your thoughts and ideas Inside your head and don't try to open this box. Just try to open it. We want really similar things Yeah, and it sort of you feel like You know my friends from back home and so the realization that we do have the same sort of language not not in like the language that we speak but in our body language and the things that interest us and the future that we hold for ourselves and for our families Like there are no sides. Like I can't draw a line and say okay. I'm like these people or I'm with these people Hey guys This is Jason- And this is John. Just want to say thank you so much for watching a really special episode of Middle Ground We love this series because it's an opportunity now more than ever to create great dialogue and create radical empathy This was a challenge, but also a privilege to get to go to Jerusalem to film this dialogue around a subject that is, you know, very tricky and very difficult but we Loved having the challenge, totally. We want to say a huge shout out to YouTube and created for change which gave us the resources and the support to do This and we'd love to hear your thoughts Let us know what you thought about the episode and the various perspectives in the comments below and also let us know what other Suggestions for middle ground you have.

worst we've seen since 2009 in Israel.  What began as a limited conflict has escalated
into a major Israeli ground offensive into Hamas-held Gaza. It's resulted in hundreds
of deaths. Here's what happened and what it means. It started with the murder of 3 Israeli young
men in the West Bank. They were students. They were kidnapped and killed. Israel responded to this, because it believed
that the killings were done by Hamas operatives. It arrested a large number of Hamas people
in the West Bank and launched airstrikes into Gaza. Palestinians from Gaza fired rockets in response.
Israelis were furious and a Palestinian boy was murdered by 6 Israelis, essentially, from
what Israeli police say, as an act of revenge. Moreover his cousin was beaten in Israeli
police custody. This led to a wave of anger on the Palestinian
side. On the morning of July 8, Hamas launched a wave of 40 rockets in the direction of Israeli
towns with very little guidance or aiming. They don't often hit targets or produce many
casualties but nonetheless create a climate of terror  inside Israel. These rocket attacks were the first that Hamas had claimed responsibility for since 2012, the last major conflict. In response, Israel
launched more strikes in Gaza, as part of what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said was an effort to make Hamas pay a heavy price. By July 11th, 100 Palestinians had been killed by about a thousand airstrikes. By July 14th, the total casualties had exceeded the 2012
conflict. And then on July 17th, Israeli troops entered
Gaza to root out tunnels into Israel that would allow Hamas to strike Israeli targets
or send soldiers in on the ground to attack Israeli cities or military bases. After the
ground offensive, casualties have skyrocketed. We've come a long way from 2009 when the Obama
administration came into office thinking they could get the two sides on the same side,
that is, get a peace agreement done. Let alone the heady optimism in the 90s that we saw
about Irael-Palestinian peace. The sad path that led to an incredibly devastating
ground offensive in Gaza has illustrated just how hair-trigger the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
is. Even slight provocations, even things that may not be planned by one side or the
other one, can lead to massive escalations in violence. There's just too much mistrust
and too much division to be able to solve these problems any time in the near term.
And that's the sad truth of this conflict."

talking about uh a histo this is going to be like a historical perspective on the entire Israel Palestine issue so this is how this podcast was designed as always abijit randomly messages me he's like we are doing this podcast and I say yes and then abijit messages me again uh you're telling Daniel to join him I'm like okay and then I reach out to Daniel he's like okay I'm coming and here we are so abijit Daniel welcome welcome thanks for having us so do we officially call this podcast you know Russell peters's kind an interesting name he said if a Hindu and a Jew have a baby they will be called Hindu so is this the Hindu podcast yes it is now so okay abijit now now I'm going to hand it over to you as I always do so you tell me how you want to go about it how do we look at the entire historical thing and then Daniel you can come in between whatever you guys want to do my job is just to sit back relax and listen to you and uh abijit now it's all yours look I think it's it's easier to take it up in terms of legal questions okay uh first for example is the WR to return now you tell me something every time partition has happened in the last and in the 20th century uh the partitions and population exchanges are an accepted fact of international law be it India Pakistan be it Cyprus uh be turkey and Greece etc etc uh the question is when a Palestinian says right of return why would you want to return to a country that you believe is genociding you number one number two why would the Palestinian State you know today countries aren't defined by land they're defined by their people the people are the biggest asset of a country why would you want to export that to another country I really don't know right so this is perspective number one right to second can I just add quickly here the the Arab leadership was very very clear since day one about right to return that after they couldn't beat Israel in Wars they wanted to destroy Israel through de demography like this sounds like racist blah blah blah the immigrants are coming well but I'm saying the Arabs explicitly have stated that the the plan of right to return is to destroy Israel um through uh you know demography and uh they are blatant about it by the way uh when you go sit down in ramala and have a coffee with them at moven Pi or whatever uh they'll be like not to worry uh in about uh 10 years we will be the majority and then we'll demand uh equal voting rights in a United States okay they're already I think equal uh Gaza is about 2.5 West Bank is what about 3.5 or something and uh Israel itself has about 1.5 billion so they're roughly equal Israel has a TFR of about uh total fertility rate of about three and the Palestinian high was about nine in the 1990s 2000s it's now down to four so that's basically nine kids per house nine kids per house to do what to act as human Shields to act as uh uh you know to uh swamp uh uh the Jew in his own home essentially uh so this is how it worked now when we talk about right to return there is no legal basis for you to say the right of return will apply to 70 years but it will not apply to 1,800 years uh you show me one international law that says either there is the right to return and it's absolute in which case every Jew has the right to come back or there is no right to return period you also have a lot of a whole Canon of international law that tells you that a country can be identity based and that it will uh uh they choose the identity okay so for example France insists that everybody should speak French it's a linguis istic identity Germany is again a linguistic identity Italy and you know this is called the use sanguis uh the rule of blood where you can claim even if you don't speak the language you can claim ancestry from there and return to that place now if you can claim ancestry in Italy and Germany and France why can't you claim ancestry in uh Israel okay this is uh number one the right written so this is one legal issue out of the way uh Dan is there any legal issue that you want to bring up because I want this to be a historical sort of myth busting and maybe invite our audience to talk about uh the big points the big points that they don't get maybe the partition of Palestine etc etc and how it was majority Muslim and partitioned etc etc but Dan over to you um yeah so if we're gonna go like full legal rights there is a good little handbook that's basically I think the Jewish people's rights to the land of Israel by Solomon benzimra which will explain this if you want to Deep dive but I'll say that but the the sort of legal framework of Israel um is pretty Rock I mean it's the only country that um was like created by lawyers when there was international law so all this Israel's illegal stuff is is anti-truth the the framework legal framework for um Israel really comes from the 1920 Sano Accords so you have the the Ottoman Empire and the Ottoman Empire is decrepit and failing in the 1800s 1900s it's gone on for a long time this they administer ottoman Palestine poorly there's a few cities with some population of uh Jews Muslims and Christians but it's it's desolate outside of that with roaming packs ofns you know taking what they wanted um the framework comes so people often site the syes Pico agreement which is this handshake deal between the British and French during the first world war where they're fighting the Ottomans like you'll get this you'll get this you'll get this not real legal framework the legal framework for the Middle East comes in 1920 from Sano in Italy so you have in Italy it's important because if you look at all the previous administrators of land you can go from the Roman Empire so the Italians are there the Turks signed on to the Sano Accords a year after was there so there's the Ottomans the British and the French were there so those are the two administers there and delegations from the Arab and Jewish populations were there Japan there too for whatever so all parties are present and they agree on the framework for a Jewish homeland in what would be a British mandate for Palestine and people often don't know what mandates are like there was a French mandate for Syria a French mandate for Lebanon a British mandate for Iraq the you know people will like twist it and say like the British mandated that Palestine would be Jewish and like no that's not what it is that there's a mandate and whatever you can go into the depths of that that's that's boring legal stuff anyway the Mandate for Palestine is actually modern day Israel and Jordan so the Mandate for Palestine 1922 that's the legal framework it's agreed on by all different parties then the hamites come and they say we want two states because we like we're going back on this bargain we want to so the British go fine they cut uh 77% of Palestine off they go east west Palestine and West Palestine East Palestine then becomes the heshi kingdom of Jordan the first thing they do is they declare ethnic cleansing of Jews no Jews allowed every Jew get out it's still illegal to this day to sell land to if I buy a house in Jordan the person who sells it to me can be put to death like this is the thing so from The River To The Sea Palestine will be free what about Jordan right what does what does that mean right because you we all know what the river and the sea or at least half of us know what the river and the Sea are um so you have that so that's the first thing now I I'm not saying it Jordan is really Israeli territory both sides accepted that the the Jewish side accepted the partition thinking that they would get at least 23% of what they were promised they were fine with that so under international law it's good except for the ethnic cleansing but other than that you have that going on there then you have uh further we'll say Arab in transigence going on from there there's massive uptakes and violence you have the foundation of the Muslim Brotherhood um coming in in Egypt 1920s uh you know Hassan albana not a friend of the Jews his good friend hajam Al husseini who is the grand muy of Jerusalem and related to yaser Arafat so you really have to to understand where the pales mentality comes from you have to know who the the the grand Muti was he was a Nazi not like a oh he didn't no he was a literal Nazi he was friends with Adolf Hitler he traveled to Germany he toured the death camps he saw the death camps and said oh this is great and had plans to build one in Jerusalem then when the Nazis were having trouble deporting Jews to death camps in Hungary because of the partisans he went to Bosnia recruited Muslims in the there to the SS was an honorary leader like he was given like the leader of this Battalion he wasn't there making military commands because he wasn't that guy but he was honored as a like SS General and you know he then went back so at the very beginning the British like propped him up as like what was the Arab counselor or whatever you'll have to you correct that there's so many names but he was the original um person the Jews were forced to bargain with for peace so it was Haj alus and then you know this there's these lies of like the Jews came in and stole the land in 1920s and kicked the the Arab Farmers out if you read the peel commission report because there were massive Arab riots in 1930s like Mass violence where they started just killing Jews and British people and they actually got Jewish immigration to mandated Palestine shut down during the Holocaust because of mass violence but if you read the peel commission Hussein is very clear they go on this whole that so the Jews and the farmers he's like he says no no no the Jews that land legally that's not our problem like we don't care that they're here legally we just want to kill them all like he's very clear he's like we made up all these lies we don't believe them we just use them for purposes of committing genocide like he said it like if you read peele's like biography he like he was very clear and very like like just matter of factly like yes we're lying we don't care that we're lying we just want to kill them all and that's sort of the that's the foundation of let's say you know Palestinian Society was this guy the grand Muti so you go on and then you have the 1947 partition plan which was you know partitioning again it's a crazy plan um like the Jews get the desert and a few things here and there Jerusalem's going to be an international City I've never heard of a stupider idea than an international City surprise surprise that failed but the Jews accepted the partition plan the Arabs did not and the including the Palestinian leadership Jordan Syria Lebanon Iraq um Egypt all of them declared war on Israel and then lost the war and Israel gain land so legally if we're talking it's not like you are allowed to acrew new land through defensive Warfare if I declare war on abash and like he comes and like ends up you know I come him with a gun trying to kill him and he stops me and then takes my house yeah it's his house now right it I declared war I lost the war um that's sort of the legal framework and then you have the Westbank is sort of controlled by Jordan and Gaz is controlled by Egypt from 48 to 67 where again there's another war in in Israel gain's territory through there so if you look at any like anyone who says international law Israel's violating international law hasn't doesn't know a thing about international law can't cite one law or one example because it's all it's all nonsense so that's a bit more of the sort of background I'll let abig continue but you know I want to contextualize this in the Indian sense if you oppose the the Jewish right to return in the 20s uh uh 30s and all of that where does that leave Fijian Indians where does that leave ganes and surinamese Indians where does that leave South African Indians we know the ugandans already kicked us out what about Kenyan Indians Nigerian Indians and Tanzanian Indians they all get kicked out uh what do you do with all of them you know I can understand Arabs say no right of return but for India to have that position is absolutely it's a joke and remember when idam kicked out all the Indians from Uganda nehu did not take them back it was the UK that had to take all the Indians and Rishi sunak and uh uh prti Patel they are all results of that particular migration to Britain uh they did not come back to India right now I can show you hundreds of different migrations like this voluntary migration that have happened let's talk about Palestinians and they actually practiced this by way Palestinians for the longest time had no working rights in Jordan they had to live in miserable nasty little refugee camps and then when Rana marries Abdullah that is when you know the process of integration really starts because you know the King married a Palestinian lady in Lebanon everybody opposes giving them jobs they meant to live in these camps they're meant to live horrible nasty miserable Little Lives uh they are not integrated out there I think people have forgotten that in 1990 when yasar Arafat supported Saddam Hussein how Palestinians were treated across the gulf in bahin in Doha in Saudi Arabia in the Emirates they were kicked out of their jobs they were kicked out of their Flats uh and they still have a very poor opinion of palestin they're all for Palestine in Israel they're just not for Palestinians anywhere around them okay and nobody wants to talk about that because you know the General thing is yo man you're all Arabs to us like you know you're abijit and you're kushel but you all look like brown [ __ ] to me uh I mean I can't tell the difference you're all brown like all white people look the same to us all brown people look the same to uh them and all Arabs look the same to us okay uh this is the kind of attitude you'll have out there and it's very very problematic now let's look a bit further from Sano do you know the peel commission actually found that Jewish immigration into Israel through through the 20s and 30s had increased the per capita income of that area exponentially it had provided massive economic opportunities they were turning the desert green the first kibuts and things like that were set up in the neev uh they did dry water farming and things like that uh they actually provided jobs to the bedu who lived in that area it is if you've been to the ne you'll know it's it's one of the dve it's an extension of the r and uh you know where that area around and akaba where Lawrence of Arabia is shot the driest part of the Arabian Desert and they were giving jobs they were massively giving jobs to local Arabs but the problem was the more jobs they gave the more it exacerbated political tension because the feudal Elites there wanted their cut so the more money a kibuts makes the more cut you have to pay to the local Arab mediator or little feudal shikh or whatever he is out there uh it became an extortion business and we know this in India right we know how Bihar and up because that is exactly how the Muslim Elites function out here and Muslim vote Bank politics functions out here it's it's not the average Muslim who benefits in fact the average Muslim benefiting actually goes against the Sunni Muslim benefiting not the Shia the Shia's uh the Shia trajectory in India is very different but the Sunni is benefiting the more the people benefit the more it breaks the hold of the feudal Sunni Lord over his little ghetto and it affects him which is why the riots start and that is exactly what was happening the riots wen't triggered by economic recession the riots were triggered by economic growth and this is why Hamas can't tolerate Al the economy of Gaza improving because every time the economy of Gaza improves new centers of power new centers of uh uh wealth emerge which become new centers of power which then become new centers of employment and uh you know social welfare which then threatens Hamas it's the problem is what we you to the left like Lin used to say you know every idea is worth aund worth a thousand pages of theory they're very good at concocting gobbley G and you know coming up with uh oppression Theory or I don't know uh Daniel's hair is black therefore he's an oppressor Theory or abijit is bald like the uh like the Iron Dome system the kipat Baran system well no I have hair and therefore I'm oppressing you I'm oppressing you with my hair yeah this is a follicle Holocaust he's perpetrating a follicular Holocaust against Holocaust Holocaust that's it Holocaust that's it Holocaust so this is a this is a verbal Holocaust going on they will talk [ __ ] like this they come up with jargon I mean sometimes I'm actually impressed by their level of coming up with jargon what do you do so this is the next legal issue which is and you know here's the problem the neev was empty uh they'll show you this map of Israel at the time of partition we'll show you the were Jews only in this part and the rest of it was all Muslim majority what they won't show you is where those Muslim majorities were concentrated and how 90% of that land was actually vacant because it was uncultivable uh people don't realize this that Israel has become green after the state of Israel was formed through a very systematic policy but it used to be green in Roman times it was actually deforested in Roman times to build you know ships and whatever military Ventures and things like that remember the Cedars of Lebanon very famous it's there on the flag of Lebanon except apparently you don't find any cedars in Lebanon anymore it's extinct uh even though every pharaoh talks about the Cedars of Lebanon coming down from sidon and Ty and all of that uh and we know because we' have found remains of these in the uh uh uh Egyptian temples and tombs in the Valley of the Kings and so on so forth but they're not there anymore so this area was deforested now it's being reforested and that again is a problem for them the next thing we need to talk about is they actually want genocide they don't want to live Side by by side with the Jewish people if they wanted to live side by side with the Jewish people a modus vendi could have been worked out this isn't a plan from River to sea is what exactly you know at least if you said Hindi Chini P or or the this thing version of it Arab Arab yahudi P you could understand that but they're not saying Arab yahudi B they're saying from the river to the Sea Palestine will be free which is basically we're going to throw you all into the sea this kicking Jews out into the sea it's a very old Trope that's been around for a few 100 120 130 years at least right uh I don't think people realize that I think there's a huge communication gap in how much I was actually watching I was on TV all evening talking about the strike that happened on the hospital in Gaza uh which we now know was an Islamic Jihad rocket falling down on that particular parking lot but uh the level of saturation coverage that is done by the other side is incredible so even when you have the truth it doesn't matter because one side has completely saturated what do you do what do you do in the face of sat ation coverage you know it requires a bit of a PhD to understand the Israeli situation it's very easy to find fault with Israel uh it takes a bit more brains to understand the Israeli side let's talk about targeting okay let's assume what Israel is doing is collective punishment the issue is the Geneva Convention talks about human Shields okay if you are in a situation of a human shield where does the onus lie the onus lies on the hostage taker not to have the human shield there is actually no recommendation on the genev in the in any of the Geneva conventions on what the adversary has to do in case of a human shield do you know it is actually legit to shoot the human shield in such cases simply because there is no legislation on it there is no convention on it so I want to know uh like you know I'm uh seeing some uh uh uh uh uh uh criticism in the comments I want to know two things if somebody takes a human shield can anyone in the audience tell me what do you think is an accurate legal ethical response number one and number two given that 1,400 Israelis were raped tortured killed uh mostly overwhelmingly non-combatants what exactly is a proportional response uh is Israel meant to go rape kill uh pluck out the genitals off uh behead uh uh Gins so two questions for our audience yeah so I'll I'll add to this there there's more here too where it's you did a very good job outlining just how poorly the Palestinian people are treated outside uh by by their biggest supporters the the loudest Palestinian supporters I mean they weren't even allowed out of the camps until the '90s in Lebanon and they still have second class citizenship um officially but it's also the United Nations created a different definition of refugees for Palestinians than anyone else so you'll find people like Palestinians coming be like I've been a refugee for 75 years how how right so there was there was like 750,000 refugees created during the the partition let's say that were Arab and 850,000 Jewish ones except Israel took in The Refuge and then made them Israelis and gave them citizenship and it was hard for Israel in the 50s like Israel struggled for its first couple decades quite mightily um but integrated this population the definition of a Palestinian refugee by unra they they have their own specific organization is anyone who spent two years in the land of Israel from I can't remember is like is it like 1922 until like 19 like 40 something it's like if you have a family M who spent two years in Israel and then you left don't even need to be kicked out you could have been kicked out by the Egyptian Army you could have just left you're a Palestinian refugee not only are you a Palestinian refugee your kid is born a Palestinian refugee that kid could then leave Jordan whatever go to Europe make something of himself have a good business meet a wife get out of the thing have three children who are they Palestinian refugees those Palestinian refugees can go on to marry like the literal queen of Spain and then become the king of Spain and they are one king of Spain to a Palestinian refugee and their children will be princes princesses and Palestinian refugees so this is why you get and this is done purely for propaganda thing this is why you get the the numbers oh the number of Palestinian refugees has increased by 400,000 this year yes it's called having babies like it it they're just making more Palestinian refugees because no other like if like if you were kicked out of Bangladesh and then you had to go to India you're a refugee and then after a couple years you get Indian citizenship and then you're no longer a refugee because that's how it works like I have friends who are former refugees my friend Salon it was an Iranian Refugee was an Iranian Refugee now he's a Canadian just FYI I am Bangladeshi by the way my grandmother was kicked out of Bangladesh but case in point you are now Indian you're not a Bangladeshi Refugee right this this is this is insane definition but because of this and Palestinian refugees get four times the amount of funding as a normal Refugee so it's an embezzlement scandal from these Arab countries they want to keep the Palestinians poor because then they get a house Palestinian refugees they get four times the amount of funding per regular Refugee they embezzled that it's a massive Cash Cow so they can keep the Palestinians poor and oppressed use them as a political Hammer against the Israelis then go to the world say look how cruel the Jews are because look what they keep making refugees when in fact you're keeping them like the open air prisons is not Gaza like a Lebanese Palestinian refugee camp like that's a literal open imprison because you're not allowed to leave those right at least Israel gives work permits to gazans and alls them work in Israel that's not the same thing as Lebanon so you have this complete inversion of history and and and and logic and and an actual incidentally sorry Daniel to interrupt you know these work permits are why Hamas knew on 7 and8 October exactly where to hit how to hit and whom to hit because all these kibuts theal uh Berry and all those places they all employ uh gazen labor who crossed the border every single day to come and work and it seems a lot of them were tracking movements taking photos on their phone like you know oh look I'm taking selfie oops look at the major general of the is IDF behind me um so they knew who was basically stationed where they knew generally what the uh uh locations Etc where and it was exactly these migrant not migrant laborers day laborers they come in the morning and go back in the evening who took all the Intel for Hamas to carry out those attacks sorry Daniel I'll hand it back no that is a good point I mean the kindness of the Israeli population has never been repaid to to Gaza like there's another thing like you know you'll see people justifying um uh a lot of violence against Israelis because of settlements um you know this is sort of the term people use for Jews living places right and the logic behind settlements is listen if there was a Jew who lives three box down from you wouldn't you be incensed to commit mass murder I mean isn't there any what what other response could there be but on this whole settlement thing remember Israel completely withdrew from Gaza in 2005 the Israeli Army uprooted every single Jew in Gaza forced them out of their homes gave the gazin homes their infrastructure Hydroponics green houses they burned it all down and then elected Hamas on a platform of genocidal um Jihad like if you read hamas's Charter they're very clear they want to destroy Israel because its nature of being Jewish and they are Islamic very clear they also want to kill every single Jew in the world they're very clear about that like the Hamas Charter is straight up Isis I I have a question Daniel for you but people say this is not a religious conflict it is actually only a land and conflict what do you have to say to that no these people these people are usually just trying to be sound smart um and if you can't take the religious conflict from either side of it out of it now it's not purely religious yes there are elements of land and resources and other geopolitics that factor into it but anyone who's who ignores the religious context of of this like listen I grew up Jewish not the most religious guy I'm not wearing a keepo right now but you know the Jewish connection to Israel is strong like there's a reason why Jews picked Israel like why don't they just go somewhere else because there is nowhere else and if Jews tried to live in Madagascar you'd still have people mad about it there so you don't get to tell Jews where to live is is our thing but there's a deep connection to the Israel particularly Jerusalem and the temple like a lot of our holidays are centered around Jerusalem and going to the temple sukut Passover shabot um you know it had to be changed a bit with the destruction of the temples but there's deep it's like an ethn um geographical religion in a lot of ways like the the nation of Israel um it the the entire religion like the Covenant is like follow my laws God says follow my laws and Commandments and you know be you know the voice of righteousness in the world and in exchange you get the land of Israel deal cut off the tip of your penis right that's the the central that's Judaism right in in in 30 seconds or less and then you have Islamic um radicals believe any land ever owned by Muslims or ruled by Muslims must be ruled by Islam in perpetuity right so this is why the Hamas Charter has the return of Spain and Portugal to the Islamic waik because according to them Spain and Portugal must also be part of the caliphate because it once was part of a caliphate at some point and again if you Hamas are Islamic radicals there's a group the second most powerful group in Gaza is called Palestinian Islamic Jihad now I don't know about you but I think the existence of that group shows there might be some Palestinians who have an interest in doing Islamic Jihad maybe right just maybe I think that's another sort of part of the conflict when you have people in the west who look at palestinia Islamic Jihad and go oh what could this be about like oh not looking at this what nothing to see here um right so see it's about it's actually he misinterpreted it's not p is actually pandas and giraffes misspelled in Arabic it's spelled differently it's actually I I missed that one I miss oh that silly Daniel I here thinking that the people launching Rockets talking about world domination had something to do with the the the Islamic Jihad um but uh well now that I know was Pand is a giraffes I guess we'll we'll we'll go that but you know every talking point that the let's say Pro Palestinians have is actually disproved by Gaza right A lot of people who were like don't know the difference between Gaza and the West Bank I mean they they've never been ruled by the same people one was Jordan one was Egypt they have different dialects and different cultures like again they've never been administered by the same people like there's no connection between Gaza and the West Bank other than this Palestinian Narrative of you know destroying Israel like that's what connects them but Gaza had all the Jews removed from it it was made uden grind that was that was the Big Thing by academics if you listen to Western academics the reason why ARS are mad is because Jews are around them and of course they're going to fly off into a genocidal rage if they see a Jew what do you expect like the the incredibly racist logic there is mind-boggling but hey that's you don't you know Harvard degrees aren't cheap so if you w to you know I I've just given you a crash course on how to be a a master's student at Harvard University but that was disproven all the settlements were removed occupation the Israeli army with true gave Gaza a state oh no it's because they're Port Israel provided them food fuel water electricity one of the main points uh like a big fighting points between Israel and Gaza in the last 17 years since 2005 is a lot of militants often it's p but sometimes Hamas will fire rockets at the power plant that provides power to Gaza and not Israel and it's a ridiculous thing where like the Israelis are trying to protect the Palestinian power plant because they know the reason why Hamas and P want to destroy the power plant so they could blow up their own power plant have the lights go off and then have their people go to the world and say look what Israel did right and and just as you saw everyone will uncritically believe you know the word of a terrorist organization over the Israeli government almost instantaneously because you know that's just the the world is so every single talking point that the left has had on Israel Palestine is Thoroughly debunked by Gaza the and there's a big thing and the Israeli left got their way and they got the withdrawal in 2005 it failed it failed catastrophically like the it the appeasement of terrorism doesn't work never has worked and always results in more terrorism that I think that's the lesson that needs to be learned um no we could we could go I I just want to quickly because he's talking about the Hamas chter I want to read out the lovely bit about Jews uh this is from the Hamas CH and it's quoting Surah 2692 of sahkari uh nevertheless the Islamic resistance movement aspires to bring the promise of Allah to pass no matter how long it takes as the prophet Muhammad may peace be upon him said quote beginning quote uh the time of judgment will not come until Muslims fight the Jews and kill them and until the Jew hides behind the rocks and trees trees and then the rocks and trees will say oh Muslim or servant of Allah there is a Jew hiding behind me come and kill him this is the Hamas chatter you see they're all human rights activists they're not genocidal at all yeah did you go over the part where there's one tree they're mad at because there's one tree that's going to be friends of the Jews and they're mad at that tree like they're they're they're lunatics right this is they're they're legit lunatics so this is the problem right like one of the best news organizations covering Israel Palestine is the Babylon B which is a satire site but they're literally the best news source like I mean years ago they put out one article like um it was something like conflict in the Middle East as uh one group wants to kill all the Jews and the other group is Jews who don't want to be killed um you know and like yeah that's that's the problem there um you you have this and I saw someone in the chat asking like why is isn't Israel allowing Gaza access to their own water and the answer is they're allowed they're just not giving Gaza their water and their electricity and their fuel it's a war Israel's not going to provide Fuel and supplies and water only six% of the water in Gaza comes from Israel anyway but they're not going to give them free stuff to help them wage the war Gaza is allowed to make their own water they just Hamas put out the video they rip up all the infrastructure that the Europeans give them and use it to build hom raid Rockets so all the internal water piping has been torn up and used to scrap to fire Rockets into Israel so why don't they have water yeah because they prioritize the Jihad over the water that's not that's not Israel's fault it's it's not bad like I do think I saw some people in chat wanting to talk about the B for declaration so I'll go back to this and like the you know people will because it's address to Lord Rothchild and all that the major Zionist movement in Europe picks up in the late 1880s uh you know theater Hotel over the um dyus Affair so dyus was this French military officer who was sort of blamed um for for undermining the French thing German it was BS there was no evidence but this was sort of the shame and the Jes and it was sort of a wakeup call for a lot of European Jews that things are going to get bad let's uh let's try and get out of here and reestablish the state of Israel so you had the British make two promises um during the first world war in 1917 they make the B for declaration where uh the zionists finally Lobby like there's the story like Rothchild the Rothchilds were not on board with the with iism from day one um they they were pretty clear like they didn't want it they were comfortable it wasn't until the Zionist movement actually gained um significant uh following in The Wider Jewish community did they then pressure the Roth Childs into writing the letter to Balor and all that so you know the whole Rothchilds created isy old like no it was the Jews who had to push the Rothchilds into writing the letter and the rabbis and all that but you have this massive Zionist movement so you you had the British make two promises you know one to the Jewish community so they would help support the war effort and then one to the Arabs um and the Saudis so they would help support the war effort like they promised Jews a state of Israel and they promised um the Saudis basically a global caliphate right they over promised everything it was war they made deals and all this so this is why I say it really starts in Sano it's not bfor it's not Sykes Pico like these are handshake random agreements sort of declarations the real legal framework comes in 1920 Sano like that's that's where we started if you want to go into you know the Zionist moov exists you know in in the spartic Jews in North Africa way before it exists in in in Europe I mean Europeans get get more attention in this world such as life we can debate about why and how and if sure but you know there's always been this movement and there's been this lie you've since now seen pushed by CCE recently that the Jews and Arabs got along so well before Israel I mean the Muslims are always so nice to the Jews why would the Jews do this to them BS absolutely BS like one we were demies second class citizens like we had to pay the jiza in like parts of Iran under Islamic rule uh Jews were not allowed outside in the rain because if the rain touched the Jew and then washed off and touched someone else it would it would pass the uncleanliness the yellow star that Hitler used to identify Jews came from Yemen Yemen did that to the Jews way before Hitler did again Hitler learned a lot of anti-Semitism from his tour of the the Islamic world and and his tour guide hajam husseini there so you know Jews were person in Morocco Tunisia this like this this this the Andalusian Paradise myth that we've pushed out like yeah at some point the the the Islamic rule in Spain for a couple hundred years was less anti-semitic than the Spanish Inquisition of the 1890s or the 1490s but being less anti-semitic than the Spanish Spanish Inquisition doesn't mean you are not anti-semitic right so by by no reasonable mod mod day standards would you ever be able to claim that Jews and Muslims coexisted on a level that would be acceptable in the 20th century onward um so you know there's all those lies and and one of the big fermenting lies and you saw Rashid TB P push this stuff all the time she pushed the Jew the Palestinian people welcom Jews during the Holocaust they saw the horrors of the Holocaust and the Palestinians were so kind and they said come Jews come come come come come come Jews we'll save you and then the Jews turned on them no the Palestinians bombed and murdered and raped to prevent Jews from coming to British mandate Palestine they murdered British officers and made demands that they didn't want a Jew even though you pointed out that they all got rich off the Jews right and and this inversion of History right and this FS a lot of the anger because there's a lot of people in the Muslim world right now who live under this delusion that they were so kind to the Jewish people they gave us everything and and then we turned on them and that's just not what happened at no point in Islamic history was there ever any type of like reasonable coexistence like yes it was better than some parts in the Christian world and Jews had had such a terrible history that by comparison you know Morocco for a few years was fine but even during my Mon's time like there were still anti-semitic riots and pogrom like that myones wrote about so yeah were there less progrom than Eastern Europe at the time maybe but when we talk about less there's still s right there's still you know anti-semitic riots Jews could be taken out of their homes at any point and raped and murdered and and thrown in jail or done whatever like second class citizens demies right if they didn't pay the taxes they didn't do this like the the it was not equal rights at no point were we ever equal citizens of any Islamic country now just to put it in context for the Indian viewer abijit I think this will give them a better context and I want you to explain this uh I'll use the analogy of the ram Mand abijit how the Ram Mand movement was a 600-year movement and cases were being filed even when the British were ruling India now a lot of times uh when it comes to the Israel Palestine conflict abijit I hear arguments like oh the British just carved out took this land and gave it to the Jews it was always Palestinian land they were not historically fighting for this land is the argument okay so you know here's the point you know uh we're all so I mean leftists are so good at you know identity we need to discover these new identities uh and you know uh the imagined identity of the nation state and all that blah blah uh I want to show you uh how the divisions the aats and the mustaf the aats were the uh uh provinces uh uh kind of self-governing under the Ottomans and the mustaf were direct ruled from isul okay uh you tell me where you you see Palestine anywhere here they did not have a premodern identity the Jews in fact had an identity of Palestine in the 20s and 30s that the Palestinians did not have of themselves in the 20s and the 30s this entire term is a concoction of epic proportions and you know let me just show you this because if the Palestinians had already been a people you know even Lebanon is an artificial creation KU is an artificial creation Kuwait was created by the British for a reason Lebanon was created by the French to artificially create a Christian majority out of Greater Syria you know if you look at the traditional trade routs out there there were four big cities which controlled the entire region there was Bagdad there was halab Aleppo dsh Damascus and Jerusalem now these four is where all the trade used to go all the military decisions used to to be taken Jerusalem was militarily important because it's up in the hills so it was a very defensible position uh uh uh Damascus is where a lot of the trade used to go from Aleppo is where the northern trade used to go from Bagdad was for historical reasons and things like that and you remember kushel we've spoken about this all of these four cities are not new they are all Bronze Age cities which have been developed so for example Bagdad one of the uh uh outskirts of Bagdad is this which was the assassinate capital of Persia right and this is why the Arabs call Iraq Iraq Arab and Iran is called uh Iraq aab you know aam isn't exactly a kafir but it's a uh U it's it's a it's a Muslim who's not really a Muslim you know Persians aren't really Muslims uh Saddam Hussein wrote this one of his earliest so-called academic papers was uh why uh Persians mosquitoes and Jews must be swatted and killed uh that was one of the lovely academic works that got passed by the University of Bagdad uh so I'm going to show you some map so I'm going to present uh and this is very easy because it's from uh uh what do you call it it's from uh Wikipedia so can you see yeah I'll put it up yeah so this is in 1975 and and I want you to see what this is out here do you see anything here at all that looks like Syria these are called sanjaks sanjaks are basically districts or counties in America you call them counties in India you call them districts uh you don't the vayat and the elat see now here's the vayat of Syria it is nowhere near what we know is Syria which is technically here but there is Aleppo right uh the mustaf of Lebanon because this is direct rule it's a tiny little part which is direct rule from istambul and this is the mustaf of Jerusalem where is Palestine out here do you see anything and see the division here is these are all sanuks which are other parts of like I said districts of the of the Ottoman Empire uh there's nothing out there where is the modern Syrian identity out here where is the modern Lebanese identity out here where is the modern Palestinian or Jordanian identity out here because remember the Sak the outlier areas were complete it it was like the Wild Wild West it was they didn't even need to exercise control out there because you know it was bad lands really right uh then let's go to the reorganization of the empire in uh uh uh 1899 which had already happened by 1899 uh there are actually many more maps I I couldn't find them at short notice I should have probably kept them ready this is how it was then further divided into uh uh uh later on Aleppo was different Hama was different Damascus was different and anybody who knows the history of Syria will tell you Damascus and Neo have never gotten along uh one of the roots of the 2011 civil war that broke out was in fact this constant uh and it is historic it is historic because the Zid rulers uh and salahudin ayubi who came from it also face this thing this constant uh uh war between Aleppo and Damascus the 2011 Civil War is actually this historical thousand maybe 2,000 year old conflict that broken out where there was a drought in the North uh in the in the Aleppo region and there was a huge migration of people throughout 2011 to the South which exacerbated resource competition in the South we've spoken about this before on one of your podcasts I think uh uh um kushen so look at here the Lebanon mustaf has been increased buut has been turned into a vayat now but Jerusalem remains a mustaf because it is one of the important parts of uh Islam and oh sorry uh and let me go here you will also see that uh the Yemen vayat Bears absolutely no historical relation to Yemen Makkah Sanuk Makkah still hasn't been made direct rule uh there are further maps of this and in fact the whole idea when they tell you that Israel is a colonial project Palestine is a colonial project the borders of Palestine where British mandate Palestine British mandate trans Jordan the whole identity of Jordan and Palestine comes from the British the whole identity of Lebanon and France comes from the French you know it it is so incredibly academically dishonest to then claim that it is a h uh H Colonial project when you know anybody with even half a rudimentary I mean look C can can you look up Wikipedia or not I mean it's not a rocket science to look up Wikipedia sure a PhD takes time it requires a lot of applications maybe you'll get it maybe you won't can you at least look up Wikipedia for historic Maps they won't even do that how dishonest is that kusher I'm sorry I'm ranting no that map has changed my perspective like what the hell like I'm not an expert in that area but Dan go ahead all right I mean let's talk about the emology of of of Palestine for a bit so one of the things you know us evil zionists will do when debating a Palestinian on the Internet is and there's a bunch of people spamming Palestine in the chat wherever you go in this stuff name me one Palestinian ruler politician president prime minister prior to yapat give me give me the name what was Palestine before Israel what was the country of Palestine who was one leader what was its currency what was its capital name me something about Palestine prior to yaser Arafat give me one leader right if you want to go hajim Al husseini well yeah that Nazi sure but give me give me one leader of Palestine what was his title what was his position what did he do give me his Wikipedia page give me something can't do it now if we go back to where the term Palestine come from you know the root Road of Palestine is from the Philistines uh in in the Hebrew thing so you might know the story of David and Goliath David was the second king of Israel he becomes famous for the slingshot to the face of Goliath the Palestinian ding dong right now the the P the Palestinians or the um Phil we actually like a seaing people we think from like the Mediterranean they weren't they didn't call themselves Philistines we call them out in the Bible because means Invader so the root of of of of philistine is actually Invader now we get to the first century after Christ uh it's about the year 100 plus uh and there's the baroka religious revolt against Roman occupation of Judea so it's called Judea Jews are from Judea Arabs are from Arabia and and there's a Jewish revolt against the Romans as punishment for the Revolt they rename the area Syria Palestina after the Philistines so it was a humiliation thing where they named the land uh basically Palestine to spite the Jews to name the land after their biblical enemy to embarrass them for revolting now it gets even better Why did um East Palestine when it was partitioned become Jordan immediately because Arabs don't like the name Palestine because they cannot say the name Palestine there is no p in the Arab language Palestine isn't all these Arabs claiming to be indigenous families Going Back 40 billion years we've been we've been in this land longer than the universe is existed I'm sorry you're Arabs there is no Palestine in AR that's why if you listen to Palestinians in Palestine they say Palestine or bastine because they literally cannot say pal there is no word in Arabic that has a p sound so when the Palestinians say they're indigenous to isra to contextual sorry just to contextualize you remember this for our Indian viewers uh how name plates in Pakistan were changed to Al bakan because p is a Udu uh alphabet there is no p in Arabic and so they changed uh Pakistan in the number plates in the car number plates to Al bistan thank exactly right so this this Deb itself and like the insanity of it when when people say Palestinians are indigenous to this land like the literal root word of the of Palestinian is Invader of Israel like that Invaders of Israel like so the Invaders are indigenous they're the indigenous Invaders like it's so insane it's so easily debunked if you know anything about the Arab language if you know anything about how to how to run a functioning Google search if you know anything about basic history all of this is immediately debunked within five minutes the the question is why aren't people you know talking about what the truth is and instead of doing this and you know we layers on you know anti-Semitism Arab funding you know ideological hardliners you know Communists want to use this for their own personal thing like the Soviet Union was against Israel so blah blah blah blah blah there's a whole we we can we can do another five hour podcast on why people won't listen to this podcast um but yeah I mean the whole narrative from from the Palestinians is just outright falsifiable on its face and and you know there is multiple verifications of this uh Palestine word because uh I would urge everybody to read this book by Israel felstein called uh you know the history barit or something just go to Amazon and Google Israel felstein fantastic book uh if you read in the sea peoples one of the sea peoples who are basically Invaders are the pelet okay uh who are believed to be uh the original where Palestinian got its name you also see at this particular period the settlement of the area of the Levant we call Israel today where a completely alien culture is introduced who incidentally eat copious quantities of pork that is a very big differentiator that the people living up in the hills in Jerusalem do not eat pigs but the the pet who we think are the Palestinians bring an entirely new culture and they're chomping down in huge quantities of pigs because pork is one of the most common bones that you find out there in these Palestinian city states so then okay maybe we can start taking a few questions so abijit I know you have to go so maybe I'll uh ask ask you a question um and then I'll I'll because a lot of questions are for Daniel to so questions I'll go first so did the Patriot Act and some similar acts in the west also kind of do a job uh in radicalizing people or so H how does one deal with the future of conflicts like this uh look some some conflicts you just have to accept are intractable uh and you know it's easier to deal with conflicts when you accept their intract ability uh look at India uh you know we always thought the India Pakistan problem was solvable and it never brought us any peace and the moment this Government tried for the first two years then it stopped trying for the last seven years we've ignored Pakistan and things have never been better for us Kashmir is completely peaceful at the moment sure you'll have one or two big Terror attacks but that's the same Terror attacks you'll have in say New York or Barcelona or something like that which will be sporadic once every 10 12 years or something it is not a state of Insurgency uh we refuse to talk to the pakistanis at any level we haven't spoken to them in the last 7 years how good is our life man how good is our life we haven't had a major terror attack uh or or a state of Insurgency for such a long time now have people forgotten that accepting intractability you know there is this belief somehow that intractability is bad sometime intractability is good but abijit a follow-up question because I know you have to go in a couple of minutes but what about all those Palestinians like I was reading a survey only 30% Palestinians that services or 31% support Hamas what about the others like did they they did not sign up for this right they did not and they live in a state of Terror you know I spent 10 days in Gaza uh I have never been in a more dystopian Place North Korea was better I can honestly tell you those 14 days in North Korea were better yeah the food was really shitty okay because in North Korea all I got was rancid pork and I could eat meat so I could only eat cabbage all the time and uh Foreigner food that they used to cook up but Gaza okay great food I'm sorry Daniel but Israelis really don't know how to make Shawarma the Arabs just make much better Shawarma okay you guys really suck at shawarma please don't make Shawarma it's a crime against shaba uh but other I will second that I've been there yeah the Israeli food's overrated yeah and other than that the fear the kind of uh externalization of everything so you know I deal with [ __ ] up conflict societies uh when I used to go to Kashmir at the peak of the Insurgency in the 90s with my dad because after he retired from the defense Ministry you know he was a left Lefty so he wanted to collect all these uh lovely things and whatever whatever he'd go back he'd always say go back after two months his methodology was go back after two months and verify what was said because lies are very difficult to keep track of the truth is very easy to keep track of and every time we'd go back after two months the story would change completely there was actually a woman who Beed her breasts in kashir uh showed us her bra and said that Indian soldiers had killed her son who she had breastfed two months later when we went there and talked to the neighbors they said this woman never had a son she's only got two daughters they're both married okay I have seen seen so many instances of that in Gaza where it's competitive victim Olympics because this gets you points you either become a Marty or if you can't become a Marty you put out a martym story it's you know it's the same way in our society Daniel might have a Ferrari and I only have I don't know a Hundai and so in a party at kushel mea's house oh dude yours is the last year's Ferrari I've got the latest Ferrari then in fact I don't you know it's keeping up with the Joneses they the keeping up with the Joneses is Martyr them Joneses right so it's it's it's such a bizarre West Bank is a lot less [ __ ] up mentally than Gaza is they can't talk have you ever seen a society that can't open its mouth that has been under a state of siege for 17 years but are so happy with their government that they will not criticize any aspect of their government how is that even humanly possible it's it's it's an impossibility right so you realize you're never going to have I've had more honest conversations with peasants in North Korea than I've had in Gaza because in North Korea being an Indian dressing in a kurta pajama I was allowed to walk into slums without a chapero in Gaza because in the language problem it never happened and everybody was always oh look at the Israelis martydom this that I I knew I was being handled and was 10 days of my life I'm never going to get back and I should say Tata to all of you yeah yeah all right abijit you go and Daniel and I will now take over uh Daniel let's get into the questions abijit I'll talk to you later um bye all right Dan okay so somebody asked does Daniel believe that Palestinians are descendants and the original biblical Hebrews PLO also claims that European Jews or Eastern European converts are not real Jews how do Israeli respond to that I mean you have to look and say Mahmud abas has claimed a lot of things over the years um he does have a PhD and Holocaust denial from the Soviet Union so take what he says with the grain of salt uh abbas's claim that the Palestinians are the real Israelites he's also claimed that no the Palestinians were the real Philistines no the Palestinians were actually the amalekites no the Palestinians were the Canaanites do this so mmud boss has claimed that the Palestinians are the descendants of everyone on the planet at different times and there is this anti-semitic conspiracy theory where there was like where the car the Jews aren't real Jews their cars are blah blah blah blah blah I mean I I would say listen Mahmud abas is again has a PHD in Holocaust denial from the Soviet Union and he's claimed so many different things over the years he's claimed that Palestinians are descendants of everyone and everyone and no one and nothing uh that he should just be outright ignored I I mean I don't really want to you know I mean I mean Mahmud abas is the best at debunking Mud abas so if you you want want something if you want someone to to counter what Mahmud Abbas has said then look to Mahmud Abbas Circa 2016 or 2020 or 2012 it will it listen to what he says tomorrow will debunk something he said three years ago yeah now this question Daniel is a very important one I think both both of us can relate to this in a very weird sort of way the rich Arab students who are protesting for Hamas or Palestine what are they getting from this social credit money sympathy Fame what the hell is happening Across the Western World Danel in all these universities what is happening here yeah I mean there's I think the question answers most of it by themselves I'll I'll add to it a little bit uh my friend Lauren isacs who you might recognize in India from India today she's she moved to Israel uh she experienced more crazy anti-Semitism at York University than anyone she was great she'd stand up to it but I studied that I know you studied there too um so Lauren would be but Lauren went to York University for four years like a normal person and then did that the heads of the Palestinian human rights groups a lot of them had been at York University for about 10 to 15 years they take about one course and they get in so there's a lot of international students who are like the leaders um they have connections to to the parties back home and a lot of them are sort of paid to go to university take two courses a year in perpetuity and then they get into these student body groups and do it now if you're talking about like the rich kids who do it again if you come from any Muslim majority country you're brought up in a culture of anti-Semitism like it's it's just starting to break a little bit with the Abraham Accords but this is still a generational project the abrahamic or it's like we're two years into a hundred-year project with with that so yeah there there's social status there's Fame like if if you are seen as being like anti- and you can send that footage back home to Lebanon that looks great for you if you're caught saying you know having a conversation with you know Hill L house and going to a Passover thing and then having friends and doing this like that's not going to look good back home and again a large part of this conflict is the genocidal anti-Semitism or the hardcore anti-Semitism preached and and propagated by the Arab Nations uh over the last 100 years and it's turned into a culture of rabid anti-semites and you know a lot of us don't want to talk about it uh some of us don't have the luxury of ignoring it and sticking our heads in the sand but a lot of you know whes from wherever do have the luxury to stick their head in the sand and just you know say oh Everyone's an an immigrant and a minority and I support all minorities head in the sand um that's the thing but yeah it's there there's a certain amount of social status like the anti-israel side is like there's a lot more girls you can get because like a lot of the Palestinian groups have learned to glom on to wider Western things so like there's like you know the Palestinian groups are in you know they'll go to the you know the safe the trees group and like the this group and they they get into this Global Lefty thing so it's it's a much easier place to just pick up a bunch of 20-year-old girls to and it's easier like to to be on the pro Israel side look we did an hour podcast we went through things Abid had to pull up a map we had to talk about history like I had to talk about the San Accords you want to be a Palestinian activist turn your brain off and start chanting from The River To The Sea Palestine will be free it's just chanting it's just easy chanting you're in a group everyone's getting hyped up whooo there's no all right let me break down the history here from back because if you try and break down the history as a Palestinian activist you go back before 1964 and realize oh Palestine doesn't exist oops yeah what the hell is this LGBT for Palestine like they can't even be LG gbt in Palestine it's it's this psychotic notion we have that we can hug the terrorism away that terrorism doesn't come from the Islamic terrorism doesn't come from Islamic scriptures which are uh it comes from Western imperialism right this is this is the root cause of it in their minds so they think that if they show their support and they hug the terrorists hard enough that their heart will break and realize oh it we we were just really mad at at at Western imperialism so much but I see these are the good ones and you saw you saw what Hamas did to the good ones when they flew into the music festival for peace the Peace festival all those people dancing you know those most of those people were lefties who went to a peace music festival and thought they could you know solve the Israeli Palestine conflict by dancing around like this like okay it was naive but it was dangerously naive because spoiler alert queers for Palestine you go to a music festival and you know like you've seen it at the you think at the bacon the islamist who came in if you said if you said no no no I'm I'm part of queers for Palestine there's no there's no like you get the bullet too um and I think a lot of it's tied to this ideology of social constructivism so if we can create the perfect society that would reduce the terrorism and I'm better than you like I think it I think it's um narcissism masquerading as um let's say virtue yeah who was the person on the Real Time with Bill Mah who said LGBT for Palestine is like the blacks for KKK version I can't remember the meme is it's like chickens for KFC um I can't remember who said that um you know yeah who said that billmar but yeah it's the meme's been done before yeah it's yeah it's it's insane okay this is an interesting question how much role did yaser Arafat play in the isra PLO peace process and why was why Rabin assassinated what are the parallels like if you can draw between Kashmir and Israel PLO so I mean Arafat was sort of like the Ambassador for peace the leader of the Palestinians since you know 1964 and the pl Charter by the way in the founding Charter of the PLO they explicitly state that Gaza and the West Bank are not part of Palestine the only part they considered Palestine was then Israel so it shows you where arafat's priorities were right and the PLO was a terrorist organization the Munich attacks bombings the anadas so with Oslo which was idea um the this was sort of the peace talks um Israel was willing to give up way more than it ever thought it would and way more than the public was willing to give um and Arafat was pretty clear in English he talked peace but during the Oslo Accords and a lot of Israeli journalists on the right tried to report it but the Israeli media wanted to ignore it because most of it was leftwing and wanted to believe in peace but Arafat was pretty clear that he wasn't going to ever abide by the Oslo Accords and he was just going to use them as further leverage to destroy Israel very clear in Arabic he was very clear going around that he had no interest in actual peace he was saying this in Arabic then he would go to the west and say I'm here for peace and so you talk Rabin you know he was killed by you know we'll say a you could say A you know Ultra nationalist or far right or Jewish one who who thought he was giving up too much land and and the assassination was basically all right if we give up this land and all this stuff to the Palestinians it's going to be used as a base of Terror against us ero Gaza um and so he assassinated sakarin who was you know pushing hard for the peace and you know overall this like again like aoud Barack was willing to give up like over a 100% on land swaps uh for Palestinians like the deals that have been offered to the Palestinians to create a Palestinian State have been way over generous um way one-sided to the extreme and all of them have been rejected by the Palestinians and there's I think there's one proposal that was almost accepted and then at the last moment uh Arafat said oh and the right of return for all Palestinians into the land of Israel and then that was the nonstarter right because then oh what like you know unchecked Arab migration into the land of Israel like and a two State and a Palestinian State like no um that thankfully broke that deal but um Arafat was always a bad actor Arafat was always a huster he died worth He was like 12 bill worth 12 billion dollars when he died what was aat into like there was a career terrorist how do he make all this money right because there's sort of a system and like this is where I have sympathy for the Palestinians here because the way the International System is set up is it monetizes Palestinian leadership failures the Palestinian leaders are rewarded to the tune of billions of dollars to fail because they make their money off the peace process do you know what goes away if you have peace the peace process so the Palestinian leaders still to this day are financially incentivized to the tune of billions of dollars to to keep a Perpetual war going and then say ceasefire we need peace talks um and then have those fall apart and then go back to trying to kill everyone and then saying ceasefire we need peace talks and then get billions of dollars for those and and then on and on and on so when you incentivize the leaders of a community towards the community's failure you're going to get community failure so why don't any Arab nations take Palestinian refuges well they don't want well like you could one they were used as a weapon against Israel right so the first St they were very clear in the 1950s that they were saving up these Palestinians to use in like the the war against Israel like they kept them mad and and one day the thought was they keep them mad and they will just flood these people back into Israel when Israel's destroyed right because the thing was like yeah we lost the first round but we're going to continue the fight and eventually we're going to destroy Israel and then you can all go back two they kind of realized what they done to these people they've radicalized them they have these hives of angry radical Terror ridden populations where you go in them then the support for suicide bombing is more than 50% do you really want these people in your population is what the Arab states have calculated because you know if you're Lebanon or Jordan and you've already kind of made your peace with Israel or Lebanon and HB but if you're any country that's sort of found this equilibrium with Israel do you really want the segment of your population that has been promised a genocide to go free reign like this is what happened in Jordan where they had to why they kick the Palestinians out is because the PLO turned on them because they weren't fighting the Jews as hard as they claimed they were so all these countries that don't really like Egypt like one they're also the pal Hamas and the Palestinians a lot of them are now under the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood and Egypt um Jordan especially their main rival to the monarchy is the Muslim Brotherhood so why do you want these radical Muslim Brotherhood supporters with a propensity to commit terrorist attacks inside your borders if they're the um uh if sorry they got a phone call coming in connect computer yeah why do you want them inside your borders if if they're the you know the most likely to commit terrorist attacks against you so again like listen no one wants Gaza Israel doesn't want Gaza Egypt doesn't want Gaza hell Gaza doesn't even want to run Gaza like that's how bad this is so you know we're we're talking about a situation here where for decades um we've turned a entire population of people into a significant geopolitical danger that no one wants a part of and you saw how the mentality of Gaza manifested like when Hamas broke the the Border fences one of the defenses a lot of Palestinian supporters are giving to Hamas is well it wasn't all Hamas look there were regular Palestinians who weren't part of Hamas went through so that makes it so much worse it makes it so much worse that the people saw an opportunity to commit genocide didn't need any prodding whatsoever and decided to run into Israel to rape and murder as many people as they could and do you think like listen the Egyptians are anti-semitic and they want to smack Israel because they are but they're also not stupid they know what Gaza is about they know like they helped create this they were part of they helped create the fim um you know back back in the early 20th century which was you know the Egyptian Military basically G trained Gaz and militants to like sneak into Israel at night and slit the throats of people in kabut and whatever all of this predates Israel 1948 right the feten you know you have the farud in Iraq like it's not it's not a it's not a new phenomenon the Egyptians and the Arab countries know the problem they have created and they don't want to deal with it they kind of just want to unleash it on Israel and then see what happens yeah so maybe this could be the last solution looking at the role of the Americans and the Chinese it's very interesting what the Chinese have done in this current current M and what the Americans are doing so Israel and the world is watching what everybody is doing but then you know there is a thought process in India about the two-state solution that even you know India is a prime example of a two-state solution that even after the two states the hatred doesn't go Pakistan still wants to anex us Pakistan still hates us so so what is maybe this can be the Las working uh question and then before we wrap it up like what do we make of the geopolitical role as of now what has done what America has done and what is the future of the two-state solution well I mean I think the two-state solution has been dead for a while I mean you're not going to combine Gaz into West Bank into one state so you're talking at least three states four states if you already include Jordan and all that but I think the the lesson here is like and there's the lesson I guess from India as well is you got to kind of ignore the Bad actors in the world um do what you need to do um don't appease people who hate you and stand up for yourself and that will make things better like the big problem Israel had is like they have to wait 24 hours between rocket barges to build up up International support to to respond and go back so Jews in the diaspora don't feel attacked and like this has not worked I think it's actually had a a more negative effect and positive effect on on Israel's public perception the fact that they take such extreme care to avoid the loss of Palestinian civilian life they've emboldened them there's no fear like I like it's gonna it's going to sound very scary and I'll get this C out and used against me as some sort of monster but the the best interest of the Palestinian people and the Israeli people is that the Palestinians legitimately fear Israel to death and and are embarrassed and humiliated by what goes down over the next year because that will finally put them in a position to sort of tap this down because this this the situation abaj described you can't have that in a functioning society and it sounds bad but it's the same way I say the Germans needed to be severely humiliated and defeated in the 1940s severely right to sort of Tamp down this sort of We're the greatest bloodline in the world and we will dominate and and labor and Sprout and they needed to be taken down a peg same thing here with the islamist they need to be taken down a Peg and this calling up and asking please can you run away it's not it's not how that part of the world works right like Netanyahu should go on and say listen the phone calling the door knocking the warnings it's all gone you're warning that a missile is in is a missile is outgoing if you hear a missile launch run because one is coming back in that has to be the thing and will this increase civilian casualties in the short term yes but we if we don't do this you're going to create a s a situation through the use of half measures and and all this has created a situation Perpetual War so long term if the war continues forever and ever and ever and ever you're going to get more casualties cumulatively than you would if you just decisively fight the war like any other country would ever do you there's a there's a missile being launched off a building level the building like then the people in Gaza because the people in Gaza have free reign to run around and say I'm a martyr I'm Miss I sympathy look at me because when [ __ ] goes down they get a phone call saying run away and they can go okay run away and there's no threat to them yeah their home gets destroyed but again that's social currency for them and it'll be taken care of and Qatar will find and blah blah blah blah blah they get social currency for being that they got to be a minor celebrity for a bit they get their 15 minutes of fame until they hear Rockets going out and legitimately fear for their lives because Hamas is firing Rockets into Israel they're not going to do anything to stop it and there are different Power forces in in Gaza like one thing people will never talk about is like the Palestinians and a lot of Arab cultures in general like the Arab nation state is a bit of a British creation you can go there a lot of the power is held in tribal militias so different towns and and cities and different areas are ruled kind of half you could say half by Hamas but also half by these tribal militias and I'm saying instigated scenario where the people legitimately hate Hamas because it's getting them killed and there is some infrastructure there uh where you do have armed militant um you know tribal leaders who can possibly overtake um um Hamas and and I do think tribal leaders are a lot easier to deal with than terrorist organizations now it's hard to deal with a lot of them but it's it's easier to deal with a tribal leader or 800 different tribal leaders than it is a terrorist organization that wants to genocide like there's no negotiating with Hamas their goal is global genocide like you can't you can't do that whereas at least tribal leaders can have some local concerns that you can deal with and work with in some way yeah I I honestly feel terrible like the last few weeks I decided not to talk about this issue last week because tempers were flaring I was like I'll wait for a week and I talked about it that's why I had Katherine first and now you know you and AIT I I just want to again once again through the podcast platform

welcome to unraveling the scriptures the descendants of Abraham continue to fight incessant disputes and to this day most people remain unaware of the origin and ancient roots of the conflicts between Palestine and Israel many still perceive these issues as mere superficial discussions but the truth transcends the understanding of most in this video I will thoroughly explore the origins and complexity of the conflicts between Palestinians and Israelis involving Jews and Arabs so I invite all of you to leave your likes share your comments and share this video with those who still do not understand the true nature of these tensions this video will provide answers to the question that many ask why do Palestinians and Jews continue to confront each other stay tuned for this new content on our channel the hidden origins of the Israel Palestine conflict on Saturday October 7th local time the armed Islamic extremist group Hamas conducted a surprise attack by bombarding Israel this attack is considered one of the largest suffered by the country in recent years when claiming this offensive Hamas alleged that it was the beginning of a major operation aimed at reclaiming the territory the conflict between Israel and Palestine is a complex mixture of political religious and obviously the genetic kinship that unites these two peoples this conflict has persisted for decades and has left a sad toll of thousands of injured and dead on both sides on the 7th of this month Hamas surprised by bombarding Israel resulting in hundreds of casualties this attack is considered by the Jews as one of the most significant faced by the country in recent years the attacks primarily occurred in the southern part of the country where thousands of rockets were launch launched in Israeli military statements it was mentioned that several terrorists had infiltrated Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip the conflict between Israel and Palestine dates back decades if not Millennia but its modern form has its roots in 1947 when the United Nations proposed the creation of two states in British mandated Palestine one Jewish and one Arab The Proposal was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and was never implemented without an effective solution the British rulers left the region and the state of Israel was proclaimed by Jewish leaders the following year sparking outrage among the Palestinians and resulting in the 1948 Arab Israeli War amid various disputes over territories the Six-Day War occurred in 1967 significantly altering the landscape in the region after the victory Israel forcibly took control of the West Bank and East Jerusalem then under Jordanian control as well as the Gaza Strip under Egyptian administration at the time half a million Palestinians fled the region since then amidst various conflicts and confrontations the country annexed East Jerusalem where sacred sites for Christians Jews and Muslims are located and continues to occupy the West Bank however it withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005 which has been under the control of the Islamic movement Hamas since 2007 the resolution of the conflict still faces seemingly insurmountable disputes such as Israel's security borders the status of Jerusalem and the right of return for Palestinian refugees who fled or were expelled from their lands the conflict has resulted in several peace attempts but few practical results have been achieved among the Palestinians key demands is the cessation of the col colonization of their territories which include settlements encouraged by Israel for example 2017 data indicates that at least 600,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem on the other hand Israel demands recognition as a Jewish State a demand rejected by the Palestinians who fear compromising the right of return for refugees other factors such as the delay in creating an independent Palestinian State and Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip also complicate the discussion both sides face domestic challenges that make any concessions difficult it is essential to note that although it has exercised control over the region the Palestinian National Authority has lost some of its credibility among Palestinians over the years due to various reasons such as the stagnation of the peace process in the region and allegations of corruption this situation paved the way for the strengthening of an armed Islamic movement known as Hamas but what is Hamas exactly Hamas is one of the leading Islamic organizations in the Palestinian territories today it is designated as a terrorist group by Israel the United States the European Union the United Kingdom and several other Global Powers leading to financial and diplomatic restrictions on the group the name Hamas in Arabic is an acronym representing the Islamic resistance movement origin ating in 1987 after the start of the first inata in Palestine an uprising against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with the loss of credibility of the Palestinian National Authority Hamas won the legislative elections in the Gaza Strip in 2006 and pushed the Palestinian Authority out of local governance Hamas is part of a regional Alliance that includes Iran formerly Persia Syria formerly aramin and and the Shiite Islamic group Hezbollah in Lebanon this Alliance broadly opposes US policy in the Middle East particularly concerning Israel in its founding Charter the Islamic organization set two goals to promote armed resistance against Israel and to conduct social welfare programs in 2017 the group updated its document softening some of its positions in the new document Hamas stated that its struggle is not against Jews but against Zionist occupiers in response Israel argued that the group was trying to deceive the entire world many people on the internet due to a lack of knowledge about ancient biblical genealogies incorrectly claim that Palestinians are pure descendants of Ishmael in contrast to the Israelites who descend from Isaac the wife's son however in reality the issue is more complex Palestinians do indeed have ishmaelite ancestry but they also have a significant portion of Jewish ancestry this is because in the past many Jews converted to Islam in ancient times and adopted an Arab identity forgetting their Jewish Heritage therefore the issue is more diverse than a simple division between ishmaelite Arabs and Jews as many Palestinians have a combination of ethnic and religious backgrounds many Palestinians are actually descendants of Jews mixed with ishmaelite Arabs who are descendants of Ishmael as well as with Jewish descendants additionally Palestinians have a genetic share from an ancient people known as the hagarenes or hagit who were a branch of the ishmaelites mentioned in the Bible they inhabited the regions of jur nafis and nadab situated east of Gilead and their name is associated with the lineage of Hagar the story of Hagar the concubine of Abraham and the mother of Ishmael is indeed fascinating she was originally a princess in Egypt but before becoming a concubine she was simply a slave in the household of Abraham where she served Sarah and Abraham how did she come to be in this situation it's interesting to note that if you consult the Torah you will recall that when Abraham left his homeland you are and went to the land of Canaan he faced famine and had to go to Egypt to buy provisions and food there he encountered the Pharaoh of that time time a known King Abraham feared that due to his wife's Beauty the Pharaoh might desire her and therefore put his own life at risk so Abraham orchestrated a story claiming that Sarah was his sister which placed her life in danger as well she agreed to this and what happened next is truly remarkable the Pharaoh became interested in Sarah and took her into his household but God intervened with a miracle a place plague affected the entire house of the Pharaoh and the Pharaoh himself preventing him from touching Sarah he realized he had made a mistake and chosen the wrong woman a woman who was committed to someone who should not be touched when the Pharaoh apologized to Abraham and Sarah they were all well the Pharaoh even approached his daughter and said my daughter I have never seen anything like this there is a God and these people serve him it would be better for you to be a slave in their house than a princess here an idol worshipper Hagar then gave up everything she had to become a monotheistic slave in the household of Abraham and Sarah we know that Abraham and Sarah were married for 60 years without having children there came a point when Sarah said my husband cannot go on like this he is a very righteous man God has already promised him that a great nation would come from him but perhaps I am not worthy of it that's when she offered Hagar thus Hagar went from being a slave to a concubine having a relationship with Abraham and Ishmael was born from this Union therefore Ishmael is the son of Abraham born from his relationship with his concubine what many people may not be aware of regarding Palestinians is that in addition to being descendants of Ishmael they also have Jewish hagaren and even some Edomite genetic ancestry  over time migrated from one region to another with their central region being Jordan however they also settled in the region that is now Palestine including the Gaza Strip where they intermingled with Jews ishmaelites hagarenes and other groups as a result the Palestinian people are in essence descendants of all these groups the truth about this conflict in terms of kinship and religion is that Palestinians are indeed descendants of Ishmael while Jews have their ancest related to Judah the son of Jacob who in turn was the son of Isaac and Abraham these two groups are essentially two genetic entities with a deep connection various genetic Studies have not only confirmed the relationship between Palestinians and Jews but have also pointed to genetic connections between other groups in the Middle Eastern region such as Lebanese syrians jordanians Saudis and Arabs from the United Arab Emirates showing that they all share a similar ancestry previously people used to say that Arabs and Jews were cousins but in reality they are more like genetic siblings the main difference in Jewish DNA compared to Arab DNA is related to the fact that Jews migrated to Europe and in doing so had some degree of intermixing with European peoples this mixture made them slightly different from their Semitic siblings however Palestinians Lebanese Jordan Ians and other peoples in the region share a common Semitic ethnicity these genetic findings highlight the Deep shared Roots among the different ethnic groups in the region despite the religious and political differences that fuel the current conflict Jews and Arabs are both considered semites although the conflicts in the region are not solely about their genetic connection instead these tensions are intrinsically tied to the religions that have developed over centuries if not millennia Islam founded by Muhammad around 600 AD coexists with Judaism a belief that existed long before that period before the arrival of Islam Arabs followed a variety of pagan beliefs although some shared the same monotheistic Faith as Jews with historical references including from Arab historians suggesting that they were descendants of Ishmael and traced their lineage back to Kanan who was part of Abraham's lineage linking them to the Semitic people even Jethro an Arab from Midian and of Edomite descent had knowledge of the scriptures and in fact taught Moses Moses spent a long period in the home of this priest of God who was an Arab and even married one of Jethro's daughters named seora it's important to clarify that the claim that all Arabs are descendants of Ishmael is mistaken and incorrect Arabs Encompass A diversity of ethnic groups including ishmaelites midianites moabites ammonites and others furthermore there are other Semitic peoples who are not Arabs but still share genetic connections with them therefore not all Arabs are descendants of ishma their lineage includes other Semitic figures thank you to all who have watched the video up to this point please share in the comments if you were already aware of this deep kinship between Arabs and Jews God bless see you soon m"

during 11 days of fighting 13 israelis and 260 palestinians were killed hassan alata was on cool throughout the conflict he's a rescue worker with the palestinian civil defense who are funded by the hamas government his job is to find and pull out those who are trapped under crumpled buildings [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] during the war your job is to pull people out from under the rubble but i imagine that it must have been a very difficult experience to pull your own children and grandchildren out of front of this building and i couldn't definitely [Music] [Music] it seems like a lot of the other buildings around here are still intact why is it the the israeli defense forces was targeting this building specifically were there any palestinian militants any hamas members any islamic jihad members in this building civilians in this region find themselves trapped between two bitter forces israel and the palestinian militant group hamas in its most recent escalation hamas began firing thousands of rockets into israeli territory following israel's efforts to forcibly evict palestinian families from shaykh gerard a neighborhood in east jerusalem the israel defence forces responded with an aerial bombardment that obliterated residential buildings shops and factories most palestinians living in gaza are unable to leave because of the strict blockade on goods and people [Music] vice news spent months securing access to both sides in an attempt to understand the military players involved in a conflict that has angered and rallied people around the world in the middle of the night hamas military wing the alcazan brigades took us to an undisclosed location and asked us to disguise the voices of certain hamas members these guys are extremely concerned about security and us not knowing where we're going so they're going to be blindfolding me and taking us to the next party [Music] we are about to reach two meters okay you can stand here don't move [Music] so we're having to take all of this off absolutely nothing is allowed down and having to give over our cameras give over everything before we go down there and we'll take that equipment from that one to make sure that there's absolutely zero tracking devices or any way of anyone knowing these tunnels are built to be out of sight from israel's drones and have been used in the past to launch attacks on their enemy on the night that hassan's family were killed 160 israeli warplanes dropped 450 missiles and shells in just 40 minutes the idf says this was with the explicit intention of destroying hamas underground tunnel network watch out you are about to write we were given exclusive access inside these still active tunnels these hamas militants are internationally designated as terrorists so we're currently deep deep underground somewhere in the gaza strip we've got permission after days and days of back and forth talking about security issues but they have finally let us down here because they're keen to show that despite the fact that israel says that they've destroyed over 60 miles of these tunnels that they're still going strong they are rebuilding their tunnels they're still got an extensive network that they can use to move people around and to store weaponry what makes you so certain that joining hamas joining the al qasam brigade and ultimately turning to violence is the answer here there's no other solutions but this weapon abu khalid is 25 years old he's one of thousands who joined hamas as a teenager and has been active in the group ever since the fact that you're down here in tunnels that have been built under civilian areas you're launching rockets from civilian areas as well doesn't that mean that you're endangering palestinians you claim to be fighting for we are sacrificing ourselves and our times and and everything we do in order to ensure a better future for our children but are you also not sacrificing the civilians that are directly above you of course we don't want them to get killed or to get targeted but this is the only choice we have this is what we can do and they are supporting us you can't go to the sea you can go to the air you can go to anywhere so that's why we are building tunnels this is the only mean which is possible for for al-qasam brigades over 250 palestinians are dead after this just 11 days you know 13 israelis are dead this is just one of so many escalations over the last few years and it's only a matter of time before the next one what is any of this really achieving the one who started this were not hamas or not the palestinians but the israeli occupation and um you guys fired the first rockets who said that we warned them we tell them not to and stormed our holy land we're talking about a holy site for muslims it doesn't mean that the first rocket was launched from gaza i mean that we started the war the first aggression has is the occupation they stormed our home so it will keep going unless the israelis stop their occupying for our lands these men saw the occupation of their land and the raid of jerusalem's al-aqsa mosque by israeli police as justification for what came next but the israelis see hamas's unsparing use of rockets as a direct threat to their national security we met the man in charge of the israeli air force which ran their side of the battle from the skies this is the first time that major general american norkin has spoken with international media the distance between bercheva to gaza is 40 kilometers the nearest base to gaza is 40 kilometers yes in a minute you can see the border of gaza strip this is gaza it's five minutes flight f16 wow so it's very thin now you can see better uh tel aviv over there oh tel aviv is here jerusalem is over there okay so everything is very very close and hundreds of thousands of citizens living under threat 24 7 threat how many times over the 11 days of conflict did you fly towards gaza thousands yes [Music] we recognize by our intelligence and our uav a rocket launcher those rockets supposed to launch to the israeli cities is there a rocket launcher here yes there is a rocket launcher you can see it in a minute but they said here in hebrew there is people walking on the street near the rocket launchers so you cannot attack you cannot attack there is no other military there is no other air force all around the world that use such a methods like i present to you by calling the enemy and asking please get out from your house because your house is a target sometimes sometimes that happens no not all the time when we know that there is people at the house which are not terrorists we did it and we did it thousands of times not once or two thousands of times i mean hamas obviously fired over four thousand rockets and your military was thankfully able to intercept most of them you have fighter jets you have air-to-air missiles you have air-to-land missiles you have drones yourself the israeli defense forces have killed 20 times the number of israelis who have been killed how is it proportionate or justifiable to be using this machinery in a very densely civilian populated area well this is not the way that i would like describe the situation but that is the situation 20 times the number of people that you've killed the number of israelis don't want to act we react because we cannot accept the hamas or the islamic jihad is launching rockets to jerusalem or towards any other city i mean the problem is that both sides say that they're defending themselves and so you have to recognize that there is obviously a power imbalance and as the stronger side do you accept responsibility for the disproportionate number of civilians i apologize because i'm stronger no isabel it's important for me i am not attacking citizens they launch rocket toward the center of the cities they want and they declare they want to kill israeli citizens [Music] under international humanitarian law warring parties can only target military objectives and must take all precautions to minimise harm to civilians something both sides stress they do but that's not true the night that hassan's daughter and grandchildren died hamas authorities claimed that multiple guided bomb missiles dropped by the israelis were responsible for their deaths we were unable to corroborate the exact weaponry used but the size of the craters along with remnants discovered at the site appeared to match this description hassan his neighbors and some of the 32 survivors we were able to speak with independently said the idf did not call anyone in the building to warn them of the attack if they had they said they would have evacuated after initially denying that they had struck this location the idf later sent a statement to vice news they claimed they did not target the building where the alata family lived but rather a terror tunnel placed in close proximity to the building these underground networks they say are built in and beneath densely populated civilian areas which puts lives at risk the idf did not elaborate on why it was necessary to destroy the residential building if it wasn't the intended target they said the reason they did not call or evacuate civilians was because the building itself wasn't what they were aiming for [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] [Music] inside um hamas training base right now this is where they have their annual summer camp there's hundreds and hundreds of kids here but apparently this year the number of young kids who have signed up and wanting to join hamas has exploded because of the recent conflict [Music] some of these kids as young as 15 they come here to get fitness training military training [Music] [Music] what would you say to people who you know would say that you are brainwashing young children and you're training them to fight for the benefit of hamas [Music] [Music] and do you think it's these kinds of experiences that motivate these young people to come to training camps like this okay okay you

of you have seen the video with the father walking around with his daughter in Palestine and and all the stuff that's going on in Israel and so many questions coming up it was like hey how did Israel some say the greatest air force in the world how did you not know this was taking place don't you have the best intelligence in the world Massad you mean to tell me for one year Hamas built a city identical to the one that you have to prepare and train on how to attack but you didn't know that this was taking place and why is Iran involved in this right after us unfreezes $6 billion and then Iran's going out there chanting mbad Omri MB Omri and then history wise who owned this land before what happened pre 1948 did Palestine own the land and who owned it before Palestine owned the land and all are all Palestinians supporting of Hamas does fat support Hamas again so many questions we went out there and did research sources everybody on what's going on our team put a lot of time behind this and we're going to talk a lot about this year today and I can make you one guarantee no matter what side you're on there's going to be some parts you're going to disagree with there's going to be some parts you're going to agree with here's what you know about me you need to know about me I'm an American a proud American I am a Christian and I was born and raised in Iran and I lived there for 10 years so when I hear mbad America and when I hear all these different things that's going on I'm not one that just watches the videos out there I've lived some of these experiences so I'm not leaning on propaganda I'm sharing with you my what my life experiences have been having said that let's get right into it okay so if you give Val out of this video give it a thumbs up subscribe to the channel let's get into it if you look at this chart right here this shows you what's happened to the land in Israel Palestine over the years so if you look at 1917 this entire land before the British mandate in Palestine Jews made up around 6% of the total population then you go to 1948 war ends Israel gets their land 750,000 Palestinians are expelled Zionist military forces these guys to go to different places captured 78% of historic Palestine then you go to 1967 Israel occupied Gaza and the West Bank then you go to 95 the Oslo Accords which the occupied West Bank was divided into three different areas area a Palestinian control area B joint Israeli and Palestine and area C Israeli control and under Trump this plan would allow Israel to Annex huge parts of the occu West Bank and give Palestinians control of only 15% of historic Palestine okay so now we take a look at the next one here here's mapping israeli's occupation so if you look at this Israel all the way at the top you see you see 5.8 million people 1.6 million Palestinian citizens living together you look to the right you'll see Jerusalem again 349 4500 Palestinians East Jerusalem 220 345,000 Palestinians then on the south you'll see it says West Bank it says West because it's west of Jordan River so they call it the West Bank you'll see 463,000 Israelis 2.7 million Palestinians but go all the way East you'll see Gaza 2.1 million Palestinians you'll see Zero Israelis okay so so the one question that comes up that is is do all Palestinians support what's going on with Hamas and what they're doing right now like it's there's no way in the world everybody can support what some of these guys from Hamas are doing with families the rape these stories you hear about 58% of the Palestinian population in Gaza Strip do support what Hamas is doing but only 42% those from West Bank support what Hamas is doing so less at West Bank obviously higher at Gaza Strip so a few things to know about Hamas samas is a Palestine political faction that controls the Gaza Strip which by the way if you want to know how big it is it's twice the size of DC it's roughly 141 142 square miles which has been under Israeli blockade back by Egypt since Hamas seized control of the coastal strip in 2007 the blockade restricts the Imports of goods including electronic and computer equipment that could be used to make weapons and prevents most people from leaving the territory according to New York Times so so at this point we know that more than 2 million pales live in Gaza Strip today but the key factor is the following here the tiny crowded coastal city has nearly a 50% unemployment rate and gaza's living conditions Health Systems and infrastructure have all deteriorated under the blockade why because people are afraid of doing business with them they they feel like there's risk to do business with them to the policies the way they're running it we'll even talk about the Hamas Charter here in a minute when you see what they had before 1988 versus when they recently updated in 2017 people don't trust Hamas because most people look at Hamas and they think Isis there isn't a trust for Hamas in the way they've been doing things even though they're trying to change but by the way they just hurt themselves this week when they say we're no longer who we used to be we're changing we're this we're that and I'm boom 900 Israelis more than 900 Israelis you kill and you think you're gaining credibility that unemployment is about to go to the roof even worse than what it is right now so Israel says the blockade is necessary to stop the flow of arms into the territory but pal alians and Aid groups say it is collective punishment and exacerbates dire economic and social conditions so so when you look at countries that recognize Palestine in 2023 it's 138 out of 193 UN members that do that's roughly 71% so 55 countries do not recognize Palestine in 2023 but if you look at Israel Israel at the same time it's 165 out of 193 countries and 28 countries don't recognize Israel so now what happened Hamas the Palestinian military group that controls the Gaza Strip launched a surprise attack on Israel the attack was the largest in decades and CAU the Israeli government military and intelligence agencies by surprise Israel immediately responded with air strikes on Gaza targeting centers at house amas militants Israel also mobilized its military reservist and deployed troops to the Gaza border and the number we keep hearing about is 300,000 reservist that they activated so then Israel has pounded the Gaza Strip for third day in a row now and announced a total blockade of the already besieged Gaza Strip including a ban on food and water and the Israeli Army just said that out of the 300,000 reservist they activated a 100,000 of the reserve troops have amassed near the fence with Gaza so so if you look at this year they've been under the blockade the Israeli air Land and Sea blockade now obviously that's a partial blockade they've had since 2007 and it's just full on now so if you look at that red surrounding that's how Gaza is surrounded by a heavily fortified perimeter and now you got 100 ,000 soldiers that are lined up right there by the Gaza Strip so you can only imagine how Palestinians are feeling in this area saying wait a minute we can't get food and water now how long can we go like this this is obviously a major concern for the people who live there now at the same time Israel has always been known for having the most incredible intelligence mad they've always you know in many different lists they're recognized as possibly best they were even trained by the CIA many years ago however there are many questions about Israel government military intelligence agencies how were they taken by surprise by such an assault which is without recent precedent in its complexity and skill how how does mad get caught this bad by Hamas it's a very confusing thing that a lot of people are asking so the initiation of Rocket attacks striking distant targets like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem the role of Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system and by the way if you've seen the videos of the Iron Dome how it prevents a lot of the you know attacks to come through they built this roughly around 2006 when the the the Hezbollah from Lebanon were attacking they said we got to put an irome they did believe it or not the investment was only a $210 million investment and it's been able to protect the city so the Iron Dome how does it work the technology determines if Rockets are headed towards a populated area and if they are the Iron Dome is used to fire Tamir interceptors at the incoming projectiles rockets that don't pose a threat are allowed to fall into empty areas so Hamas militants infiltration into Israel Crossing by land sea and air including the use of bulldozers hang gliders boats and motorbikes again this is first pitch battles on Israeli soil in decades so the militants infiltrated 22 Israeli towns and army bases and took civilians and Soldier hostages many of whom they brought back to Gaza but again the question is how how did the Mad the CIA of Israel that's considered one of the the top agencies in the world how did they allow this to happen how did they not know now this the part that gets a little bit tricky Israel and Egypt have had a very good working relationship together their borders their neighbors for 40 years however an Egyptian intelligence official said the Israeli government was warned about something big before the Hamas attacks this is what the official from AP said we have warned them an explosion of the situation is coming and very soon meanwhile the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin yaho called this claim absolutely false again this is a New York Post and a bus Business Insider story so so now the casualty reports obviously one is too many but this number is this the biggest since 50 years ago is what happened in Israel the number of people killed at Gaza at least 830 injured 4250 occupied Westbank killed at least 19 injured at least 110 and in Israel more than 900 killed injured 264 Americans American citizens have been killed so on Hamas side they're trying to give their reasoning why they chose to attack this is their reason and here's what the leader said the leader of Hamas military Wing Muhammad Dave said the assault was in response to the 16-year blockade of Gaza Israeli raids inside West Bank cities over the pasture violence at al- AA the disputed Jerusalem Holy site sacred to Jews as a Temple Mount increasing attacks by settlers on Palestinians and the growth of settlements and to be more specific the motivating factors for the attacks number one Israel's OCC tion of the West Bank number two recent Israeli police rid on the AA mosque in Jerusalem number three Detention of thousands of Palestinians in Israeli jails and number four the contentious status of the axam musk compound when this happens Benjamin Netanyahu prime minister comes out and says that Israel is at war after Hamas launched a devastating surprise attack on the country and vow to exact an unprecedented price from the terror group and and many of these Israeli military reservers mobilize and there is now speculation about potential ground invasion of Gaza since tank units have been sent to the South here's some places that Israel air strikes targeted uh one Israel's military said it had destroyed centers that house Hamas militants two Palestinian officials said that a hospital had been hit along with multi-story buildings homes and mosque three Gaza Health Ministry in Gaza said that at least 400 plus Palestinians had been killed most inside Israel and the rest in the Enclave so the one chart that's uh being shared all over the place on social media is this one here the historical context of the Israeli Palestine conflict the red represents how many Palestinians have been killed in Conflict related the deaths and then the purple is Israel obviously if you go back to 2008 look at the red versus purple then 2009 and it continues and go to 2014 where this was a 50-day war in 2014 sparked by the kidnapping of three Israeli teenagers ended in the deaths of 73 Israelis and more than 2,000 Palestinians most of them civilians for Israel seeking Vengeance and then today more people in Israel have died in this conflict than in any year in decades and these numbers are just starting to grow potentially within a week if this thing continues both the purple and the red could cross what the numbers were in 2014 meaning what this really shows there is no peace they're having a hard time coexisting and it doesn't show things are getting better it actually shows things are getting worse based on this chart so the unique of this attack here's what an article New York Times says it says the issue came after months of profound anxiety about the cohesion of Israeli society and the Readiness of its military a crisis prompted by the farri key word farri right New York Times says far-right government's effort to reduce the judiciaries power and the New York Times article continues the taxs also came on the holiday of the Sim Tor and nearly 50 years to the day since the Israeli authorities were cut off guard when invading forces from Egypt and Syria set off the start of the yum poor War the the part that got interesting is when all of a sudden Wall Street Journal WR wrote an article talking about how Iran was involved with plotting the attack on Israel and if you look at this article here Iran has long been a support of Hamas and Hezbollah two Palestinian Lebanese militant groups that are designated as terrorist organization by the United States and Israel think about Hezbollah and Hamas just think Isis okay if you know Isis Hezbollah Hamas similar mindsets Iran has been setting aside other Regional conflicts such as its open Feud with Saudi Arabia and Yemen to focus on coordinating financing and arming militias antagonistic to Israel now here's where it gets a little bit interesting you know the 6 billion dollars that us you know unfree to give to Iran in exchange to a political prisoner do you know when that report the news was reported to the rest of us it was on 911 which is kind of weird right it's roughly a month ago when this happens then former speaker Kevin McCarthy is calling on President Biden to refreeze the six billion in Iranian funds in the wake of the recent attacks on Israel by Hamas we're thinking yeah let's work with these guys and let's give him the six billion and give us a political prisoners everything's going to be great then you see them in the parliament you know in Iran M death upon America after we just gave you the six billion kind of weird the timing of this whole thing but let's continue here in a lengthy address laying out a five-step plan to address the escalating conflict in Israel McCarthy took aim at Biden Administration for its prisoner swap with Iran and his decision to unfree 6 billion in Frozen Iranian funds in exchange for freedom of five wrong fully detained American citizens 6 billion for five un wrongfully arrests on US citizens so so here's what's a lot of people are saying the $6 billion doll has become a rallying cry again this is the hill for critics of the Biden Administration and the wake up attack on Israel many Republicans say that the move freed up resources for Iran's military spending and support of terrorism then then next thing you know secretary Anthony blinkin came out pushing back saying no you know all the Iranian criticism he emphasized that not a single dollar has been spent from the funds that have been unfrozen for the prisoner swap Lincoln reiterated that the funds were to be used only for food medicine and other humanitarian Goods now obviously a lot of people don't believe this and and here's where the news comes from wsj Wall Street Journal Iranian security officials helped Hamas plan the attack on Israel and gave the green light for the assault at a meeting in Beirut just last Monday even officers of Iran's Islamic revolutionary guard Corp irgc have worked with Hamas since August to devise the air Land and Sea incursions so what do you think Iran does you think Iran comes out and says they were part of it you think they're denying it well the article continues and says Iran has denied any involvement in the attack but there's a growing consensus amongst experts that Iran played a significant role in planning and executing the attack and evidence of Iran's involvement includes the meeting in Beirut the fact that the attack was coordinated with other Iran back militant groups and the use of sophisticated weapons and tactics that are Beyond hamas's capabilities so Iran's backing of a coordinated group of Arab militias is ominous for Israel and on top of that in the past in previous conflicts the Soviet Union was the ultimate patreon of Israel's Arab enemies and was always able to pressure them to reach some type of accommodation or recognize a red line so so obviously this is a little bit concerning because down the street from here literally half a mile away from here that was protesting literally in the middle of a street okay hundreds of people out here protesting across the country some people are war is this going to impact people in America is it safe is this the time to kind of not feel that safe going out with your family and your kids are they going to calm this thing down it doesn't look like it is one side is saying if you keep bombing us this is what Hamas is saying we're going to have to kill each hostage and we're going to show it on the internet so people can't see that just think about like a statement like that being made and Israel saying look you know we're not negot Nea with terrorists and on the Israel side there's two sides one side saying look the left the Liberals are saying hey find a way to negotiate the other side's like we're not going to negotiate with Terror these guys are saying they're going to kill your kids and you want us to sit there and negotiate you believe these guys you believe that whether we say anything or not they're not going to do it now again whichever white side you lean on that's what's being done today so how is America and Saudi and others looking at this and do people people trust that actually uh peace will be able to be come a reality here we don't know yet but here's what happened there's been International reactions including President Biden's support for Israel Arab Nations including Saudi Arabia are calling for deescalation but avoid blaming Hamas they're they're still being supportive of Hamas they're not blaming Hamas they're just saying we want this thing to be done and we are making a lot of progress with Israel but we just we just want to make sure everything's going to be good with everybody so so this is kind of tricky because you know Biden just recently his top AIDS were trying to push Saudi Arabia to normalize diplomatic Rel relations with Israel yet Saudi Arabia has never recognized a Jewish State out of solidarity with Palestinians but had seemed ready to change its policy you think this event's going to help Saudi be even more comfortable to want to do it now or you think they're going to say whoa whoa whoa we got to back up this one here this is not a good look with us and Hamas and our relationships there so the question can it get worse well the risk of a wider regional conflict involving Hezbollah this is New York Times article the Lebanese shite militant organization that fought war with Israel in 2006 this is Hezbollah coming from Lebanon this will be on the Northern side in a statement Hezbollah said it was closely following the important developments in the Palestinian situation with great interest what that means no one knows they're speaking sign language so now United Nations that is trying to play a role of a peace you know let's deescalate let's not that this is their assessment of what their thinking is going on United Nations peacekeeping Forces in southern Lebanon said that the situation on the Lebanese Israeli border was volatile but stable after Hezbollah and Israeli exchange artillery and Rocket fire earlier in the day volatile but stable really I mean you either believe you or you don't but here's the reality of it if you look at the charter Hamas Charter that they had in 1988 they just updated in 2017 and kind of cleaned it up six years ago but the one thing everybody talks about is what is your core beliefs what do you really believe in you can read the entire chart it's not hard to find on the internet but there's couple things in there that's important for you to look at and here's what it is pretty much the premise of the document that's 36 article can be summarized as falling within the four main themes number one the complete destruction of Israel this say again Hamas the complete destruction of Israel as an essential condition for the liberation of Palestine and the establishment of a Theocratic State based on Islamic law Sharia law this is in Charter 1988 not too long ago just roughly 35 years ago is what they said number two the need for both unrestrained and unseizing holy war Jihad to attain the above objective again to annihilate Israel pretty much off the face of the planet number three the deliberate disdain for and dismissal of any negotiated resolution or political settlements of Jewish and Muslim claims to the Holy Land and number four the reinforcement of historical anti-semitic tropes and calumnies married to Sinister conspiracy theories so now here's what's interesting that article I just read to you was from the Atlantic and the title of the Atlantic says when Hamas tells you who they are believe them so some people may say wait a minute does Israel sit there and say let's eliminate Palestine Palestinians and Hamas off the face of the Earth you've never heard Israel say that by the way Israel could if they wanted to they won the strongest militaries they're not doing that why are they not doing that maybe that's not you know part of what they want to do but for Hamas they're not even you know sitting there trying to hide it here's who we are here's what we want to do here's what we're going after having said that there's also a group of people that are saying maybe Israel allowed for a part of this to happen so the world would back them up to go destroy and annihilate Hamas all of the you know Gaza Strip all of that because now people like Nikki Haley are saying go get them go do this the the Rhinos or the establishment and Lindsey Graham and you know all these guys yeah we should going Iran's getting involved let's go after Iran there's a lot of Iranians that are saying you know the the civilians are saying no no no we don't have a problem this is not us this is our government that's doing this anyways the Tipping Point of how ugly this thing could get it could get very very ugly um in many ways so uh when you take a deeper dive and you see what the history of it is now you kind of have an idea what the events been taking place and a bit of the history obviously we can go into this for hours but this gives you a bit of an idea on what's going on there tragic heartbreaking as a kid I lived there I posted a picture the other day online of my sister and I when I was 6 years old 7 years old and my sister text this to me and she says do you look at this picture do you see what I see I'm like no I don't she says look at the windows I'm like wow wow I always tell the story of how my dad used to tape the windows in Iran so when we would get bombed the glass wouldn't shatter all over us but finally we have a picture my sister texted it to me yesterday to show it that highlights what it was like as a kid living in Iran when war was going on between Iran and Iraq and we would driving a freeways you're like that's the house I used to play that's the park I used to play explosion everywhere it's extremely scary I don't pray it on anybody including my enemy but um you know you know very weird first we have Ukraine Russia then we have the way we left Afghanistan then we have Hamas using the weapons that we left in Afghanistan to used to go attack Israelis very wild tragic what's going on that's the update for now um if you want to go a little bit deeper on this we had Rosanne bar if you know Rosanne bar the comedian she was on the podcast uh recently and we got deeper into this topic she gave her perspective if you want to watch more on this topic click here to watch that video having said that um take care everybody bye-bye bye-bye"

121,jwvsrybklf8,Hamas leader&#39;s son who became a spy explains what Hamas really wants,"Mosab Hassan Yousef, the son of Hamas' founder who later became one of Israel's top informants, speaks with CNN's Jake Tapper about Israel's war on the terror group and the situation in Gaza. #CNN #News",2023-10-23,1328938,22141,8285,UCupvZG-5ko_eiXAupbDfxWw," Joining us now, Mosab Hassan You He is the son of a Hamas foundin and later become became one of Israel's top informants he went undercove with Hamas from 1997 until 2007 on behalf of Israel's Shin Bet security services. And he now lives in an undisclosed location. Mosab Yousef, thank you so much for joining us What did you see and experience that made you turn on Hamas and help Israel You know, since I was a child, I always complained to my father about Hamas abuse of power and their brutality. You know, they are very strict a they are very religious. They they're fanatics. And but I did not think at some  you know, they would cause all this global You know, they are we saw their  I witnessed their brutality firs when I was in prison, when they tortured so many Pales people for suspicion of collaborating with Israel. And this is basically when I start questioning Hamas movement did the barbarity and the cruelty of what Hamas di to innocent civilians on October Did that surprise you? Well, you know, they surprised me as they surprised everybody by the scale of the attack. You know, we did not see that co But their brutality, their natur it did not surprise me. You know, back in 1996, they killed so many people, they tortured so many people. Our, you know, prison mates, bas people I knew personally, they did all type of crazy thing you know, they put needles under people's fingernails, you know, and I witnessed that f So I am not surprised to what extent Hamas can go. But the scale of the attack on October 7th, that was surprise, I think, for everybody, includin Hamas themselves. Were you surprised at the failure of Israeli intell October 7th? Listen, there was a failure, but this is not the time to blam anybody there. There. There is corruption. There is failure. There is lack of leadership. But this is not the time now to blame anybody. This is the time to get unified. You know, the United States need to give Israel the necessary cover to uproot Hamas. You know, Hamas Israel is fighting on beha of America. Israel is fighting on behalf of the Palestinian people. Israel now is fighting on behalf of the free world. This is not a political propagan I as an ex Hamas member, the son of the founder o organization, and today as an American citizen I ask the president of the Unite to give Israel the necessary cover, the necessary s whatever it takes to uproot Hama Otherwise, the next war is going to be dead I know that you think that Hamas is the enemy of not just Israel but the Palestinian people. Strategically, do you think it is wise for the Israeli Defense Forces to to stage a ground incursion i to uproot Hamas? Do you think that's a smart thin Well, you know, now it's a war time, unfortunate And this war, Israel did not sta Hamas started this war. And Hamas, in fact, in this equation, blood for mone They start a war every few years whenever they want money and they should children's blood This is their game. And this has to stop this to have to come to an end. And unfortunately, the price is not going to be che In fact, I feel very sorry for Israel that they have to go into Gaza where there are booby traps all over the place. And tunnels all over the place. I don't know how many Israeli soldiers have to die in order to destroy Hamas. This is the most complicated mission a moder has in our in our modern day. Now, what I suggest, you know, to the Israelis, that they wait, they take their time, they collect intelligence. And what I need from the United  to give enough support, in fact, I would like to see the Navy SEA taking part in this. I know this sounds horrible, but again, I speak as a taxpayer, as an American today that we need to be unified. We need to give Israel the suppo We need to free Palestinians and free Gaza from Hamas ruling You were embedded with Hamas before you were well, first you were with Hamas and then you were embedded with  on behalf of the Shin Bet. What can you tell us about what  these people? What what are they like? What are the leaders of Hamas li What do they want Well, they are a religious movement, and this is what everybody's afraid to say. If Hamas was a political movemen then we can satisfy their political ambition. But Hamas is a religious movemen that does not believe in political borders. You know, they want to establish an Islamic step state on the rubble of the state of Is They want to end it. The Jewish people and the Jewish They want to kill everybody who support Israel, then establish an Islamic state. But this is not the end because their ambition is global They want to establish eventually an Islamic state, a global state. So this is what's on their mind. And we know that we cannot satis their ambition. And the more power, you know, we give them, the more aggressiv they are going to be. Hence, we cannot give Hamas what they want. We cannot give them what they are asking for, whatever it takes. You know, in war, people die and we need to prepare public. You know, I say that this is an  Israel did not start it, but Isr will end it. So the United States insists that the aid being provided for  in Gaza will not go to Hamas. Do you believe that the aid will not go to Hamas? Do you believe that the aid will to the innocent Palestinians You know, they are not. It states and Europe have been very generous with the Palestinian people. But their leadership still the m all the time. They still. So much aid came into Gaza. Hamas used all that aid to build under the ground. And now look at the chaos they are creating. The aid is great, but not right  I suggest that we open the borde for the Palestinian innocent peo including women, children and elders, to leave the Gaza St or to go into a safe zone In the meantime, we have to enforce unbridgeable siege on Ha Otherwise, we are not able to deplete them. They are under the ground. They have hostages. We have to cut the power. We cannot give them food. We cannot give them water. And we have to deplete them for long weeks before we can eve You know, otherwise we cannot win this war against this brutal enemy, enemy of humanity. Have Yousef thank you so much for your time. Really, really appreciate your i You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you for having me."

#MiddleEast #Israel #Palestine",2023-10-08,312129,1524,1473,UCaXkIU1QidjPwiAYu6GcHjg," WHICH WILL BE LED BY THE FBI AND OTHER DOMESTIC AGENCIES. >> OVER THE PAST TWO HOURS, WE'VE TALKED WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIPLOMATIC BACKGROUNDS, MILITARY BACKGROUNDS, ABOUT THE ROLE IRAN HAS PLAYED IN ALL OF THIS. I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU WITH YOUR NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTISE AND BACKGROUND. WHERE DO YOU BELIEVE IRAN FITS IN? >> THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT IRAN HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF HAMAS THROUGH THE YEARS. AND VERY INTERESTINGLY, WE'VE SEEN EVEN HEZBOLLAH AND HAMAS MARY UP TOGETHER. I SAY INTERESTINGLY, BECAUSE OF TWO DIFFERENT FACTIONS WITHIN THE MUSLIM RELIGION. ONE IS SUNNI, ONE IS SHE. WHEN IT COMES TO A COMMON ENEMY, ISRAEL, THEY ARE WILLING AND HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER. WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT? HEZBOLLAH IS A MIGHTY, MIGHTY FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH. WITH LOTS OF WEAPONRY, LOTS OF MUNITIONS, AND LOTS OF PEOPLE THEY CAN REALLY HURT PEOPLE. SO, WHEN WE LOOK AT HOW HAMAS PULLED THIS OFF, THEY COULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS ALONE. SO, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT HEZBOLLAH, AND WHO IS THE SPONSOR OF HEZBOLLAH? THE NATION OF IRAN. THAT'S GOING TO COME UNDER SCRUTINY IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD. >> WHEN YOU SEE AN ATTACK LIKE THIS ABROAD, WHAT IS THEN THE SECURITY APPARATUS THAT GOES INTO EFFECT IN THE UNITED STATES TO ASSURE THAT RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE SHORED UP. >> YEAH, WE'VE ALREADY SEEN REPORTING, WALL STREET JOURNAL AMONG OTHERS, REPORTING THAT THE NEW YORK POST DEPARTMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS STEPPED UP THEIR COVERAGE OF RELIGIOUS SITES. SYNAGOGUES THROUGHOUT THE NEW YORK AREA. AND PREDOMINANTLY JEWISH NEIGHBORHOODS. I WOULD ALSO NOTE, THERE IS EQUAL CONCERN ABOUT RETALIATION AGAINST THE MUSLIM AMERICAN COMMUNITY. SO, THERE WILL BE OUTREACH THERE TO ENSURE THAT VIOLENCE DOES NOT BREAK OUT HERE ON OUR SOIL. NOW, WHAT THE FBI IS GONNA BE DOING, INEVITABLY, CALLED IN TODAY TO CHECK SOURCES. METHODS OF ALL KINDS, WHO HAS THE SOURCE WHO HAS AN INFORMANT THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO SHARE SOMETHING CONNECTED OVER THERE THAT CAN SHED LIGHT ON SOMETHING BECAUSE HISTORICALLY THEY INTEREST IN HAMAS HAS BEEN FINANCIAL IT'S ALL ABOUT THE FUNDING OF HAMAS THE MONEY THAT COMES OUT OF HIGH-PROFILE TAKEDOWNS OF CHARITIES MUSLIM CHARITIES LOTS OF THEM OVER THE EVEN DESIGNATED AS TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE MERELY MONEY GATHERING FRONTS FOR HAMAS. DON'T BE SURPRISED IF THERE'S ANY INVESTIGATION RIGHT NOW THAT HAPPENS TO BE PENDING. AGAINST SUCH A CHARITY. DON'T BE SURPRISED IF THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS, TAKE THOSE DOWN NOW. DON'T WAIT, PRIORITIZE."
123,Y58njT2oXfE,Israeli Palestinian conflict explained: an animated introduction to Israel and Palestine,"Israeli Palestinian conflict explained: an animated introduction Israel and Palestine 

Easy to understand, historically accurate https://JewishVoiceforPeace.org/ mini- primer about why Israelis and Palestinians are fighting, why the US-backed peace process has been an impediment to peace, and what you can do to make a difference. This conflict is essentially about land and human rights, not religion and culture. Endorsed by Palestinian, Israeli and American scholars and peace activists.

Jewish Voice for Peace opposes anti-Jewish, anti-Muslim, and anti-Arab bigotry and oppression. JVP seeks an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem; security and self-determination for Israelis and Palestinians; a just solution for Palestinian refugees based on principles established in international law; an end to violence against civilians; and peace and justice for all peoples of the Middle East. Current mission statement adopted in 2009.

Jewish Voice for Peace is a diverse and democratic community of activists inspired by Jewish tradition to work together for peace, social justice, and human rights. We support the aspirations of Israelis and Palestinians for security and self-determination.

We seek:

A U.S. foreign policy based on promoting peace, democracy, human rights, and respect for international law.
An end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem.
A resolution of the Palestinian refugee problem consistent with international law and equity.
An end to all violence against civilians.
Peace among the peoples of the Middle East.
We are among the many American Jews who say to the U.S. and Israeli governments: “Not in our names!”

JVP supports peace activists in Palestine and Israel, and works in broad coalition with other Jewish, Arab-American, faith-based, peace and social justice organizations.

Jewish Voice for Peace calls for a U.S. foreign policy that promotes democracy and human rights. The United States must stop supporting repressive policies in Israel and elsewhere. U.S. military aid to countries in the Middle East must be based on rigorous enforcement of the Arms Export Control and Foreign Assistance Acts, which mandate that military aid may be used for only defensive purposes within the recipient country’s borders, and that aid may not be delivered to countries that abuse human rights.

Under these guidelines, U.S. military aid to Israel must be suspended until the occupation ends, since the occupation itself is in violation of these guidelines. Military aid allows Israel to avoid making serious efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as well as conflicts with its other neighbors. It enables the occupation, contributes to the devastation of Palestinian society and fosters the increasing militarization of Israeli society.

JVP also calls for suspension of military aid to other human rights abusers and occupiers in the Middle East. This aid helps prop up autocratic and repressive regimes, promotes violations of human rights and international law, obstructs democratic movements, prolongs the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and fosters militarism and violence at home and abroad.

if you build a refuge for A persecuted people in a place where another people already lived in the next few minutes you'll learn why this moral quandry is at the root of the struggle between Israelis and Palestinians and what you can do to help achieve a just peace for everyone in the region first there are a couple of things it's helpful to understand one many Jews fled harsh persecution in anti-semitic Europe especially the Nazi Holocaust zionists encouraged massive immigration to Historic Palestine at that time a British colony where Jews had an age-old connection and where small Jewish communities had long existed among larger groups of indigenous peoples but when the UN offered the Jewish immigrants the majority of the land for a new state called Israel for the indigenous Palestinians who lived there it was a mass massive destruction of Life they rejected the un's partition plan and several Arab States invaded the new state of Israel Israeli forces essentially erased over 400 Palestinian Villages and towns by the end of the fighting Israel controlled 78% of historic Palestine and when 3/4 of a million Palestinians who fled or were expelled during fighting tried to return to their homes with the new state now stood they were permanently barred by the government while over 100,000 of their relatives and neighbors who hadn't left became second class citizens of the new state along with the new Jewish majority today Palestinian refugees and their descendants number in the millions most are in the Gaza Strip the West Bank and Jordan many are spread throughout the world with Millions still living in refugee camps seeking to return to their Homeland to sum up one group of refugees found a much needed home but in the process a new group of refugees was created here's the second thing to understand Israel was founded as a Jewish state but now ask yourself what exactly does that mean people had lots of ideas about what a Jewish State should look like some called for equality for all citizens but what was created in practice was institutional discrimination against non-jews in other words Israel ended up being built on a blueprint of exclusion the Israeli government wants maximum land and resources for Jews but not the Palestinians living there that's why inside Israel Jews get special privileges including rights to land and housing that are denied to the Palestinian citizens who make up 20% of Israel's population that's also part of why Israel has never defined its borders in fact they still hold on to land the West Bank and Gaza that they conquered in the War in 1967 since then Israel has built Jewish settlements throughout the occupied West Bank building Jewish only cities and supplying them with infrastructure like roads and Army Camps schools and even a college military occupations are meant to be temporary but after 40 plus years this one looks permanent and entirely unjust in the West Bank Israeli Jewish settlers and Palestinians live on the same land but must live under two completely separate and unequal systems of Israeli law the Jewish settlers dominate the natural resources including water and agricultural land and they're backed by the Israeli Army to maintain the occupation Israel has demolished thousands of Palestinian homes and Orchards confiscated Palestinian land bombed a captive civilian population in Gaza and punished resistance with raids arrests and assassinations all to gain maximum land while making life so difficult for Palestinians that they will either leave or be too afraid to resist Palestinians have fought back for decades they tried to achieve National Liberation through armed struggle some groups still do but the majority now support popular protest instead the deeply harmful pattern of control repression and violence profoundly harms Palestinians living under occupation and Israelis living as occupiers this must be broken to reach a peaceful and secure future for both peoples now that you understand the problem what about the solution what about peace talks so far over two decades of usback peace talks have actually made things worse by helping Israel continue the occupation it's been years of talking while Israel massively expanded the Jewish settlements and L literally redrew the map peace talks are good if they're real but not when they're theater to cover a land grab so now what the current world superpower the United States has been a terrible friend enabling Israel's destructive and self-destructive expansion onto Palestinian Land by funding the Israeli military the biggest recipient of US foreign aid in the world but there's another superpower that can make the difference you there's a movement with hundreds of thousands of people just like you across the world including Palestinians and Israelis protesting educating divesting and boycotting all to bring nonviolent International pressure on Israel to stop violating human rights of Palestinians throughout history where governments have failed to push for justice people just like you like us have taken the lead and won now it's the Palestinians turn for freedom and Justice we can pressure Israel to end the occupation and the Discrimination we want all people Jews and Palestinians to have equality human rights and democracy we can change history join [Music] us"
124,S3NV5taFoWc,"Explainer: Israel-Palestine conflict, the two-state solution","The Israel-Palestine conflict has been one the longest conflicts in history. Internationally, the widely accepted approach to resolving the conflict is the ""two-state solution"".  

What is a two-state solution and why is it so important?

128,htNfs-UeNvQ,Timeline: The Palestinian and Israeli conflict explained,"KPRC 2 spoke with US Ambassador David Satterfield, the current director of Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy about his insight on the conflict happening in Israel.",2023-10-10,9936,67,18,UCKQECjul8nw1KW_JzfBTP1A," joining me is Ambassador David saterfield he is with Rice University of course the director of the University's Baker Institute for Public Policy also a US Diplomat focusing on Middle East for over the past 40 years more than 40 years as a matter of fact Ambassador thanks so much for joining us delighted to be here first I have to ask you Saturday morning when you first learned of the attacks in this new conflict what were the first thoughts that went through your mind well even by the the early morning hours it was clear that the scope of what had happened hostage taking Israeli military facilities civilian settlements outside of Gaza stormed by what seemed to be hundreds of Hamas terrorists with many many killed this was shocking horrific and absolutely unprecedented in its scope all right A lot of people may not understand the history may not know the history of of this conflict between the Israelis and between the Palestinians can can you walk us through uh where this started and take us to where we are now with this Palestinian Israeli relationship 1948 49 Israel's war of independence uh the Gaza Strip that small part outside the Sinai Peninsula right on the Mediterranean Coast winds up in Egyptian hands outside the boundaries of the Israeli state in 48 that's of course the when Israel first became a nation that's exactly right more of independ stopped was ended beginning of 49 1967 The Six Day War Israel overruns the Sinai and the Gaza Strip as well as the West Bank and the Golan Heights so Gaza comes under Israeli control for the first time June 67 another p p pivotal moment 2005 2005 then prime minister Ariel Chiron RS the decision to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza leave Gaza to its residents over 9,000 Israeli settlers are forced to leave sometimes at the point of a gun and Gaza is turned over outside Israeli control 2006 their elections Hamas the Islamic resistance movement founded in 1987 takes control of the Gaza Strip now it's important to remember Hamas unlike fata yes or arafat's fata movement did not accept those famous Oslo Accords of 1993 in which fata Arafat the PLO recognized the existence of the state of Israel agreed to a negotiated not violent resolution of outstanding issues Hamas didn't accept the Accords rejected them rejected to the PLO and Arafat and continued to insist on a violent course to resolve issues between Israel and the Palestinian people that's they LED they became the leader of the rejectionists amongst the Palestinians okay 2007 2005 Israel withdrawals 2006 elections 2007 Hamas seizes control of the Gaza Strip from fata and from 2007 until today Hamas has ruled and only Hamas has ruled in the Gaza Strip as an Islamic movement rejecting Israel rejecting a peaceful negotiation to the conflict then we have some other uh not minor but uh very in Rapid succession 2008 2009 2008 2009 major Israeli campaign in Gaza ground campaign Gaza Strip is entered and divided into portions by the Israeli Army to bring an end to Hamas violence directed from the strip outside 2014 another Israeli major operation against Gaza and while we have now over here in the years since those nine years there have been multiple smaller Israeli operations against the strip but the general concept was Hamas would recognize Israel believed that its interests were served not by attacking outside the strip but by allowing the peaceful movement of workers from the Gaza Strip into Israel and accepting financing primarily from cutter the state of cutter which would allow Hamas to be able to provide for the needs of its people and this Arrangement this concept of operations was what governed most of that period between 2014 and today but then came the events of satday satday the explosion I have to ask you in your experience knowing that region so well knowing this relationship this conflict so well what is Israel's most important objective and what should we see in terms of the next steps with the understanding that the scope of this horrific violence against Israeli civilians is unprecedented and just for a moment more Jews killed murdered in a single day since the end of the Holocaust in Nazi Germany more Israeli civilian dead in a single event since the founding of the state over a 100 hostages taken children elderly and brought back into Gaza there is no parallel or precedent to this now traditionally the focal point of the Israeli people of their governments has been the return of hostages living or dead but with these numbers and with the death count as it is and Rising with every hour that passes The Dilemma facing the Israeli government is going to be do you negotiate for the hostages which typically means release of Palestinian prisoners or other concessions or do you simply demand their release unharmed do you conduct a ground operation or do you confine yourself to air operations prime minister Netanyahu has been extremely reluctant to put the Israeli Defense Forces on the ground into Gaza it's not an easy kind of campaign it doesn't usually turn out altogether successfully when it comes to an end but he is under enormous pressure right now to act but how do you act in a way that doesn't put those hostages at harm how how do you get the hostages return without paying an unacceptable price to a terrorist organization that's the Dilemma right okay all right Ambassador David saterfield thank you so much thank you"

#Israel #Palestine #MiddleEast",2021-05-19,48821,434,389,UCeY0bbntWzzVIaj2z3QigXg, [Music] you just have two uh conflicting parties each of which has a self-justifying view of the world each of which is determined to maintain his position we're trying to degrade hamas terrorist abilities and to degrade their will to do this again both of which see themselves in an existential struggle for existence existential struggle for dignity and neither of which is willing to surrender the palestinian-israeli conflict has reached a boiling point once more but how did we get here let's start in the early 1900s when the region now known as israel was controlled by the ottoman empire arabs in the region slowly began developing a national identity as palestinian while a growing number of jews moved into the region as part of a movement known as zionism zionism arose in europe in the late 19th century in response to escalating anti-semitism in the quest for a independent land where they would no longer be subject to external persecution after world war one the ottoman empire crumbled the british took control of a region known as mandatory palestine as jewish immigration to the region continued within the past five years alone these have provided permanent homes for two hundred thousand jewish settlers then world war ii and the holocaust court for israel was intensified by the holocaust because the image of jews as long-suffering victims was only magnified in 1947 the british left and the u.n devised a partition plan dividing mandatory palestine into three parts an arab state a jewish state and the holy city of jerusalem as a special international zone israel declared its independence in 1948 and violence broke out palestinians are joined by armies from lebanon syria iraq egypt and jordan in an effort to wipe israel off the map and establish the un's partition as palestine israel won the war and took an additional 23 percent of territory from which they had been attacked in order to enhance their security israel won the war and in the process seized land well beyond the borders outlined by the u.n taking over all of palestine except for gaza controlled by egypt and the west bank controlled by jordan and sparking a palestinian refugee crisis they weren't responsible for anti-semitism in europe they weren't responsible for the holocaust but they had to pay the price for it because they were eventually displaced from their land in 1967 history repeats itself another war israel won and seized more land taking control of the golan heights the west bank and the sinai peninsula the 1978 camp david accords brokered by president jimmy carter led to israel giving the sinai peninsula back to egypt but as israel conceded land it gained further control of what it already had building settlements in the west bank and gaza and breaking up palestinian communities in those regions frustrations reached a boiling point in 1987 and in 2000 with the first and second intifadas or uprisings at least eight israelis are dead in this morning's suicide bombing attack in the northern israeli city of haifa its rooftop peeled back where the suicide bomber had taken a seat in the front of the crowded bus within hours the islamic militant group hamas had claimed responsibility more than ever this was a funeral that masked ranks of palestinian fighters for unprecedentedly israel had killed all three of their top military commanders the two intifadas led to the deaths of more than 5 000 palestinians and 1400 israelis israel withdrew from gaza in 2005 but put in a blockade suffocating the region into further poverty israeli settlements continued to be built in the west bank and jerusalem as land that previously belonged to palestinians changed hands to israeli settlers as for the violence we're seeing today two events are often cited as triggers first tensions flared in mid-april during islam's holy month of ramadan israeli police put up barriers at the damascus gate in jerusalem where muslim worshipers gather after evening prayers this led to palestinians protesting and clashes with police and israeli nationalists second tensions were high after a long-running legal dispute in the east jerusalem neighborhood of sheikh jarrah that left four palestinian families to face eviction from their homes on land claimed by jewish settlers the disturbances we see today are seen and felt around the world it's a very sad story of incompatible aspirations existential aspirations unwillingness to compromise because in the case of uh in case of both sides compromise people fear will lead to suicide will lead to extinction hey nbc news viewers thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down here and click on any of the videos over here to watch the latest interviews show highlights and digital exclusives thanks for watching

been injured the scale of it is being called unprecedented the images are terrifying Israel is fighting back it says the enemy will pay a price the type of which it has never known This Is War and it is massive the hostility is decades old but the latest provocation came this morning Hamas invaded Israel it was a surprise attack no one saw it coming thousands of missiles reigned on Israel Hamas entered Israeli territory killed people and took hostages through the day we've been receiving pictures they're chilling and deeply unsettling but this is a story that must be told so we advise viewer discretion we start with how it began this morning take a look at this [Music] at 7:00 a.m. local time thousands of rockets were fired on Israel we don't have the exact figure but there are multiple reports Hamas says it launched over 5,000 Rockets Israel says 2,500 and other report says more than 7,000 Rockets were fired whatever the number the scale is immense Israel is facing its biggest attack in decades the Rockets fell far and wide some all the way to Northern Israel towards Tel Aviv these attacks activated the sirens Israeli citizens were alerted they were under attack soon the attackers released a video message it featured a Hamas spokesperson you cannot cannot see the face it has the silhouette of a man and he announced an operation against Israel we have decided to put an end to Israel's defenses with God's help so the enemy understands that the time of wreaking without being held accountable is over we announced the start of ala flood operation the AL AA flood operation that's the name of this Kamas operation of the series of attacks that they've launched and it was a well-coordinated operation soon after the message Hamas kicked off their ground assault their terrorists invaded Israel from all directions on land sea and air yes there were paragliders in the air and boats charging towards Israeli [Music] beaches [Music] it was truly unprecedented there was no Skirmish On the Border a limited or a limited ground offensive it was none of these things it was an allout attack Hamas was on the streets of Israel they were seen driving around in Jeeps charging at their targets the focus of the ground assault was Southern Israel they destroyed border fences using bulldozers and Hamas had guns here the Israeli forces were clearly caught off guard this is the Israel Gaza border and here the Hamas captured a tank they were seen [Music] celebrating [Music] as the day progressed they captured more military assets like Vehicles they even infiltrated into military bases as of this evening fighting was underway in at least six locations Reports say the Hamas tried to break into homes Israel's police chief said there were 21 active scenes and this shows the extent of the attack 21 active scenes as the reports poured in prime minister Benin Netanyahu called an emergency meeting and then he made an announcement he said Israel is at War it's not an operation not an escalation This Is War he said citizens of Israel we are at War not an operation not an escalation a war I ordered an extensive Reserve mobilization and a retaliatory war with a strength and scope that the enemy had never known the enemy will pay a price he has never known so Netanyahu has vowed Revenge Israel is striking back but the response will be complicated that's because they still don't have full control of Israeli territory fighting is underway on the streets Israeli troops are clashing with the Hamas Villages and towns on the border have been captured by terrorist ists people have been taken hostage Hamas says it has taken israeli's hostage how many more than 50 as per some unconfirmed reports and there are disturbing videos online they show Israeli citizens being grounded up both civilians and soldiers some have been taken to Gaza this is territory controlled by Hamas other hostages are being held inside their homes and again let me warn you the pictures are disturbing that was an Israeli Soldier he was captured on the Gaza border many more videos like these are circulating and they're fueling anger and calls for retaliation Israel is not known to take such provocations lying down it has launched a counter offensive already they're calling it operation iron swords and this is not just a military response expect Israel to strike deep inside Gaza and also Target the top leaders of Hamas there is talk of deploying troops to Gaza but no official confirmation yet today Israel conducted air strikes Israeli war planes flew to Gaza they conducted strikes at multiple locations and Israel plans to ramp up these operations they held a cabinet meeting earlier in the day chaired by prime minister Benin Netanyahu and he has set out three goals for his military clear out the terrorists impose a vast cost that's the term he used impose a vast cost of on the enemy and fortify other areas Israel's defense minister says they will win at any cost Hamas made a grave mistake this morning I call civilians to abide instructions and follow them to the letter the state of Israel will win this war on the other side Palestinian families are fleeing Gaza they expect more violence the death toll is mounting both sides have reported casualties hundreds of people are hurt but this is just the beginning of the conflict expect the casually count to rise"

#VICENews #News",2023-05-29,1868021,19961,7674,UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ, foreign [Music] [Music] s come here every week to protest against illegal Israeli settlements and outposts that are built on private Palestinian land they accuse Israel of land grabbing we've already seen the Israeli Army fire take us in this direction I'm gonna have to put my gas mask on because I'm already finding it difficult to breathe foreign [Music] oh my God [Music] in the directions of Palestinians everybody Retreats and then they go back the illegal settlements or Outpost known as Evita has been built numerous times on the mountain opposite here in beta over the past 10 years preventing some 30 000 Palestinians from accessing their land it was last evacuated in 2021 when Israeli Courts for settlers to leave again while it determined quote land ownership [Music] Israel's new far-right government has declared settlement expansion a top priority 's hamayas has spent his whole life living in these Hills [Laughter] [Music] um fishing it's all incoming who we spoke to earlier is now on the ground he's struggling they're calling for an ambulance to take him away [Music] the West Bank was first occupied by Israel in 1967. since then Israel has sanctioned over 200 settlements which the United Nations considers illegal under international law the new government formed in late December are led by Benjamin Netanyahu is the most far-right in Israel's history its plan to radically reform the country's Judiciary triggered Mass protests in Tel Aviv but here it enjoys significant support the three million Palestinians in the West Bank are subjected to martial law meanwhile 500 000 settlers like these in beta abide by civilian law which means they're allowed to carry guns and are backed by the Israeli Army so these Israelis are Marching towards an illegal settlement at the top of this hill which they were forced to leave under the last government but they're now being escorted by members of the new far-right government as well as the Israeli military the new government has already allowed nine illegal outposts to become sanctioned settlements settlers here want every atar to be next so behind me is bangiv is Israel's national security minister he's been previously charged with incitement to racial hatred for being part of a terrorist organization but now is actually in Israel's government and he's here supporting the settlers on this March benga Villa has openly praised soldiers who've killed Palestinians and since joining netanyahu's Coalition six months ago he's pushed for his own so-called National Guard a team of security forces that would be under his Direct Control it's led to protests from both Palestinians and Israelis who accuse him of wanting to create a private militia what do you think about the older Israelis who are Marching against your far-right government Italian [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] policies focus on Palestinians but today he didn't want to talk about that say to those who say you are inciting violence again so I'm now being told to leave because I've asked too many questions and bengaver has asked them to get me out so we're leaving now rhetoric like bengaliers has left some International observers uneasy the United Nations says that settlement expansion fuels Violence by undermining the right of Palestinians to self-determination but settlers like simha evantov insist that all of the region belongs to them he lives in a settlement built on land confiscated from two Palestinian Villages he's a leader of the hilltop youth a hard-line religious nationalist group that builds illegal outposts in the West Bank why did you want a home up there it is [Music] like many settlers wants even more support from Israel's far-right government he took us to the house he built illegally on this Hilltop which has since been destroyed by Israeli forces [Music] so the Israeli military are now telling us to move because this is they say a closed militarized Zone we're not allowed to be here so we're going to go move and do the interview somewhere else so this Israeli soldiers here who are telling you you have to move and they've previously also pulled down this building why is that is did you have permission to build this house when you did it right now there are millions of Palestinians who live in the West Bank what do you think should happen to them [Music] [Music] foreign Palestinian residents of the West Bank say raids by Israel have become more frequent and more ferocious 61 year old abdulhadir ashgar was one of the 123 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces this year he was treated in hospital by his own son Elias before he died Israel says it's targeting militants but at least 23 of those killed in the West Bank Jerusalem and Gaza were women and children and in February 30 Palestinian homes were burnt down after hundreds of settlers attacked several Palestinian villages armed Palestinian fighters in the West Bank have also targeted Israelis this year 19 were killed including three British Israelis who moved from the UK to a settlement eight years ago one of them was 15 years old [Music] the increase in violence hasn't disrupted the new government's program it's pushing ahead with the reforms to Israel's judicial system which would make it easier to implement extreme policies including the annexation of the West Bank the proposed changes have triggered the biggest anti-government protests since the creation of Israel every week hundreds of thousands of Israelis Gather in Tel Aviv to protest against the far-right coalition's plans to overhaul the judicial system but what's really striking is that there are hundreds of Israeli Flags everywhere there are lgbtq flags but I can't see any Palestinian Flags here despite 5 million Palestinians living under Israeli military occupation few here believe it's relevant to the debate around democracy man isn't one of them we met the film director as he was battling police officers who'd confiscated his Palestinian Flags in contravention of the law here [Music] foreign he says he attends the protests with a small group of Israelis who ensure that the Palestinian issue isn't ignored I swear to God it's difficult for me right now it's difficult for you reply because look I feel like I feel like ouch of Israel usually I always walk here with my Palestinian flag and this is what disconnects me from all this Zionist orgasm and Zionist orgasms yes welcome yeah yeah it's very rare see this sort of commentary what do you think the people holding these ready Flags will say bye if I go to them and ask them what do you think of occupation the reason why there are not many people here with my opinions is because the Zionist system is very efficient yeah and they touch us from very very early age that this is the place for the Jewish people one of the biggest supporters of Israeli settlement expansion has been former Israeli Prime Minister Natalie Bennett who only a few months ago handed over power to Benjamin Netanyahu before politics Bennett headed an Israeli settler organization called the yisha council he's advocated for the illegal annexation of 60 of the West Bank what do you think the role of the military occupation of Palestinians and the death of Palestinians what what role do you think that has played in terms of Israeli society and politics we make it our business to uh thwart Terror as early as possible in the process so if we can meet the terrorists in his home uh in let's say Janine rather than meet him while he's shooting Us in Tel Aviv all the better that's our process and during that sort of friction yes it Palestinian militants and terrorists die and that's part of it but we we don't go out uh ever um with a goal to kill civilians you say it's defensive but this year 18 Palestinian children have also been killed and the father of Elias that we spoke to was not indoors he was outside he'd just been in a mosque he wasn't around any militants and he was shot and killed we also spoke to the father of a boy who had been killed in Janine he was outside we saw the video of him he was also unarmed and he was killed Shereen is another person who clearly was labeled as press there are clearly situations that happen over and over again I want to emphasize if we don't see Palestinians coming in and killing Israelis we won't walk around there we're not in the business and no one has a desire to roam around Janine or nablis or Ramallah that's not what we're looking for but when folks from those cities come into Israel and and kill Israelis so yes we do go and try and thwart Terror at its sources do you believe in the Palestinians right to have their own state the Palestinians have their own state in Gaza and have half of a state in the West Bank in the PA so as I said that they already have one and a half they're talking about I don't believe in another one we're talking about no Israeli military occupation we're talking about Israeli soldiers withdrawing from the West Bank we're talking about them controlling their own borders we're talking about them making decisions for themselves having their own um army having their own system do you believe it and all you said do you believe in Hamilton so I'll answer you said having their own Army no controlling the borders so they can bring in millions of Palestinians that will flood us no having their own education system their own tax system their own government their own Parliament their own democracy yes but nothing that can infringe on our security so do you believe that Palestinians should be allowed their own State equal to how Israel has its own State it's it's less than a state I said because a state would mean they have their own military it's what I would call an autonomy and yes we need to strengthen that but I am opposed after having one Palestinian state in Gaza another one or half of one in the uh in the Palestinian Authority both are Terror States no I oppose a third one [Music] yeah man finally found another Palestinian flag but many Israeli liberals here agree with naftali Bennett that their democracy doesn't depend on the Palestinian rights of freedom um [Music] [Music] I've been to the West Bank I've been to Jerusalem I was talking to many Palestinians about these demonstrations all of them nearly all of them are supposed to seem indifferent about what's happening and they say this is Jewish people protesting for Jewish democracy it's got nothing to do with us I am very sad to say that I totally agree with them and instead of being home and bitching about it I prefer to come here with my Palestinian flag because I believe that maybe it is helping to change just a tiny tiny tiny tiny bits the wind towards the left [Music] thank you [Music] for sure um [Music] [Music] Elias works as a nurse in a hospital in nebulous City it was a normal day for him until he received information about an Israeli raid can you take me back to the day of the raid when you were working and your father was caught up in it can you explain what you remember from that time foreign [Music] foreign [Music] healthy storage [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] with his father was captured on video thank you foreign [Music] hello in the sentence Israel says it was targeting militants responsible for the killing of Israelis but that day 11 people were shot dead including Elias's father two elderly men and a 16 year old boy what does it do to people when things like this happen and there's no course of justice for you the problems foreign all right

137,6Wj_j9aLxF4,Israel - May 1948: The Battle for Jerusalem | Free Documentary History,"May 1948: The Battle for Jerusalem | History Documentary 

Watch 'How Britain Started the Arab-Israeli Conflict' here: https://youtu.be/ZXfuqUhzESg

One war, ten days, three stories: the Old City of Jerusalem, at the dawn of a new Middle East. For the Brits, it's the shameful end of the 30-year Mandate. For the Jews, it's the birthday of their State. And for the Palestinians, it's a catastrophe. Only now, 60 years later, images can be shown from three opposing points of view, telling a whole new story.

The events of the 1948 war of Jerusalem, which would lead to the founding of Israel, had been immortalized through the photographs of two war photographers, British and Palestinian. 

John Philip, the British photographer, was one of the first photojournalists in the world on the war in Jerusalem. His camera documents the Jews' perspective, the evacuation of thousands of Jews from the Old City of Jerusalem. Philip captures, for Life Magazine, the destruction of the Jewish Quarter of the Old City. 

Meanwhile, Ali Zaarour was one of the few photographers who took photos of the Palestinian side of the story. His photos had never been seen before his grandson discovered them and undertook a tremendous task to illustrate the catastrophe that this war was also for the Palestinians. The Naqba, the catastrophe and the darkest day, where 750,000 Palestinians lost their homes and became refugees. 

The documentary also focuses on Jack Padwais, producer of the first major film about the founding of Israel, ""Hill 24 Does Not Answer"" directed by Thorold Dickinson. Coming from a right-wing Jewish family, he recreated the battle for Jerusalem from an Israeli perspective. To this day, his film is consistently used in schools as the definitive account of that historic battle.

This documentary shows how photographs not only have the power to anchor history in memories and ensure that it is not forgotten but also the ability to create a story and offer different perceptions of an event.

Enjoy stories about people and events that formed the world we live in.",2023-09-29,190909,2051,333,UCsgPO6cNV0wBG-Og3bUZoFA, thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Jerusalem a vision of serenity but the war goes on and in between the battles walls of hostility two peoples with a different story to tell Palestinians and Israelis each fortified in its own memories each with its own images how important are the photos to the survival of one story how do they determine a way an event is remembered everyone's taking photos today there's no photo it didn't happen 60 years ago there were few to witness and take photos of the battle for Jerusalem five days after the foundation of the state of Israel in 1948 the battle for the Jewish quarter escalated outside the walls the Israelis had the upper hand within the walls the Israelis were fighting large Jordanian forces the battle lasted 10 days and nights with heavy Jordanian artillery fire the Israelis surrendered and the old city passed into the hands of the jordanians in 1967 there was another battle and today the old city is under Israeli rule the only photographs of the battle published in 1948 were by War photographer John Phillips he documented the Israeli defeat in The Old City stage by stage right up to the evacuation of three thousand Jewish residents to the Israeli zone of Jerusalem at the same time tens of thousands of Palestinians living outside the walls became refugees each side with its losses it's dead readers of the world press or John Phillips photographs of Palestinians looting Jewish property this is how Israelis still remember the Battle of Jerusalem in 1948 the Jews turned refugees the Palestinians looting their possessions this photo of the little Jewish girl was seen all over the world there were other little girls and there must have been other photographs no Jewish photographer could have shot the pictures I did being a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant was no help either conditions were such that anyone with a camera was considered a Jewish spy and promptly set upon I managed to get the pictures only because I was in the uniform of the Arab Legion on the 14th of May 1948 when I joined the Legion on the way to Jerusalem thank you a pink bromeliad bloomed in an old gasoline can on the window ledge from behind it two Arab Irregulars fired away a third jammed a fresh clip into his rifle the Jews must have at least 50 synagogues and every one is a fortress one of them said it must have been May the 19th that I became aware of the Arab Legion in full battle dress streaming into the old city the Georgians were highly trained and fully equipped for 10 days and nights the battle raged on May the 28th the Israeli surrendered Here Comes mayor Weingarten a legionnaire announced heralding the arrival of the spokesman for the Jewish community in The Old City to my surprise the Legionnaire held weingarten's right hand in a friendly gesture at a quarter to four male Wine Garden and major Abdullah tal set out to ziongate where the surrender was now to be signed the Israeli signatories were male Weingarten and Moshe rosnak the Israeli Commander while the Jewish officer signed musel husseini the representative of the Palestinians in the old city looked on condescendingly a glance at my watch it was exactly 4 36 pm on May 28 1948. the Victor major Abdullah tal contemplating the golden dome at his headquarters before entering the Jewish quarter the vanquished the Jewish inhabitants awaiting their fate during the brief love between the surrender and its aftermath John Phillips kept taking photos even off the Jewish quarter capitulated he managed to get the images outside the Middle East this is how the world had evidence of the hours following the Jewish surrender [Applause] in John Phillips New York Studio there are thousands of photos accumulated over many years as a war photographer in 1996 he left his collection to his step-grandson Andrea Karen this is my grandmother's handiwork right here little not something John would have done get them all nicely Bound in Italy 1948. Arabs sacked the holy city Muslim census tried for a fortnight to keep the news from leaking out but last month these uncensored photographs by life's photographer John Phillips reached New York and told the story once the Looting started and there was a uncertainty about who was who and what was what of course he became nervous about being dressed in an Arab uniform at that point he did not take photos of Palestinian refugees not that I know of he just took these and I don't know if this says he always said that you know back then in the days of the photographs he always said you know modern photographers they just like they take millions of photographs anybody can do that back then you know we only took photographs when we knew we were taking photographs of something important we didn't just take photographs of everything and he always said you know I could if you can't do it in one roll of film then you can't do it at all so you know I think that his assignment was this and he did what what interested in him and he made a very powerful powerful story John Phillips was born in Algiers to British parents he studies Photography in France and becomes one of the world's first photojournalists during the second world war John Phillips follows the Allied Forces throughout Europe and the Middle East there apart from taking photos he also makes friends in high places King Abdullah of Jordan amongst them then in December 1947 an event changes his life John is in Rome in December of 1947 he was in Italy he was photographing actresses and fancy things and he happens upon the demonstration in December of the Jews demonstrating in favor of the partition and the creation of the state of Israel foreign the Titus had built to glorify the Roman victory over the Jews two thousand years ago now stood thousands of Jews demonstrating for the creation of a Jewish state what a Triumph of Faith they thought and his eyes struck very much by the idea that the Jews back in Rome were the Arch of Titus are demonstrating for the creation of a Jewish State again and he decides that he is going to cover this very important story and I guess he got to go ahead so he uh he ends up um with the Arab Legion in Palestine John becomes an Ardent supporter of the Jews right to their own state in Palestine while wearing the uniform of the Victorious Jordanian Legion camera documents the fate of the vanquished Jews the Israeli Fighters were drawn up in loose formation on the square they wore the vacant look of men who had been under constant fire and had slept little the Jewish civilians gathered up their belongings and trudged off to the square it was strange photographing of people who were being uprooted once again the first wave of refugees reached Zion gate borderline between the Old and New Jerusalem one through the gate they would be in Israeli territory few looked back one Wishful boy did a frightened girl screamed I walked back to the street of the Jews Arab civilians in defiance of major Tull's curfew had come like a swarm of locusts to loot oh a proud Muslim led the way followed by his wife carrying Scrolls from a nearby synagogue his daughter was balancing a carton of matzas on her head distracted by the speed with which the quarter was being destroyed I almost missed the terrified girl running down the street in her Terror she bared her teeth like a trapped animal the ground floor of a building had been converted into a makeshift Hospital a round loaf of bread had been left in the mattress beside a wounded man who must have died soon afterward on May the 29th the Jewish quarter was a charred and burnt out shell [Music] five years after the battle of Jerusalem John Phillips photographs come to life in the film Hill 24 doesn't answer the first Israeli feature financed by the owners of marks and Spencer it was shot at the height of the austerity years [Music] it was the first and last film produced by Jack Padua the 92 year old is looking for his forgotten film in the Jerusalem archive [Music] [Music] soldiers of Israel you stand before the walls of Jerusalem for 1878 years these walls have been waiting for you tonight you will Mount them at midnight we shall break through the Zion gate into the old city it was Jack padwell's version of Israel's Birth of a Nation the few against the many boy soldiers carrying the fate of a Nation on their young shoulders Arabs even his enemies barely registered it's real this was uh that's why I say this part of the film ought to be shown today to every single child in school they still think we were given close the mono silver plate the plot was inspired by Jack's own life story a British Jew he comes to Palestine as an intelligence officer in his Majesty's forces he begins passing information to the anti-british Jewish undergrounds let's see where he goes Finnegan pick him up as soon as curfew starts and anyone you find with him yes sir he falls in love with a local Jewish girl and marries her the film's hero returns to Israel having done his time in the British army shalom he joins Israeli Army and takes part in the 1948 battle for Jerusalem the real Jack Padua didn't take part in the battle but he returned to Israel after the 1948 War to produce the film there's a lovely moment where one of our soldiers here's somebody coming around the corner and he thinks it's an Arab and he gets ready to shoot and then he'll save them any little thing we did was a pioneering it was never done before we had to shoot in the old city of acre obviously we couldn't do anything Jerusalem it wasn't in our hands all the explosions of all of the battle scenes the equipment the artillery everything was applied by the Israeli Army get back [Applause] foreign alive and then you see this awful scene where the Arabs suddenly come in okay it's watered this is really quite even today I'm impressed the Arabs Republic they chose Arabs not to look too terrible you know we didn't want to overdo it all right and this is the scene showing an hour of Bluetooth possessions the Jewish refugees left behind [Music] I must schedule nobody enjoy the shooting of all this of these scenes it was too near the actual truth look at the faces that we found look at the people we managed to get together people were crying like babies exactly as it was [Music] for Jack little has changed in the last 60 years as if to prove it he flies to Jerusalem accompanied by his son amazing about the old city [Music] we don't deserve to have this why can you explain hi there Alex do you know the number of youngsters who've never been to the Old City I've got me introduce the past a couple of hours they know nothing they don't know anything about the history the present history the past history scandal I'll ask you an annoying question the answer will be more annoying well annoying question for uh in a cliche question for a real peace but I mean for you what would you give I'd give Tel Aviv it is so absolutely unlikely and that you cannot I mean you can't even begin to in this world why is it unlike they want us out completely only the Fanatics only a few very very noisy noisy politicians 99 of them are Fanatics okay shortly now I'm I'm gonna do circling to the right so you can see the Dome of the Rock there's the Temple Mount and just beyond that is a security fence Palestinian cousins [Applause] Jaffa gate in The Old City the gate into the Muslim quarter the arrow family has been running a photo studio since the 1930s Studio Studio the photographer is the only Palestinian who took photos of the battle over the old city in 1948 his son Zaki shows the images still in the family's possession for the very first time other Cleveland um foreign 60 years after that battle the photos have never seen the light of day Ali named after his grandfather spent hours scanning these photos nope [Music] same city same battle a Jordanian armored car facing Zion gate John Phillips photo taken a few hours earlier shows the Jewish refugees passing through the same gate to the Israeli Zone Dome of the Rock Victory celebration at the center is Musa al-husseini signatory of the surrender and there is more lady hello English some of Arizona photos are almost identical to those John Phillips made Zaki has trouble identifying them his father wrote notes for each photo but they've disappeared foreign foreign foreign nakba the Palestinian catastrophe documented by Aliza Aurora's camera is hello how do you recognize her Charter foreign thank you foreign foreign harass a boy careful then it was dead whiskey whiskey foreign foreign amen is feel to stand wake up and I am the negatives have been kept hidden since the photographer's death why has his son decided to show these photos now foreign foreign tells his neighbor about his father's photographs foreign as you said what has happened to the rest of the Palestinian photographs foreign 1976 the mayor of Jerusalem invited John to come back and find some of the Jewish survivors and photographed them 30 years after Phillips managed to find and take photos of many of them a will to survive Phillips called his photo exhibition according to him the images tell the story of the Jerusalem Jews from defeat and evacuation to rebirth and renewal yes let's get a little background yourself first these pictures were taken by you I was covering the wall and it's nice because for about 27 years I fought a lot of things which had happened hadn't for instance one of the most dramatic pictures of a dead man with a mask a veil over his face I found him again I also found a man who found him in a morgue I thought he was dead he was tapping and he got him out the doctor pulled out his tongue he's still alive you photographed him I thought it was a corpse and the nurse said no I know him see what his photography does here it makes dead men alive again in the Holy Land yeah just like in the Bible let's take a look at some of the pictures this is this is the end of a battle we're about to go into the new city in the old city and this is the Arab command what's what's in the background this is the famous mosque of Omar they evacuated and hear a little bit about his uh funny um he had a very particular kind of accent John and nobody got quite figure out where it was from from the way he spoke John Phillips a foreign correspondent from Distant Shores took photos which were appropriated by the Israelis but they tell only one side of the story yeah I was particularly shocked by those pictures of the Looting so down here you've got an arrow bleeding his women behind him this was looted from a synagogue that these are really boxes of Torres Straits where they ever returned you know the these things weren't found foreign there is a Palestinian article which criticizes John and will to survive it was published right after the exhibition you're kidding me they say about the photos that they serve the southeast American propaganda of course I mean what else what else could it be John is accused of serving the Zionist story completely ignoring the Palestinian side the accompanying text is an insipid afterthought to what must be Philip's views of the early days of the 48 War scenes of a Muslim family allegedly plundering squirrels from the old quarter synagogue that is the interpretation from the text there okay who knows what could they could have been doing carrying Scrolls on their heads John would have so loved to have read this because he would have laughed so you know I mean I mean he certainly never liked you know pontificators and you know self-important people on any side you know so I mean to have read this he would he would have just I mean he would have had a good laugh it would have been really mad it's like I can't believe it then I mean he you know he he probably would have framed this I would say and put it up on the wall this drawing was done by my son who was all of 11 years old he did it immediately after I had taken him to Sea for the first time Hill 24 doesn't answer he apparently came home spent all night doing it and when I woke in the morning it was on my bed in his Tel Aviv home Jack Padua goes over press clippings of Hill 24 doesn't answer which represented Israel the Cannes Film Festival in 1955. in The Hollywood Reporter Hill 24 doesn't answer a fine sensitive picture I left the theater with the feeling that the druze was succeeding in the world today at a time when most other patriotisms were failing because they have a patriotism love of their Homeland as a survived two thousand years of adversity a historical document the original budget for the film which I think if I'm not mistaken was over 650 000 Sterling this was in 1953 my friend when a pound note was a a pound note in the event the film cost exactly three times as much how do you make a small fortune in Israel you come with a big one how original ity the small one the big one went and the small one but I'm still here and all the people who screwed me oh yeah [Music] but I had a lot of fun this is not how any of us imagined we were going to land up but who knows the story is not finished yet [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] I found him the Israeli military archive near Tel Aviv a file which states that they have photos from Jerusalem in 1948. they filed it under Arab sources well I think that's my father pictures because he's the only one who took these pictures first second he's just the only one nobody else it's mean these it's the one which from the house if we find them you are willing to come and see them to come and see it yes yes really and they wish to to copy the writing and in this case make it easier for me to see the numbers and the pictures remember because each I still I have the numbers each negative there is number on it still I don't throw the envelopes from my father's time [Music] wedding I said in um [Music] Iowa hello sir Sorry probably foreign to apply sect exactly yeah okay shut up hi my name is seki hello foreign [Music] where it was 30 years foreign hold on and it's what Auntie

Israel  reports a  majority  of  the deaths  and  injuries  during  the  incident  were  caused  by   the Stampede  with  some   people  being run over  by   the trucks. a lot of   developments  as  always   here. So  I do  want  to   bring in  Javid Ali and  associate professor of   practice. at  the University   of  Michigan. and Arbor.   He's  also  a former  senior   US government  counterterrorism  and  intelligence  official.  joining us  now live.  Thank you so much as  always   for taking  the time  to  be   here  with  us. Absolutely,  Josh  great to be with  you.   All right.  so  your  initial  thoughts  as  you hear  the  details of  this  starting   to  emerge  and also  see  that  video that  was  released  the aerial  video.   by  the IDF.  the more  Grim   news  coming  out of  Gaza   and the fact  that  you had  thousands of  Gaza  and  civilians trying  to  get  food  and uh  other Aid at   this  1 particular  location   just  speaks  to  the overall  humanitarian. Um, uh   situation on the  ground   that  obviously has been   building  for months  and  months  and months. now,  uh   sort of at the  Tactical   level,  you know, why did  things  unfold the way? they   did and and why did the IDF  had the have  these Rules of   engagement  where the troops   um  shot  a warning shots,   even  though  these crowds   were  were  massing trying   to  to  ostensibly  get um,  food  and and other supplies   not storm the the convoys  that  were  there and why why  were  the Rules of   Engagement? Um, allowed to   actually  shoot some of the  protesters  and 1 can imagine  that  or  no  protesters, but  the the individuals gathering  for the the food  and then   it  seems like  just  mass   chaos unfolded  after that.  So  just  another sad  development against this   backdrop  of  the  humanitarian  suffering and  the gastro. Yeah, very  sad  development here  and I do   want  to  take  you out to   this  live  image that  we   have  showing the Israel   Gaza  border. We  also  have   another image that  we  show.  that  does  show  the Israel   Lebanon border  and I want to  talk  a little  bit more   about that  situation as   Arab  media is  now reporting  that  Iran  has given  Hezbollah the quote unquote  green light to  escalate   attacks on  Israel's   northern  border. What  would  an  escalation  look  like?  Would it  essentially be  an   all-out War?  I know  we   have  discussed this  in the   past. Yeah. I mean  Hezbollah  is  by  far in  a way the  most  capable.  adversary  that  Israel  faces.  um   from  a non-state.   perspective in  in  the  region, Hezbollah for the  last  4 years.  has grown  from  a small.  clandestine.   terrorist organization   backed by Iran, uh  from   Lebanon in  the early.  1980s  to  what  it  is. Now it has   a large military  force that   has sophisticated weapons  that  it  is. uh  been   provided  by  Iran. uh  has  members and as  a social   political movement  too as   members of  parliament. uh   the Secretary General of   Hezbollah Hassan   nasrallah is  sort  of the   de facto  kind of leader  of   Southern  Lebanon,  so,  if if this  latest  report   is  true, and it's  unclear  if  it's  not there's also   questions about the Iran   Hezbollah relationship.  or hizballah doesn't   necessarily need  Iran's   backing to  to  do  anything.  um  that  if  but again if   you take  it  at  face   value,  that  it  would be  a  serious serious development  in  the overall conflict   because again,  Hezbollah is   orders  of  magnitude more   capable than  Hamas or  the  other Palestinian.  groups   that  Israel  is  currently  facing  So  if  it  if  there  is  you know  a broader  conflict  between Israel  and  Isabella  it would  make   look  it  would make  um,  what  is  happening in  Gaza   look  small in comparison.   just  because as Bala is  so   much  more. advanced  from  a  from  a military   perspective.  And it is  important to  note  as  you  said, there are so  many   different reports that  are  coming  in  when   you're talking  about.   Israeli media Arabia.  media a lot of   different reports. So it is  to  you know, kind of preface  that  by  saying  if   if this report  turns out to   be  true, so  I appreciate   you.  uh, bringing  that  up   there now as  senior  Hamas  leader  calling on  residents  of  the West  Bank   and Jerusalem to  barricade  themselves  at the  alox.  Moss  at  the start of   Ramadan some  have described   it  as  a quote Uprising.  What  is  the significance   there of  that  move   overall?  Yeah  that  this   could be  another.  attempt  for Hamas to  Rally.   Palestinian.  support.  Uh   for its caused. Um  and even   though  the the bulk  of  the  Israeli fighting  is  in  uh   Gaza  against Hamas.  There's  still been  um, uh   skirmishes  and and um   kind of smaller scale.  Uh,  uh  raids and attacks against  Hamas and other Palestinian,   uh, Targets in  the West   Bank, so, uh, if  if  uh, the  this  call  from  senior   Hamas officials is  heard by   Palestinians  in  the West   Bank, and they  do  try to   barricade themselves  in  the  on  locksmiths  That  would  be  a highly  provocative.   move  certainly with  the  start of  Ramadan in  about  uh, a week  plus  from  now.   Um, and it  would sort of be   daring  the Israelis  to  go.  in  uh  again the beginning  of  Ramadan very  kind of um,  holy  time  in  Islam and  forcibly  removed these  protesters  and 1 can imagine  what  those scenes  would  look  like  so  I think this   seems to  be  um  an  attempt  by  Hamas to  put pressure   on  Israel. uh  in  the West   Bank  even though they  are  facing  pressure  from   Israel  in  the Gaza  Strip.   is  the offensive from   Israel  in? rafah still  imminent? I know  there's  discussion  over  this   potential.  ceasefire and  hostage release deal  and  there's been  a lot of   discussion  over  the last   week  especially  about that   offensive in  rafah is  that   essentially still going to   happen? regardless? Yeah.  That's  a great question   Josh  and we don't  know   from  the outside looking in   sort  of  what  the calculus   is  from.  prime minister Netanyahu. War  cabinet and um  if  the  operational level has have   the Israelis  um  sort  of   put all the right pieces  in   place to  actually  um  start  that  offensive because it   would have to be  fairly   large scale  and involve thousands and  thousands of  troops  and  lots  of  other equipment and  you need  a lot of   intelligence  to  coordinate.  uh  the movement  of  of  all  of  that. uh  activity, but  at the same time  at the   international level,  and  from  the bilateral us   Israel, uh  level  they're probably  a lot of   discussions right now.  uh,  and attempts, um  to  have   Israel  not engage  in  that.  um  aspect  of  the campaign   because  Roth is 1 of the few places  right now,  that uh,   Palestinians  can sort  of   um  seek  some  kind of  refuge  and safety  despite  in  what  happened. uh   today,  and um, the just   thinking  of  the the scenes   of  a large-scale,  uh  IDF  offensive in  this  highly   populated,  part  of   Southern  Gaza  at the   beginning of RAM. Ramadan  1 can imagine that  that it  would just  spark an   enormous  amount  of   international um  outrage and  attention so  that  has to   be  um  factored  into  these  really  decision-making  processes as well.  Want  to   talk  a little  bit more   about the ceasefire and  possible  hostage release  plan  that  has been.  discussed.  So  we  do  have   President Biden we  have  the  leader  of  Egypt saying   that  this  could happen   in the  coming  days  Here.  They  are hopeful for that.  So  my  question  is  does   it  appear  that  Hamas is   kind of softening its demands  for uh  this  deal  to be  reached and does  it  appear   that  we  are closer  to   actually  seeing  a deal.  Well  President Biden made   that  comment I believe on   Monday. and uh  he  um  said   that  uh, this  at  that time  that  was the status  of  uh,  the negotiations. uh, based  on. comments  related to  him  by  his National  Security   adviser Jake  Sullivan. So   that  was Monday, here  We   are now,  it's  Thursday. Um   is  there really  going to   be  a ceasefire?  in  place?   Uh  by  next  Monday  just   a few days  from  now maybe  there will  be  maybe there  won't uh, the the comments   from  the Israeli side  prime  minister  Netanyahu and  others  doesn't seem  to   suggest that  that  is   something that  they  have   agreed  to  um, similarly on   the Hamas side. It's  not  clear.  that  they  they're  sort of negotiating position.  Um, that  they  have  all the  terms they  want  to  put a  ceasefire.  in  place and I  think prime minister   Netanyahu who's still under  a lot of  domestic  political  pressure  to get  the  hostages. back  and and to   show  more  tangible. uh   gains against Hamas whether  that  means killing or   capturing senior leaders,  like  who's the military   chief?  uh  for Hamas?  Um,  in  the Gaza  Strip in  the  West  Bank, so  these are all  things  that  have  to  be   factored  into  whether a  ceasefire.  takes place and  there's International  politics. There's domestic   politics. There's the Hamas  calculus. So  there's so many  complex.  variables that   have  to  go  into  that   decision. and it's  very   complex now the Palestinian  authorities foreign minister   is  saying  that  Hamas  really  does. understand   that  it  shouldn't be  a  part  of  the new government   in  the Palestinian  territories.  Is that a shift  in  any way for Hamas not to   be  part  of  the new  government? well, that  would  be  a sea change  based on.  what's  happened  the past   you or  the past  decade   when  Hamas assumed control  of  the Gaza  Strip now.   maybe that  is  also  a  reflection  of  the the  losses  that  Hamas has  suffered  as  a result  of   the uh, Israeli campaign   against it  and that  but  this  may not be  long  term.  This  could be  short term   where Hamas um, if  there is   some  kind of ceasefire and  if  there is  an  agreement  for the Palestinian Authority  to  take  uh  control with   other um  types of  support  around  it  of  both  the  West  Bank  and the Gaza   Strip that  this  is  the  time  for Hamas to  to   regroup to  regather  and and  think about its next  steps,   but it  doesn't mean  that   it  won't try to  come back  at  the political level or   even  from  a terrorist  perspective.  you know  years  from  now so  that  will  be   another thing that  has to   be  looked  at. All right.   Well  a job at  Ali.   Thank you so  much  for  taking  the time  to  join   us  here. great perspective  and a a great help  to  break  down  all these headlines.  I  say it  all the time, but we   have  these developments   that  pretty  much  happen   on  a daily really  hourly   basis here. Anything  else   you want to add about any of   this  before  I let you go.  Yeah, Josh, um. it'll be   really  interesting to  see  whether a ceasefire does. um   happen  and the fact  that   Ramadan as  I said  before   is  going to  start  relatively  soon. I I do   think that  is  going to  be   a driver  of  whether a  ceasefire.  happens or  not.   And if  it  doesn't and if   this  fighting  continues for  um, the next  6  months it's already on.  Almost  at  the 6-month.   Point,  uh  right now then  I  think that  is  just   going to  put more. pressure.  Um, here  inside  the United   States  on  the  Biden Administration. We've  already seen  the reporting  about how it's  affecting.   Um, politics, especially   where I am  here  in   Michigan  and I know  you're   a Michigan  grad  as well.   So  these are all things   that  that  can play  out  over  the next  several  months  if  a ceasefire  doesn't happen  sooner, uh,  rather  than  later.   All right.  Thank you again  for taking  the time  to  be  "

once again reemerging among the International Community but given the level of violence in the past 7 weeks across the occupied territories is now the time to pursue this path to a lasting peace and what would it take from both sides to secure it this is Inside Story [Music] hello there I'm James Bay 47 days of air strikes on the Gaza Strip nearly 15,000 Palestinians killed 1,200 Israelis dead ongoing raids and arrests by the Israeli Army in the occupied West Bank and add to that Israeli settler attacks on Palestinian communities is now really the best time to restart discussion surrounding the elusive two-state solution for Israel and Palestine international calls have begun to grow louder to pursue this but what are the red lines for both sides and what would a return to 1967 borders look like in reality we'll explore all these issues with our panel of guests in a moment but first this report from ktia Lopez hodan calls to revive a two-state solution are reemerging to address the crisis in Gaza during a visit to the Rafa border crossing in Egypt Spain's prime minister Pedro Sanchez urged the European Union which he currently leads to make that happen I think that the momentum Has Come For The International Community especially for the European Union and member states to recognize uh the state of Palestine Belgium which next year will take over the rotating EU presidency Echoes that call the destruction of Gaza is unacceptable we cannot accept that a society is being destroyed the way it is being destroyed Detroit repeated attempts for a two-state solution have failed for decades there are several issues at play including Israel's illegal settlements land confiscation and the status of occupied East Jerusalem which would be the capital of any future Palestinian State the changes are notable this map outlines Israeli and Palestinian territories in 1967 after The Six Day War decades later this is the new territorial outline between 1967 and 2022 Israel has built about 300 illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem violating international law the US which is Israel's strongest supporter is also backing calls for a two-state solution in a recent statement President Joe Biden said two states for two peoples it's more important now than ever but previous US administrations say political push back has continuously blocked this from happening Hamas is not a partner for any kind of peace or two- State solution but the Palestinian Authority might one time again be new leadership uh in Gaza might again be so you to get to a point where that's possible seven weeks into the war on Gaza calls for a two-state solution are growing louder well beyond the Middle East with supporters insisting it's the best option to ensure security and dignity for both Israelis and Palestinians Kia Lopez oan for insight [Music] story well let's discuss all of this further by bringing in our panel of guests in Tel Aviv Alan leel a former director general of the Israeli foreign Ministry and a former Israeli ambassador to South Africa he's also part of an Israeli campaign to advance recognition of a Palestinian state by other governments in Washington DC Phyllis Ben a fellow at The Institute for policy studies an international adviser to Jewish voice for peace and author of understanding the Palestinian Israeli conflict a primer and in rala Mustafa bakui Secretary General of the Palestinian national initiative and a former information Minister for the Palestinian Authority thank you all of us all of you for joining us today to discuss a two-state solution now this is an idea that clearly isn't new it's been around since before uh the formation of the state of Israel with the un Palestine partition plan although that also in addition to having an Arab and Jewish state was going to have an international City for Jerusalem U let me start by getting your basic view before we discuss this in in detail um do you think that a two-state solution is desirable and viable Mustafa let's start with you well it was desirable and it was viable but Israel killed it Netanyahu in particular came to power with one goal to kill the possibility of two-state solution and he managed to do so in two ways first of all he obstructed any possible negotiations and second he expanded settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories specifically in Gaz in West Bank to a level that makes the two-state solution impossible in the process they've created a one new reality a one apartheid state reality uh pushing Palestinians to start to think that the only alternative to one apartheid state is one Democratic state with equal rights now Netanyahu is coming with the second plan with his fascist crowd in his government like smotrich and Bing and their goal now is to solve the demographic problem where the number of Palestinians is equal if not a little bit more than Jewish Israelis on the land of historic Palestine by trying to impose ethnic cleansing he wants to start with Gaza evicting 2.3 million people out of Gaza and this is the real purpose of this horrible attack on Gaza and then he's trying he will be moving to the West Bank this is the exact reality of today okay if you want to speak will we'll bring you back we'll bring you back in in a bit Mustafa let's get alon's take of this uh do you think it is viable now a two-state solution do you think it's desirable the current circumstances I certainly think it's desirable I am a two Stater from my early adult years I always belied this is the best solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict and with what happened over the years on the 6th of October I was among those believing that this dream is gone that it's not possible anymore and not only because of the number of settlers but also because the Israeli government in the last decade dropped the idea officially dropped the idea and in every Coalition agreement we had until 10 years ago the two- State solution was a goal of the Coalition about 10 years ago it was removed so we were very disillusion we we really believed it's not possible anymore and when you ask me today I think the idea is back on the table okay okay we'll come we'll come to you again in a minute Phyllis your take please well first I would say that I think on the question of viability that there is no land left for a Palestinian State whether or not we'd like it I think it's just not realistic unless we're talking about removing somewhere close to 800,000 illegal Israeli settlers on that land which I don't think is on anyone's agenda number two I think that we have to be clear that the kind of state quote that was being talked about for the Palestinians was never really a Palestinian state it would be an entity that lacked control of its own bard orders of its own water of its own airspace its electrical grid self-defense it was not designed ever it was never discussed as something that would truly be an equal state with the state of Israel and third my only point is I'm an American I'm a Jewish girl from California I don't think I have any right to say whether it's a good thing or a bad thing that's for people who live in that land Palestinians and Israelis to decide and the notion that my president or me as a taxpayer should have some right to choose as opposed to saying what we want is equality if it's one state equality for all within the one state if it's two states equality within both States and between both States but I think as I said as an analyst I don't think it's viable any longer because there is simply no land left okay Mustafa my day job when I'm not here in Doha which I am at the moment is based at the UN in New York for Al jazer and I watch the security council meeting that happens every single month on the Middle East and the situation regarding Israel and Palestine and every single month I listen to all 15 members of the security Council talk and mention a two-state solution it's rather like a mantra but no one ever talks about the steps to make it happen do you think the talk now we're hearing for example from the the Spanish prime minister and the Belgian prime minister Minister do you think it's actually changed or do you think they're just saying it because they have nothing else to say no there is change and the change is specifically because the heroism and the steadfastness of the Palestinian people especially in Gaza but all over Palestine have defeated the Israeli Netanyahu plan to eliminate the Palestinian question and liquidate through normalization with Arab countries as he was planning to so the pales issue is back on the table nobody can avoid it unfortunately it has to be a situation where Israelis are hurt before the world starts to see the reality of Palestine uh there were many many better ways to look at the problem during the last 30 years but the world turned there back to us and especially the United States of America and Western Europe the talk about two-state solution became a title of hypocrisy it be became a cliche that they would mention just to avoid dealing with the problem it's became just a slogan but in reality nobody worked for it if anybody really meant it they would have initiated real sanctions plans on Israel for continuing settlement activities which all these countries including the United States of America admitted was a violation of international law and admitted it would kill the possibility of two State solution so Israel was allowed to increase the number of settlers from 121,000 to more than 750,000 today and they became a major political power inside Israel producing such fascist like smri and Bing becoming actually the real governors of the West Bank now if the world wants I mean the the options are three there are no other options either one Democratic state with equal rights which I prefer for everybody but it would not be a Jewish only state it cannot be one Democratic state of Israel wants to maintain this nation state law which says that self-determination in a it's Israel meaning all of Palestine is for Jewish people only it has to be fully Democratic and fully equal which means equal National and civil rights if that's not what they want and they want two-state solution there are two conditions one the complete evacuation of all settlers from the West Bank and second negotiations will not be about what will happen but will be about implementing a particular end result which everybody would agree about which is that the end of the process is the creation of a Palestinian State the end of Israeli occupation of all occupied territories in 1967 and that the borders are not for discussion the borders are the borders of the 4th of junee 1967 including East Jerusalem if these conditions to these two conditions are there there can be a Palestinian state but without these two conditions the talk about two states becomes only one way of avoiding the problem this is my opinion Al Alan Alan if I can bring you in on this you just heard Mustafa say that up until now the International Community the two- State solution had become just a slogan would you agree with that and do you think they're serious right now I think there is a difference between 2014 and today I think that until 2014 ER countries ER and especially the most relevant ones that are interested in this conflict including the United States and the the European countries really believed the idea is feasible it doesn't mean that they adopted it on the governmental level or put pressure on Israel to implement it but I remember and I was part of it in the last three months of 2014 one Parliament after the other in Western Europe adopted a resolution to call upon the government to recognize a Palestinian State I think at this stage they really believe in it what happened there were several things the first time the first one of them was Isis the major Terror attacks of Isis starting in January 2015 and the big March in Paris and so changed the mood ER in the Palestinian in the Western World on Islam and as a result of it also on the Hamas and the Palestinian issue and there was less Readiness in Europe when the focus was on Isis to discuss a Palestinian State parallel to it and I agree what was said the Israeli government understood the the world is not pushing putting pressure and removed the issue and it was not a a policy of Israel anymore so the the fact that in the last decade the world kind of dropped the idea definitely didn't put pressure on Israel and the Israeli government dropped the idea caused the situation that prior to this war it was not an issue let me bring phis in on that point because when I say sit listening to those un Security Council meetings I listen to the 15 people 15 um members talk about a two-state solution I listen to the Palestinian delegate talk about two-state solution and you never hear the words coming from an Israeli sitting in the security Council for literally years in fact um I tried in the last year to um to address Ambassador gilad Adan the Israeli Ambassador on this I said do you simple question does your government believe in a two-state solution he walked off I mean is Israel doesn't believe in this does it Israel certainly does not believe in it but I think this is not something new and we'll come to you in a second Mustafa we'll come to you in a second Mustafa Phyllis please okay okay thank you okay I think that it's certainly true that the current Israeli government has been far more explicit in its rejection of a two-state solution earlier Israeli governments talked about it talked around it none of them ever acknowledged the realities is that Mustafa so clearly laid out a few minutes ago the notion that there would have to be the removal of uh all settlers or the agreement of all current settlers to become Palestinian set C citizens sorry Palestinian citizens with no special privileges no special protection no arms against their own government they would have to be citizens like everyone else which would make it essentially two equal citizens equal citizenships in two different countries uh but no one is talking about that as a model the models always included the idea that Israel would be the dominant power and what we're hearing now is a much more explicit call for accepting the reality of the Israeli legal system which so many in the world now identify as an apartheid system partly because of the laws that have been passed explicit laws that mandate discrimination against non-jews the most recent one the one that Mustafa referred to the nation state law which is essentially the equivalent in the United States of a constitutional amendment that says explicitly that the right of selfdetermination in the land of Israel meaning all of the land of historic Palestine belongs only to Jews that's a very clear understanding of who is to have power and who will have the choice as one Israeli leader outlined very explicitly the choice will be either Palestinians leave ethnic cleansing as we're now seeing the effort to force people out or they will agree to live under the suppression of a dominant population that of Jews and Jewish Jewish power over Palestinians or they will die okay let me let me bring let Mustafa was very keen to say something Mustafa let me bring you in no I was going to say something similar actually no Israeli government before even the government of itak Rabin agreed on a Palestinian State all they have been talking about is some kind of self-governing authority they differ about the size of the land that will be under this self-governing Authority about the amount of Natural Resources they will be in control of but all Israeli governments without exception up to now we didn't see that government that would agree with a Palestinian independent state meaning that a state would have sovereignity would have control over its borders would have security control of its airspace of its electromagnetic field Etc and even that formula of self-governing structure that could be called a state or whatever you call it Empire maybe even that Netanyahu did not accept okay and that's why Netanyahu made it the goal of his life not only to aggravate the public tillak Rin was assassinated by an Israeli extremist but to kill the very idea that Palestinians would have any form of self-determination okay let me let me for a moment pause for a moment let me read you a quote uh this was when um the issue of settlements as often as it been at the top of the agenda it's a quote from the former un Secretary General bang kimoon uh he said let me read you the parties must act and act now to prevent the two- State solution from slipping away forever unfolding and implementing this Vision two states living side by side in peace and Security offers the only means by which Israel could retain its Jewish majority and Democratic status that was in 2016 it was slipping away forever that was before the Trump Administration and a massive expansion of settlements being built um what do you say Alon to people who say there's absolutely no way now it's already dead it's an apartate State how do you dismantle settlements that have more than 70 700,000 settlers living in them first I was part of the Rabin government so I know exactly who were the people and I know exactly why Rabin was assassinated we wanted a Palestinian State and it cost Rabin his life as you know I think we are missing two words in this discussion one the will and the will of the leadership when you have a leadership that doesn't want a Palestinian State you will not have a Palestinian state but we are speaking on a different leadership we are speaking after this war there might be there will possibly be a different Israeli leadership now if the new Israeli leadership will come back to the two states idea it can happen now another important word that we miss is the swap of land all previous discussions on a Palestinian state with Arafat with Abu maen always spoke on a swap of land not on the removal of all settlers and the number of settlers here were exaggerated I don't know about the higher number at least in the West Bank than half a million but the the swap was the key and we agreed on the first stage to a 3% SW then in the Abu ma talks it was about 5 six% it can be maybe more now but with the swap it is possible and I think now those of us who want two states have to promote the idea of a swap to explain the idea of a swap of land because without a swap I agree it cannot work okay well among those talking about a two-state solution in recent in in a moment Mustafa one of those talking about a two-state solution uh in recent hours has been President Biden a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can one day live side by side with equal measure of freedom and dignity but it does I mean it's all very well saying a two-state solution but it does matter what you mean by a two-state solution we look at the Trump Administration uh Jared Kushner came up with something that um uh that president abas said look like a a Swiss cheese um if you look at the un's definition um it it says Phyllis a vision of two states Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security that bits the same as Biden but on the basis of the pre-1967 lines with Jerusalem as the capital of both States do you think the US support that bit of the statement absolutely not absolutely not because that implies number one that there would be real sovereignty for a Palestinian State no one is talking ever not since the Madrid Conference of 1991 not since Oslo and not today no one in power in Western capitals particularly in my capital is talking about a truly Sovereign Palestinian state with control of all the things that make up sovereignty they're talking about an entity there was an extraordinary moment on this show about two weeks ago I was on uh on discussing another aspect of the of the Gaza crisis and there was someone on it I've been trying to remember his name and unfortunately I don't but he was a he's a a um an activist in the Democratic Party in the US from Jewish Democrats a great supporter of Israel and a supporter of a version of the two-state solution and he said of course the settlements I had raised something about the settlers as a serious problem in the notion of two states and he said of course the settlers would have to be removed and Israel has shown and this was the extraordinary thing he said Israel has shown now in Gaza that it could move a million people in a very short time so clearly it could do that with the settlers and unfortunately it was the last moment of the show and I didn't get the chance to follow up with a question to him are you saying that you're proposing that Israel should be bombing this 750 to 800,000 settlers across the West Bank and killing thousands of them because that's what it took for Israel to force people in Gaza to move from the northern part of the Gaza Strip to the southern part what killing them the problem with this show we get to the end and we we we we can't say everything so I'd like to go to Mustafa on the US Point Mustafa um he's talking about a two-state solution do Palestinians think the US is an honest broker given its strong support for Israel in this war that's now killed about 15,000 people in Gaza no the United States Administration is not uh cannot play that role because it has become a partner in the crime in what's going on in Gaza and that that doesn't make it capable of being a mediator and what we need is something different but in response to what was said about the Swap and all other projects like Yos ban project of Confederation they're all designed to accommodate settlement building to accommodate an illegal action of settlements what Israelis don't realize and don't understand that the what they have done in Gaza now the back the ACT of ethnic cleansing of 1.5 million people from the north and center of Gaza brought this whole question to its roots which is that Israel was created as a settler Colonial project ethnically cleansing 70% of the Palestinian people the message that we get now as all Palestinians in the West Bank in Gaza and even inside Israel itself is that these guys only want one solution which is to ethnically cleanse all of us and we will not allow that and we will struggle for our freedom and we will get our freedom they don't want two states fine but they will not cheat us with a ploy of something that is uh nothing but a Subs servant structure for Israeli occupation Mustafa thank you very much and thanks to all our guests Alan leel phis Bennis and Mustafa bouti Al jazer continues to cover the war in Gaza and the region around the clock for more analysis and context text I'd recommend going to our website al.com and if you have views about all of this we'd like you to express them go to our Facebook page that's facebook.com AJ insidestory or

140,9wWer4c3htI,Is the New York Times losing its credibility on Israel-Palestine? | The Listening Post,"In December 2023, The New York Times published an explosive article - now widely discredited - that detailed Hamas’s agenda to weaponise rape and sexual violence on October 7.

On our radar:

After they won an award at the Berlinale film festival, the reaction to a speech by filmmakers Yuval Abraham and Basel Adra has become the latest example of Germany’s toxic debate on Gaza.  Meenakshi Ravi reports.

Genocide in Gaza through the eyes of Israeli soldiers

For months, Israeli soldiers in Gaza have been documenting their own war crimes against Palestinians and sharing them on social media.

The Listening Post collected and reviewed hundreds of items. We asked three experts on human rights and torture to examine the material.

#News",2024-03-02,305636,12493,2732,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg," we're almost five months into Israel's war on Gaza and among the institutions whose reputations have taken a beating over their coverage the New York Times a German Film Festival worthy of its own award for the worst performance in tacid support of an Israeli genocide and why bother investigating war crimes in Gaza when Israeli soldiers are documenting those crimes incriminating themselves since Israel launched its assault on Gaza in October many Western news outlets have seen their credibility take a hit Accused by audiences and staff members alike of succumbing to Israeli propaganda that includes one of the world's best known Publications the New York Times a notorious case in point an investigation the times published back in December which alleged that Hamas deliberately weaponized rape and sexual violence on October 7th those claims have since been unsubstantiated if not disproven revealing the times's pro-israeli anti-palestinian bias and leaving the papers Newsroom Riven by descent but for the times's critics including some of its former reporters the article is a mere symptom of an age-old problem a persistent double standard in the stories the paper deems fit to print on Israel and Palestine and those it does not the role of the New York Times is not defined by its circulation it's defined by the fact that it sets the agenda that's number one number two most newspapers do not have foreign bureaus and so they will run the times foreign coverage so that's the power of the times it sets the agenda starting with something that is definitely not breaking news the American newspaper of record the New York Times has a track record of supporting Israel what is new are the stakes Israel is on trial for genocide at the international court of justice core to its propaganda effort has been framing hamas's attacks on October 7th as extraordinarily sadistic like something out of the Isis Playbook the wholesale Massacre mutilation rape and Abduction of as many citizens as the terrorists could find enter the times and this story published in late December it accused Palestinian militants of weaponizing rape and sexual violence systematically unleashing it on Israeli women and men a lurid allegation a sensational story but one that the evidence simply fails to support when the New York Times said we've done a TW Monon long investigation we interviewed 150 people and we found a broad pattern of sexual violence on October 7th that for a lot of people just uh closed the case if the New York Times is saying it then it must be true I even had friends who know how much Israel misrepresents things and lies who said Ali now surely you have to give some Credence to what it's saying but it's a case of journalistic fraud because it just doesn't deliver the goods the principal criticism lies within the main claim which is that not only did sexual assault and occasions of rape occur but that they were used systematically since that report has been published major flaws have emerged not just um in the contents itself but also when it comes to the actual journalists and authors behind the report alternative US news outlets subscriber funded ones like movice electronic inada and the grey Zone went to work debunking the times's story they noted the article contained zero direct testimony from victims that the alleged eyewitnesses the paper quoted were either Anonymous or of dubious credibility that the family of a woman killed on October 7th disputed the times's assertion that she had been raped another of the times's sources accused the reporters of pressuring them to speak saying it was important for Israel's PR effort one of the reporters involved andat Schwarz had never filed a news story before October 7th she is a filmmaker whose Wikipedia page said she had worked for Israeli intelligence had the times done its homework its editors would have known that schwarz's social media accounts revealed she had liked some disturbing posts including one advocating turning Gaza into a slaughterous a post South Africa included in its case against Israel at the icj not that the story was shortz's idea as she explained to Israeli Army Radio it was an odd way for such a report to come together still the times published it and showcased it imagine it was the other way around any Palestinian who Whispers something that is considered Politically Incorrect is out in a [Music] second and yet you have this person who worked for the Israeli intelligence who wasn't a journalist and who liked on social media these blood curdling calls for the decimation of Palestinians in Gaza and that's the person you hire to report on your story disparity between standards is staggering the New York Times article had an enormous impact I've seen it cited repeatedly uh even by some human rights organizations but I have to say I think that it had less influence than it might have had if Independent Media Outlets had not exposed the flaws in it the New York Times is used to getting away with this and this time they didn't critics of that Times report included people on the inside the papers podcast the daily planned to produce a version of the story but dropped the project following descent in The Newsroom over concerns about the journalism roughly 6 weeks later when un officials highlighted quote unquote credible allegations that Israelis had raped or sexually assaulted Palestinians they have imprisoned including children that times failed to cover the story then there is the writing the paper has published by Thomas fredman a former Jerusalem bureau chief turned columnist fredman infamously backed the 2003 us-led invasion of Iraq that was based on lies and did so in the most offensive Cavalier way and what they needed to see was American boys and girls going house to house from busra to Baghdad and basically saying well suck on this okay this time around fredman concocted a column comparing the Middle East to an animal kingdom with America cast as an old lion Iranians as wasps and Hamas as some kind of spider when he Likens the Palestinians and various other players in the region to animals it's horrifyingly offensive at a time when the Israelis are saying that the Palestinians in Gaza are human animals and even more offensive than that is treating a situation like this as some kind of fable or Barnyard story rather than actually understanding the reality of the Palestinians that this is an oppressed people this is an occupied people it's classic colonialism classic uh racism and wherever you look in a settler Colonial project the British in Kenya or India uh they spoke in the same language and they used overwhelming Force to subdue a population that they considered less than human and only capable of understanding violence fredman in the Iraq War was the famous one who said we hit Iraq because we could Thomas fredman is one of the spokes people for that Twisted ideology and that's why he does as well as he does the New York Times is not alone in failing its American audience on the Gaza story there was the Wall Street Journal report on Israel's allegation that unra the relief agency so many Palestinian depend on had been infiltrated by Hamas the paper swallowed Israel's unsubstantiated side of that story hookline and sinker there's CNN and the fake news beheaded babies narrative babies and toddlers were found with their heads decapitated neither CNN nor the journal however are considered America's news Outlet of record the way the times is but should it be despite some worthwhile inves tigations since October 7th like this one showing the destruction caused by 2,000lb Israeli bombs that does not begin to address an imbalance that goes back decades the unmistakable pro-israel bias coming out of the times's Jerusalem Bureau where Chris Hedges worked in the early 2000s you have had more than one case where the reporter assigned to Jerusalem Ethan Broner for example his children are serving in the IDF I mean imagine that if a Palestinian reporter covering Gaza his kids were in an armed wing of any Palestinian faction so I sick of the one-sided coverage used vacation time to go to Han Unis and write a magazine piece for Harpers called a Gaza diary that was published and I was informed that I would never report again from the Middle East for the New York Times times I'm an Arabic speaker by the way they don't have a lot so you pay a heavy price if you attempt to report we requested interviews with numerous reporters at the times and a spokesperson there all of them declined instead the paper sent this statement we remain confident in the accuracy of our reporting and stand by the team's investigation which was rigorously sourced and edited we could have asked about the papers famous motto the one created in 1897 that still adorns its Mast head today and perhaps suggested an edit something like all the News That's fit to print and some that clearly isn't Germany is under a long shadow of censorship when it comes to Gaza a situation that is so Grim it can be comedic at times the latest example came at a film festival in Berlin where an Israeli and a Palestinian teamed up to win an award Mino shiravi is here with more the Berlin Alla is one of the so-called Big Five film festivals worldwide and is a major cultural institution in Germany it was already facing criticism for its silence on the genocide in Gaza several filmmakers pulled out in protest and Festival workers demanded the organizers call for a ceasefire it all came to a head when no other land a film about the ethnic cleansing and settling of Palestinian villages in the West Bank won the award for best documentary the film was co-directed by Palestinian activist basil Adra and Israeli filmmaker yal Abraham I am Israeli basis Palestinian and in two days we will go back to a land where we are not equal I am living under a civilian law and Basel is under military law this situation of apartheid between us this inequality it has to end the festival quickly distanced itself from Abraham's remarks which were hardly controversial the German press and politicians criticized Abraham a Jewish Israeli calling his statement anti-semitic Berlin's mayor said the words were intolerable the country's culture Minister who was criticized for applauding the filmmakers then clarified she was clapping only for Abraham all in all a ridiculous example of the toxic climate in Germany for any discussion about the war in Gaza a berlin-based coalition of arts and culture workers called it an everpresent atmosphere of fear self-censorship and suspicion on social media and in the workplace in institutions and on the street Israeli media went all in on the story as well threats against the makers of no other land have intensified and yal Abraham who says his family in Israel has been targeted by right-wing mobs says he's now too afraid to go back home thanks MAA after hamas's attacks on October 7th Israeli leaders spoke openly about the violation of Gaza they said there were no Innocents there called Palestinians animals with no right to exist they were inciting a genocide a message that was clearly heard on the battlefield because in one video after another Israeli soldiers have recorded their own war crimes celebrating as they looted homes destroyed houses or set them on fire filming as they mocked humiliated and assaulted Palestinian captives it is a sign of the punity they think they have that so much of that material has been brazenly posted on social media now in a way Palestinians have seen this kind of thing before going back to 1948 but never have the images the videos been this widespread explicit and barbaric the listening post has collected some of that material and asked three experts on human rights and torture to assess it first a viewer warning many of the images in this report are difficult to take [Music] in there has been a remarkable number of videos posted by Israeli soldiers on social media depicting themselves pillaging property mocking the death and destruction that they are causing and uh most egregiously uh torturing humiliating and mocking detained Palestinian [Music] [Laughter] Prisoners the images of M arrests of torture of Palestinians of numbering their bodies which is reminiscent of images all of us have seen from Guantanamo and Abu these images are Testament to what Palestinians have long been saying which is that this this settler Colonial regime is utterly violent they show the nature through which this genocide is unfolding in the Gaza Strip they also show the extreme brutality and torture violence utter disregard of human life transforming these violent conducts into a spectacle to beew viewed and watched on social media posts they lack specific intelligence about who actually might be Hamas and because they lack intelligence they therefore are rounding up everyone in order to hope to extract information through interrogation the fact that they've been stripped to their underwear is you know a manifestation of cruel inhumane and degrading treatment which is also illegal in addition to torture the fact that they're photographing these things it's like trophy shots what this depicts I think very vividly is dehumanization and torture you know the idea that somebody can be just like their body is just being attacked you know in their most vulnerable position his hands are bound behind his back he's lying face down soldiers stepping on his face in a sense it epitomizes torture in general purposefully harming someone who's in custody that custodial relationship is a particularly vulnerable one where you know the custodians have all the power and the Prisoner who is in this case not only on the ground and tied up but completely powerless the images are showing us and telling us how Central imprisonment or carceral practices are to this settler Colonial regime the torture humilation uh and degrading conduct against Palestinians is not simply restricted to the Gaza Strip there are also images and videos that have been circulating from the West Bank since October 7th over 7,000 Palestinians have been detained which is a number unheard of over the past [Music] decade Israeli soldiers have quite remarkably taken to converting their massive really unprecedented destruction of Palestinian homes hospitals mosques universities churches schools into entertainment [Music] videos there's one uh video where Israeli soldiers are showing some residential homes that they've set on fire and attached a [Music] song Fire there have been uh many many images of uh uh Israeli soldiers who've ransacked Palestinian homes and confiscated their personal Goods uh one in particular is the red neglige that uh appears to be seen in so many Israeli videos where Israeli soldiers are mocking and advertising their very deliberate intrusion of the home of a Palestinian woman the confiscation of her most intimate apparel uh and flaunting that in a way that's definitely intended to be provocative and humiliating the video further reinforce a discourse that is coming out of every sector of the Israeli official Machinery where all Palestinians are the enemy many officials have said they deserve to be eliminated and you see it manifested in that kind of Jah deiv you know that soldiers are expressing as they destroy uh Palestinian homes and there is a consumption of this kind of image that kind of fortifies the anger the hatred the anti-palestinian sentiment and the kind of complete disregard of the humanity of Palestinian civilians there is such a high level of confidence among these IDF soldiers that they can do whatever they want to say to the whole world look at what we're doing to Palestinians in Gaza look at how we are brutalizing detainees look at how we're humiliating every single man woman and child and we destroy their homes set fire to them uh and make fun of it uh and they are provoking and challenging the whole world uh to say we can do this we can get away with it and no one in the world can stop us no isra has found themselves sanctioned uh by the International Community by countries that have these tools which again has only reinforced the belief of Israeli soldiers that they are immune that they are Exempted from uh uh complying with International laws from basic human rights laws uh that they are above the [Music] law since the beginning of this genocidal War reservists have been called up and who are the reservists they are the entire proportion of the Israeli Society there are teachers professors students doctors Medics artists writers journalists these images they are not only directed to a small audience they are directed to a broad audience there's a a long practiced history of racializing and dehumanizing Palestinians these images and these videos entirely show how Israeli violence is also not only directed towards Palestinian livelihood but also their material being so their houses their their belongings eliminating Palestinian existence history has taught us that the dehumanization of subjects is essential to the infliction of violence I think Israel has perfected this in discourse and in practice ice but this is not new it dates back to the beginning of this state through which Palestinians were expelled degraded humiliated killed and effectively forcibly disappeared and finally this past week more than 50 International broadcast journalists signed a letter calling for free and unfettered access to Gaza the letter was addressed to the states responsible for cutting off the strip from the outside world Israel and Egypt since October 7th only a few foreign reporters have made it into Gaza mostly those embedded with the Israeli military and they were not allowed to speak with Palestinians which left us to rely on the courageous work of local journalists an unprecedented number of whom have paid with their lives it is long past time that Israel and Egypt let journalists in the awful scenes this past week in Gaza City the Israeli military's Massacre of more than a 100 Palestinians who were lining up for food simply underlines how important that journalistic access can be we'll see you next time here at the listening post"

judicial reforms but that's only part of it remember the bigger stories that I'm going to be talking to you about in a short while still continued terrorism what's happening with the settlements what's happening with the Palestinians what's happening with the Oslo Accords and the Abraham Accords and is there going to be peace in Israel that that seems to be there but let's face it this is not new this is the holy land but it's also historically been a place of conflict and that's that's because of the Sacred nature of this in fact let me just show this to you if you look down at the Western Wall which is right down here this is the holiest spot for Jews and this is actually this is where the Solomon's first temple was what 3 300 years ago and then after that after that was destroyed then it was it was rebuilt the second temple came in just a little bit around that period the retaining wall was built and that is the Western Wall and as I said this is the the holiest part for Jews to pray as as you can see them doing right now but just behind that you've got the the the the dope of The Rock and Alex can Muslims believe that this is where Prophet Muhammad ascended to the heavens from and as a result um this is one of the most sacred spots in in Islam I think after Mecca and Medina this would be the most sacred site for Islam and if you if you go a little bit this side if you think uh that that fighting between the Jews and the Muslims isn't enough uh remember the Crusades remember the Christians coming to fight for the holy land and that's because all of this was also very sacred uh for them so the the Crusaders came the Templars came and somewhere out here of course is this Christian quarter and that's where the Church of the of the Holy sepulcha is this is where Jesus Christ was crucified this is where Christians believe the body of Jesus Christ is is buried there at that at the church of Holy sepulcha so this is a very very historic place and because of the history and because of the fighting it is really a place you should get to know a little bit about and can I just can you just bear with me for a few minutes because the most recent fighting is not all of this this has been happening for thousands of years the most recent fighting obviously the last 70 years has been Israel and the right to the state of Israel to exist and Israel being set up out here and what happened with the Arabs and the Arab State fighting with Israel and what should be done with the Palestinian people that's been the real subject of argument and fighting for the last 75 years or so so let me go a little bit into giving you the quick history of that I'm going to be walking with the deputy mayor of Jerusalem through the streets of this entire holy city and I'm going to be discussing some of those issues with her including where the peace can be can be brought in which way could peace possibly be realized but before I do any of that let's just give you a potted history of what's been happening here for the last 75 years or so recent history begins somewhere around the first world war after the war ended the British established a colony in Palestine under the League of Nations mandate the British were allowed to rule the area until Palestine was ready for self-governance Back in the 19th century this Region's population was around 87 percent Muslim 10 Christian and three percent Jewish but in the Years following the war the Jewish population and Palestine began increasing courtesy what was happening in Europe the expelling of Jews and the prosecution in Palestine the influx meant increasing tension between the Israeli and the Arab population during the second world war more Jews began making their way to Palestine in 1947 the United Nations held a vote it divided Palestine and established separate Palestinian and Jewish States while the Jewish leaders accepted the plan the Arabs did not either way the British left in 1948 the Jews declared independence and Israel was created thus began a never-ending Spate of violence in 1948 five Arab States invaded Israel Iraq Syria Lebanon Jordan Egypt Israel won the war over 700 000 Palestinians fled to Arab countries in 1956 tensions escalated once again Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal Israel attacked the Sinai Peninsula and retook the canal the British and the French government supported Israel but peace was nowhere in sight in 1967 the Six-Day War broke out Israel fought Syria Jordan and Egypt over 90 percent of the Egyptian Air Force was destroyed Israel captured the Gaza Strip from Egypt Golan Heights from Syria and the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan the last one was especially significant because the control of East Jerusalem meant Jews could now pray at the Western Wall in 1973 Syria and and Egypt launched airstrikes in Israel the assault began on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar lending to its name the Yom Kippur War who won Israel all this while Israel was encouraging Jewish settlements in areas that weren't given to it under the U.N resolution in 1987 there was an uprising of Palestinians they were angry about the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank these protests triggered the first intifada it came to an end in 1993 with the Oslo Peace Accords who were the signatories the government of Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization which was formed in 1964 to fight for the liberation of Palestine the PLO was operating from Lebanon in 1982 the Israeli Defense Force invaded Southern Lebanon to evict the PLO cut to the Oslo Accords it established limited Palestinian self-rule in parts of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in 2006 the second Lebanon war broke out Israel was fighting a Lebanese Shia group called Hezbollah also in 2006 a Sunni islamist group Hamas won elections in Palestine in the years that followed the group fought multiple battles with Israel in 2020 the Trump Administration announced its most ambitious foreign policy project the Abraham Accords a plan for normalization of relations between Israel and the Arab states in September 2020 the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain agreed to normalize ties with Israel they were the third and fourth countries in the region to do so following Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994 but the truth is the multiple Peace Accords have not really been able to solve the conflict tensions are still very much on the rise between Israelis and Palestinians there's talk of a third intifada on the horizon and what happens next is anybody's guess thank you foreign [Music]

Every conversation is an EXTREME learning experience for the viewer.",2023-11-21,700470,20566,4189,UCPxMZIFE856tbTfdkdjzTSQ," you know a lot of people listening to this are going to assume that you're pro Israel yes you are pro Israel I am explain to me why I shouldn't be Pro Palestine Israel gives a 10-minute warning and then they B there's a lot of pro Palestine people watching this asking you how you know that you tell me Randy how many of these friends of yours sharing all these Instagram stories will not at least attempt to free the other person if held hostage do I shoot risking your cousin's life to save myself or do I just put my hands up and say kill me I am Jesus Christ crucify me I die for the whole world do you think that there's propaganda that's spread in favor of Israel as well of course there's a propaganda spread in favor of Israel all the time my heart goes towards Palestine civilians children women do not deserve to die at all I have an Israeli friend who actually got murdered shot so badly by the Hamas militants that they couldn't recognize his body you should be Pro Palestine I Am pro Israel but I am Pro Palestine but being pro Palestine is not being pro Hamas is not being pro Terror no matter matter what you say now there's a whole section of the audience that's just categorized you as pro-israel and anti-muslim yeah which is a lot of the pro Palestine argument on social media that 50% of the debts are children why should kids be a part of a political conflict I'm trying to approach this from as neutral a perspective as I possibly can go this is not a pro-israel statement this is a statement from the perspective of trying to learn more you're going to get abused very badly for this podcast yeah that's fine I'm complet completely aware of how sensitive an issue this whole Israel Palestine situation is my intention with every single episode that we create on TRS is to bring you a very neutral very objective perspective but I do believe in listening to subject experts my request is that you please listen to this episode till the end more importantly you listen to the squel episode which is much more about the history of Israel and Palestine I feel only at the end of of these two episodes can you truly form an opinion about the situation so be patient with this episode do share this episode as much as possible the news or even social media is never going to show you the entire truth that's just how old media works but it's the age of New Media it's the age of podcasts and TRS is here with one of India's foremost geopolitical experts he holds a master's degree in political science and international relations he's one of the most qualified people to talk about International conflict he's been on the show earlier he's a legend of the Indian podcasting space his name is abijit a Mitra and he's one of my absolute favorite people to speak to on the show so enjoy this episode and I hope that I was able to do justice to this as a podcaster I'd love to hear your feedback at the end but for now sit back and let's learn [Music] together [Music] this is the India perspective on the Israel Palestine War we have abijit a Mitra with us welcome back to TRS thanks man it's always fun being on your podcast likewise you're one of the guests I look forward to the most uh because of all the data that's retained but also the flow of the conversation I always enjoy talking to you you have no idea how much um and I mean with anyone who we repeat on the show it's usually because it's great conversations and I think actually a lot of teenagers college students hell even adults people are parents's age are actually consuming podcasts now for the sake of conversation and learning the truth um let me begin this Israel Palestine situation with a pertinent question are we seeing the truth on the news you're not seeing the truth on the news but you are seeing the truth on social media and I'll tell you why I think after Elon Musk removed all these um you know content filters and uh uh God knows how many 20 million people they employed to do content moderation we are now seeing unfiltered news from the ground come through uh so it's almost like doing primary source intelligence you know primary source research which is much better than news which is always tainted with an editorial angle ke you know we have to show you this we can't show you this we don't want to show you this or we're going to spin it this way so I have not ever since Twitter got freed I'm really not even watching the news if I I like go to a News website to see what the latest thing happening is and then I just go to Twitter to follow primary sources and see what's happening on the ground ground out there uh the big reason that I believe podcasts are taking off on a worldwide scale is because of the concept of Steel Manning yeah steel Manning basically means taking a topic putting forth your perspective also putting forth the positives of the perspective that's supposedly against your own so there is no black and white it's all a spectrum of gray and you try Landing up on the right shade of gray through conversation now this is not possible on the news this is why podcasting has taken off this is why Joe Rogan and Lex Freedman and all these guys have careers that they steal man arguments which is what I want to begin Israel Palestine and this whole situation with my heart goes towards Palestine in terms of H civilians children women do not deserve to die at all uh this is you know men at War political leaders at War right uh now parall I have an Israeli friend who actually got murdered in the this music concert okay and I knew him for a very very long time he was shot so badly by the Hamas militants that they couldn't recognize his body yeah um family is going through hell right now um so when you when you hear all these situations again you don't land up on either side you just face the brutality of war and you try steel Manning arguments yeah uh so the whole purpose of this convers is to give you a very structured Steelman approach I'd love to hear what you think of everything that I said right now and your own opinion of course so let's start with first the Hindu affection for Israel yeah right uh some of it is but remember the um am I allowed to use a swear word go for it uh if you're one of those who are like yeah man I support Israel because they're killing Muslims that is a small percentage of Hindus um I can tell you I'm right-wing and on my timeline I've only seen one or two Schmucks who have said that and I've unfollowed them because that's not the kind of friend that I want to have yeah 99.99% of the people and by the way those are the two people that places like BBC or Al jazer will take as a representative of all Indian Hindus okay um 99.99% of the people on my timeline which is quite right-wing do not think that they have a great deal of Sympathy for the average Palestinian and their anger is that Hamas is using women and children as human Shields okay which they are because remember if you look at the pr War out here the military war you can't overcome Israel Israel is an absolute superpower in the region everybody in that region has tried to take down Israel and they've all failed very miserably and paid a very heavy price for it the are doing and you know how those reels and Instagram reels and things tget your heart their strategy is to see to it Israel kills as many women and children as possible so as to Target your heart so that your heart takes over from your brain for Israel it is bad PR to kill so Israel actually first of all they don't have a bloodlust to kill second it is bad PR for them because every Palestinian woman or child killed hurts their cause whereas every Palestinian woman or child killed increases hamas's support base it helps hamas's uh PR argument see they can't counter Israel militarily so they counter Israel PR wise that's how things play out and you know it's natural human instinct you tell me who will not support the underdog okay except the problem is we think of this as the underdog they are technically the pr overdog Hamas is and Israel is the pr Underdog number one uh number two let's get back to Hindus um what Hindus see is that you know where what vs Nall called a deeply wounded civilization uh you know we've been colonized for the last Thousand Years uh it's been Massacre after Massacre after Massacre after Massacre uh there is not a single old uh Temple standing in North India all the old temples are in the South there's nothing left standing in North India uh that's more than a few hundred years old unless they were lost like kajra was lost in the forests and things like that uh they are not uh you've in our own lifetimes we've seen the ethnic cleansing of kashmiri pundits in Kashmir uh we've seen uh uh what is essentially a sort of denial of rights to Mighty tribals in Manipur happen right now in the same year that all of this has happened uh there is anger and there is this feeling that Israel is kindered but it it stands up for itself the average Hindu is like the Jew before the Holocaust you know the Jew before the Holocaust was the good Jew that everybody liked he didn't take a pistol and go shoot he didn't stand up for himself when he was sent to the gas chamber he went like a cow to the slaughter you know you know how cows are killed no they put a pressure gun To The Head and the um Steel Jack goes right through the brain it essentially causes the brain to explode and the cow dies immediately and uh that is their idea of a good Jew and what they do to the good Jew is kill the good Jew okay uh but after the Holocaust they realized they couldn't continue like this you know the biggest supporters who uh I won't say supporters but the big the the loudest voice saying Hitler wasn't going to kill Jews they're in fact German Jews they said you know this guy's he's not really going to say what he does but he did we all know he did so there was a civilization a community change that happened in their mindset what the rest of the world seems to want is for the Jew to go back to being that good Jew who just dies when you tell him to die and they're not going to do that and Hindus there is a lot of frustration in feeling that you know where the good Hindus where the Democratic lovely Multicultural state that the New York Times and Washington Post used to love as as long as we were ready to get butchered and the moment we stand up for ourselves we're fascist Nazis who uh should essentially be looked at as the Third Reich can be bombed in and divided up like East and West Germany where under two or four different zones of influence um that doesn't work second it is much deeper cultural ties remember because you know Israel is a Jewish State it's the only Jewish State and a religion born from there called Christianity Jesus Christ wasn't a Christian he was a a Jew uh but Christianity became the dominant religion in the west but the point of origin remained Jewish similarly India the point of origin remained Hindu but we spawned Hinduism spawned a religion called Buddhism which took over the East but the point of origin remained uh Hindu so there is that similarity the third similarity is you see that the diaspora of both you know there's this concept of the Hindu in America after Protestant Cath Catholic marriages Hindu Jewish marriages are the highest why because we are both Urban peaceful communities that don't go around rioting and burning things on the street uh very educated focus on you know uh uh uh family uh being peaceful doing things through the law etc etc there is a reason that Hindus and Jews have the highest per capita incomes of any diaspora anywhere in the world uh the fourth reason behind all of this is the fact that you know we've never had anti-Semitism in this country we don't know what it is to hate a Jew so you know many Jews who come to India get upset that you know sometimes oh like a lot of my Jewish my Israeli friends would come here and oh you're Israeli and like what the hell dude he's not being anti-semitic we don't know what it is to be anti-semitic in India so we don't even understand what the gravity of Hitler is to the Jewish mind I'll tell you why in the Christian world the Jew is the person who killed Jesus they are God killers they literally the assura who killed the dasas or whatever right and mind you this was a rhetorical device anything in if you look at Pontius Pilot's record in Judea in the Roman province of Judea uh it'll show you that he was an absolutely nasty character uh who would have had absolutely no compunctions ordering this Rebel who was becoming a Law and Order problem to be crucified uh but when the Christian Cannon was written the whole point of early Christianity was to co-opt the Roman state so they wanted to absolve Rome the Roman Empire of guilt and pass that guilt off onto other Jewish because Christianity is a Jewish faction remember that they wanted to pass it off onto all the Rival factions and blame them for it so you know Rome didn't do it Pontius pilot washes his hands and it is the uh um what's it called the uh was it called the knesset in those days the rabet the rabet that decided to I think it's called something hagah I forget the equivalent of the uh what's the Christian one called the the the the Roman curia I guess uh the papal curia kind of like that the the the Supreme uh uh Council of uh um priests religious governance right and uh the religious governance body uh that sentenced him take so they have always carried this burden of being the ones who killed our God and they have been targeted for it the second problem is both Islam and Christianity did not allow Finance did not allow Usery which is to say interest taking right so the only people allowed to take interest were the Jews now every every time you wanted to um I've taken 12 years worth of debts from you I now realize I can't pay it back what do I do uh I can't pay it back I'm not going to allow you to destroy my life by taking over my property so I say ranir aladia or in this case let's give you a Jewish name let's call you uh Yakov finlin Yakov finlin uh kidnapped uh uh my maid's baby and drank his blood in his Satanic god-killing rituals demonic rituals and so remember in pre-industrial societies riots happen like that you spark off a u rumor it leads to a riot they would all come and they would butcher your family and my debt is clean so this whole concept of blood liable that you shed the blood of Christ and therefore you should be killed for you are you're not demons but you're not much closer either was developed as a means of first making them do all the finance and then you couldn't pay back your debts to kill them off right it was a very sick sadistic way of running things now remember in the Muslim World also you are not allowed to do finance and so a lot of the financial duties again fell on the Jews and the same Dynamics would overtake it the difference was it it is not fair to say that the Muslim world wasn't anti-semitic the Muslim world was deeply anti- Semitic because the same dynamics of Finance you don't want to do finance and you want to kill off your uh your creditor um but the Jews didn't kill the Muslim God therefore it was slightly of a of a slightly less caliber than what you saw in Christian Europe right and this is how this whole Jew hate plays out so you see chronic anti-Semitism but for Hindus I mean when is interest taking been wrong you know we we don't look at these things so Jews could do when they came here they could do whatever they wanted you want to be a fisherman do it you want to do banking or Finance do it you want to become a chief minister there were Jewish Chief ministers to uh and prime ministers to several of the Kings along the west coast and things do it who's stopping you uh so you know there was no restrictions on them and there's no killing of the God there is so so you know the sociological reasons for Jew hatred never existed in India and for that reason we don't even understand what Hitler did because I can tell you being an I was a cbsc student so Central Board of secondary education and you know how much was taught to us about the Holocaust exactly one line uh the Holocaust happened and uh the and Germany killed off about 5 million Jews it was literally one sentence one line and you know this is cbsc which is a much more globally integrated curriculum the states and things like that have no idea out there and you know the tamad board under the admk actually had some lines praising Hitler um it was embarrassing but the point is you don't know what Hitler did so somebody looking at Hitler on balance where there's just one line about the Holocaust but then there's all this thing about how he built up Germany's honor and this and that and whatever nonsense like for those of us who have read about the Holocaust you know okay so these are all small things and mass murder especially that kind of sadistic mass murder is that big but for an average Indian who hasn't even traveled abroad low per capita income how how do you tell that difference so you know it's but that is not what Al jazer sees they do something very mischievous the same way blood liel is put on to Jews in the Christian world and now the Muslims have also adopted blood liel they've started making up stories of how Jews kidnap uh Muslim Marty child and uh drink its blood for their rituals and things like that Al jaaz does that to Hindus they take the two Hindus saying yeah man go bomb Muslims like every religion has its  man I can show you Jewish  there were uh uh that who I saw on Twitter who were pissing on the bodies of uh uh Hamas killed but that doesn't Define Israel or a Jew that is a shitty Jew uh who exist there are shitty Indians who exist just because somebody we have rapes and murders in India doesn't mean all Indians are rapists and murderers now so we have pedophiles in India that doesn't make all Indians pedophiles but that is what Al jazer wants to stereotype and do it Al jaaz is actually an absolute mirror of the Jew who was pissing on the Hamas bodies and the guys on Twitter who are saying go uh uh kill Gins because they're Muslims so this is one part which is the Hindu part what do you make of like the current situation in terms of I mean a very raw way of asking you this is which side are you on right and sorry it was the Muslim side as well we we we want to discuss Hindus and then Indian Muslims and then which side am I on yeah te um so now let's talk about Indian Muslims right uh there is an increasing feeling amongst Indian Muslims or at least the Muslims who are visible and heard that they are uh p persecuted in India okay that there is an imminent genocide going to happen and what happened in Germany is going to happen to what happened to Jews in Germany is going to happen to them they've been fed a whole load of cods wallup uh about the origin of Israel which we're going to talk about later and how there's a colonial project and you know it's now remember the average Indian how many protests run have you seen on the street since this thing broke out nothing no so there is a huge Discord between what we're told is the Indian Muslim opinion which you see with englishspeaking and politically important Muslims on Instagram and Twitter which you're not seeing translated on the ground out here uh there isn't you know uh riots happening and things like you remember during the Danish cartoons people were burning yilan Poston and uh uh all of that we're not seeing that here this time why is that so you know I think the average Muslim basically doesn't care what's happening out there because their lives are you know they're working they're working people they don't have time to come out and do uh you know protests and all that crap so it's it's I do accept that for the in for the high disposable income uh significant spare time Indian Muslim who has time to post on Instagram this is an issue because they are connected with the world and they see uh sort of religious justification key there is an umah you know the Muslim the global Muslim uh feeling of fraternity and Brotherhood that should exist which means they should speak about this to uh uh they should speak about uh fellow Muslims being slaughtered by Israel and again we come to the point in India we have the lowest possible knowledge of what is happening in Palestine and Israel because we keep getting so much propaganda out here who's actually going to sit down and do a historical deep dive right uh nobody wants to do historical Deep dive they all want these sort of 15 seconds what's your hot take on this bro and then that's it so this is part two the um Indian Muslim do you think that there's propaganda that's spread in favor of Israel as well of course there's a propaganda spread in favor of Israel all the time right and uh uh you know I I tell me one country that doesn't do propaganda I mean Israel would be stupid when it's being attacked to not be doing a propag not have a propaganda in PR Division and being uh you know uh doing what it needs to to uh get a better name for itself but all people do propaganda you know a lot of people listening to this are going to assume from here on in this conversation that you're pro Israel yes you are pro is I am because on balance you know I can't sit around and AC accept that you will not condemn terrorists going around torturing raping and killing women and children and non-combatant Men okay I I just want to pause you there for a second if someone knows you in person or has consumed enough of your content uh you are someone who steal man's arguments like you break down things you see it from 360° perspective I personally don't know anyone who studies as much as you maybe abijit CH you know you're on that kind of Realm of just the Quantum of information you absorb um now currently as it stands based on what I've seen on my friends's social media I have a dear friend Alia alasi I have so many other friends who keep sharing Pro Palestinian stuff uh when I see it one my heart breaks because the pr hits me in the heart yeah that Palestinian kids Arab kids are dying Arab women are dying Etc and then there's a part of me as a podcaster which has spoken to enough subject experts to know that that hey the news that you see on social media also sometimes can be mored to make you feel a certain way or entire narratives are not given absolutely uh so what I'm going to request you to do is explain to me why I shouldn't be Pro Palestine because currently you should be Pro Palestine I I'm Pro I'm pro Israel but I am Pro Palestine I want to see a two- State solution with a Palestine that lives in peace with itself and peace with the outside world okay but being pro Palestine is not being pro Hamas being pro Palestine is not being pro Terror being a pro two State solution is not being pro raping and killing women and children I think we need to make that distinction we can always condemn The Killing and this is where the Shades of Gray come in again uh Hamas is using Palestinian women and children as shields in Israel you will never see a military facility collocated with a civilian facility military facilities will be kept far away from civilian facilities so that even when uh if some catastrophic War happens and a military facility gets bombed the people get saved in Gaza the military facilities are deliberately kept under civilian facilities under schools under hospitals under uh uh colleges uh in civilian buildings civilian residential highrises where is the Steelman here where is the shade of gray here see if if uh you know um I come and stab you where is the shade of gray in I empathize with ranvir for getting stabbed but I empathize with abijit for being abijit is also Victim Because he was a victim of circumstances who stabbed ranir it doesn't work that way right I think we need to separate uh terrorism Hamas and this Cult of brutality and essentially what is a death cult from the average Palestinian now I've actually spent 10 days in Gaza and when uh this was in what 20145 some sometime around that time um the West Bank is different because West Bank you know I go in for a Day come out I set up meetings go and meet people come out it's very easy to go in and out of the West Bank uh Gaza it isn't because of Hamas um now what ends up happening out there is it's such a dysfunctional Society people live in fear it's a small strip people don't realize this it's 1/4 the size of Delhi you know it's uh it say the length of Bombay the peninsula of Bombay if you draw the length of the peninsula of Bombay and about 7 km wide it's about that much so you know basically the worldly SE link when you're going over the waterly ceiling if you see the width of the bay that it covers think of that wide but about uh 50 60 km long okay that's it it's the size of the Bombay Peninsula Bombay is much bigger than Gaza small place uh 2.5 million people so it's not as densely populated as Indian cities are but for the West it is there are so many factions out there there has only been one government a Hamas government which has never held elections the average Palestinian doesn't even get to decide uh if they are satisfied or not satisfied with the government you tell me 17 18 years under a blockade not being able to travel in and out or whatever and that's incidentally fake they do actually get to travel a lot I we'll talk about that when we uh talk about their jobs and how this attack was carried out um for there to be absolutely no dissent against your government give me a break that is not normal this does not happen in normal count where there is zero dissent and everybody's like super happy with your leadership and they think they're great Heroes fighting the resistance battle no I have seen fear in the eyes of Palestinian women uh for their children uh I have also seen that fear come out in deep conversations over hours but it doesn't come out immediately uh it is very subcutaneous because if those fears are expressed in P publicly it leads to nasty consequences for you and your family uh Hamas is not nice to its own people uh and this is you know where because you or me watching what Israel is doing nobody likes unless you're very sick in the mind you don't like watching buildings being blown hospitals being blown empty hospitals mostly by the way uh because Israel gives a 10-minute warning they do a tap which is your signal get out you have 10 minutes to get out and then they bomb the place you there's a lot of pro Palestine people watching this asking you how you know that I know that because I've seen it I've seen the uh remote video footage of what that tap looks like I've spoken to Gins who all know what that tap sounds like uh or what it's meant to be they are all sent sms's because I've seen uh those smss I wasn't there when any bombing took place so I haven't seen it firsthand but I've seen those sms's on their phones and you know and the very surprising part of that conversation is they'll deny Ever Getting Any smss they'll deny ever getting a warning and they'll say you know oh they just uh bombed us and my cousin died became Shahid and then you know over two three days when you have warmed them up they can slowly open up to you you get to see their phones I don't read Arabic very well I have very rudimentary knowledge of Arabic uh but it is a warning that has been smsed to them uh from the Israeli military saying your house has been targeted get out you have so many minutes to get out I forget now is it 7 minutes or 10 minutes I think it's s maybe not 10 uh to get out and that was based on a calculation that this was explained to me that seven is enough for the people to evacuate but not for the equipment and the ammunition stored there to be evacuated and it's enough for the person to run far away enough so that the secondary detonation of the ammunition in there uh doesn't harm them um so it's it's a very well practiced routine right um so here's the thing is is there Collective punishment happening yes but they want you to look at this as collective punishment in isolation the problem is there is hostage taking it's not just Israelis who are held hostage it is the vast majority of the gazan population that is being held as a human shield hostage by Hamas supporting Hamas is islamophobia Hamas are not Muslims they are uh they are what you'd call uh uh uh I shaan IB which are the names for the demon than the devil they are the sons and daughters of devils they are not Muslims let's be clear about that if you think they are Muslims that they are fighting for a Muslim cause you are sick uh no muslim will hold a fellow Muslim woman and child as a hostage and if you think it is legit then there's something very wrong with you they hold them hostage they hold the Palestinian population hostage deliberately now assume you are the one holding somebody hostage uh say uh your cousin you're holding him hostage because I want to kill you but I don't I have no fight with your cousin right what do I do I know holding your cousin you have a gun which you're pointing at your cousin right now threatening to shoot if I come but if I lower my guard you're going to shoot me through the head do do I shoot risking your cousin's life to save myself or do I just put my hands up and say kill me I am Jesus Christ crucify me I die for the whole world you know Jesus wasn't he was kind of rejected by most Jews for a reason and this turn the other cheek uh you know it's it's fantastic in books but it never works out in practice see he said turn the other cheek when somebody slaps you he didn't say show them the other side of your rib cage if somebody uh uh uh pierces you with a spear and as far as I remember when he was pierced with a spar with with a spear on the cross he didn't turn around and show the other side of his ribs did he you know there all these sort of rhetorically lovely philosophical that you hear you know like Gandhi uh uh an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind but look I mean I pluck out one eye of yours you pluck out one eye of mine then I pluck out the second eye of yours you're already blind and you know in the land of the blind the one eyed man is king So I've won an eye for an eye does not make the whole world blind and if I'm attacking you now I pluck out both your eyes first you've got nothing left to do uh you might try but you won't be able to succeed till you learn you know uh ninja style um blind man blindfolded ranging and uh the things that you see in superhero movies it doesn't happen so all these um sayings they're fantastic they don't work in real life I would just ask your friends who are pro Palestine to examine their own self-beliefs what are you are you Pro the Palestinian people are you Pro Hamas are you uh uh because Hamas I can guarantee you is not pro Palestinian and why do I say that I think it's very important We examined why Hamas is not pro Palestinian and why did we get to this stage what is the history out here see the Palestinian Authority which is formerly the PLO and the fat faction after like 40 50 years of running a Guerilla campaign and terrorism and whatnot they finally agree to sit down with Israel and talk Hamas refuses to even talk they don't want a two-state solution they want the whole of Palestine what is today Israel and their chant is from The River To The Sea Palestine will be free which is basically a call for genocide okay because the river is the Jordan River and the sea is the Mediterranean so all the Jews are to be pushed out into the sea you'll you'll keep hearing this tell me how do you sit down and talk to somebody who refuses to talk to you okay then Israel did make uh you know when there were kutas out there there was very significant agricultural employment you can go check out the peel report which came out in the 1930s I think which shows that it was actually Jew Jewish migration which significantly improved the employment and the uh uh uh arability of land and everything out there but it led to Greater social tension you know why because them coming and enabling people and making them richer through employment threatened the feudal par structures out there which is incidentally you see that in India as well one of the very smart things Modi is doing is giving Muslims education to toilets and electricity and things which are making them less dependent on the feudal leaders who have who they've depended for and those feudal leaders just like Hamas condom their own population they send them out for riots to die when to sort out those rights you have to make a deal with the leader and give him property or give him uh two three uh loksabha seats or rajas saaba seats or whatever power like you said and this is the problem of a feudal pass structure which has not modernized and what you see I think Indians an international audience won't be able to relate to this because you know an international audience is Fred with Indian propaganda because you ask me about Israeli propaganda Indian propaganda that with this shining new it power you know which is Leap frogged people don't want to look at the nasty rural India pre-industrial India which hasn't changed since the 7eventh or 8th centuries it's 7th Century or 13th century India still exists if you go far enough outside of Bombay outside of Delhi and places like that so I would really urge the people who are pro Palestine be Pro Palestine sure but that shouldn't prevent you from being able to condemn what Hamas does that shouldn't be able to and sure uh condemn Israel when it kills women and children deliberately do not take it out of context when somebody is holding their own people hostage if the Israelis shoot what you tell me ranir tell me how many of these friends of yours sharing all these Instagram stories will not at least attempt to free the other person if held hostage which you know they're going to die you know it's very easily said but when it push comes to shove I'm sure the reactions are going to be very different I can tell you honestly if if I was in that situation I would do what the Israelis do and shoot okay I'm not going to I'm like sure I'll be very upset that I killed somebody Innocent but ultimately my life is more important I'm sorry uh would they make a different decision I don't know but then also let's look at proportionality somebody has come into your country uh killed 1,400 people many of them torture raped uh and the Israelis generally don't talk about all of this crap because it happened right here where we are in Bombay you remember when that a similar attack happened on 2611 2008 uh they attacked the kabad house which is the Jewish house and unspeakable things were done to that lady out there it never came out in the news but I think we we've all known about it because we've all seen the autopsy report in private it was I think we've all seen it we we know what was done to her rabbi's wife the rabbi's wife um and all of this is done what is a proportionate response to that I mean you tell me what what is Israel meant to do okay U assume assume you uh you're a nice guy you would't do this crap but let's just assume for the sake of argument you come to my house um you uh torture rape kill my entire family I don't I mean I have dogs which are like my children but anyway um you TOR a rape kill my entire family um I have a gun in my hand the police are doing nothing I've called them 100 times in this case the UN or whatever they they're not doing anything they're just saying sir up you you manage what am I meant to do when you're about to do to my last living child what you've done to the rest of my family I don't know what is a proportionate response you know I want them to answer this question what is a proportionate response um I've never gotten a straight answer for it I I will never get what is a proportionate response answer I will never get a clear answer there is always equivalence for do you condemn Hamas no but they do all of this and then when you bring out the fact that there is that there is a fundamental moral equivalence between targeting civilians and civilians being collateral damage of human Shields fine I mean by all means you want to be partisan and criticize Israel for bombing colleges or hospitals even if they're holding ammunition dumps fine you don't want to condemn Hamas for killing Jews fine will you at least condemn Hamas for holding Palestinians as hostages you know no matter what you say nowra there's a whole section of the audience that's just categorized you as prois and anti-muslim yeah so a very direct question to you are you anti-muslim no I not explain how you're not anti-muslim uh I not anti-muslim because I make a very clear distinction between jihadist and Muslims okay I know a lot of Muslims who are very very disgusted by what uh uh Hamas has done I know a lot of Muslims who detest Hamas you know what the problem is they are are scared to come out and say it openly why because it breaks down family structures they get harassed within their Social Circles they lose a lot of their Social Circles some of them are brave enough to actually come out and say it so you know my friends Amna Ansari Khaled B zahak tanir all of these people and they will immediately again be uh classified as rented Muslims you know uh paid Muslims that have sold their souls to the Hindu uh to the Hindu Jewish conspiracy you know there's an actual term for that uh uh HUD yahood HUD saish yahood being the Jew HUD being the Hindu saish being conspiracy so you know Protocols of the Elders of Zion where uh uh Hindus are now Junior Partners in the protocols they are classified as that but do you know how many Muslims I know who really don't want this crap who are absolutely morally clear that what Hamas has done is reprehensible who just won't come out because they get no support tomorrow if somebody can uh do you remember when the entire nupu Sharma thing controversy broke out uh people were killed in their houses just for expressing support for Nur Sharma there was a Muslim boy who posted saying you know this lady seems Brave and there was a whole crowd of Muslims that gathered outside his house extremist Muslims jihadist Muslims not just average Muslims uh who gathered outside his house to do him physical harm and he had to be arrested for his own protection uh the uh Hindu tayor who was I mean you saw the video his head was sliced off had expressed support on a Facebook page the police in this country the enforcement mechanisms in this country are pathetic we are a third world country in terms of the state's Monopoly on violence we cannot provide protection to everybody uh and it is there in the west as well where extremists you know they can always take over a thing because Law and Orders generally good out there so there's less police in India Law and Order was never good and we have less police the state of Terror they live in largely by their own people pretty much you know the Gaza Stockholm not even Stockholm syndrome they know the terror they're in Gaza may be Stockholm syndrome but India they're just petrified because they will get no support the state doesn't have the resources to protect them why will they go out on a limp so I make it very clear that you know being anti- Hamas doesn't make you islamophobic uh in fact being pro Hamas makes you islamophobic uh I'm very clear that uh you can be an Indian Muslim and a very good Indian Muslim which is probably 90% of the population uh and you can be a Jihadi you can be a radicalized Jihadi I always make it very clear um I call people jihadis I don't call them mus Muslims I call them jihadis which is again taken as islamophobia I think it's important to talk about the argument for the pro Palestine side yes okay all these friends of mine who are expressing sympathy uh for Palestine and it's reached that point like this issue has reached that point where now content creators actors cricketers are getting DM saying why aren't you talking about this we're not talking about this because Instagram is not the right place to talk about this this is the right place to talk about this and this is the right place to learn um I'm trying to approach this from as neutral a perspective as I possibly can go towards but uh I know that even I'm going to be labeled on one side or the other all I can do is deep dive into this argument and keep trying to counter you for the sake of a better or or you can actually get a proponent of Palestine and we can do a 3 way uh after you get abused you're going to get abused very badly for this podcast that's fine um find one of the more eloquent people who abuses you invite him or her onto the podcast and we'll sit and do a three-way then who would who would probably abuse I don't know but find somebody who would abuse you and find the most eloquent person who abuses you or writes a article against you or whatever and invite them I mean we in India we believe in purva Paka the whole the whole concept of purva Paka where somebody's most deeply held beliefs are challenged in a academic environment not a environment of viciousness we should have that we should have more of that uh what do you think their arguments would be say if there was a third person here um their argument would be that Israel kills yeah Israel kills but let's contextualize The Killing uh like we just did uh human Shield versus Collective punishment see there's there's nothing that says uh you know the Geneva Convention Outlaws human shielding in it doesn't tell you what what is right and what is wrong in the case of human shielding uh the Geneva Convention the Fourth Geneva Convention uh uh makes Collective punishment illegal but it doesn't tell you what is collective punishment in a hostage situation or in a human shield situation right uh is firing at a hostage so this is fundamentally two cannons of international law clashing which has not been sorted out Collective punishment by itself is wrong human shielding by itself is wrong but what when Collective punishment is in response to human shielding what is the argument there what comes out on top in international law we don't know because nobody wants to answer that difficult question see everybody wants their little propaganda Point uh what you keep getting is a lot of bad history uh from the Palestinian site uh and a lot of it comes from the fact that they can't accept that Israel is there and should exist once you accept that Israel is exist and a two and a two accept a two-state solution it becomes a lot easier to move forward in that conversation but you know there are first principles errors in a lot of the arguments that come from there which we'll discuss when we do the uh uh uh three-part series like there's a lot happening geopolitically let's stick to the present and the future in this particular part one of the conversation uh for people who've been living under a rock how did this present situation begin you want to take it Forward well very simple the present situation began because Israel was complacent they actually thought Hamas was behaving itself unusually good behavior for a period of almost 2 years and uh they did not expect the attack to happen but then on the 7th and 8th of October uh the defenses the Border defenses were breached and Hamas just went on a Rampage in southern Israel killing 1,400 odd people several of them were very sadistically torture rape killed and boasting about it putting it on social media uh putting it on mass distribution channels and you know to contextualize this in Israeli terms 1,400 dead is like a nuclear bomb going off in Indian terms it's like about what it's um 2.8 lakhs 280,000 people being killed uh you know it's psychologically it's the same impact that Hiroshima and Nagasaki had on Japan and obviously Israel is going to respond to it uh which is what they're doing right now which everybody's crying foul about um the question really is what exactly did they want Israel to do what did they think Israel was going to do after an attack like that like sit down sit back and start sting uh you know singing Kumbaya and uh knit sweaters really okay um again this is a very very long conversation like that that's the only way to explain this topic and I do definitely want to address the pro Palestine side of things much more of that will happen in part two which is about the history of that piece of land that we call Israel in the modern day uh I want to just confirm certain things with you please correct me whever I'm wrong so the Hamas carry out this attack they can't be stupid enough to think that there's going to be no retaliation from one of the world's military Powers actually they can okay let's also attach that narrative that we just spoke about I think you told me outside which is that um whole thing about children which is a lot of the pro Palestine uh side of the argument on social media that 50% of The Debs are children uh what those same people who share those clips and of course I condemn a children's death as much as you condemn it as much as aim condemns it why should kids be a part of a political conflict uh just that you know it was mostly the uh uh the fertility rate of nine which is to say nine kids per household was very deliberate planning in order to SW wamp uh what is today Israel including the occupied territories and create a Muslim majority and the uh the benefit of it the side benefit of it was having lots of underage human Shields okay again this is a very long conversation that we have to break down much more but to understand this further we'll Club it into part two of this conversation maybe to end part one all I'm going to ask you is where do we go from here um things aren't going to change for the Palestinians in Gaza till you get rid of Hamas they crossed a line okay and this really comes down to a philosophical difference okay who is responsible the person who is using children as human Shields we have proof that when the Israelis have been uh you know dropping leaflets and sending smss and phone calls asking people to evacuate Hamas actually prevents them from evacuating and tells them not to evacuate and to stay back and say that uh Israeli evacuation orders are a disinformation campaign you can actually see the smss you can actually live see the SMS lots of videos uploaded on social media uh that they're doing this and I guess this is for me it's not a philosophical question but for people who want to equivocate it becomes a pseudo philosophical question that I am here to demolish a house by Corporation orders you are deliberately keeping your children inside there in the hope that it will prevent me from demolishing and in case I do demolish and the children get killed you can sue me for murder and then negotiate with me to get my house UND demolished or not see with that the corporation does not resends its order or something like that I would hold the house owner responsible um if you related to the house owner obviously you'll hold the corporation responsible but the question is I understand where the Palestinians are coming from if you're not a Palestinian take a legal point of view on this who is putting the children in danger okay for me it's a very straightforward argument uh there is unfortunately a tendency in our time to not accept responsibility for your own actions and externalize it everybody else is responsible for how screwed I am and I am blameless I a victim of society I'm sorry that doesn't work okay I am not voke I don't I detest vokes because the whole point of voker is to not grow up and externalize your own faults onto other people and that really is the Palestinian political mindset it's never really grown up and it refuses to interest respect it refuses demonstrably failed tactics they refuse to change what do you do you learn about the history of Israel in the next episode yes that's all you can do I think there's a lot of pro Palestine people who are not familiar with the history of Israel it's a very key part of this whole argument please understand that anything you see on the news anything you see on social media uh there are multiple mple aspects to that argument this is not a pro- Israel statement this is a statement from the perspective of trying to learn more which you me and I am will do in part two of this conversation am thank you uh thank you for explaining it the way you did but I think part two is where meet lies because whatever is happening today has happened because of whatever happened in the past absolutely um and you know it'll also determine the future um so I just hope which is something the Middle East never learns I think is let's learn from our own history you know and to learn from history you first need to have an accurate history all right we will see you in part two thank you so that was the episode for today please feel free to drop in any feedback on my Instagram DMS in the comment section on YouTube this is one of those topics where we have to bring someone who's Pro Palestine to actually debate with an opinion like the one that aim had part two will be about the history of this conflict the history of this region um both these parts were extremely heavy for me to do that's why I hope I did Justice at least to a certain degree I'm very open to Bringing on anyone who is qualified and who's capable of speaking in favor of Palestine in this Israel Palestine War situation please share the episode as much as possible and stay tuned for part [Music] two"
143,NgVXIBj905w,Who Owns The Temple Mount / Al-Aqsa? | The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,"Oct '23 Hamas-Israel War: youtube.com/watch?v=N1TXC9eQcJ4

Sacred and significant to Jews and Palestinians alike, the Temple Mount has a long and tumultuous history, serving today as a focal point and symbol of the entire Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

For the Jewish People, the Temple Mount is known to be its holiest site. It is the site of the Foundation Stone, the center of the universe and where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac, as well as the place where King Solomon built the holy First Temple. For Palestinians and other Muslims, the Al-Aqsa Mosque Compound is considered the third holiest site in Islam, the place to where Muhammad travelled from Mecca and ascended to heaven in a single night.

Since the formation of Zionism and the founding of the State of Israel, the Temple Mount has once again become a site of tension between competing peoples and religions, sparking conflict over antiquities claims, Jewish prayer, and security presence. At the center of the violence is the fear that recognizing the claim of the Other's connection to the site will mean that the Other rightfully owns the Temple Mount to the exclusion of all other peoples and faiths.

From its origins as a symbol of legitimacy for various empires and groups to its current role as a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Temple Mount continues to represent the complexities and tensions of the region.

About Explainers: From ancient Jewish traditions to the modern State of Israel, we explain it all. Diving into anything and everything related to Jewish culture, history, and even religion. 
Understand Jewish holidays, Israeli politics, Jewish diasporic communities, and more. Learn about Judaism in pop culture, debunking myths about Jews, and explore obscure Israeli landmarks.  We’re asking questions as basic as “What is the Talmud?”, and as obscure as “How did hip-hop boost Kosher wine sales?”, and everything in between.

About Unpacked: We provide nuanced insights by unpacking all things Jewish. People are complex and complicated — yet we’re constantly being pushed to oversimplify our world. At Unpacked we know that being complex makes us more interesting. Because of this, we break the world down with nuance and insight to drive your curiosity and challenge your thinking.

#Israel #Palestine #alaqsa #templemount",2023-01-11,466866,7399,3318,UCU63EiU7Y-8xcRntPIRVrzA," - It's nearly impossible to summarize the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict concisely. But if you're looking for
the most potent symbol of the conflict, this
place right behind me wins. Hands down. Palestinians call it the
Al-Aqsa Mosque Compound. Jews know it as the Temple Mount. It's the holiest site in Judaism and the third holiest site in the Islam, which makes it some of the most contested
real estate in the world. Its every ancient stone uses proof either of Israeli or
Palestinian legitimacy. So who actually owns this land and how did this site become
the biggest flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? (upbeat music) No place encapsulates
Jerusalem's turbulent history quite like the Temple Mount whose iconic golden dome has come to define the city skyline. This is where the stories and hopes and aspirations
of three faiths converge. But if everyone claims it as their own, who does it really belong to? To answer that, we have
to start at the beginning and I mean the beginning. In Jewish tradition, the
large flat stone in the middle of the Temple Mount complex
is the center of the universe. This is where God breathed life into Adam, where Abraham nearly sacrificed his son, and where the Israeli King
Solomon dedicated temple to God 3,000 years ago. Temples were a dime a
dozen in the ancient world but not for the Jews who had
a single portable temple, known as the mishkan, which had been with them
for hundreds of years since their wanderings in the
desert after leaving Egypt. Solomon wanted to turn
that portable temple into a permanent temple that could draw pilgrims from all over. See, at that time, the Israelites were the
world's only monotheists and their beautiful temple served as excellent PR for the one true God. So the king invested
considerable resources to make the Jewish temple the destination for pilgrims of all nations. Solomon got his wish. Emperors and kings flocked
to Jerusalem with offerings, and gifts, and weapons, and imperial ambitions, and violence. Now it's starting to sound
like the Jerusalem we're used to hearing about. For 400 years, Solomon's temple served as Judaism's focal point. Its fame extended to the distant corners of Europe and Africa. If Jerusalem was a prize situated
at the crossroads of Asia and Africa, then the
temple was its crown jewel. Here's the thing about prizes
though, everyone wants one, including the Neo-Babylonians
who set their sights on Jerusalem in sixth century BCE. The Jews weren't jazzed about
submitting to a larger empire but the Neo-Babylonians didn't
take kindly to being denied. They sacked Jerusalem,
destroyed the temple, and hauled off huge numbers
of Judeans into exile. But then something amazing
happened, the Persian ruler, Cyrus the Great, rose to
power and allowed the Jews to return to their homeland
and rebuild their temple. 71 years after the first
temple's destruction, the second temple was open for business. Like its predecessor, the second temple was magnificent, especially once the
Roman puppet king Herod started expansions in
the first century BCE. But Herod's renovations
didn't last very long because history repeats. Another empire had its eye on Judea, and just as they had before,
the Jews refused to submit. So in 70 CE, the Romans borrowed from the Babylonian
playbook, burning Jerusalem, destroying the temple,
and deporting Judeans to Roman in chains. In a final insult, the Romans used the temple
mount as a garbage dump. Literally. The Jew's holiest place reduced for centuries to a heap of trash. All that was left of the once great temple included sections of the retaining walls. A small part of the western
retaining wall became a site of Jewish pilgrimage in prayer, a symbol of both Jewish
pride and Jewish tragedy. Why did Jews flock there? Why worship among refuse and ruins? Because it was never about the wall. The wall was merely the
closest the Jews could get to the foundation stone,
the holiest place on Earth. So what changed? Who built this gorgeous dome behind me? That would be the Muslims. The holiest site in Islam is Mecca, which is a smooth 17-hour road trip if we get in the car right now. But the prophet Muhammad didn't drive. According to Muslim
tradition, he made the journey from Mecca to Jerusalem in a single night on the back of a magical winged
creature called the Buraq, and from there he ascended to heaven to meet and pray
with the other prophets. So yeah, this site is a
big deal for Muslims too. Islam spread quickly through the Levant and by the seventh century, the Holy Land was part of
the growing Arab empire. To commemorate Muhammad's night journey, the Umayyad caliph built
this beautiful shrine behind me right on top of where the Jewish temple's
innermost sanctuary, the Holy of Holies had once stood, the center of the universe for Jews, the place where all three
Abrahamic faiths agreed that Abraham nearly sacrificed his son. Speaking of the Abrahamic faiths, you might have noticed
I've been pretty silent about our other cousins, the Christians. So what's their relationship to the site? Roughly 500 years after
Muhammad's night journey, Christian crusaders marched from Europe to take back the
Holy Land from the Muslims. When the Crusaders
encircled Jerusalem in 1099, the city's Muslims and Jews banded together
to hold off the threat. But the Crusaders won the day, slaughtering thousands
of Jews and Muslims, and turned their holy sites into churches, including this one, and the
Al-Aqsa Mosque right there. For 88 years, it served as the headquarters of
the Knight's Templar but the Crusaders didn't
hold Jerusalem for long. In 1187, Saladin routed
the Christian forces and the Temple Mount has been
in Muslim hands ever since. Well, sort of because last I checked, the Temple Mount is in
Jerusalem, the capital of the Jewish state, which
brings us back to today. So who owns it now? Muslims or Jews? Like everything in the Middle
East, it's complicated. Jews have been praying at the base of the Western Wall for 2,000 years but as Jews returned to
their homeland in the 1900s, Muslim authorities did their
best to restrict Jewish access to the wall. Clerics whipped up their
people of lies claiming that the Jews were planning to take over and destroy Muslim holy sites. In August of 1929, after
months of incitement, Arab mobs descended on
the Jews of Jerusalem, Chevron, and Tzfat, massacring and mutilating over 133 Jews. The fight over this holy site has powered this conflict ever since. After Israel declared
independence in May of 1948, the Arab world came calling, confident that they could
stamp the tiny new state out of existence. As we know, they failed. But the Old City, including
the Jewish Quarter, fell to the Jordanians
who pointedly ignored that pesky clause in
the ceasefire agreement that guaranteed Jews access
to their religious sites. From 1948 to 1967, no Jew could approach the Western Wall. All that changed when
tensions exploded in 1967. The resulting war was brief but it permanently
altered the Middle East. Within six days, Israel
dramatically expanded its borders and regained control of the Old City. No Israeli alive then will
ever forget the IDF chief of Staff Motteh Gur's announcement, (Motteh speaking in foreign language) ""The Temple Mount is in our hands."" My uncle Yoram was there that day. He had the honor of
hanging the Israeli flag above the Western wall
on the Temple Mount, and he wasn't the only
one overcome with joy. Within a week, a quarter of a million Jews had flocked to the wall. After 2,000 years of waiting, the Temple Mount was once
again under Jewish control or was it? Muslims all over the
world weren't too happy with the prospect of Jews
controlling the Temple Mount. Plus, Jewish law has quite a lot to say about who's allowed to enter the complex and where they're allowed to go. Even in the days of the temple, ordinary Jews were barred
from entering certain areas. This hadn't been an issue for 2,000 years. With the Temple Mount in
Jewish hands once more, Israeli authorities had
some decisions to make. The miraculous victory of 1967 had opened up a whole
new world of complexity. Ultimately, Jewish tradition and Muslim pressure
prevailed, and since 1967, Jews have not been allowed
to pray on the Temple Mount. The only Jews regularly allowed on the sacred complex are soldiers and other security personnel,
and for good reason. The mere hint of a change
in the status quo can and has set the entire country a blaze. I've seen that tension firsthand. For almost three years, I served as a border policeman in the Israeli army,
patrolling the Temple Mount, and its surrounding neighborhoods. Under the leadership of
my commanding officer, an Arab Muslim from Haifa, my unit protected worshipers
of all ethnicities and faiths. Along with these innocent pilgrims, we were attacked too many times but even the ugliest
violence can't detract from the holiness of this place. As I know all too well, Israeli forces can enter the Temple Mount at any time for security
reasons, but control and maintenance of the
site ultimately rest with a Jordanian-funded Muslim trust known as the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, which means that Judaism's holiest site is under the third holiest site in Islam, located in a territory controlled
by Israel and entrusted to a Muslim religious
organization that's funded by another country. Simple, right? Shocking that there's
been any controversy here. The Waqf and the Israeli authorities have had some pointed
disagreements over the years about everything from
archeological research to the presence of metal detectors. For example, in 1999, the Waqf decided to
build an emergency exit in one of the mosques on the Temple Mount. Sounds fun, right? Safety first, except they used
bulldozers to clear an area of four stories deep into the ground, carting away literal tons of soil embedded with ancient artifacts. As Israeli historian Eyal Meiron put it, ""A toothbrush would be too large for brushing that soil, and
they did it with bulldozers."" You can guess what happened next. Jews accused the Waqf of
destroying archeological evidence of the ancient Jewish
presence on the site. The Waqf's chief archeologist
responded by snapping. ""Every stone is a Muslim development. If anything was destroyed,
it was Muslim heritage."" The controversy encapsulates the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with the Temple Mount serving as shorthand for each side's legitimacy, a symbol of the worst
kind of zero sum thinking. It's like everyone is afraid to admit that the other side might
have a historical claim or connection to the site, as though admitting
someone else's connection somehow takes away from
the validity of your own. Under that all-or-nothing mentality, there's literally no
such thing as compromise. You're either a winner or you're a loser and no one wants to be a loser,
especially the Middle East. That's why so many Palestinians
refuse to admit the Jews have a claim to the site, ignoring mountains of historical evidence. In 1929, a Waqf historian wrote
that it was beyond dispute that the Temple Mount was
the site of Solomon's temple. Yet in 2010, the Palestinian Authority
released a study claiming that the Kotel wasn't the
Jewish Holy site at all but a part of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Here's a quote. ""This wall was never part of
the so-called Temple Mount, but Muslim tolerance allowed
for the Jews to stand in front of it and weep
over its destruction."" Nice, right? Do these guys write textbooks? I could stand here and laugh at the PA's blatant attempt
to erase the inconvenient fact the Jewish presence here predates
the Arab Empire's conquest of Jerusalem by well over 2,000 years. But the PA's rhetoric, just like the rhetoric that
incited the massacres of 1929, trickles down to ordinary folks
with violent consequences. Today, Muslims and non-Muslims alike refer to the entire complex, not just the Al-Aqsa Mosque, as al-Aqsa. These three syllables have served as a rallying cry, inciting
Muslims against Jews. ""It's all Al-Aqsa,"" one
young Arab man seethed during the 11-day war
between Israel and Hamas in May of 2021. It's all Al-Aqsa. There it is. The whole conflict stuffed
into one 35-acre complex. So who owns the Temple Mount? I think that under the politics, under the wars, under
the fighting, every Jew, and every Arab would agree that
there's only one true owner. But in the absence of a sign from heaven, it's our responsibility to figure out how to share this holy space."

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has launched an international campaign to achieve recognition by the United Nations for an independent Palestinian state. Abbas and his international supporters claim that only Israel (with the United States) stands in the way of this act of historical justice, which would finally bring about peace in the Middle East.

This video debunks the Palestinians' claim and shows that Abbas has been lying about the origins and history of the conflict. Palestinian leaders have rejected partition plans that would have given them much more land for their independent state than the Jews were offered for theirs. Rather than being the innocent victims of a ""dispossession"" at the hands of the Israelis, the Palestinians rejected reasonable compromises and instead pursued their aim of getting rid of the only Jewish state in the world.

Palestinian state by Mahmud abas president of the Palestinian National Authority in that piece aboss called for the United Nations to formally recognize a Palestinian State based on the pre-1967 borders regardless of negotiations with the state of Israel the article appeared just a few days before Barack Obama much anticipated speech on the Arab Spring in which the President also tried to jump start peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority to reach an agreement on a two-state solution Obama declared Israel must agree to return to the pre-1967 borders modified only by mutually agreed land swaps now neither Mr abas nor Mr Obama can explain how anyone could have recognized a United Nations designated Palestinian state that palestin Ian leaders and the Arab states themselves have rejected of the troubles in Ireland the poet William Butler Yates once wrote great hatred little room maimed us at the start in Palestine at the start there was plenty of room more than enough room for a prosperous Jewish State and a prosperous Arab state after World War I ended with the dismantling of the Ottoman Empire the League of Nations established the Mandate for Palestine including all of the land that is now Israel the West Bank and the Gaza Strip plus the entire territory east of the Jordan River now called the kingdom of Jordan the area under the Mandate was as large as Syria and about half as large as Iraq yet the total population at the time was less than 1 million of whom 10% were Jews it was in that vast underdeveloped and underpopulated territory that the British had promised in the language of the 1917 balfor declaration to support the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people the Declaration also promised that nothing shall be done which may Prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine open Jewish immigration to the Holy Land was encouraged as was freedom of speech religion and assembly for the Arabs of Palestine rights they had sorely lacked under Turkish rule Meed for more than two centuries in backwardness and grinding poverty Palestinians were never recognized by the Ottoman Empire as possessing any distinctive national identity the Palestinians quickly took advantage of their New Freedom to speak bluntly demanding a stop to the Jewish immigration which had just begun said one Arab representative during the Paris peace conference we will push the Zionist into the sea or they will send us back into the desert RF Pasha deani a Palestinian leader from Jerusalem warned that it is impossible to live with the Jews in all the countries where they are at present they are not wanted because they always arrive to suck the blood of everybody if the League of Nations will not listen to the appeal of the Arabs this country will become a river of blood well as promised blood did flow when the Palestinian demand to end Jewish immigration was not granted Jerusalem was the first flasho for regular Arab attacks on Jewish communities in April 1920 Palestinians from nearby towns poured into the old city the Muslim mayor of Jerusalem and other notables worked up the crowd to launch a Jihad against the Jews if we don't use Force against the zionists and against the Jews we will never be rid of them urged newspaper editor Arif al-arif the crowd shouted back we will drink the blood of the Jews shouting Islamic slogans like Muhammad's religion was born with the sword thousands surged through the Jewish quarter and into West Jerusalem the mobs vented their Rage Against any Jew they could find burning and looting homes and stores and even attacking British and Arab policemen after several days of rioting the final toll was six Jews dead hundreds beaten and widespread destruction of property what became known as the nebim Musa Riot was the opening shot in a 90-year war to reverse the balfor Declaration and things soon got worse as the Allies to assuage the fears of Arab monarchs separated the land east of the Jordan River out of the total area accessible to Jewish immigrants and created the Emirate of trans Jordan reconciling the aspirations of Arabs and Jews became far more tenuous after the balfor Declaration had to be carried out in the truncated area of Palestine from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea there was now much less room and a great deal more hatred the decades that followed were marred by Perpetual violence against the Jews both in Palestine and in Europe the two were often linked under the leadership of the grand Muti and president of the Supreme Muslim Council Haj Amin al-husseini the Arabs of Palestine waged an endless Jihad against their Jewish Neighbors when the British sent a royal commission to investigate a solution the Jews represented by high and vitman pressed for a partition of the territory into two states even if the territory assigned to the Jews was the size of a tablecloth the appeal commission's final report published in July 1937 proposed such a division the Jews were offered an independent state in a small Enclave along the Sea Coast from Tel Aviv to the north of the country constituting about 20% of the remaining mandate territory while the Palestinian Arabs would get 80% for their own State desperate for any means to be able to bring in large numbers of the endangered European Jews the zionists reluctantly accepted the commission's partition plan led by the Muti the Arabs rejected partition out of hand and pressed on with the armed revolt against the Mandate the British succeeded in putting down the violence for a time al- husi was sent into Exile ultimately in Hitler's Nazi Germany where he lived as a special guest of the fur but severe limitations were placed on Jewish immigration to the Holy Land in the Years leading up to the Holocaust that undoubtedly directly led to the death of many thousands of European Jews now following the atro ities of the second world war Britain relinquished authority over the mandate to the newly formed United Nations the UN created yet another commission to try to figure out what to do with the contested territory the United Nations special committee on Palestine recommended by a vote of 7 to3 yet another two-state solution another partition plan to the general assembly this plan would have seen the Territory divided almost equally between Jews and Arabs once again the zionists made public their acceptance of the proposal and once again Arab officials announced that any partition would be met with rivers of blood shortly after the UN vote the 20 member Arab League sent their newly organized Arab Liberation Army against the Jews of Palestine elements of five regular Arab armies from Egypt Jordan Syria Iraq and Lebanon invaded Israel on May 15th 1948 Arab League's Secretary General Abdul Raman aam vowed this will be a war of extermination and a momentous Massacre which will be spoken of like the Mongol massacres and the Crusades but despite their overwhelming numbers and heated rhetoric after a year of fighting it was the Jewish state that had want a decisive Victory based on the 1949 armus lines Israel's territory expanded by almost 40% the Palestinian Arabs were the big losers for the second time in 10 years their leaders rejected a partition plan that would have given them Independence and more land designated for their state than for the Jewish State instead they ended up with nothing and 650,000 Palestinians became refugees Jordan's King Abdullah sent his Arab Legion to occupy the Palestinian West Bank and Annex the territory to his kingdom Egypt took the Gaza Strip and for the next 18 years denied Palestinians any civil rights it never occurred to the rulers of Jordan or Egypt to create a state for the homeless Palestinians nor did new Palestinian leaders like yaser Arafat protest this occupation of their land by Foreign rulers now three times in the past decade Israeli Prime Ministers have offered Palestinian leaders an independent state far more generous than anything Jordan and Egypt ever allowed when they controlled the West Bank and Gaza at Camp David in 2000 Israeli Prime Minister ahud Barack agreed to the Border suggested by President Clinton that would have established a West Bank Gaza Palestinian state with some territorial adjustments and with the Palestinians getting East Jerusalem as their capital for his part Palestinian Liberation Organization chairman yaser Arafat walked out of negotiations went back home and launched the second inada invoking Islamic Jew hatred as justification the Palestinians conducted a three-year brutal campaign of suicide bombings against Israeli pizza parlors wedding halls and discotics in 2005 Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Chiron decided that it was against Israel's security interest to govern the 1.1 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip Chiron dismantled all of the Jewish settlements and pulled Israeli forces back across the 1967 borders between Israel and Gaza without even any land swaps as an added bonus Israel left the Palestinians a thriving flower export industry to help jumpstart the local local economy the Palestinians response to this generosity well first they destroyed the donated green houses and then they launched a war of missiles and Rockets against civilian Targets in Israel in a September 2008 meeting in Jerusalem then Israeli Prime Minister ahud mert presented president abas with a detailed map of a future Palestinian state that with land swaps would constitute close to 100% of the territory of the West Bank in Gaza prior to the June 1967 war Al Merit also offered to divide Jerusalem enabling the Palestinians to locate their capital in the eastern half of the city promising to come back the next day for further discussions abas took alit's map to his romala office just a few miles outside Jerusalem for his aids to study but abas never returned with the map this was the last time the Israeli and Palestinian leaders met many times over the last 63 years both the International Community and the state of Israel have offered the Arabs of Palestine their own State each time these offers have been met by more violence against Jewish citizens neither president abas nor President Obama are ignorant of this fact they simply both choose to ignore it for Mr abas this refusal seems to be part of a consistent thread woven throughout the Arab war against the Jews Mr Obama's positions remain more mysterious"

#VICEonHBO",2018-05-15,3785361,45411,21656,UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ," the israeli-palestinian conflict has been the focal point of geopolitical instability in the Middle East since the establishment of Israel in 1948 although the vast majority of the international community the UN and the United States publicly support a two-state solution trying to end this conflict after decades of negotiation final settlement has never been reached and tensions between the Jewish state and the Arab world continue to fester throughout this process America has remained firmly behind Israel as its greatest supporter in fact Israel receives more US foreign aid than any other country in the world now much of this support has been attributed to a strong wealthy and very pro-israeli Lobby in America which is true but you'd think that the majority of the strength behind this Lobby would be the Jewish community in the US which is only partially correct because as it turns out in terms of sheer numbers the evangelical Christians from America's Bible Belt make up the majority of this lobbies power base so he sent Thomas Morton to find out why a bunch of born-again Christians from Texas are so in love with the nation of Israel [Music] this may be the most important prophetic spot in the entire Bible because the final act of the book of Revelation is going to begin right here at this place the Bible teaches that Russia Iran Ethiopia Libya Turkey and other nations will come down under a UN flag and they will invade Israel at this particular point can you imagine thousands of Tanks out here in this valley rumbling fighting firing can you imagine jet airplanes screaming overhead the battle is going to be fierce the horrific multinational fighting this preacher is describing is the Battle of Armageddon which is supposed to happen right here just as soon as Israel as a fully Jewish state which is why a bunch of Christians in Texas have become the most fervent Zionists on God's green earth while most Americans probably think that the pro-israeli Lobby is largely a Jewish thing actually the most of its support comes from right here in the Bible Belt where evangelical Christians overwhelmingly believe that Israel has a right to exist because God said so go to the phone right now and call that number and say yes I'm gonna stand with Israel I'm gonna bless the people of the Bible I'm gonna bless the Hajj tocb well those of you in this audience who support the State of Israel stand to your feet and give a shout of support while a lot of Israel's financial support does come from Jewish wallets that are close to 70 million evangelicals in America versus less than 14 million Jews worldwide and given that roughly 80% of these christians support israel that makes american christians the largest pro-israeli voting bloc in the world about four times the size of the jewish community on earth there's a lot of money behind the Christian Zionist movement this church behind me cornerstone is one of the biggest supporters of Israel not just among Christians but in the world the pastor here John Hagee has raised an estimated 70 million dollars of the course of his ministry pastor Hagee also found in Christians United for Israel or a CUFI which is the largest pro-israel lobbying organization in America even bigger than AIPAC the organization most people assume dominates the american israel lobby because it's the biggest jewish room what Stacey about CUFI is that a good deal of their money for Israel is spent on buildings and organizations in the Israeli settlements these are massive Jewish communities built well within Palestinian territory in violation of international law the settlements are run by some of the most fanatical Zionists who believe the Bible entitles them to their land and that's eating any of it back to the Palestinians would be a violation of God's well there's nothing wrong with Christians supporting Israel the way these Christians have chosen to do so puts them firmly on one side of the israeli-palestinian conflict one that's directly opposed the US government's official policy and are using their massive political power and money to oppose the peace plan John Kerry is currently trying to push through that's the two-state solution that would give the Palestinians the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the Israelis would get the rest hopefully ending all the violence the evangelicals not only Lobby Washington and send money to Israel to fight the two-state solution they also make up over 40% of American tourists in Israel every year with popular holyland pogrom egde tours many of these tours actually have stops in the Israeli settlements which are used by the settlers to solicit donations for their cause we're incarnation Ramah Israeli settlement we're about to meet Sandra who deals with pastor Hagee in the United States she is not a Christian she's an Orthodox Jew and right now she's hosting a bunch of Christian Australians who are touring the settlement and hopefully coughing up the bills to make the settlements more relatable to their Christian friends Sondra and her organization used the Palestinian territories biblical names of Judea and Samaria people who believe in the Bible are the moral and spiritual right of the Jewish people amen after Sandra's presentation weary boarded the bus to see the settlement for ourselves come on guys I want you to try to punch him in the stomach let's give it a try unfortunately our Arab neighbors also have these kinds of guns you need to be protected with something like this how important is Christian support for specifically for the settlement Christian support for the Jewish presence in Judea Samaria is critical because it's a very large group of people all over the world and we need to hear their voices and thank God they are raising their voices on this issue louder and louder every day another Christian holy land tour leader is evangelical pastor Irvin Baxter who's in time ministries takes its flock to Israel twice a year the focus of their tours is actually the real reason evangelicals overwhelmingly want the Jews to control all of Israel which is the actual end times as an Armageddon because according to their interpretation of the Bible Jewish controlled the Holy Land will lead directly to the second coming of Christ the word Armageddon is actually two words har Megiddo or hill of Megiddo you are standing on the hill of Megiddo right now the final act of the book of Revelation is going to begin right here at this place and when it is was about to be defeated the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ Himself will intervene it says it this way the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God he is going to defeat the Antichrist he's going to defeat the false prophet both of them will be cast alive into the lake of fire at that time Satan is going to be bound for the next 1,000 years and we are going to crown Jesus Christ as king of kings and Lord of lords real quickly I will take time for a few questions well sure we'll still be there or not in addition to Armageddon pastor Baxter's in times tour hits all the other local attractions associated with the apocalypse including the most contested piece of real estate on the planet Jerusalem which houses some of the most sacred sites for Jews Muslims and Christians alike it's also where Jesus lands at the grand finale of the end times which doesn't pan out so great for the Jews of Israel will die if Zechariah 13 I think maybe verse 7 8 9 right in that area that few thirds will by one-third will be brought through the fire and that one-third will then turn to Messiah and Mass when it comes back and the scripture says that they will run out to him and when they bow to worship Him Zechariah 13 6s they're going to notice he's got wounds in his feet dude she's almost son we've been so stubborn we've been so proud we've been so blind could you ever forgive us and 2,000 years of blindnesses don't compete enough the Jewish mind and those of us have been a part of the rapture and come with Jesus here 200 cuz the Christians have been raptured out all who are born again yeah all have been rapture when Jesus comes we'll be caught up to meet yeah and then we will come with them in the battle Bacchus and so we're gonna be watching this whole panoramic thing unfold as the Jewish people turn to their Messiah we're gonna be converting fueled by the hundreds of thousands during this time well the two-thirds of Jews who died are definitely getting the worst of times into the stick it's a little less clear how the rest of the world fares in the pastor's end of days scenario in America get on the right side of Armageddon by supporting Israel Americans can let their legislators know support Israel right now under the present Obama administration there seems to be a drift somewhat away from Israel at least a determination to force Israel to do what America thinks they should do the only way for Israel to endure and thrive as a Jewish and democratic state is through the realization of an independent and viable Palestine the Jewish people should say look this is our promised land the Bible says we should not give it up so we're not giving it up you have to respect our religion aside from potentially derail and otherwise pretty solid peace plan Christian support for the Israeli settlements further makes life a pain in the ass for the Palestinians living nearby which is exactly what's happening at Beit Jala a Palestinian village on the outskirts of Bethlehem where Jesus was born happier Abu Aid is also Christian as well as an official in the Palestinian Liberation Organization we met him at a weekly outdoor mass put on by the Catholic Church as a form of protest against Israeli encroachment two years ago and they strike the court decided to build the wall here where we are so basically all this valley but you see here it's going to be on this really side of the wall for example he's one of the 58 land owners that are going to lose their land here it's in our 58 Palestinian Christian families yeah they're going to lose their land here and you're not talking about you know immigrants that came here now you're talking about the indigenous population of this land we are standing now over a territory that no one in the world not even the u.s. recognizes as part of Israel I know a lot of Evangelicals it's really big in America right now to support Israel because they say you know well the Bible says Israel belongs to the Jews and a lot of them also believe that once the Jews take over all of Israel then they get to hover on the garden I don't I've read the Bible and I never saw that the Bible says that God is a real estate agent those Christian Zionist organizations they are not giving money actually to the State of Israel they are giving money to the most ideological settlers and of course I don't think that's a very Christian act if I were a Palestine Christian I wouldn't involve myself in this conflict I'd stay out of it and say look I know what's coming I'm gonna serve Jesus Christ when he gets here he'll straighten all this out while Baxter's advice for Christians on the ground is basically just a bunker down and get ready for the inevitable key Anna's fellow Christian Zionists in America are working full tilt to make the end of day as a reality and are using the voting strength that their followers to try and get Washington on their side and in a political conflict that's already been hijacked by religious zealots on both the Palestinian and Israeli side adding millions of doomsday ready American evangelicals to the table is like pouring gas on the fire in the most flammable region in the world [Music]"

writer at The Intercept, Murtaza Hussain, and staff
writer at The Atlantic, Yair Rosenberg. Please welcome them. [APPLAUSE] I told you guys it was
going to get [INDISTINCT].. Welcome to the show. [MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome. The audience-- very rarely
do you get a standing ovation for the guests. But clearly, they
think, Muslim and Jew sitting next to each other? How can that be? But thank you both
for being here. You are both,
obviously-- you're American writers that write
a lot about the Middle East. The peace plan, the
Stewart Plan, as I call it, the Me Too plan-- [LAUGHTER] --and Murtaza, we'll
start with you-- how unrealistic is that? It's similar to a 2002
Arab League resolution. Why? Why can't this happen? Well, you know,
it's not a bad idea. And on paper-- JON STEWART: We're
going to cut there. Thank you so much, Murtaza. [LAUGHTER] So appreciate that. Well, you know, I
think the problem is-- I write about US
foreign policy, especially in the Middle East. And I feel that the
consistent theme here is that when we give blank
checks to countries which are our clients or partners, we
enable their worst tendencies or their worst behaviors. In this case, you know, you
mentioned the Arab Peace Plan. In 2002, the Arab
League offered Israel full political, economic,
diplomatic normalization in exchange for-- the main crux of it is
creating a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders, which is
in line with international law and so forth.
JON STEWART: Right. They have re-iterated-- JON STEWART: And the
Repatriation Plan, which-- Which can be negotiated--
the deal-- the details of it. But that was the crux of it. And you know, they've
reiterated this plan many, many times, including recently. And it's not just
the Arab world. The broader Muslim
world as well too. I interviewed the Pakistani
ambassador to the UN a few weeks ago. And he told me that
Pakistan, Indonesia, other large population
Muslim countries would be willing to
normalize with Israel but they do not want
the Palestinians to be thrown under the bus. There needs to be a two-state
solution in their view, creating a state
in those lines. Without that, they cannot be. But the Israeli government has
never responded to this deal. It's not even rejected. It's refused to engage. And I think the main
reason is because they have the US as a guarantor. Whatever they do, they'll
have a superpower backing. And many people in Israel
want the West Bank. And the Israeli government,
Benjamin Netanyahu has bragged that he's
stopped the Palestinian state from coming into existence. And because they
have this backing, they don't need to compromise
with their neighbors or engage with their
neighbors substantively. So you think the
US backing of that enables this reticence? I think the US putting
itself in this position-- not just this
position, many other situations where
it acts as a blank check writer for its clients. It enables these
situations to play out. JON STEWART: Well, we've
to make money somehow. And without selling
weapons, what are we going to fall back on, wheat?
Come on. Right. Yair, you probably
have a slightly different interpretation of
that peace plan and also what we
laid out here, so-- Yeah. Well, I think that the-- again,
the idea is actually a pretty good one, which is the idea
of put some third party in between these two parties-- JON STEWART: That's what
seems like has to happen.  --that would then be
sort of like the referee. The problem is, is that while-- as you showed in
your monologue, the Arab states are
willing to talk a big game. The United States,
and sometimes depending on the
administration, will also talk a big game. But no one actually
wants to put their own troops down there. Can you imagine America under
Democratic presidents who are retrenching from
the Middle East, trying to get out
of the forever wars, or Donald Trump, who
wants to turn America into some sort of
isolationist country, get us out of-- you know,
stops helping Ukraine. Right? They're not going to stick
Americans there, right? The Arab countries,
no different. They'll, you know, give
a token amount of money and then try to
make it go away. And so that's, I think,
the fundamental flaw here. I will say that, if you
took away US backing and said, Israelis, we're
going to put some other people on your border-- particularly, say, Arab
states-- and they're going to be the guarantors
of your security, the Israelis wouldn't
say, well, guess we don't have the Americans.
We're just going to pack it up. JON STEWART: Right.
- Because this is a country-- JON STEWART: Nobody's
going anywhere. Yeah, and also this
is a country that's full of people who
fled other countries, including those Arab countries
because they were persecuted-- JON STEWART: Right.  --killed, dispossessed. Right? There's like-- you
know, half of Israelis are now Middle Eastern origin. But two diasporas
don't make a right. - Of course not.
- It's the-- But they won't--
they won't trust it. But let me-- let me--
let me push back on both of these for just one second. [APPLAUSE] So-- and this just
pushes back on both. You know, we get into
this litigation of, well, the Palestinians
and the Arab state, they proposed something very
reasonable to the Israelis but the Israelis
wouldn't do it. And the Israelis say, well, we
don't have a partner for peace and we propose something very
reasonable, but they never do. Doesn't it appear that
no party is incentivized to fix this at the
peril and detriment to the Palestinian people? And here's what I mean by that. Egypt has its border
closed to the Palestinians. These are autocratic
states in the Arab world. They all view the creation
of Israel as a humiliation. If that's where
they start from, it's a very easy kind of
issue to deflect attention from your own dictatorships to
own the so-called Arab Street with anger towards Israel. But the Saudis, UA, they
all do business together. Aren't they disincentivized
to fix this? Netanyahu, whenever he
gets in political trouble, suddenly, there's a war. So who is incentivized
to actually fix this? And isn't the people
who really suffer from all of it just
the Palestinians, who get no regard from any group? No real support. You know, I think that
was the case for some time, but I think that things
have changed in the sense that the Arab countries
are very eager to get this off their plate actually. That's why they had this
Arab Peace Initiative and keep reiterating it. Because they no longer want to
have a conflict with Israel. It's not in their interests. They'd like to move
past it, but they cannot do so in a way which
ignores the Palestinians. And I think that the idea
of the Abraham Accords, for instance, was let's
sidestep this issue and make deals with the
Emiratis and the Saudis and so forth. I was in Saudi Arabia
recently and I was talking to a broad range of people. I think the idea that
the Saudis will make a deal with Israel without
a two-state solution or a meaningful pathway to
one or significant concessions on that subject, it's
very unrealistic. Because-- JON STEWART: No,
that's my point-- Yes. JON STEWART: --is the
two-state solution. But if nobody is
there to just-- everybody has preconditions
for everything. You know, Netanyahu,
I need a partner. If you don't meet these certain
conditions of no violence, I won't negotiate with you. Well, America occupied
Iraq and there was violence there the entire time. I mean, imagine if we had
set a precondition that there would be no Iraqi government
unless this violence would end. Nothing would ever--
it seems like nobody's actually being honest
or genuine in the region about their aims. I would put it a
little differently, which is to say that the people
who are running the show-- That's why you're a
scholar and I'm a comedian. We'll see.
We'll see when it's done. The people who are running
the show for some time-- which is how we arrive at this
disastrous destination-- are these absolutist actors,
who they might say that we'll negotiate and
here's a condition and here's, you know, whatever. They might say that
to some people, but in practice, we see
from, you know, many years of Netanyahu governance, every
single document and statement as you showed of your
people from Hamas, these are people who
want everything, right? They see half of the people
in the land as the problem. And the question is,
how you negotiate-- JON STEWART: The absolutists?
- Yeah, the absolutist. OK. And then there
are lots of people who are also pragmatists. And that's how we had a
peace process that failed. But there were
genuine majorities in the polls at the time, among
Israelis and Palestinians, behind negotiations
for two states. And so there always
are those people. They might be a minority,
they might be a majority at a given point in time. During a war-- right
now, they're a minority. But there's always
those people who say, this is not going to
be solved with weapons. We need to find a
way to live together. But we're not
supporting those people. JON STEWART: How could it
ever be solved if the United States and Israel, the two-- let's face it-- most hated
entities in that part of the world are
the ones responsible for the peacekeeping effort? It doesn't make any sense. No, you have to
have Arab states. If the Arabs don't step in,
if the Arab nations there-- and couldn't you say that
this was a great bulwark against the strength of Iran? Couldn't you convince
UAE and Saudis that the only way
to temper Tehran is by forming this alliance
and recognizing them? Well, you know,
it's interesting. You mentioned that the
US stance in the region is very unpopular. I think it's related
to this issue. This is the core issue
of why the US has not had normal relations with the
Arab world and Muslim world generally. It's a very bitter and symbolic
issue for a lot of people. JON STEWART: We do
have normal relations. We sell more weapons
to the Saudis than we do to the Israelis. On a public level,
or like, you know, only with dictators, for instance. The reason this
democracy is very skeptical in the
Arab world, we're afraid that regimes which are
mad at us will come to power. But I think the main issue,
I think from a US perspective primarily, is that
we're involved in this very bitter conflict. We're not taking it
seriously in solving it. We take a very one-sided
approach, I think. And we do that supposedly
in Israel's interest. But I think what
it does in reality is prolong the
conflict indefinitely, to everyone's detriment. I come to the position
that we should either be fair in this conflict and
adjudicate it in a way which is fair and results in a just
solution both sides accept or we should leave. We should leave
because it impacting us in very, very negative
ways, militarily, economically, strategically. We have other
problems in the world to deal with as well too. And I believe that if the
US were to pull what I'd say is a blank
check from Israel, it would incentivize
Israel to compromise more. Because ultimately, Israel has
to live in the Middle East. That's where the country is. That's where the
people are going to be. Their neighbors who are
willing to compromise with us-- JON STEWART: We could
move them to Maine. Maine is wide open. [LAUGHTER] They could they
could play tennis. - Right, right.
- But I hear your point. But to that, I do
think that the idea that this is all about
the United States, that we are the actor
that drives all the-- I think plays into a myth
of United States control. And I think if we've learned
anything in these last 20 to 30 years of
the United States is, we've got big influence,
but we sure as hell don't have control. And I'm not so
sure that by the US changing its policy in certain
ways that that solves this. What's your thought on that? Yeah, well, I mean, Jon,
that's a very controversial thing to say that
the United States is not the main character
of the entire planet. JON STEWART: And I'm
going to say, you said it and I didn't say it.
That was him. OK. You know, because-- you
know, this is not live, so maybe we'll cut that. JON STEWART: Yes, exactly. [LAUGHTER] But you know, that
is clearly the case. There is this sort of
sense that a lot of people have that the United States
and the president of the United States, in particular,
have the ability to sort of wave a magic
wand and solve these things. If they could, there are
multiple American presidents who would have done so. And they would have
changed the policies and they would have tried. And there were always
people in different factions in the state department. And they tried
different things. You go back to
Eisenhower and Nixon, they all had plans, right? And you know, they pressured
Israel in ways that, you know, presidents today don't. But there's a reason why we
moved in different directions because they thought maybe
if we are more involved. And one thing I
want to say to this, though, is that a
lot of people want to see a solution
in the Middle East, but they also want to see the
US get out of the Middle East. And those two things
are in contradiction. And people are
ultimately going to have to make choices about what
the US does and doesn't do. And-- JON STEWART: Buy
can have influence-- I don't necessarily
have the answer to that.  --and not be so
involved in the region. I do think, if there
is-- to your point-- if the Arab states form a more
broader alliance with Israel in a genuine way and that the
United States wouldn't feel maybe that it had to be on
the line there-- listen, I'm no fan of any of it. I think this cycle of
violence over 75 years is destroying the
dreams of two peoples. Not just the Palestinians. I think it's destroying the
dream of the Israeli people as well. And so I think that what
we're doing now, clearly, and what we've been
doing is a cycle that we have to pull out of. And I imagine, you
know, that's the thing that ultimately has to happen. So thank you both
for talking about it. Murtaza Hussain
and Yair Rosenberg. We're going to
take a quick break. I want to come back and talk
to them about one other thing. We'll put that offline. We'll be right back after this. We're back and we're
talking to Murtaza Hussain and Yair Rosenberg. And we talked a little bit
about some of the things that could help break
the cycle of violence in the Middle East. You know, the act of the two
of you sitting here, having this conversation is almost
rebellious or revolutionary in the current moment. How do you counsel
Americans in this moment to be able to,
you know, not lose so many Facebook friends-- [LAUGHTER] --when it comes to all this. Is there any advice
that you guys have? You take that first. Well, the backstory
of the two of us is that we've been having
these conversations for something like 10 years. And the further back story
is that we reached out to each other on Twitter
because we both realized that we shared a lot in
common about how we approach the world, but we
had very different opinions on issues like these. And that's how
we became friends some 10 years ago is it? Yeah, something like that.
Yeah. And so-- [APPLAUSE] We've had-- we've
been doing this over, you know, at kosher--
in kosher restaurants because for Sunni Muslims, many
of them, kosher meat is halal. And so I will take Murtaza
to a kosher restaurant, introduce him to
it, and then we'll have conversations like these. And Jon is just, you
know, interloping. You know, just
sort of-- you know, we decided to let him come. - I'm picking up the check.
- Exactly. There we go. And so and what
it is, we refuse to allow ourselves
or our communities to be held hostage to a ruinous
conflict thousands of miles away that we may never be
able to fully resolve or fix. JON STEWART: Right. But we can have
an impact about how we treat each other here. And the other thing I
would say is that we both are both journalists. And one of the things
that motivates us is our pursuit of
truth and what is true. And we share that,
even when we disagree. It's because we came to
different conceptions and we really believe
the other is honest. Yeah, that's well said. Well, you know, ultimately,
as Yair mentioned, we're journalists. And you know, we
seek out people's perspectives who are
different from you, who see a different world-- see the world from
a different view. And then that's how you learn
about the world a little bit. And I think I have to say
that it's easier for us too, though, because we're not
Israeli and not Palestinian, ultimately.
We're American. JON STEWART: You're
American journalists. And we view it that way. You know, both of us
know people who've family members have been
killed recently-- many dozens, in some cases-- in Gaza recently. And you know, that
emotional component, you can compartmentalize
it when you're not so directly involved. So we're looking at it to
an American perspective. Two different sides of
this issue, in some sense. But we're able to have
that conversation, which is constructive. And what I would
say, you know, I can accept any Palestinian's
view or any Israeli's view when they're so
intimately involved in it. But I can never respect
the bloodthirsty American. That's the only person
I cannot respect. [APPLAUSE] So, you know-- That's kind of the issue. And it is-- you know, I have said
this for many years. One of the biggest
issues I have with American foreign
policy is how cavalier it is about the destruction
that so many of our policies have had internationally. Even something as
simple as, you know, we had a big issue
here with burn pits with Iraqi war veterans
and Afghan war veterans. And we talked a
lot about getting them the help they need here. But the thing nobody
ever talked about was what those did
to the environment in Iraq and Afghanistan. We left. And I think our
policies oftentimes are cavalier to the
destruction that occurs. A report from Iraq-- and
I met so many people whose family members were
killed by the US military or by the violence
that took place in that time. Also it really elevated
rates of cancer and-- JON STEWART: Sure.  --other indirect
causes of the war. JON STEWART: I'm sure. And it's kind of not-- it's
kind of forgotten, actually. Those people, their lives
go on, but you know, the impact that we had in
a very cavalier moment-- and to us, we kind of--
the news cycle moves on. So but you know,
those memories stay. And it impacts our
ability to operate there or how we're viewed
there in the future. So it's something
which, you know, it's made me very pessimistic
about US foreign policy in the sense that I know many,
at the end of the Cold War, there was an
optimistic view we can make the world a better place. I think that's
true in some cases. But I'm a lot more hesitant
to get the US deeply involved because there's a very
negative track record. JON STEWART: I think there's
a mythology around sort of the Marshall plan. And it's, you know, after
World War II we said. we were in war with
Germany and Japan and we threw a bunch
of money at it. And now we're the best of
friends and they buy our cars and we buy their cars. And it's all lovely. And all it takes
is a little bit of money and some
American know-how and we can turn the
world into allies. I think we might have
learned the wrong message from all that. I'd also say, from reporting
around the world myself, when you talk to people, this
can have the wrong impact. If you have a great
mythology about yourself and how you fix all
the world's problems, then some people will
say, how can the Americans not fix this problem? And they'll notice-- JON STEWART: And
they believe us? People believe us. Son of a-- And I will say
to them, actually, there are a tremendous
number of incredibly well-meaning people
serving our country, trying to do this stuff. It's just really hard.
But-- JON STEWART: Hearts and minds  --there's a certain
story that we've told. And sometimes people really
expect us to make good on it. And there are impossible
promises that we can't keep. JON STEWART: How do you guys
negotiate this pragmatic view within your own families? Because I know within-- you know, there is no-- I can't get five Jews to
agree on anything at dinner. [LAUGHTER] How do you negotiate that
within your own families? You know, I think there's
the personality type that tries to really hear where
people are coming from and speak to-- JON STEWART: How do you get
one of those in your family? [LAUGHTER] Sheer dumb luck or your
dad is a rabbi, in my case. Right. You know, and so that's what
you do, as the rabbi, right? And you're trying to understand
where everyone in the audience is coming from. Your synagogue can be diverse. And there are people
with different political and ideological perspectives. And how do you
tell them the truth and stay true to that,
while also saying-- you know, speaking
to each of them. JON STEWART: Right. And so it's a
type of personality. You see it in different--
there are different kinds of political leaders
and spiritual leaders who manage to do this. And there are others
who feel like, what's the hardest,
sharpest, best viral slogan I can use on
Twitter to own the other side. JON STEWART: Right. And by the way,
when we were younger-- I mean, I won't speak for
you-- we were like that. I was much more hotheaded
when I was younger. JON STEWART: Really?
- Yeah, when we first met-- JON STEWART: You guys seem
the opposite of hotheaded. Like it's--
- We aged a lot. JON STEWART: I honestly-- I feel like I want
this as my screensaver. [LAUGHTER] This is just so
calming to me that I-- [APPLAUSE] What about you? So let me ask you this
then, because that brings up an interesting point. What mitigated the rashness? Was it just youth? What got you guys
less visceral? Yeah, I think getting
older is one aspect of it. But then also, you know,
reading a lot of books, trying to see other
people's-- travel, that has a big impact on I think. Keeping open mind. Trying to treat
others consistently as you want to be treated. Keeping that Golden Rule
in mind as well too. I'll tell you, you know,
you mentioned family. It's interesting because I've
had conversations with family. I have family very spread
out over the world. And you know, certain
experiences can be very resonant with people. I had an uncle who
lives in Pakistan. And you know, he was very
critical of the US war in Afghanistan. He thought that it
was very, very bad. He said-- I think he visited
Kabul and that's kind of what put this in his mind. He said, look, there's
nothing is being built here. It's all falling apart. They're-- didn't
make anything good from their presence there. It's just very exploitative. And then he actually
visited New York one day and he visited the subway
system and he's like, oh, now I get it actually. [LAUGHTER] It's not the-- they're just-- it's not that they
do it on purpose, they just can't do it actually. So you know what I mean? There are moments like that. JON STEWART: That's hilarious.
[LAUGHTER] I mean, you look at-- I mean, this is where we're
getting to the jokes portion, which is hard In this topic. Very hard. And people ask me, like,
how do I conceptualize, like, Hamas has-- what is
it The New York Times says-- 350 to 450 miles of
tunnels underneath Gaza. And it's like, to
think of it this way, it would cost New York
City $648 quadrillion over 268 years to
build that much tunnel. You know, it's just
a really big number. JON STEWART: Well, they
would just raise the price to $1.50 a ride and then-- Problem solved. $2 a ride. I appreciate you both
so much for coming on and having the conversation. And really just
admire both of you, not just for having
this conversation, but your journalism as well. It's really fantastic stuff. So thank you both. Murtaza Hussain
and Yair Rosenberg. [APPLAUSE]"

impulsive mob sometimes symbols get attached to places to cities that are considered sacred some cities wash away sins some are the birthplaces of gods and some serve as the headquarters of a religion but no city in the world has ever played a greater role in the history of a religion as jerusalem has for judaism for christianity and for islam hello and welcome to gravitas plus i'm palki sharma they call it the city of peace yet jerusalem today and has been throughout history a city of conflict it has been destroyed twice fought over 16 times besieged 23 times attacked 52 times and traded hands on many more occasions jerusalem has divided people it has also united them in reverence as a holy land what makes the city so special yet so complex let's break it down for you i'll start with the history jerusalem is old really old 440 years or perhaps longer over the centuries of its existence three major religions have fought for its control judaism christianity and islam the abrahamic religions religions that view abraham as a common forefather a patriarch who is mentioned in all three of their holy books the torah the bible and the quran jews and christians trace their roots to abraham's second son isaac muslims trace their roots to his elder son ishmael their belief in ancestry divides them but jerusalem has been that one unifying force in hebrew it's called yerushalayim the spiritual homeland of the jewish people temple mount in jerusalem is where two biblical jewish temples stood thousands of years ago the western wall within temple mount is said to be the last remnant of those temples today it is considered to be the holiest site in judaism when jews pray they face the western wall in jerusalem just like muslims face the kaaba in mecca jerusalem is also holy for muslims in arabic it is known as al-quds the holy sanctuary home to the al-aqsa mosque the third holiest site in islam after mecca and madina and on top of temple mounts it's the dome of the rock this is where muslims say prophet muhammad ascended to the heavens and lastly in christianity jerusalem is mentioned as salim in the bible an ancient hebrew name that was preserved in its current name jerusalem for christians this city is home to the church of the holy sepulchre this is where jesus was crucified buried and resurrected so for all of these three christians muslims and jews jerusalem holds a sacred and important place but who owns it and this is where things get complicated you see jerusalem belongs to everyone and no one every religion has marked this city and almost every major empire has controlled it but in the words of winston churchill it is the jews that made jerusalem famous how did they do it let me take you further back into history to 135 ce to be exact when the romans drove jews out of jerusalem and renamed their kingdom judea to palestina a greek name meant to break the jewish connection to this land all jews were barred from setting foot in jerusalem but what about the jews where did they go after their exodus from judea they got scattered across the roman empire which is present in europe but they were persecuted wherever they went in the 11th century the jews were slaughtered by the crusaders who considered them to be the killers of jesus christ in the 14th century they were scapegoated as the cause of black death accused of poisoning the wells of christians and slaughtering in the rhine and rhone region their persecution went on till the 19th century and this is when some jews joined forces to protect their identity they launched what is called zionism a religious political and ideological movement which had two aims one was to put an end to the centuries of persecution and two to take jews back to their ancient homeland the zionist believed that judaism was as much a religion as it was a nationality that the jews deserved their own state the same way the french deserved france or the chinese deserve china this movement is what brought jews back to israel today zionism is israel's national ideology towards the end of the 19th century zionism led to a massive jewish immigration to palestine by 1903 at least 30 000 had reestablished themselves in palestine by 1914 40 000 more jews had resettled there then came the first world war the ottoman empire collapsed the british and french empires carved up west asia with the british taking control of the region under the british mandate for palestine at first they allowed jewish immigration but as more jews arrived tensions between jews and arabs grew both sides committed acts of violence both claiming to be the victims so by the 1930s the british began limiting jewish immigration things changed again after the rise of nazi germany 6 million jews were killed in the holocaust the remaining fled to the u.s and palestine in large numbers by 1944 the jewish population in palestine had increased to 33 percent of the total this galvanized much of the western world in support of a jewish state with much of the arab world against it in 1947 a sectarian violence between the arabs and the jews grew the united nations approved a plan to divide british palestine into two separate states one for jews called israel and one for arabs called palestine the city of jerusalem was to become a special international zone since it housed the holy sites of both religions this plan was a colossal failure the british first failed to prevent the violence and then wash their hands of all responsibility they left the land in a mess just as they left india and pakistan after partition the jews accepted the u.n plan on 14th may 1948 they proclaimed independence they formed a new state the palestinians viewed this as theft they accused jews of stealing their land what followed was decades of endless animosity between the jews and the arabs in the last 70 years there have been eight recognized wars two palestinian intifadas or uprisings and a series of armed conflicts israel treated them as do-or-die battles and with each conflict it gained more control of palestine it helps to look at a map to understand this this was israel's map in 1947 it changed to this after the arab israeli war of 1948 to this after the six day war of 1967 and as of 2020 it looked like this with east jerusalem under israeli control and palestinian territories reduced to small ghettos we are in 2021 now and the israel-palestine conflict has resurfaced jerusalem has once again become a city under siege in gaza buildings are shaking streets are crawling with troops and flash bangs are flying overhead it's been called the most intense hostility in years the heaviest offensive since the 2014 gaza war what explains these killings like always a piece of land this time it's sheikh jara a predominantly palestinian neighborhood in east jerusalem you must know about this history too after israel took control of this neighborhood in 1967 settler groups launched legal bids they staked claim on jewish properties properties which they said had been lost in the 1948 arab israeli war israel passed a law to back these claims to justify the takeovers but only if the claimants could furnish proof of their ownership the latest case sought to remove four more families from this contested neighborhood the verdict was expected to be delivered this week but even before the verdict some israelis had already started moving in watch this you are stealing my house and if i don't steal it someone else is going to steal it no no one no one is allowed to steal it if i don't steal it someone else will this video was by far the biggest catalyst in the ongoing conflict it mobilized palestinians who were already complaining of unwarranted restrictions on them during ramazan hamas a palestinian militant group and the de facto governing authority of the gaza strip sensed an opportunity to push the palestinian struggle back on center stage it launched rocket attacks on israel israel responded in kind it's been more than a week the violence has not stopped what will it take to end this violence what will it take for peace to be restored in jerusalem five peace deals could not settle this dispute eight wars could not bury the differences the palestinians say if they drop the weapons they will lose more land the israelis say if they drop the weapons there will be no israel so hamas shoots rockets and israel bombs gaza as jerusalem the city of peace struggles to live up to its name its symbolism lost in its reality
153,bW8efvOK2MY,100 Years of Israel-Palestine Conflict Explained,"The borders of Israel are clearly defined, but the boundaries of Palestine are difficult to establish. Theoretically, Palestine includes the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. However, control over this region is complex and constantly evolving.

Palestine’s history is drenched in bloodshed, displacement, and instability. The conflict has lasted for a century now and is nowhere close to a solution. But why are the two countries locked in a perpetual war? Here's a look back at the 100-year-old history of the Israel-Palestine conflict.

In this eye-opening video, we delve into the complex issue of the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the historical injustices faced by the Jewish population in Middle Eastern countries. We examine how Hamas, the Palestinian militant organization, played a significant role in the escalation of violence by launching attacks on Israel. We discuss the repercussions of these actions and their impact on the people of Gaza.

We also shed light on the historical exodus of Jews from Middle Eastern nations, highlighting how once-thriving Jewish communities have significantly dwindled over the years, leaving us with few traces of their existence in these regions.

Palestinian conflict part two as we speak reports are out that American troops have been attacked repeatedly in the Middle East as war between Israel and Hamas continues Fox news reports that us officials on Tuesday said American troops in the Middle East have been attacked 14 times in the last week American troops in Iraq attacked 10 times according to US Department of Defense spokesperson Air Force Brigadier General Pat Ryder two US defense officials confirmed later on Tuesday the Iran proxy forces fired a rocket at Iraq's an alassad Airbase which houses American troops no injuries or damages reported from that rocket attack however shortly prior to that story Fox news headline reads two dozen American Service members injured in attacks on Iraq and Syria bases according to sycom that report suggest American officials say 24 US service members were injured by attacks in the Middle East last week sycom said those attacks were conducted with drones and Rockets a drone attack at the AL ton Garrison in Syria injured 20 American Personnel on October 18th the same day four other service members were wounded at the al-assad base in Iraq according to the spokesperson all affected service members have returned to D Duty some of the Personnel may have follow-up appointments for additional treatment every step of the way as this story unfolds a tragic story that begins in current events with the terrorist attacks in southern Israel by the terrorists of Hamas I have have sought to ask questions I have sought to understand it is my guard rail the handrail of Sanity on a world that is spiraling towards the insanity of World War II but in order for me to understand to grab that handrail of Sanity I always find it not just important but necessary to look back in history to see how we arrived at this moment they say that those that don't learn from history are destined to repeat the mistakes in the future the mistakes of the past repeated in the future in part one of our history of the Israeli Palestinian conflict I told you that this story from much of my life has been one of a cycle of confusion white noise and ultimately silence as I tuned it out or turned past the newspaper page or scrolled past the website article impossible to keep up impossible to understand too deep de of a dive of History well with this moment in history I found it important to look back into history something that if I were to grab a full understanding of it would require a PhD and years of study but I've done my best to read to listen to what I think is an incredible podcast Fear and Loathing in New Jerusalem published by Daryl Cooper under his handle martyr which I find an valuable and fair resource tracking the history of the Israeli Palestinian conflict in the establishment of the Zion estate of Israel this understanding I'm sure is imperfect I'm sure I'll get some wrong I always welcome your feedback willc podcast fox.com but I am doing my best to try to understand and in our short time together provide some Cliffs notes version of how we arrived at this moment how we arrived at Israel and Hamas in part one we brought you through 1880 to the end of World War I we brought you through the beginnings of the Zionist movement and I talked to you about the concept of identity and tribes the importance for a secure Homeland for Jews far before World War II far before Hitler suffering at the hands of pgms and persecutions across Europe at the hands then of pagans and Christians the beginning of the Zionist movement to take them back to Jerusalem but there they encountered a people while not fully formed in a cohesive identity across the region Arab Muslim people who had lived in that land for 2,000 years what do you do what do you do when someone knocks on your door and said I used to live here I would like Refuge what do you do when that person then in turns attempts to create a political State what do you do when the rest of the world has persecuted you and driven you from your Homeland treated you as a second class Citizen and threatened your wife with rape and your children with murder where do you go what do you do that's the question constantly asked In Fear and Loathing in New Jerusalem by Daryl coer what would you do today we move forward to the period from 1920 to 1948 British mandate Palestine and we show you the beginnings of the Sparks not just of what now today could manifest into World War II but what has already manifested and what seems to be a Perpetual War let us pick up after World War I let us pick up with the British mandate for Palestine after World War I is laid out in our first part of this Israeli Palestinian history the League of Nations the greater International Community LED largely by the British and to some extent the French had divided up the Middle East into the modern concept of nation states they drew lines in the sand and from which they created Syria and Lebanon trans Jordan Iraq but one of those Parcels of land that was designated after World War I what would was what was termed the British mandate for Palestine the British having made promises to the Arabs and the French and the zionists who' already begun their move back into the Middle East set up what we con what a portion of what we know of is the Levant and today what we call Israel and at one time they called Palestine as under the protectorate of Great Britain there they would honor their promise to the zionists to have a home in Palestine that was established after World War I at the tail end of World War I with the Bal for declaration the Bal for declaration established a home in Palestine for the Jews that language very important to the history and the telling we have today about what ultimately sets the Arabs of Palestine and the Jews of what would one day be Israel towards what is an existential fight again this history and this understanding I look at this I don't know I don't know what it tells us about what we're to do today I don't know what it tells us about the proper course of action for Israel I don't know what it tells us about the proper course of action for Arab Palestinians I don't know I know that it probably doesn't lead us to a pretty solution and in fact it may just lead us towards an absolutely horrifically ugly conclusion because it really ends up being and you can see it from its beginning an existential fight for survival we throw that term around what's an existential threat to America what's an existential threat an existential threat is one that is a risk to your entire existence climate change is not an existential threat even the greatest climate change scientists do not think it could end Humanity there is no foreign power not even China that is a true existential threat to the United States of America we're protected by two great oceans we have one of the world's best militaries I happen to believe that China can play a role in the true existential threat to America which is internal that is separating ourselves from our identity because our identity is tied to our values but an existential threat means you no longer remain and when it comes to the Jews and Palestinians in the British mandate for Palestine you can see from the very beginning this was going to be despite all the diplomacy and all the commissions sadly an existential fight let's pick up with the colonization of the Middle East the Zionist after World War I continue populating the Middle East Jews from across Europe primarily Europe Eastern Europe primarily and Russia moving under the threat of persecution and pgms and some as true believers in the concept of Zionism to the British mandate for Palestine it's a safe space it's a refuge for Jews and they begin the true concept of colonization let's talk about who actually started moving to the Middle East and who championed the cause of Zionism and essentially those who those people those actual individuals can be broken up roughly into two camps first one hardore revolutionaries rough young men these were young men tired of walking around persecuted by P pgms tired of being made to eat crow and subject themselves to second class citizen status you know Jews across the world really had no military force had no high office they were living in villages all across Europe on the edge of civilization literally on the edge of town always at threat with their existence doing you know Urban middle class jobs never fully assimilated or accepted at that point into most of these societ ities and then made to feel less than wherever they went this created a group of revolutionaries and revolutionaries were big in the early part of the 20th century and Jews were a big part of the revolutionaries of the 20th century the bolsh the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia Revolutions in Italy Revolutions in Germany everyone was starting to identify with ideology more than kingdoms and aristocracies or even religious territories they're beginning to buy into the ideas of the nation state and as part of that buy into ideologies revolutionaries looking to upend the status quo of the world and the young men that moved to the Middle East that moved to Israel saw this as part of not just their sort of recapturing a veril in manhood and purpose but also exercising a revolution in Zionism they were often lower class they were often uneducated they were also often tough secondarily the zus project was driven by educated intelligencia Urban wealthy mostly socialist thinkers across Europe in London in Poland these were like so many people at that time men who sought again a better world what some sought it in communism some sought it in socialism those two ideologies that time not sympatico with one another others sought it in fascism in fact there were fascist Embraces in Zionism as that movement broke up internally or at least competed politically internally about what would be the future of a political State again no real concept yet of quote unquote Israel but leaders pushing forward a different vision of what it may be to be a Zionist there were some that embraced Italian fascism we'll talk more about individuals like Zev jabotinsky in a moment there were others like H am whum who was the in in essence the intellectual force behind Zionism who was more of the the the the the Thinker the intelligencia the Urbane vision of Zionism and then there's another David benan who I believe the airport is named after in Tel Aviv who was more of the Socialist vision of Zionism he believed in labor Zionism but these two types of camps the Rough and Tumble revolutionary young men and the Socialist Urban intelligencia were the driving forces behind Zionism and as such there were two theories emerging in the 1920s about how to pursue the Zionist state in Israel the first was organic gentle it was acre by acre the idea here was the Jews would move back into the Middle East and start buying up land they would pursue this over time it's clear from the Memoirs of David benan that there was an ultimate objective of morphing into a self-determined state but came first in the literal language of the Bal War declaration a home for Jews in Palestine this was cultural Zionism as we talked about this was buying up land adopting Hebrew is the as the the unifying language sharing customs with one another because remember these were Jews that came from all different places across the globe from Poland from Russia they didn't speak the same language until they all began to relearn Hebrew revive Hebrew they certainly had different customs and ways of life London Jews different than German Jews this was acre by acre slowly developed communities signs were Rewritten into Hebrew languages were adopted Customs shared but when they went around buying up land [Music] they they would find the landowners and they encountered then a people in the Middle East Arabs Who had who lived almost according to Daryl Cooper in the Martyr made podcast of feudal existence with no modern-day conception of land rights what happened was many of these Arabs were living on land owned by someone else they were substenance Farmers although they'd been there for Generations two three generations living in homes that was built by their grandfather or their great-grandfather doing largely the same thing that was done by their ancestors scratching out a living from the dirt um substance farming truly peasants but when Jews moved to the Middle East and began to buy up land under the banner of Zionism and repopulating this land for Jews no one could live there was overl it was not just the overriding sentiment among individuals it was like a charter for many of the organizations that that and funds that accumulated money to help Jews by Lands like the Jewish National Foundation I believe it's called that you couldn't have anybody living on the land but Jews so immediately these Arab peasants were dispossessed disaffected Cooper and his podcast talks about this in much greater detail than I'm capable of this is a cliff notes version but one of the things he does well is we can speak in generalizations like islamism or militant religion or disaffected or dispossessed but when you put it in personal human stories you start to really understand how people can be set in Conflict one another or what it means for someone to all of a sudden go I've got to move off my land and in many cases by the way the land was bought for Jews to live there for Jews but those Jews did not yet exist yet they don't they were they hadn't fully migrated to the British mandate for Palestine so the gland went unused and it went back to to seed and the Arabs were looking at it like why can't you just let me live there I'll I'll make something productive of it like I've done for Generations well this is only for Jews now I mentioned there's several different forms of Zionism cultural political there was also labor Zionism is M that was that was championed and pioneered by David Ben gurian now labor Zionism was not just a socialist movement but it was also a Zionist movement where the idea was you would only in your business or on your land employ Jews you wouldn't employ Arabs now there was a reason for this Beyond simply brute grotesque discrimination it was because they wanted to entice Jews to migrate to the British mandate for Palestine and if you constantly had Arabs who were taking a lower dollar lower wage it was hard to get Jews to move from Poland to the Middle East this was still not like a project that every Jew wanted to take part in some were assimilating into their local cultures some knew it was hard I why would I want to move there and so they essentially created a captured labor force with higher wages by enticing Jews to come and take these jobs and boxing out Arabs and and as you emerged through the 19 19 20s and 1930s this is another thing that disects the local Arab population I'm kicked off my land can't live on the land can't get a job those are reserved for Jews and if I do I have to take a wage again prescribed 30% less then a Jew would be paid for the exact same job this is all going on during the 1920s and 1930s so let's talk about the Arabs for just a moment in the last episode we talked about the UN ing identity of the Jewish Zionist of the of the Jewish religion of the Jewish culture of the Jewish people the Arabs living in the Levant the Arabs living in the Middle East in what would soon become the British mandate for Palestine and will one day become Israel the Arabs living there were tribal they were peasants they were lowly educated low literacy rat and they were disorganized they were poor you know they lived in small feudal Villages and tribes they didn't know what the guy you know or care to Great extent didn't care what a guy 100 miles away was doing much less two or 300 miles away in Syria or in Iraq and so when Jews started showing up it didn't seem like any big thing it was like a little land here a little land there exactly as it was intended by David benan but there was an Arab nationalist movement that was largely centered in Syria at that time we talked about after World War I the lines had been drawn and Syria the northern part of Arabia was given to France now that was a violation of the promise the British had made to the Arabs the Arabs wanted a kingdom an Arabian Kingdom Under King fisel but fisel bowed down ultimately gave in somewhat to the French after a short Skirmish of a war called the Syrian French War but in the process of that war in the early 1920s the Syrian French War again right next door to the British mandate for Palestine you began to create some real radicals within the Islamic movement we take that for granted today you think of the Islamic movement islamism Arabian politics even the Persian politics of Iran you think it's part parcel it's endemic all the way over to Afghanistan the Taliban you think it's part and parcel like this Sharia law hardcore islamism but it wasn't always the case there was a secular Arab movement under fisel and a a secular unified Arab movement represented a threat to the promise that the Brits had made to the zionists they didn't want a unified Arab front so there's many things that both the Brits and the zionists did to undercut the idea of a secular Arab movement a potential secular Arab State they created they they they the British the British were in control at that time it wasn't two parties it wasn't Z it wasn't from 1920s to the early 1940s it wasn't just the Jews and the Palestinians it was the Jews the Palestinians and the British and in the beginning the British were on the side in almost every occurrence although they were good at diplomacy and understanding things on the side of the Zionist and the British were good in their colonial empires of understanding how to subjugate or control a local population and it was largely divide and conquer so they divided the Arab population like they not only undercut the secular movements the Mayors the political entities in the Palestinian areas of the British mandate for Palestine but they actually helped kind of encourage and Empower some of the more radical Islamic elements like the Muti the grand muy of Jerusalem who is Ain al-husseini he's one of the most famous individuals most important individuals of this entire story for the first half of the 20th century but for now understand the Brits and even the zionists played some role in empowering the Islamic elements of the Arab population at the expense of the secular political factions of the Arab population now this is something that's gone done throughout history just so you know we did United States of America has done that we we backed the mulas in Afghanistan including Osama Bin Laden in our fight against the nation state of the Soviet Union we know how that Domino continued to fall we've done it several times as we've empowered powered weak dictators in places like Egypt or Iraq and then at the same time have had money flowing and support behind the scenes to the powers that be that undercut that dictator Benjamin Netanyahu it's famously said it was right here in this podcast with Dave Smith where he brought up the fact that Benjamin Netanyahu modern Israel's leader is on record saying that he believes or he knows that helping along to some extent I'm sure not to the extent that he ever thought he could imagine Hamas was a useful tool in undercutting a unified Palestinian political entity whether or not that's the PLO or fata whatever it may be and bringing together a rival to Israel but like every point in history every time that anyone has flirted with islamism that is a fire they have had trouble putting out Amin Al husani is a formative figure in the early 20th century and what went down in the British mandate for Palestine islamism was really the only available unifying identity for the Arabs they had no working secular political movement they had they were tribal to begin with they had as I mentioned no ties to Bine the only real outlet for Grievances and in the Fulfillment of a commonality of identity against an other and everyone everyone understands that's the nature of identity it is it is foundational to Identity that you are different from someone else that there is another the zionists knew that it's it's core in the in ham Whitman's definition of of what it means to be a Jew and the other is anti-Semitism well now you have another living in your land and what would unify the Arabs and what was increasingly an environment of grievance for them losing land losing jobs well it was the only viable institution that had been empowered by the powers that be and it was the mosque it was the Muti it was an increasingly radical coming out of that French Syrian War merging of islamism and Arab national identity and violence that would become islamism one of the figures that would come out of that uh was a man whose name was kasim he was a militant coming out of that French Syrian War he ended up taking up the C cause of the Palestinians and he became apart from husseini and other like Palestinian Urban thinkers and leaders he became a real populist in the voice of the people he ended up violent revolts against the British against the zionists he ended up dying as a martyr um in battle and he's remained an inspirational figure for Palestinians to this day he's a terrorist let's be clear he was a terrorist but he's an inspirational figure for the Palestinians today the Rockets the Palestinians fire modern day are called kasum Rockets and the I believe some of the terrorist um outfits that conducted these horrible Acts Southern Israel were under the banner of the Kum brigades so he served through his martyrdom as an inspiration for Palestinians now as Palestinians and Arabs begin to take on this identity not just of Arab nationalism not just of tribes and tribal people living in the British mandate for Palestine but begin to take on the identity of radical Islam this runs headon into to the second school of thought for Zionism I told you the first school of thought was acre by acre but there was a second school of thought and these were by the more radical one could say realist but certainly more militant visions of Zionism these were rough men as well that came out of Russia who had fought in wars or in Eastern Europe who understood the nature in essence of man in so many ways I brought up the figure Zev jabotinsky he's a fascinating guy he's the founder of the revisionist party of Israel and I found this quote read by Cooper in his podcast again Fear and Loathing in New Jerusalem absolutely fascinating he gave a 1923 essay called The Iron Wall speech and he said this when it comes to colonization there can be no voluntary agreement between ourselves and the Palestinian Arabs chabinsky wrote it is utterly impossible to obtain the voluntary consent of the Palestinian Arabs for converting Palestine from an Arab country into a country with a Jewish majority everyone should be aware how colonization had taken place everywhere else across the globe the Spanish meeting the Aztecs the American colonist meeting the native Americans there was not one solitary instance of any colonization being carried on with the consent of the native population there is no such precedent the native populations civilized or uncivilized have always stubbornly resisted the colonists irrespective of whether they were civilized or Savage that is jabotinsky saying there is an an inevitability to this there's no peace agreement there's no partition agreement there's no meeting of the minds there's no slow colonization this is all leading us down the same path to the inevitable conclusion of an existential fight and it's hard to argue with satinsky when you look at history show me the singular solitary instance where it hasn't resulted in that existential fight he's right to bring up the Spanish and the Aztecs he's right to bring up the American colon and the Native Americans it's true I say he's right because it's true I'd love to be proven Wrong by history it could provide us a path forward we should take a moment as well talk about the concept of colonization it's become a word that is so charged and quite honestly stupid in modern America we talked about this in the last episode part one of our history of Israel I and the Palestinians but in modern America from sort of the University angle of colonization colonization is just simply a slur it's a dirty word but it's also a proxy when you see college kids today like flying Palestinian Flags free Palestine I don't think they've gone into the history that you and I are going into today I mean some of them have so I don't want to undercut everybody but I don't I don't think most people have what you and I are talking about here together I I'm pretty confident puts us at least in the top 5% of people who know enough or care enough to know about the history of this conflict and again that doesn't insulate me from being wrong again I'm not sitting here tell you I'm the voice of God on this issue I'm just some someone who's simply trying to understand and so are you by proxy of listening to me and that puts us in rare company and I don't think most those college kids know you know when they fly the Palestinian flag they say free Palestine I don't think they know I don't think they know anything about Amin Al husseini I don't think they know anything about you know labor Zionism I don't think they know anything about land purchases I certainly don't think they've ever heard of Zev jabotinsky again some may what they're doing is buying into this modern Robin D'Angelo IX Kendy you know that's the popular tip of the iceberg on a thought process that is critical race Theory vision of the world where colonization essentially means anti-colonial means anti-white it's true it means anti-white and it means anti-western that's what it means so to be a colonialist makes you a white racist shoving down Western values on the globe there's a much deeper conversation by the way about that about whether or not the sharing of Western values is in of itself as we talked about with Douglas Murray the ultimate anti-racist movement these better values that produce better medicine longer lifespans greater Freedom are available to everyone regardless of race with adjustment to culture means you're not encumbered by your biology but that's an interesting conversation about colonization as a concept but you know modern day universities it's like colonization is just anti-white anti-western on the other side I think a lot of conservatives have now taken on the idea that colonization in itself is a there no what what you talk coloniza well look it's a real thing colonization I mean we know that so let's not get overly stupid in response to their stupidity like English pilgrims colonized Virginia Massachusetts it's a Col colonialization effort and then Scots Irish Pioneers pushed West and colonized the Plains and the West the Spanish colonized it's true they set up colonies shared their culture sometimes in violent ways with the native population in Mexico in Central America in South America the French setup colonies in Canada and Louisiana and in Africa and in the Far East in places like Vietnam I mean colonization is a real thing and we can't pretend it's not because some dummies on the other side think it just means anti-west and anti-white but again looking at all of those experiments it's really hard to find to jabotinsky point one example where it did not ultimately mean an existential fight in fact jabotinsky considered it insulting to the native population that you're just going to what you're going to deceive the Arabs they're not going to see you buying their land they're not going to see you kicking them out or boxing them out of jobs like whether or not they're savage or civilized whether not they're smart or dumb whether not they're 500 years behind us on the progress scale or even they're going to see that they are losing their land that's what jabotinsky said to his fellow zionists they're going to see and it's going to be a big deal to them they're going to have a problem everyone knew that by the way every single Zionist so me laying out to you what happened in the 1920s and 1930s is just historical fact and not only historical fact it is a fact recognized by the main characters of the time period it was recognized by benguan it was recognized by whitesman it was recognized by atinsky that's fact that's not picking sides it's not skewing facts I don't know how it can be painted I'm sure in some way it can I'm open to that criticism to revisit it but it's I certainly have read the words of benguan I've read the words of whitesman I've read the words of jabotinsky and jabotinsky as the hardcore found of the revisionist party which I think ultimately led to the luced party which is Netanyahu was just honest about it in his estimation I'm just telling you what's going to happen guys this is going to lead to this we are colon in their land they are going to push back interestingly zabinsky also believed that Arabs should have full rights within Israel that they should be equal citizens more complicated figure than simply The Brute realist also free market by the way not socialist brute realist more complicated than just simply the guy who saw this was an existential fight but this is all coming down the highway of History all that set against the backdrop where Arabs begin to chafe under Zionism in 1920 there's an uh there's a riot the nebim Musa riots I mean Al Hussein is behind a lot of these things as it turns out after the nebbi Musa riots um where I it's hard to keep up with how many got killed but in what it turns out to be historical terms not as many as what we' soon see dozens on both sides killed after that the British remember now the British are in charge they boot out Amin alosi you're gone you help you help do this but you know what you're out too Zev jab jabotinsky you're gone he was seen as a provocator an aggressor what going going on because while the Arabs Revolt in 1920 at neb Musa they Revolt again in 1929 riots now we're ramping up now we're ramp in up some serious violence hundreds now killed and hin and Jaffa and Arabs doing horrific things that actually really rival what we just saw in southern Israel like this was a true PGM like what we saw on October 7th horrible mutilations and rapes and killings now understanding history is not the same as forgiving history a lot of people consider 1929 in those rights the years zero of the Israeli Palestinian conflict like that's when the fire started Sparks before that's when the fire started and it moved forward the big one kasum was killed in 35 becomes a martyr the Arabs still continue to Rally they get more concerned more mad now in response to a weapon shipment they discovered coming in by the Zionist under the nose of the British in 1936 they start the Arab Revolt it first starts as a general stri but then inspired by there are terrorists there are whatever revolutionaries Freedom Fighters in the Arab Hills who are conducting Terror on citizens and now the whole world's looking at it going whoa whoa what's happening in British mandate for palestin this is bad news and then the Zionist in response they radicalize as well Zab after the 19 uh 20 riots when jabotinsky had sort of been banished from the British mandate for Palestine they started the the hagana I believe I'm saying that's right but it's like a Israeli response Force to any Arab terrorism then there was the urgan which was another which eventually was classified I believe as a terrorist organization I think I think uh Albert Einstein called it a right-wing fascist Terror organization chauvinistic Terror organization then the British sort of empowered the the special KN forces and in response to all this Arab terrorism the British again backing the Zionist at that time but trying to mediate some peace but when push comes to shove it's the British Empire just destroyed the Palestinian Arab Revolt from 36 to 39 by most stats I read this Wikipedia something like 10% of the Arab population of young men aged 20 to 60 fighting age capable fighting was wiped out killed either killed injured or exiled done with out of the equation so you arrive in 1939 and you now have an untenable situation for the Brits an untenable situation for the Arabs an increasingly untenable situation under the under the Yoke of Terror for the zionists and you now sitting there in the late 1930s have three events that set you up for the rest of the 20th century they are as follows one the peel commission this is in 1939 the peel commission is one of several commissions and attempts to finally say okay we're going to partition this we're going to give part of the land to the Arabs and part of the land to the Jews we're going to break this land up and it required Mass migration largely by the Arabs but some by the Jews as well out of lands where they lived into other areas this was a as it always was a fight for political representation and land but political representation was a dicey proposition because what did you mean by that did you mean democracy because remember now while Jews were moving to Israel they were still a minority moving to the British mandate for Palestine they were still a minority Arabs outnumbered them so you going to have a democracy but it was the first time to start looking at land and start partitioning up and it wasn't accepted it wasn't accepted by the Arabs and it wasn't accepted by the Jews the peel commission number two this is formidable the 1939 white paper it was a it was a it was a commission and diplomatic um paper put together in Britain remember now this is run by the Brits where they said the following this was huge they said there would be political representation for the Arabs they said that the Bal for declaration promised a home in the British mandate for Palestine for Jews they made clear in the 1939 white paper it it did not mean that the British mandate for Palestine would become a Jewish state in no uncertain terms they said they did not consider that you would drive everyone out who is not Jewish and turn this in to a Jewish political entity a Jewish state but rather you have a protected home in Palestine and from that everything falls apart the zionists are now mad at the Brits the Arabs are unhappy with the peel commission everybody is unhappy it's 1939 and you know what is beginning in Europe the third big event Hitler begins his program to First ethnically cleanse and then commit genocide on Jews in Europe in that podcast martyr made he talks about the rest of the world at this point there has to be a safe haven there has to be a refuge for Jews but for all of there we're going to control the world the Brits the French the Americans did not take in Jewish refugees from Europe in great numbers they limited the numbers by the way the Brits did to appease the Arabs the number of Jewish refugees to Palestine 15,000 a year the 1939 white paper presented 75,000 total limited immigration land partition political representation and now a flood of Jews fleeing a genocidal Maniac in Europe but the rest of the world does not open their doors and everyone's looking at Palestine the British mandate for Palestine as the place where Jews can and should go find their safe haven and that brings you to the doorstep of War oh I know I know World War yes we understand Hitler France Great Britain America no not just that war that's World War but the doorstep of Perpetual War I'm talking about zionists against Brits zionists against Palestinians Arabs against zionists Israel against the greater Middle East and of course all set against the backdrop of world war in Europe in part three we will now move forward from World War II the establishment of the state of Israel to modern day a period of time defined by Perpetual War I hope that provides you some understanding I'm not sure it provides you a solution I'm not sure where it leads you in terms of a conclusion I know not a pretty one but what I hope this illustrates is whether or not it was by design by implication or by inevitability what you were looking at there was an existential fight between Jews and Arabs for a home Story number three the Texas Rangers are in the World Series How Sweet It Is Mark it down as one of the best sports experiences already of my life I started thinking about this like how many championships have I got to root for in my lifetime I have the three times the Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl in the 1990s I was alive for their run in the 19 some of their run in the 1970s but I don't remember I had the three Cowboys runs in the 1990s I have the Dallas Mavericks in 2006 a championship in which they lost or were robbed by NBA referees and I have the Dallas Mavericks in 2011 one of the sweetest experiences of my sporting fandom life I have the 2005 Texas Longhorns under Vince Young also one of my favorite experiences also have the 2009 Longhorns who lost to the Alabama Crimson Tide and then I have the 2010 and 2011 Texas Rangers I don't like talking about 2011 because it's one of the most crushing Sports losses of my life that in the 2006 Mavericks but the 2011 Rangers are the top of the- mountain of worst Sports fandom moments of my life but we're back and it's the 2023 Texas Rangers that means in my lifetime I've had three rangers Championship opportunities two Mavericks championship opportunities and three Cowboys championship opportunities along with two Texas Longhorn Texas football championship opportunities these things don't come along that often I mean what's this 3 six 8 10 that's 10 between four programs right now if you're from Boston I don't even want to hear from you I don't I want to hear from you Boston I mean 10 between four programs I'm 48 years old I mean it's about one every five years but it doesn't feel that way and this is exercising demons this is exercising the Demons of the Houston Astros can we take a minute to talk about the Houston Astros Houston Astros what a wonderful rivalry Astros fans I'm glad you're there I don't I can't say I love you but I'm glad that we have you just like these tribal things we're talking about you need another you're our other in baseball we need you you hate us we hate you you hate adus Garcia I just wouldn't boo him any longer because he's gonna elomi is gonna hit bombs but I'm glad you're there and I think it's interesting how many people hate the Astros I mean look at it in any comment section talk about it around a bonfire everybody brings up cheating and everybody hates the Astros and it amazes me to think about that when you see the story right now about the University of Michigan football program have you seen that Michigan is accused of cheating stealing signs the story is that they had some graduate assistant student go around buy tickets at 11 different stadiums where Michigan would soon play sit there with a cell phone at the 50 yard line bought the tickets on his own credit card and video the other team's signs signs so that he could steal their signs and then they show him on the sidelines later in the Ohio State game there's a video of this where all the Ohio State players are looking to the sidelines looking for a sign and all you can see all the Michigan players on the opposite Sidelines looking as well and the minute they get it the Ohio State guys turn back to the line of scrimmage and the Michigan guys all start pointing pass pass pass it's a pass like so they've stolen the signs and everybody's comparing this to spy gate and deflate gate and the Houston Astros but I think I think Dion sand I'm not outraged by this story out of Michigan and I think Dion Sanders head coach of Colorado put it well he said look it's not like baseball he like in football you can steal all the signs and quite honestly everybody does Matt rule head coach at Nebraska said the same thing Steve sarkeesian Texas everybody steals signs but in football ultimately Deion Sanders said I could give you the Playbook but you still got to stop it it only has so much of an impact in football I mean I if you can read a defense or if a defense can read an offense but Larry Allen Hall of Fame offensive lineman for the Dallas Cowboys they say they tell this story he used to have a huge dip in I think he had a dip in during games and Larry Allen like who could bench press him million pounds everybody say strong he used to walk up to the line of scrimmage I think it's the Green Bay Packers who've talked about this and he would go cho cho coming right behind me right at you meaning EMT is running right behind me Bank it good luck stopping it those 90s Cowboys third and seven everyone knew what they were going to do they were going to throw it to Michael Irvin on a slant stop it football's about that it's brute man- on man you got the battle plans win the battle you have to win I'm just it's not and Dion said it's not like baseball if I know a curve Ball's coming I got your number and everybody hates the Astros as compared to how I feel about Michigan I guess probably because of the level of Technology the Astros use I don't know something gross about banging a trash can but using out filing signals and and the Astros won that's another thing they won but it does put it in a different bucket I mean there's cheaters in baseball all throughout its history scuffing balls steroids sticky stuff I can't pretend like cheating is not part of baseball but it's more it seems more impactful than sign stealing in football and everybody hates the Astros so in beating you which I'm glad you're there we exercise the Rangers that demon we exercise 2010 lost to the San Francisco Giants that's gone because now we have Bruce bochi who's got to be the best manager in baseball 2011 I told you I don't want to talk about that St Louis Cardinals one strike away twice but I don't want to talk about it we're exercising Demons of a franchise nobody cares about and that's how baseball is nobody cares about any franchise but their own a franchise nobody cares about the Texas Rangers I think I'm not want to get ahead of myself set for this to become a long-term run deg Grom comes back Scherzer comes back Wyatt langford's a stud rookie who hasn't even gotten there yet Evan Carter will be a full rookie next year I'm just getting excited and I need to stop because live in the moment live in the present live in the now we're going to win a World Series and as I record this I don't know if that's going to be the Phillies or the Diamondbacks but forget all that I said in the past episodes I'm not I can't just be happy we got there anymore now we're too close I'm at the Finish Line I can't just say well we ran a good race no you got to win break through the tape you took down the Astros you got adus Garcia you got Cy Seager go win the World Series and maybe maybe I'll stay up and watch every pitch and maybe maybe I'll be on Fox and

(Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe) 

And growing desperation has led to even more tragedy near Gaza City. 

Palestinian health officials say Israeli troops opened fire on a crowd waiting for food aid, killing 112 people and injuring 760 others.

It happened at around 4am local time as a convoy of aid trucks moved north along Al-Rashid Street, passing through an Israeli checkpoint near Nabulsi roundabout. 

Israeli officials acknowledge their troops opened fire, but say many people were trampled on or run over after storming the aid trucks.

Hamas is warning that it could jeopardise the ceasefire talks in Qatar.

numbers show the death toll has now passed 30,000 people and growing desperation has led to even more tragedy near Gaza City Palestinian Health officials say Israeli troops open fire on a crowd waiting for food Aid killing 112 people and injuring 760 others it happened at around 4:00 a.m. local time as a convoy of Aid trucks moved North along Al Rashid Street passing through an Israeli checkpoint near nuli roundabout Israeli officials acknowledged their troops open fire but say many people were trampled on or run over after storming the aid trucks Hamas is warning that it could jeopardize the ceasefire talks going on in Qatar our International editor Lindsay Hilson reports from Jerusalem desperate scenes at Kamal Edan Hospital in jabalia as dozens of injured people were brought in after a crowd rushed Aid trucks in the early hours of the morning and were reportedly shot by Israeli soldiers what happened was that yesterday we received information that Aid would be dropped in the duli roundabout area all the people from the northern Gaza Strip were there with us heading to the same place then at 5 to 4: we were surprised by Israeli tanks that came out and opened on people randomly and directly immediately afterward all we found were Martyrs the injured and the wounded scattered on the ground in a chaotic and horrifying manner the dead and injured were transported by donkey cart and stretcher along the Beach Road where the truck Convoy had been moving it seems more likely that they were victims of small arms than tank rounds probably fired from a nearby Israel Defense Forces checkpoint the IDF has a different version of events they've released edited Drone footage that they say shows people climbing over the trucks and claim that the motionless people on the ground died in a stampede or by being run over they say later in a separate incident their soldiers shot people who refused to turn back when warned not to approach a checkpoint this contradicts eyewitness reports some of the inured were taken to alifa hospital in Gaza City their testimony and that of other eyewitnesses is similar to those at Kamal edwan hospital we ran towards the food a to get some the soldiers and tanks fired at us the people in the front and the back were shot some in the hands others in the legs we left the food Aid and ran an injured man at alifa hospital says they were shot at twice after they stopped shooting we went back to get our Aid by the time I got flour and some canned goods and took it down from the truck they shot at us they shot me and the truck driver left and ran over my leg social media footage shows that similar recent convoys have been mobbed too people are desperate to get food for their hungry children the police no longer dare guard Aid trucks because they fear Israel will Target them as part of Hamas no wonder Law and Order is breaking down the hospitals treating today's victims are barely functioning medical supplies like food are scarce partly because Israel isn't allowing enough in especially to the north of the strip and partly because of the lack of security for Aid convoys you can be shot or starve or succumb to your injuries so many ways to die in Gaza we're really talking about two separate issues here the first is did the Israeli Defense Forces fire into a crowd of unarmed desperate hungry gazan civilians if they did and they deny it then that is potentially a war crime and that is very serious obviously and what was said on the ground and what the Israeli Defense Forces have said to us completely contradicts each other but there's another issue there's a context for this and that is why people are so desperate I've been talking to senior un officials over the last two days this is what they tell me that they have not been able to get any Aid trucks into Northern Gaza for more than a month now and that means that malnutrition rates are absolutely Skyrocket rocketing they have never seen malnutrition rates go up so quickly amongst children what that means is that the children's parents are absolutely desperate at the same time because Hamas is no longer a government there and because the police have melted away because they're afraid of being targeted there is no security there is no security for the trucks that's why the trucks get mobbed people who are desperate for food to feed their children there's no one to stop them doing this and that's what anyone would do that's what you would do if your family was starving and there was no law and order to stop you and if there is no ceasefire these officials say and if more Aid doesn't get in very quickly we're going to see more terrible incidents and more deaths Lindsay Hilson in Jerusalem well in a minute we hope to be speaking to the IDF live but earlier I spoke to Aaron David Miller a senior fellow at the carnegi Endowment for International Peace and a former State Department Diplomat who spent decades negotiating for peace in the Middle East I began by asking how an event like today to's killing of gazans waiting for food could impact the ceasefire talks going on right now it is the two combatants that determine the trajectory the intensity and the prospects for deescalation in this conflict and frankly right now I see very little urgency on the part of either Hamas or Israel to come to a quick agreement uh in large part because the issues surrounding what would lead to an agreement have little or nothing to do with what happened on the ground on the ground in Gaza today in that sense it may actually uh complicate matters Hamas May well decide to let the uh public relations nightmare that this is going to cause for the Israelis to play out a little longer hoping that it will increase pressure from the Biden Administration on the Nano government to push for more favorable terms uh for a prisoner for hostage release so I don't expect this incident frankly to to operate uh in a positive way are these talks though going on on two levels you know on one level they are there to bring about a ceasefire right now and get the hostages out but they're also aimed at a longer term settlement and presumably Hamas want to increase the pressure for serious two-state solution talks I don't think Hamas is any interest um in a two-state solution I think what Hamas wants basically is to survive this uh to release as many Palestinian prisoners particularly security prisoners with blood on their hands hoping that International pressure will Mount to create a situation where the Israelis will be forced to withdraw from densely populated areas in Gaza or from the Gaza Strip entirely so so again even if you get by Ramadan March 10 uh a prisoner hostage exchange it's only an interim limited exchange I fear that this conflict is going to continue uh for months and and how do you think the United States uh and the Middle Eastern players uh in Qatar should be treating Iran right now where I'm speaking to you from where tonight's event is being portrayed there's another chapter in genocide where they talk about the West as enablers um of that genocide and deniers of the of the truth I mean is there any way that this nation can seriously interface with the United States at talks I don't think so um I think that any sort of transformational uh change in the US Iranian relation is not will not be possible the best the US and Iran can do is to come to limited understandings what I would call transactional agreements to manage the conflict and prevent uh what I think neither wants which is an allout military confrontation clearly the Iranians don't want that and I don't think the bid Administration wants it as well so with Iran it's a management exercise and I'm afraid it has its ups and its Downs Adon David Miller thank you very much appreciate it thanks for having me with joining me now from Tel Aviv is leftenant Colonel Peter Lerner a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces leftenant Colonel eyewitnesses say that more than a 100 Palestinians died when Israeli soldiers fired on numerous occasions into a crowd do you take responsibility for those deaths no of course not because those claims are blatantly lies um the IDF conducted a humanitarian operation this morning in order to assist and facilitate the movement of Food Supplies as we have have been doing over the last four days in similar in a similar manner um the supplies went in passed through our our positions and then continued to move forward where a mob stormed the the um the Convoy bringing it to at some state to a halt but in the state of chaos on the site people were being pushed U trampled and in some cases run over when you say do you mean starving people who have been deprived of food because you haven't let the aid in the UN officials told us that no Aid has been allowed into Northern Gaza for more than a month the UN obviously aren't up to date on their information the last four days convoys like we conducted this morning uh this morning was 38 truckloads passed into Northern Gaza to distribute Food Supplies which are international donations um but on private vehicles that were conducting the Convoy into in Northern Gaza so multiple say some Aid is going in but not nearly enough and you spoke of a mob I want to put to you what saved the children said they said while children die from lack of food their parents are killed trying to get it for them that's the reality isn't it these are starving people desperate for anything they can get their hands on Kathy the incident at the on the Convoy this morning was nothing to do with Israel the IDF secured the it went through and it got out of hand on the ground as people were looting the trucks troops fired your troops fired shots no there were warning shots fired and then when it got out of hand the forces retreated back into the formation along the um the G Gaza Wadi area it was that was not true that is just a blatant lie that is absolutely inaccurate so why do you think people are so angry then I think there is a lot of things that are going on in these days and of course there is a dire situation in the Gaza Strip a human tragedy and that is precisely why we are facilitating humanitarian actions like this morning or the airdrops of suppliers into Gaza both in the north and in the South or the continued access and movement through Rafa or through Karam Shalom Crossing of course there's a lot of frustration there's a lot of frustration precisely because Hamas launched the war on the 7th of October and now is hiding behind the people of Gaza but you are now responsible for LA and order in Gaza and Law and Order has broken down and that is on you isn't it no the reality is one where we are still in a combat zone and indeed there are civilians in that area and we are doing everything in order to distinguish in order to um conduct our operations based on the military necessity while we get people out of Harm's Way while we try and supply and facilitate the access of humanitarian goods and the reality is one which it will be continue to be extremely challenging I would argue that there has been no um similar operation similar War conditions similar Urban environment Warfare uh in in modern history and Israel is facing a huge challenge absolutely you are still in turning to press ahead with an invasion in Rafa in the South there are 1.4 million people trapped there no humanitarian evacuation plan can redistribute those people in an area that you've bombed in the North Kathy there are 134 Israelis that remain in the clutches of Hamas the war can end tonight we don't need to wait they can release the hostages bring them home um unconditionally surrender so that they do not have that power of government to launch another 7th of October and the war could be over what we know from our rescue operation two weeks ago is that there are hostages in Rafa there are fighters in Rafa they conducted our operation was conducted of extensive fire million civilians there too and and indeed we've presented to the government to the Prime Minister our operational plan and evacuation evacuation plan and indeed in if we if and when we need to mobilize uh the instructions will be given to the population to evacuate from the dations that we need to operate in leftenant Colonel Peter larner thank you very much"

158,trEgxKWpviU,From Nazism to the Creation of Israel: from One Exile to Another,"In 1948, the State of Israel was created. For Jews around the world, it is the end of 2000 years of exile. For the 700,000 Palestinians present on these lands, this is the beginning of injustice.

of great violence and of which no one sees the end. The story of a hatred
between two nations who have been fighting
over the same land for decades. Suicide attacks. Air raids. Urban guerilla. Every day, the powder keg
in the Middle East threatens peace. This conflict, which no one understands
 anymore, started a century ago. It is this story
we are going to tell you. Why did some Jews decide to
return to Israel, the ancient kingdom of Judea after 2,000 years of exile? Why did they fight
the British colonial troops? How did they impose themselves against the Arabs of Palestine? Just a few years after suffering one of the greatest traumas
the world has ever known, Nazism. For years, movie lovers filmed their adventures. Jews. Arabs. Their films testify the violence, but also their daily lives, their hopes and their dreams. We found these amateur films for you. With Bärbel and Ella Weiler, two little German Jews who narrowly escaped Nazi persecution
 with their parents. With the Katz family, Jews from Eastern Europe
who endured the genocide before illegally joining
the State of Israel. With the Arens, Zionist activists. We will tell you about the tragedy and the odyssey of the Jewish people
in the 20th century. We will also see the Saïd family, Arabs from Jerusalem. With the Kouri in the city of Jaffa, as well as several actors
of the Palestinian drama. We will follow them in their revolt and on the roads of exile. From Hitler's accession
to power in 1933 to the establishment of
the State of Israel in 1948, a look back at these 15 crucial years
 which marked the world and which continue
to influence its destiny today. Berlin. The year is 1933, April. Hitler has been in power
for two months. Germany's new leader is
an obsessive antisemite. He accuses Jews of dominating
the world and exploiting it. He said to one of his deputies: “The economy is completely
dominated by Jews.” “It is their universal empire,"" ""which they have extended
over all kingdoms.” ""The fight between
them and us begins."" “What's at stake is simply
the destiny of the world.” A month later,
Hitler attacks writers. He organizes nocturnal ceremonies where books written by
the Communists and the Jews are burned. Hitler entrusted the head of propaganda,
 Joseph Goebbels, with converting the German people
to his theories. German men and women, the era of absolute rule by Jewish intellectuals
is coming to an end. The success of the German Revolution made it possible
to liberate the country. Now is the time of the German man. Ten years earlier, simply a far-right activist,
Goebbels wrote in his journal: “I hate the Jew by instinct
and by reason.” “It's poisoning us.” “It's hateful and repugnant to me,” “from the bottom of my soul.” At the same time in the vicinity of Berlin. Meet the Weilers, a small
German Jewish family vacationing by the lakes. They are Hitler's enemies. The father, Friedrich,
is holding the camera. He's filming his wife Hilse and the two little girls they had, Ella and Bärbel. He is an image enthusiast. He gives his daughters a camera so that they immortalize
family happiness. In their country house, Bärbel and Ella live
a cloudless childhood like all little German girls
of their age. It is paradise. We are all together. My mom is the best mom
in the world. And my dad is the strongest. He's a former soldier. He received the Iron Cross
during the First World War, but for some time he has been saying
 that he wants to leave Germany. From the window of
the family apartment, Little Ella recently attended
a Nazi parade. I am afraid of soldiers
parading in the street. Dad explained to me that
they were dangerous. They sing, they walk at pace in black boots. Just seeing them is horrible. The Weilers are very integrated
into German society. Little Ella goes to public school,
but she is the only Jew in her class, and since the Nazis came to power,
she feels more and more isolated. The other children come up to me
and say: Jewish! Jewish! My teacher likes Nazis. He explained to my father that Jews are not allowed
to have very good grades. I don't want to go 
to class anymore. Designated as public enemies, the Jews are, however,
very few in Germany. Less than 1% of the population. Less than 1% in France as well, where, despite the extreme right,
one of them, Léon Blum, is preparing to form
a leftist government, the Popular Front In Western Europe, most Jews are perfectly integrated. They obtained equal rights with
other citizens in the 19th century. Some of them,
like Sigmund Freud, the inventor of psychoanalysis 
or the physicist Albert Einstein, are among the great figures
of Western culture. In fact, of the 11 million Jews in Europe, most are elsewhere. They are in the East. Look at this exceptional document, shot when Hitler came to power. This world has completely
disappeared. We are in Munkacs in Czechoslovakia. Here, Jews make up almost
half of the population. They live in community. By practicing small trades and in the cult of their
thousand-year-old tradition. Some of them, religious Jews, dress in clothes inherited from
the 18th century. They have their
own language: Yiddish. And 3,000 years after Moses, they continue
 to recite the prayers of the Hebrews. Communities out of time, far from the great upheavals
of the world and at the center of which
is the rabbi. Here, wearing a fur hat. Keep doing Shabbat. Listen to me, stick to Shabbat
and everything will be fine. Say the prayers We don't have the right to do less,
it's important. In 1933, the Jews of Munkacs are far from
imagining that in barely 15 years, their community will have been
almost entirely exterminated. However, Jews have lived
in fear for centuries. Traditionally in Europe, they are held responsible for all the
 misfortunes that affect the population. They are accused of living off
the work of others. Of being parasites. And of belonging
to an impure race. Above all, Christians consider them
responsible for the death of Christ, 2,000 years ago. Absurd accusations
that fuel hatred and cause outbreaks of violence. Massacres that
we call pogroms, “thunder” in Russian. The last wave of pogroms dates
back to the end of the 14-18 War when thousands of
Ukrainian nationalists stormed Jewish neighborhoods
and massacred tens of thousands of people. An investigator,
Léo Motzkin testifies. Old people and children
have been cut into pieces. Thousands of women
have been raped. Victims have been mutilated
in the most atrocious way. Their right arms and
left legs were cut off, or vice versa. Here, the moral state
of the Jewish population approaches dementia. In Eastern Europe, more and more Jewish families are now considering
moving abroad. This is the case in Kaunas, in Lithuania,
for the Katz family. Traders who are also very
integrated into local society and have been living in the country
for around 50 years. This family movie dates from the year
1929, before Hitler came to power. Here are the grandparents,
Vasya and her husband Zemar. They are walking on the boulevards
with their grandson. Zvi, who is three years old. Deloliya and Yitzhak,
the parents. All we have left is
this beautiful photograph of the year of their marriage. Their eldest daughter is 16. Her name is Dita. She perceives more and more
anguish in her own family. I have heard about the pogroms
in Poland and Ukraine. My dad recently said
to my grandfather: ""Take our money"" ""and take the whole family
away from here"" ""because the Lithuanians will soon
throw the children out of the windows."" We are advised to leave, but I don't want to. Everyone loves me here, and life is so good for me. 200 kilometers away, the same year. We are in Riga, the capital of Latvia. This is the Arens family,
bourgeois Jews like the Katz. They own a small
confectionery factory. They also film
family members at home. with one of the very first
personal cameras. Same superficial smiles,
same apparent good humor. However, among the Arens, some have already made
the decision to leave the country. This is the case for this 16-year-old boy,
who teases his cousins on camera. His name is Mickaël. As this photo shows, Mickaël Arens, here,
in uniform, belongs to a youth organization. He is one of these Jewish activists we see more and more
in Eastern Europe in village squares. They are called the Zionists. They adopted an anthem, The HaTikvah. Which means hope in Hebrew. Their hope is to reach Palestine on the other side
of the Mediterranean and to settle here,
on the hill of Zion, in Jerusalem, the ancient capital
of the Jews. Zionism was born
in the 19th century, long before Hitler. For the founder of the
Theodor Herzl movement, the Jews will always
be under threat wherever they are. Whether they integrate
into society or live as a minority according to their tradition. They must therefore constitute
themselves as a nation and found their own country where they can
defend themselves. Physical training, Hebrew lessons, before their departure
for the land of their ancestors, thousands of young Jews
are cared for and trained. They learn agriculture
on Zionist farms. They are the future pioneers of Israel. In the early 1930s, Mickaël joined one of these farms
with his group, Betar, a radical Zionist movement. We will sleep
in the tent. We sing. We're training. For us, it is a necessity to fight because we all share
a love for Palestine. This land which is
part of our history. In the 1930s, The Middle East was
shared by the great powers. After the First World War, France was given control
of Lebanon and Syria. Already present in Egypt, Great Britain administers
Transjordan and Palestine. In 1917, with the Balfour Declaration, Great Britain officially opens
the doors of Palestine to Jews. Each year Thousands of them land in the
 promised land with their families and whatever they were
able to take with them. They join a small local community which has never left the region and which has never stopped praying
 here, in front of the Wailing Wall. It is the cradle of Judaism. The last remnant of the temple
built 2,000 years ago by Herod, the king of the Jews. The temple was destroyed
by the Romans, all that is left today are
the surrounding walls. A few meters above the wall, the Muslims have built one of their
most beautiful religious buildings. According to the Koran, The Prophet Mohammed gained
paradise here in the seventh century AD. It was also in Jerusalem
where Christianity was born. Each year, thousands of people
go on a pilgrimage to the site of Jesus' death. It is on this thrice holy land where the Zionists intend to
implement their project. Founding their new homeland and settle permanently. All over Palestine, they found a new type
of agricultural villages, the kibbutz. In one of them is
a young Polish Jew, Joel Iglinskiy. I had no future in Poland. Here, we are a big family. We are going back to farming
as in the Bible. Men and women,
we work all day while our children are in daycare. On the kibbutz,
we are all equal, we share everything. Everyone pays their salary
to the community and we make all of our decisions
 together. For these young idealists
from the depths of Europe, the experience is unique. With his comrades, Joël Iglinskiy simply intends
to build a different world. We are committed
to building socialism. The red flag flies
on the kibbutz. We admire Herzl,
Léon Blum, and Marx. We are revolutionaries and we know that
we will change the world. On site, the inhabitants who witness
the arrival of the Jews wonder. What do the Zionists want? How far will the colonization
of land go? Why are they coming to Palestine? In the 1930s, the Arabs of Palestine
numbered one million. They represent two thirds
of the population and are spread throughout
the territory in hundreds of towns
and villages. They are called Palestinians in memory of the Philistine people in antiquity. Before the arrival of the British, they lived under
the empire of the Turks for four centuries. Watch these color images shot
at the beginning of the 20th century. Their oriental culture
has always fascinated visitors. Some of them are Bedouins. They live in the desert
with their herds, but most of them are peasants. They work for great
Arab landowners, like here, on the coastal plain, where the famous Jaffa oranges
are produced. They are exported
 all over the world. For several years now, some Arab owners have agree
to sell their land to the Zionists. And little by little, the face of Palestine is changing. In 1935, Jews already represented
30% of the population, they created dozens of villages
along the coast and in the north. This does not prevent
most Arab families from living the pre-war years
without mistrust and in a certain welfare. This is the case, in Jerusalem,
for the Saïd family. Christian Arabs who own
a publishing house. Filmed by his father
during summer vacation, this boy is called Edward. He is the future Palestinian writer
 Edward Saïd. Our family home was in Talbiya, a neighborhood of
Palestinian Christians like us. The imposing two-storey villa
had many bedrooms and a lovely garden in which
my two younger cousins, my sisters and I could play. It was an idyllic time. On their family movie, nothing yet suggests
that this idyllic period is about to end. At the same time, in Germany. The situation becomes
dramatic for the Jews. The Nazis who seek to create
an ethnically pure country, multiplied provocations and anti-Semitic inscriptions
are spread throughout the country. On the trams and even on public benches. on public benches. At the Nuremberg Congress in 1935, the Nazis officially exclude Jews
from the national community. Among German Jews,
panic begins to set in and more and more people
are seeking to flee abroad, to France, Great Britain, or the United States. This is where a Jewish community
of 4 million people already lives. But visas for Western countries
are granted in dribs and drabs. Thus, more than 100,000 German Jews
 choose Palestine where the doors of immigration
are still open to them. A hundred Jewish families
arrive in Palestine aboard the Mariette Pacha, of the
 Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes. Most of them are
in absolute poverty, the laws of the Reich prohibiting Jews
 from transferring their property. The Zionist associations welcome
these unfortunate people and give them the means
to rebuild their lives. Among the passengers on the
Mariette Pacha are the Weilers, our Jewish family from Berlin. Unlike the other passengers, the Weilers come
as simple visitors. Without knowing yet whether
they will settle in Palestine with their two little girls and leave Germany definitively. They continue to film
with their personal cameras. To convince his wife, Friedrich Weiler
 shows her around the country. He takes her to the shores
of the Dead Sea. They visit Tel Aviv, the Jewish metropolis
of 130,000 inhabitants, emerged from the ground
in less than 20 years. They visit German friends
who are already settled there. However, after a week of travel, they are still hesitant
to take the plunge. In Jerusalem, they found a city in turmoil, close to revolt. At the call of the grand mufti, Palestinian Arabs demonstrate
against British occupier and its policy favorable
to the mass arrival of Jews. One of their spokespeople explains. Since the beginning
of the 1930s, demonstrations follow
one another in Palestine. Getting more and more violent. Attacks on kibbutz, attacks in the middle of the street. In 1936, what is called the Great
Arab Revolt finally broke out. One of its leaders is called
Fawzi al-Qawuqji. He launched the guerrilla war
against the British army. We rebel against injustice, against Zionism, to defend our Holy Land. The English abused Arab blood. Today, we are ready
to face them. In a few months, the revolt
spreads all over Palestine and forces the British
to send reinforcements. The repression is relentless. Like here, in Jaffa where a neighborhood
is emptied of its inhabitants and razed. It takes the British army two years
to put down the revolt, but it's only temporary. In 1938, on one of the Arab peasants
taken prisoner, we find a leaflet which sounds like a warning. Today, you are cruelly trying to
strip us of our rights, of our houses, of our honor. Know that never, not before having
conquered our freedom, will we lay down our arms. The same year, in Germany. The date is November 9, 1938. In front of the population which
observes and sometimes approves, the Nazis set fire to the places
of worship of the Jews. It's Kristallnacht. A gigantic pogrom during which
8,000 shops are ransacked and a hundred Jews are murdered. A few months ago, Germany took control of Austria where 200,000 Jews live. In a new outburst of anti-Semitism, tension rises sharply in Europe and the risk of a new world war
draws near. Some Jews in Europe realize that
for them, the countdown has begun. Shortly before Kristallnacht, The Weilers made the decision
to leave Berlin for good and to emigrate to Palestine. On the photos taken before departure,
the parents try to put on a good face, but Friedrich notes
in his journal: “We are spending the last
few days in fear.” ""Until the end I feared
that the Gestapo"" ""would ask us for
an additional formality."" “Last night, my mother thought she was
suffocating at the thought of us leaving.” Friedrich's mother, Ida, decided to stay in Germany. She tries to reassure
her granddaughters. Nazis. It's nothing to worry about. We have them
only for a while. All that, you'll see, will pass. Berlin. the day of departure. The parents take final photos
on the dock. The grandmother, Ida, came to say
 goodbye to the whole family. Ella, her granddaughter,
here on the right, is excited. is excited. She doesn't realize it's the last time
 she's seeing her grandmother. I am excited about this trip. A new life is beginning. We're crossing Austria where Hitler has just
taken power. We're crossing the Alps. It's the first time I've seen
such big mountains. And then that's it,
we find ourselves in Italy. The Nazis, with their viciousness,
are behind us. The family embarked for Palestine. Our boat is called the Jerusalem. To pass the time, my mom knits, and I read books all day long. After five days at sea,
the Weilers land in Palestine. The parents have chosen to settle
in a small house north of Tel Aviv where they think their two daughters
will be able to grow up safely. They will soon learn that
they are among the last to have been able to
reach Palestine. Because in the spring of 1939, the situation changed abruptly. Great Britain, which is still
occupying Palestine, makes a decision that calls
everything into question. To secure the support of the Arabs
in the next war against Hitler, the British decide to stop
supporting Zionism. To limit the number of entry visas
for Jews as well as purchases of land. A catastrophic decision for the Zionists who intended to make millions
of Jews to emigrate from Europe before the outbreak of war. Their leader in Palestine, David Ben Gurion, in turn,
chose force through. He decides to accelerate the
operations towers and palisades, these creations of colonies which multiplied in previous years and which rely on
the effect of surprise. It is July 12, 1939, 
n Negba, near the Negev Desert. The Zionist militants have
been loaded a convoy of prefabricated houses
which they will install here. On those lands they previously
bought from the Arabs. Among them is Joël Iglinskiy. “You have to go fast.” “Everyone knows what to do.” “You build palisades by putting
gravel inside the planks” “to stop the bullets.” “We're going up the watchtower.” “We forget the fatigue” “because we are the soldiers
of the Zionist revolution” “and we know that we're doing
something bigger than ourselves.” In the summer of 1939, as the
cataclysm that was about to come, Jews held their breath. Some, as we have shown, sought refuge by emigrating
to Palestine. Others still hope to continue
living in Europe espite the danger. It will only take a few months for them
 to achieve the unimaginable. The project of the destruction of
an entire population by the Nazis. It is this new chapter that we are
now going to tell you about. September 1, 1939, Germany invades Poland. It is the beginning of
the Second World War. From the first weeks, the Nazis,
who crushed the Polish army, increased the exactions. Forced labor, beaatings, humiliations, as shown by dozens of photos
taken all over the country, of German soldiers
unleashing on Jews. Hitler ordered the Polish Jews
to be grouped together, men, women and children, in quarters reserved for them, the ghettos. The Nazis chose to isolate their
future victims from the rest of the world, to starve them little by little, before, soon, deciding to
murder them en masse, here. The massacre began
a year and a half later, on 22 June 1941, when the German army
attacks the USSR. A lightning offensive which,
in a few days, pushes the Soviets back
hundreds of kilometers. In the conquered cities, the Nazis immediately launched
the persecutions against the Jews with the help of the population. Everywhere, like here in Zloczow, pro-German nationalists, far right activists and defendants launch pogroms under the encouragement
of the Germans. They accuse Jews of being
responsible for massacres which were committed by
the Soviets a few days earlier. In Lvov, Ukraine, a German soldier films the crowd
and the Ukrainian militiamen. Dozens of Jewish women, after being raped, will be murdered
along with their families. An SS sergeant, Félix Landau,
despite being ferociously antisemitic, is surprised by
this outburst of violence. “We're seeing things that are
almost impossible to describe.” “Hundreds of Jews
covered in blood,” “holes in their heads,” “broken hands” “and eyes hanging out
of their sockets” “because of the hits” “full of hate” “and anger.” In a few hours, the massacre
spread to dozens of cities. Again on the 4th of July, Germans approach
Kaunas in Lithuania. This is where Dita Katz
and her whole family live. Do you remember that film
shot twelve years earlier, in 1929? When the Germans arrive, the
grandfather tries to reassure his family. “Don't be afraid of the Germans.” “I knew them during
the First World War.” “They are civilized people.” However, from the very first hours, his own son Itzhak disappears
at the corner of a street. The rest is told by
a German corporal. “Lithuanians with sticks and crowbars,” “hit the Jews to the ground,” “on the skull or on the face.” ""Without distinction,"" ""they are beaten"" “until they no longer show
any signs of life.” “In three quarters of an hour,” “the one who is presented
as the executioner of the city” killed fifty people."" “All around, the Germans
are watching the show.” In Bavaria, from his mountain chalet, Hitler approves pogroms. But he wants to frame and rationalize them. He instructed Heinrich Himmler,
the head of the SS, here on the left, to set up special units:
the Einsatzgruppen. Their mission is to remove
within a few months any trace of the Jewish people
on the conquered territories. The Einsatzgruppen will shoot
Jews directly into mass graves. In Libau, not far from Kaunas, the soldier of the German navy, Reinhardt Wiener, films one of these massacres
with his personal camera. A truck is coming. Guards force Jews
to jump off. There are weak and sick people
among them, they help each other out. They are pushed towards
the trench by an SS. When they get to the trench, they have to walk over bodies
covered in sand, the firing squad
stands in front of them, they are told to turn around waiting for the next group to arrive. The scale of the massacre
is unparalleled in history. In six months, the Einsatzgruppen murdered
half a million Jews. In front of his troops, Himmler gave the order. “What to do with women
and children?” “I don't think we can exterminate men” “and at the same time let
their children become adults” “so that they can take revenge on
our children and grandchildren later.” At the end of 1941, information about the genocide
begins to filter in. In Palestine, the Arab population remains
aloof from the conflict. Even though its spiritual leader,
the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, exiled by the British,
chose to collaborate with Hitler. He raised a regiment of
pro-Nazi Bosnian Muslims. The Jews, on the other hand,
are alarmed to stop receiving news
from their loved ones. This is the case for Mickaël Arens, the young Zionist from Riga,
who arrived in Palestine in 1938 and who joined the police force. He is unaware that his mother, who remained in Latvia, was killed in the first days
of the German offensive. Friedrich Weiler, too, can no longer
communicate with his mother, Ida stayed in Berlin. On November 2, 1941,
he wrote in his journal. “Horrible news from Germany.” “The Jews here are being
deported from their homes” “and sent like cattle to Poland.” “This news is so inhuman"" ""that it's hard to believe it.” “They are asked to dig"" ""and they are slaughtered
in these graves.” In November 1941, Ida Weiler, the grandmother, has
already been deported to the east. She is here in Lodz, Poland, with 140,000 other Jews. All those who escaped
the first pogroms are now locked up in ghettos. This is the case, in Kaunas,
for Dita Katz. With her mother,
her little brother Zvi, and her fiancé Yéhuda, Dita no longer harbors
any illusions about her fate. “I know since my father disappeared” “that the Nazis are
exterminating us.” “What is happening
is unimaginable” “and no one is helping us.” At the end of 1941, the Nazis, who occupied 
almost the entire Europe, launch the final solution. It is the second phase
of the Holocaust. From everywhere, in France
with the help of the Vichy regime. In Romania, in Yugoslavia, in Poland, Jews are grouped together then directed in panic to unknown destinations. It's from Holland, at the Westerbork
 transit camp, that we have the most precise testimony
of the deportation of the Jews. These images were taken
by German soldiers. They are unique documents. Every morning, a train takes several 
thousand people to the East. A Jewish nurse, Etty Hillesum,
attends the departure. “The cattle trucks are filling up
little by little.” “I see an elderly person going to
the last stage of the disease” “saying the prayer of the dead.” ""The babies with squealing
little cries, ripped from their cribs."" “Young women are already
sitting in the wagon.” “Are these doors really
going to close?” ""Unfortunately, yes."" ""Thin openings still let
glimpses of faces."" ""Will we ever be able to
describe to the outside world"" ""what happened here?"" For the world to realize the tragedy
that has affected the Jewish people, it will take another two years. Spring 1945, the end of the Second World War. After five years of nightmares, Europe celebrates victory
over the Nazi regime. One of the worst
the world has ever seen. During the winter, Allied and Soviet soldiers liberated dozens of extermination
and labor camps. Majdanek, Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen. And the world has learned how
the majority of the victims perished. In gas chambers and crematories which sometimes still burn even
after the camps are liberated. The toll is 5 million Jewish victims, 6 million, as we learn a little later. How did the world let
this genocide happen? At a meeting of the
World Jewish Congress, one of the leaders
of the Zionist movement, Nahum Goldmann, let his anger out. The port of Haifa, in Palestine, a few months after
the end of the war. On makeshift boats sometimes
on the verge of sinking, the first survivors of the camps
reach the Holy Land. On one of these boats
is a Polish Jew, Garcher Rabinovich. “From where I am, Palestine
seems like a paradise to me.” “It's the first light
I've seen in 17 years.” “I am crying with joy.” “Do you know what it's like
to be welcomed somewhere” “after being hated” “and driven from
country to country?” Relief for some, but concern for others. Faced with the arrival of Jewish
survivors from Europe, once again, the Arabs of Palestine are protesting. In Jaffa, a teenager, Youssef Chaker,
asks the question. “Jews suffered horribly
during the Second World War.” “But we Arabs have
nothing to do with it.” “Why should we suffer
the consequences” “Nazi genocide
against the Jews?” ""Why don't they create
their state in Europe,"" ""where they were massacred,"" ""instead of coming to us?"" To deter any new Arab revolt, Great Britain continues to
apply its pre-war policy. It forbids Jews to
go to Palestine, but this time it gets all the undocumented
 immigrants arrested and groups them together
in camps. After the Nazi death camps, holocaust survivors experience British prison camps. They will react soon. In Europe, 150,000 Jewish survivors
 wait near former Nazi camps, like here, in Austria. They are reluctant to return
to Poland or Russia where they fear returning to the
antisemitism they have always known. Among them is Dita Katz, who miraculously survived
the death camps. Despite the death of her father in 1941 
and that of her husband in 1944, Dita chooses to return
to her hometown. In Lithuania, where she hopes to reunite
with her pre-war friends and rebuild her life. Her younger brother Zvi, the boy filmed in 1929, is now 18 years old. He too survived the Holocaust,
but he makes a different choice. With his mother, they decide to go to Palestine. To circumvent the British ban, he made contact with
an underground network and it's Zionist agents who are
going to take him all over Europe without identity documents and without a visa. In 1947, one of these trips was filmed by the
 American journalist Meyer Levin. By train, then by truck, Zvi and her mother
cross Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Austria. After several weeks of travel, they are dropped off at the foot of
the Alps with a group of refugees and it is on foot that they will
cross the Italian border illegally. “There are women and children with us.” “But nothing can stop us
from reaching Palestine.” “We are 2,700 meters
above sea level,” “mom is not weakening.” “We feel sure of ourselves” “because we know that we will finally
have a country, like everyone else.” On the other side of the border, they embarked
on the Rome region at night, on a clandestine ship. It is from here that dozens of ships
take Jews to Palestine to land them
on a deserted beach. High-risk trips. One of these ships, the Exodus, was recently boarded
by the British fleet. The collision caused
several deaths and injuries and the Exodus was
sent back to Germany. This time, the Zionists want to
take every precaution. As soon as a ship is in sight, the 950 illegal passengers are
ordered to evacuate the deck and they take refuge
in the holds. Journalist Meyer Levin
continues filming while his partner, Tereska Torrès,
keeps a logbook. “This boat is a modern jellyfish raft.” “There is almost no air, no light,
only an unbreathable smell.” “Women, often hysterical, faint.” “Around 1 a.m. a little boy was born.” “The mother screamed
at the top of her lungs for two hours.” After 12 days of navigation, as the ship is nearing
its destination, a plane flies over
the illegal immigrants. It is followed by a British warship
who approaches and orders the machines
to be stopped. Unmasked, the passengers go out
into the open. For them, as Tereska Torrès
notes in her journal, The dream ends when the English soldiers
take control of the ship. “We are living the last hours
of the boat.” “As we get closer to Haifa,” “the city is rising before us,” “so beautiful"" ""and forbidden
to these poor people.” “A company of armed and helmeted
soldiers is waiting for us on the quay.” The passengers are all directed
to prison camps the British established
on the island of Cyprus. It is there, locked behind new barbed wires, that Zvi Katz and her mother
will spend several months. For them and for the Zionist activists, the situation has
become unbearable. In Palestine, Jewish armed groups
decide to take action and to launch a campaign of terror. Extremely violent attacks which aim to subdue the English
and drive them out of Palestine. On clandestine radio, an 18-year-old terrorist, Gueoulah Cohen threats. “You, British people,” “are going to pay for every tear of
a Jew who stretches out his hands"" “and to whom you refuse help.” ""Hell will enter your lives,"" ""and terror will flood
every part of your body."" “For we have taken an oath
to liberate the land of Israel.” In Palestine, Arab attacks are now
responding to Jewish attacks. And the region is once again
on the verge of explosion. Then news arrives from New York
that changes everything. It is November 29, 1947, at the
headquarters of the United Nations. An extraordinary general meeting
must be held on that day. One of those that will make history. Commission of inquiry, public hearing, speech. For a year, the international community has been
studying a solution for the Middle East and is preparing to vote on the
territorial division of Palestine. In green, the territories offered to the Arabs, in blue, those that are
offered to Jews. In the middle, the Jerusalem area, which would be administered
by the international community. The Zionists accepted the division, but the Arab countries all announced
that they would vote against it. To be adopted, the draft must receive
two-thirds of the votes. Undermined by guilt
over the Jewish people, The United States announced
that it would vote in favor and Great Britain that
it would abstain. The suspense concerns two countries. Tempted to the end by abstention, France has just given the Zionists
a helping hand. It is followed by the Soviet Union. It's unexpected, but the major powers
are swinging the vote. In a few minutes,
the cause of the Zionists has just progressed
like never before. In the crowd in Tel Aviv who explodes
with joy at the announcement of the news, there is the young Berliner
Bärbel Weiler. “Our dream is
becoming reality.” “The Jewish state is
getting closer to us.” “It's fantastic.” “We dance, we laugh, we sing.” “Everyone embraces each other
without knowing each other.” “What a joy!” They crossed the borders
clandestinely, reached their promised land
on makeshift ships, they now have the support
of the international community. At the end of 1947, the Zionists
seemed close to their goal. Will the two parties now succeed
in coming to an agreement? According to the UN, sharing must be followed
by two separate states, one Jewish, the other Arab. We will explain to you why did this project collapse
in only six months and how the creation of Israel plunged
the Arabs of Palestine into misery, and exile for decades. November 30, 1947,
the day after the UN vote. A young Arab from Jaffa,
Afif Elkouri, is revolted. “Why should we give away
half the country?” “For them to turn it
into a Jewish state?” “And what will happen
to non-Jews?” “Now there is only one solution,
to fight.” To defend their rights, thousands of peasants
are engaging in the guerrillas. One of their leaders
is Fawzi al-Qawuqji. One of the heroes of
the Great Arab Revolt of 1936. He has only a few weeks
to train his troops. “My soldiers have only basic weapons
that they bought themselves.” “We sent SOS to neighboring
Arab countries,"" ""in vain"" “Yet the hate is so intense that
we are ready to sacrifice ourselves.” In the opposite camp, The Haganah, the future army of Israel,
has been training for months. Supervised by veterans
of the Second World War, it is made up of highly motivated
young recruits. Among them is Zvi Katz, here,
on the right of the photo. He escaped from the Cyprus camp
thanks to a clandestine network. “All I think about is fighting.” “For us, it's a matter of dignity.” “We no longer want to be like animals
that are killed without saying anything.” “Never again will we allow ourselves
to be slaughtered like sheep.” The two young Berliners,
Ella and Bärbel Weiler, they too were involved
in the Haganah. They have just learned that their grandmother died
during the war in Poland. Assassinated by the Nazis. They are determined. “During the war,"" ""no one acted to save the Jews.” “Today, we can only
count on ourselves.” “If we don't help ourselves,"" ""who will help us?” In the spring of 1948, Fawzi al-Qawuqji and
the other Arab leaders launch their troops to attack
Jewish positions. One of the targets is the
kibbutz of Mishmar-Haémek, the crossing point
from Galilee to Tel Aviv. “We attack at 5 a.m.,
on the Sabbath day of the Jews.” “I give the order
to fire the cannon” “to destroy as many houses
as possible.” “They seem to have
a lot of losses.” Opposite, the kibbutz defenders
respond blow for blow. One of them, Joël Lotan,
films the fighting. “We're trying to repel the enemy.” “And we hope to hold out
until reinforcements arrive.” “Fortunately, after a few days,” “Haganah soldiers end up
joining us over the hills” “ from Haifa.” In a few days,
Palestine is on fire. Offensive, counteroffensive, the Haganah, better organized
than the Arab army, manages to gain the upper hand
within the first few weeks and to take thousands of prisoners. In the conquered cities,
the population is frightened, and is considering
fleeing the fighting. On April 9, 1948,
an event reinforced these fears. In Deir Yassin, Jewish extremists massacre
nearly 200 Arab villagers, including children. A carnage of which no image remains, but the news of which goes
around the world and triggers panic. In Jaffa, a few rare candid photos show residents abandoning
their homes and leaving the city. Among them is Youssef Chaker. “We heard about Deir Yassin
on the radio.” “We heard that the Arab countries
were coming to rescue us.” “In the meantime,
we prefer to leave.” “I get in a truck, we pile up
and we head to Beirut.” This is the beginning
of the Palestinian exodus. A few streets away is Afif Elkouri. “The whole city is fleeing.” “On Arabic radio, we are told that
we will be back in two weeks,"" “but is it for sure? “ Those who have fled will never
be allowed to return home. From now on, the city of Jaffa,
 deserted of its inhabitants, will officially be considered
an Israeli city. May 14, 1948,
the day everything changed. It is 10 a.m. in the port of Haifa. The British governor Alan Cunningham
 sets sail for England. Britain ends three decades
of presence in Palestine and leaves the two sides
face to face. Six hours later, in Tel Aviv, the leader of the Zionists,
David Ben Gurion, decides to proclaim the Jewish State. After years of struggle, the Zionists are reconnecting
with Jewish history. Behind their flag will be a
minority of the Arabs of Palestine. 150,000 people who
choose to stay there and who will become
Israeli citizens. Today, 60 years later, they represent 20% of the population. But most of the Arabs in Palestine
are on the road. Almost an entire population, men, women and children,
are now fleeing abroad. It is called the Nakba,
catastrophe in the Arabic language. The exodus that began in April
after the Deir Yassin massacre, will affect more than 700,000 people. Two thirds of the Arab population. The entry into war against Israel
by seven Arab countries the day after Ben Gurion's speech, doesn't change their fate. After several weeks of battle and the
 capture of the Old City of Jerusalem, after several spectacular advances, the Arab armies are retreating
and losing new territories. A situation that further reinforces
the flow of Palestinian refugees. According to the latest historical
 research conducted in Israel, half would have been
forcibly evicted by Israeli soldiers. They found refuge in
neighboring Arab countries, in Jordan or Lebanon,
in refugee camps. Among them is Abu Hicham, who is19. “They gave us tents.” “The ground is wet.” “We don't have
a country anymore.” “One can't live normally anymore.” “They give us bread and cheese.” ""I feel humiliated and
I only think of one thing,"" ""to return to my village."" “As long as it takes, we will fight.” Hate, humiliation, exile. In 1948, The history of the Arab-Israeli conflict is just getting started. Today, Abu Hicham, 78,
still has refugee status. He lives in a Palestinian camp
on the outskirts of Beirut, Lebanon, a few kilometers from Afif Elkouri. For 60 years, neither has been allowed to return
to live in their native land, Palestine. Some have emigrated to the West, like Edward Said, the little
Christian Arab from Jerusalem. A university professor in New York, Edward Said was one of the most famous
spokespersons for the Palestinian people until his death in 2003. On the other hand, in Israel,
everyone tried to rebuild their lives despite the trauma
of the Second World War. Mickaël Arens, the young Zionist from Riga,
dedicated himself to agriculture in Galilee. Very marked by her childhood memories, the little Berliner Ella Weiler married a Jew who
came from Germany like her. They had two children. Her sister, Bärbel, married an Auschwitz survivor
of Polish origin. She lives with him in Tel Aviv. Grateful to her father
who died in the 1960s, for making him leave Germany
when there was still time. It was only in 1972 that Dita Katz
left Lithuania for Israel. There she met with her brother Zvi,
who had become a reserve officer. They live in Tel Aviv in the
memory of their loved ones murdered by the Nazis. Perhaps the most surprising
is Joel Iglinskiy. At the age of 99,
he still lives in Nekbah, the kibbutz he created in 1939. More than ever, he remains faithful to
the socialist ideal of his youth."

The Land of Israel has been referred to by many different names throughout its history- Canaan, Judah, Judea, Israel and Palestine. Each of these names has deep historical significance based on the inhabitants or conquerors of the land. 
 
Though modern day Israel was established in a land known as Palestine, named by the Romans who took control in the Second Century CE, its inhabitants have been historically Jewish since biblical times. No matter where Jewish people live across the world, the land of Israel continues to be their homeland.

Farha is a new film on Netflix depicting Israeli forces murdering a Palestinian family during the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation has been condemned by Israeli officials as “creating a false narrative”.  We are zooming out to give you a wider perspective of the events.

#Israel #Palestine #westbank",2022-11-30,325036,9232,5511,UCU63EiU7Y-8xcRntPIRVrzA," This is my home. Yup, I'm lucky enough to live
in one of the most beautiful and contested countries in the world. Wanna send me a fruit
basket? Or a letter bomb? Yeah, I read the YouTube comments. You can address it to
Yirmiyahu Danzig, Israel. Ancient country. Ancient name. Pretty simple. Or is it? Because this region has been
known by quite a few names over the centuries. 100 years ago, a letter
addressed to Israel probably wouldn't have been delivered. After all, the place had a
different name back then: Palestine. It's all over the official documents, the newspapers, the money. So what gives? Did Israel take over a country that was once called Palestine? And if it was called Palestine, then why is it called Israel today? Let's get into it. I'm going to tell you about
the history of my home. The name ""Israel,"" which
has confusingly been used to refer to a place, a
person, an entire nation, traces back to the Hebrew Bible. Remember the patriarch Jacob? Son of Isaac, grandson of Abraham? Jacob had a big family. And his descendants became
known as the Children of Israel, or Israelites. We Israelites trace this name back to a fateful wrestling match described in chapter 32 of Genesis. One night, Jacob was
attacked by a mysterious, possibly-divine figure. They wrestle until day break. As the sun rises and the
fight comes to an end, Jacob demands a blessing
from his attacker. Instead, the attacker gave him a new name. One that means ""he who wrestles with God."" In Hebrew, Yisrael. In English, Israel. Pretty fitting for a country
this contentious, huh? But the Hebrew Bible isn't our only record of the name ""Israel."" In the 13th century BCE,
an ancient Egyptian pharaoh named Merneptah commissioned a stele to record various military victories. A stele, by the way, is
basically a stone monument with writings or drawings. Among those victories are
Merneptah's defeat of ""Israel"" and ""Canaan,"" another
name for the same land. Yeah. This place has had a lot
of names throughout history. Merneptah's scribes don't
give us much beyond a name. But later stelae are a
bit more forthcoming. The Tel Dan Stele, which dates back to the 9th century BCE, refers to a war with ""the King of Israel"" and ""the House of David."" Which suggests two things: one, Israel is probably a place, named after the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob, who lived there. And two, there's archeological
evidence dating back to the 9th Century BCE
for the Biblical account of an Israelite king named David. David's kingdom split
into two around 930 BCE. The northern kingdom
retained the name Israel. But the southern kingdom,
which was home to Jerusalem, took on a different name
that starts cropping up in the archeological record
around 730 BCE. Judah. Both the kingdom of Israel
and the kingdom of Judah were home to Jacob's descendants. But in the 8th Century BCE, when the Assyrians destroyed
the kingdom of Israel, only the kingdom of Judah survived. Its territory became known as Judea, the Greek word for ""Judah."" And its people become known
as, wait for it - Jews. So the names Israel and Judah are ancient. They denote places where
Jews established a monarchy and enjoyed a continuous presence from at least the 12th
century BCE until today. And that is why the name Israel, or Judea, is so important to Jewish people. It reaffirms the link between
our history and our present. Between our peoplehood and our land. Our Bible, our liturgy, our
poetry, our lifecycle events. All refer to us as the Children of Israel. And for over three thousand years, our home has been the land of Israel and the province of Judea,
with Jerusalem at it's heart. Even the conquerors and
occupiers of the region knew it as Judah. The Babylonian king
Nebuchadnezzar referred to his ""seizure of Judah."" The conquering Persians kept the name, assimilating ""Yehuda"" into their empire. And when the Greeks and Romans came along, they too referred to
the province as Judea. But Israel and Judah aren't
the only names on record. During the reign of King David, the Jews' biggest enemy was a
group called the Philistines, who came from a place known
in Hebrew as ""Paleshet."" And in ancient Egyptian as ""Paleset."" And in ancient Assyrian as ""Palashtu."" Hmm. This is starting to
sound a little familiar. Could the Israelites' ancient enemy, the Philistines of Paleshet, hold the key to the name Palestine? The answer is...probably. Scholars believe that the
Philistines made their way from somewhere around here to here in the 12th century BCE, roughly around the time that
""Israel"" starts showing up in the archeological record. Because they left no written records, everything we know about
the Philistines comes from the folks they warred with: Egyptians, Assyrians,
Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans. And of course, the Israelites. Unsurprisingly, none of
the records are flattering. In fact, in modern English, the word ""philistine"" literally
means ""an uncultured bozo."" Harsh. And no, that's not a racist term, because the Philistines
aren't around anymore. They disappeared from written
records after Nebuchadnezzar destroyed their cities
in the 6th century BCE. The folks living in the region today are not descendants of the Philistines. So you can go ahead and
use the term ""Philistine"" without worrying that you're
going to offend anyone. Still, our ancient friends the Philistines did leave a few things behind, other than their bad reputation. Like pottery, temples,
shrines, and...a name. Which, in the Greek, became Palestine. In the fifth century BCE, the Greek historian Herodotus
took a little road trip around the Levant. In his travelog, he described a place
that sounds quite a bit like modern-day Israel. Except he calls it ""Syrian Palestine."" What gives? OK, maybe he didn't use
the name Israel because the northern kingdom no longer existed. But the southern kingdom sure did! Why wouldn't he call it Judah
or Judea like everyone else? There's a couple of explanations. The first, popularized by historians like Louis Feldman and Bernard Lewis, assert that Herodotus was
referring only to the coast, that part of the region
where the Philistines lived in cities like Jaffa, Ashkelon, and Gaza. According to Feldman,
Herodotus didn't venture much farther inland, to the majority-Jewish province of Judea. This is backed up by the
first-century historian Josephus Flavius, who says that ""the Greeks call part of
that country Palestine."" But other historians, like Martin Noth and David Jacobson, claim that Herodotus'
use of ""Palestine"" refers to the whole of the region. They believe that the Greek name Palestine is actually an alternate name
for the land of the Jews. Okay, remember when we explained
the etymology of Israel as ""one who wrestles""? In ancient Greek, the word
for ""wrestler"" is palaistês. Sounds an awful lot like Palestine. Could the Greeks have
called this land Palestine as a literal translation
of the Hebrew word Israel, rather than an explicit
reference to the Philistines? After all, Herodotus'
description of the folks living in Palestine makes them
sound quite a bit like Jews. For one, he comments on
the fact that the folks in Palestine were circumcised, like Jews. And later writers, like Ovid, talk about the ""seventh
day feast that the Syrian of Palestine observes."" Sounds a lot like the
Jewish tradition of Shabbat. So the name Palestine stuck around, and its exact parameters ambiguous. In some sources, it's
mentioned in tandem with Judea. In others, it's referenced
as a land of Jews. And in numerous sources,
it's paired with Syria. But then the Romans came along. Queue scary music. Once the Romans took control of Judea, things got really ugly. Because the Jews fought
the Romans bitterly. So bitterly in fact,
that the Romans destroyed the Jewish Holy Temple in 70 CE and carted many Jews away
from their home in chains. But the flame of rebellion smoldered, and in the second century CE, a Jewish warrior named Shimon Bar Kokhba led a strike force against
the Roman occupier. He and his guerrilla army
gave the occupiers hell. But the Romans had the
resources of an entire empire. They crushed the Bar Kokhba revolt and renamed the land of the
Jews to Syria-Palestina. No one knows exactly who chose that name, but historian Louis Feldman suggests it was the Emperor Hadrian. So assuming it was Hadrian,
why choose that name? Well, there are two possible reasons. First, the Romans, Hadrian included, were big fans of the Greeks. And the Greeks had used the name Palestine for hundreds of years to
refer to different parts of the land we now know as Israel. So as Hadrian consolidated his territory, it made sense to adopt a name that had been used by the Greeks. The second reason is both more nefarious and harder to prove. The historian Louis H. Feldman writes that the name change was
deliberately intended to sever all Jewish
connection from the land, replacing Judea or Israel
with the name of the Jew's ancient enemy, the Philistines. That would be pretty on-brand for Hadrian, whose early sympathies towards the Jews quickly turned into a
vicious antisemitism. I mean, the guy built a pagan temple on the ruins of the Jewish Holy Temple. Banned Torah study,
Shabbat, circumcisions, and Jewish courts. And forbade the remaining
Jews of the region to enter Jerusalem, except
for one day of the year. So yeah, not the Jew's biggest fan. True, Hadrian didn't leave behind a diary with inscriptions like,
""Today I renamed Judea to Syria-Palestina just
to stick it to the Jews."" But given his record on Jewish people, he may well have appreciated the resonance of ethnically cleansing
the region of Jews, whose rebellions had been a
thorn in his side for years, and then renaming their home
after their historic enemy. Whoever was responsible
for the name change and whatever their reason, they certainly made an impact on history, because the name stuck around. When the Arab army
swept through the Levant in the seventh century CE, they adopted the name
into Arabic as Falasteen. As the region traded hands
through the centuries, passing to Arab dynasties
and Christian crusaders and the Ottoman Empire, it
kept the name Palestine. And it's inhabitants, Arabs,
Sumeritans and Jews alike, were known as Palestinians. This is one of those
crazy historical facts, but some folks even call
diaspora Jews, Palestinians. Like German philosopher Emmanuel Kant, whose 18th century book, ""Anthropology from a
Pragmatic Point of View"", criticized the Palestinians
living among us, with a boatload of
antisemitic stereotypes. So yeah, it's true. Modern-day Israel was
established in a region that was once known as Palestine. Though there was never
a self-governing country named Palestine, the region's inhabitants
were known as Palestinians. That's why the Jewish
newspapers, and money, and immigration certificates I showed you at the start of this video
refer to ""Palestine."" But look closely at those
two letters right there. Yep, that's shorthand for
the region's other name. The one that had sustained
the Jewish people through thousands of years of exile. The one that they'd used
since the 12th century BCE. The one that represented
their ancient connection to their homeland: Eretz Yisrael. No matter where they were in exile, the Jewish people turned towards Jerusalem and prayed for Eretz Yisrael. The home that fell in blood and
fire two thousand years ago. The home that rose again
as a modern state in 1948. The home where I am lucky enough to live."

163,8RVoPZPKxLY,‘They Came Here to Attack Arabs.’ Welcome to Life in Israel’s ‘Mixed Cities’,"“Inside Israel, we are Palestinians too.” 

When solidarity protests erupted across the country in May, a Palestinian resident in the city of Lydd (or Lod, as Israel renamed it) told AJ+ that local Jewish Israelis marked their homes with red paint so they could be targeted for attacks by armed settlers.

This is part of a much larger project happening in Lydd, where ultranationalist Jewish Israelis have been moving into the city for over a decade with resources and support from the state. The group is called the Garin Torani, or “Torah Seeds,” and its goal is to create a Jewish majority in Arab-majority neighborhoods. Residents we spoke with say that while the city has welcomed these Jewish settlers, it has also ignored the basic needs of Palestinian citizens. 

In the aftermath of recent violence that left two people dead, one Jewish and the other Palestinian, new levels of mistrust and generational trauma are haunting these residents. 

AJ+ went to Lydd to find out how Palestinians with Israeli citizenship are challenging the country’s de facto policy of divide and rule while demanding freedom from colonial oppression.",2021-08-05,2040048,27673,12644,UCV3Nm3T-XAgVhKH9jT0ViRg," They came here to attack Arabs. You're watching Jewish Israelis, some armed with baseball bats, headed in the direction of a mosque. Local Jews marked Arab houses [with] a red spray, so the ones who come from outside will recognize our houses and attack us. ISIS did it, and the Nazis did it. And now they are doing it for us. This is the city of Lydd, or Lod, as it's been known since Israeli forces took control of it in 1948. It's one of just a handful of binational cities where Palestinians and Jewish Israelis live together. Residents here told us that right-wing Jewish settlers are moving into Arab-majority neighborhoods in a deliberate effort to dilute the population. We want the Palestinians to accept this is our land. This is our country. This is our city. In the aftermath of a violent crackdown, new levels of mistrust and generational trauma are haunting its victims. We're in Lydd to find out how Palestinians are challenging Israel's de facto policy of divide and rule while demanding freedom from systemic oppression. The minute that set [off] everything, and the police lost it, is when an Arab boy climbed that electric pole over there, and he moved the Israel flag and he put instead a Palestinian flag. For activist Ghassan Munayeer, massive protests this spring signaled a kind of reawakening for the descendants of Palestinians who resisted efforts to violently force them out in 1948. Inside Israel, we are Palestinians too. They tried all their best to tear us from our people and our nationality and our identity. They failed. What happened next was several days of violence. Two men were killed. One was Jewish and the other Palestinian. Marwa Hassouneh's husband, Moussa, was just a few minutes from home when he got caught up in protests that turned deadly. The father of three children was shot dead after a settler fired his gun at protesters. Religious settlers have been moving into Lydd from the occupied West Bank for over a decade with resources and support from the state. Their group is called the Garin Torani, or ""Torah Seeds"" in English. They're expanding their community into Arab neighborhoods with the express goal of establishing a Jewish majority. Marwa visits her husband's grave daily with her family. Suspects were detained in Moussa's killing, but released shortly after. Marwa says it's a testament to the ways Palestinians are treated differently by the justice system. Palestinians with Israeli citizenship face dozens of discriminatory laws that limit economic opportunity, restrict their movements and deny them access to their land. And they live in a climate of pervasive fear and punishment. But Marwa and her family are determined to fight back. For Marwa's 6-year-old daughter, Mila, what's left is hopelessness and confusion. The Hassouneh family is one of the oldest  Indigenous Palestinian families in Lydd, who, like so many others, were forcibly expelled during the 1948 creation of Israel. Moussa's great-uncle, Ramadan, survived the Nakba, or catastrophe.  That's when over 750,000 Palestinians  were violently forced out of their homes. In Lydd, more than 200 men, women and children were murdered as they sought refuge in the Dahmash Mosque. Ramadan recounts what happened afterward. Some 50,000 people in the city became refugees overnight. Historical accounts called it a death march. After a few years, Ramadan's family found a way back to Lydd. The city's name was changed to Lod, and their farming community was now jobless and completely dependent on the Jewish state that had taken their land. And until 1966, they continued to live under military rule in virtual ghettos surrounded by barbed wire because they were considered a threat. By the time they were granted Israeli citizenship, the state had taken away pretty much everything they had. Jewish Israeli resident Yigal Yehoshua was the other victim of  deadly demonstrations in Lydd.  Yigal’s brother Effie showed up   at the Hassouneh family home to offer his sympathy. For Palestinians, it's not a question of ""just getting along"" or achieving ""coexistence."" It's about living alongside Jewish Israelis who refuse to recognize the brutality of their past and current experiences. During filming, thousands of right-wing extremists marched through East Jerusalem, waving flags and celebrating the day in 1967 when Israel occupied the city. The crowd cheered as one Palestinian counterprotester was pulled away by his neck. As police dragged away a Palestinian woman, a group of youth shouted, We want the Palestinians to accept this is our land. This is our country. This is our city. And then, if they want to live here, they come to live in peace and don't have problems for nothing. As new housing projects for hard-line Jewish settlers persist, Lydd's mayor has been accused of emboldening their growth with discriminatory policies and anti-Arab rhetoric. A few years ago, he barged into the  Dahmash Mosque - the same site where Palestinians were massacred during the Nakba - and demanded they lower the volume. At an Arab primary school, parents say armed members of the Garin Torani stormed the property and demanded the school turn over its playground to the city so it could be used as a tourist walkway. Incidents like this have signaled a new level of aggression that Palestinians in this city haven't seen before. Armed extremist Jewish Israelis trying to enforce their own rule and order. AJ+ requested an interview with the Garin Torani. They didn't reply to our request. Democracy without equality doesn't exist. What we see here is apartheid. Ghassan showed us a 10-foot wall on the north side of the city that separates a wealthy, thriving Jewish neighborhood from a poor, struggling Arab one. The building of this wall reflects how the Jewish majority looks at us. They don't want to see us. So we build walls in order not to see you and not to see your miserable life and your misery. Most of the Arabs in Lod are second and third generation of 1948 refugees. We will not leave this place. We will not leave this place. This is our homeland. This is my city. As Marwa and her family are left to confront new layers of trauma, she responds to Yigal's brother Effie in fluent Hebrew."

#History #Politics #Religion #Israel #Judaism #Islam #Jordan #Gaza #Hamas",2021-06-05,4639617,181649,35317,UCnQC_G5Xsjhp9fEJKuIcrSw," All right. So today we're going to talk about the history of the Israeli Palestinian Arab conflict. In order to discuss that history, we have to go back in time, like way, way back in time. First. This particular video is sponsored by our friends over at Expressvpn. The Jewish homeland has always been the dream in Israel to understand how tiny this plot of land is. You kind of have to look at this map. Okay, so this tiny area right here covers Israel and actually some of some other countries. Okay. The entire map, if you were to zoom out and take a look at the Arab world, what you see is this enormous swath of the globe. And then you would see like this tiny pinprick, about half the size of New Jersey. And that constitutes modern day Israel is a very, very small plot of land. And if you were to look at this area like the narrowest part of the land it's currently constituted, you'd be looking about nine miles wide right here. The Jewish history with regard to the land of Israel begins approximately 1300 BCE before the birth of Christ. Moses leaves Egypt somewhere around 1300 BCE. There various sort of attempts to date this. A little bit later in the century, Joshua enters the land. He crosses the Jordan River. Rights of the Jewish people go out here, they pass through the Red Sea, they end up wandering around in the desert, and then they enter the land of Canaan, right. Which is this whole area. By about 1000 BCE, the Kingdom of David is established. Jerusalem is the capital. Right? This is the first that Jerusalem matters sort of in world history. Remember? So a thousand years before Christ. By 957 BCE, the first Temple of Solomon is built. It is built in Jerusalem. Now, remember, this is still a good 1600 years before the rise of Islam. There's a lot of infighting among the Jews. There's a separation between the Kingdom of Judah and the Kingdom of Israel, which are two separate kingdoms, and you end up with ancient maps that look sort of like this, right? This ancient map is the Kingdom of Israel, which was ten of the tribes. And then you have the Kingdom of Judah, which is the one that was governed by the Davidic line. The first exile that happens to the Jews happens in 722 BCE when the Assyrians rush in from the north into the Assyrian Empire. At the top of this map, they rush in from the north. Then there's another exile that takes place in 586 BCE. This is the Babylonian exile. So from way the hell out here on this map, the Babylonians come in, they conquer the land and they destroy the first temple In 515 BCE. There's this great return from Babylonia, and the second temple is built in 63 BCE. The Romans take over. So Pompeii at that point, not the emperor, but just a general, takes over the area and Judea becomes a vassal state and Judea remains a vassal state of the Roman Empire, basically through the end of an independent Jewish kingdom. It's called Judea at this point is not called Israel. 70 CE is the destruction of Jerusalem. There's Jewish revolt against the Roman government because of bad administrative practices and because of infighting and because of a crackdown on religious practice. And Jerusalem is destroyed. And not only is Jerusalem destroyed, the second temple is destroyed at the time as well. 132 136 C.E. There is a massive revolt by the Jews under a general named Shimon Bar Kokhba by Simon Bar Kokhba. The copper revolt was extremely damaging to the Roman Empire. They had to expend extraordinary resources in order to stop the bar Kokhba revolt, which is why it was almost an independent kingdom for a solid four or five years there. They renamed the area Palestine as an insult to the Jews. That's why it was named Palestine. Some people say a historic Palestine to understand that the existence of Palestine was meant as a name, as an insult to the Jews who are considered the historic inhabitants of the land. And it is first used in 136 C.E., a solid 1200 years after the Jews first enter the land at a minimum. Now, finally we get to the founding of Islam. So Islam finally is founded around the seventh century. CE. Arabs take over this land in about 636 C In 1099, the Crusaders decide that they are going to take back the land and from 1099 to 1291, the Crusaders are fighting battles with the Islamic world and establish rule inside Jerusalem and inside Israel. In 1291, the crusaders are defeated and a muslim group called the Mamluks takeover. They rule for a couple of hundred years. In 1517, the Ottoman Empire, another Muslim empire takes over the entire area. Now, understand, since the destruction of the Kingdom of Judea, there has not been a single independent state called Palestine, set up anytime in here. It has always been a territory of an outlying empire and pretty sparsely populated, actually, because there wasn't a lot there. As it turns out, the Ottoman Empire this entire time, from 1517 to 1918 until the end of World War One, during that time, they really didn't want you settling in the land and they had barred Jewish land purchase. You actually could not buy land in this area if you are Jewish. Jews started to make sort of backdoor deals with local Arabs to buy their land. And so you start seeing Jews trying to escape various places from which they have been exiled for thousands of years back to the Holy Land. There was a constant Jewish presence here throughout all of these exiles. There's never no presence of Jews in, for example, Hebron or in Jerusalem or in various areas of the Holy Land. But the first major aliya, which is termed the alien Hebrew, that means to go up because there's a spiritual rising that takes place when you go to the Holy Land. The first aliya is around 1882. It's late 19th century, and it's mostly Russians attempting to escape pogroms that are happening in Russia. By 1897, the Zionist movement begins. And this is the idea that there's going to be an independent Jewish state in Israel, and it's launched by Theodor Herzl. He's the founder of the World Zionist Organization. He is not a particularly religious Jew. He launched this after the Dreyfus Affair. The Dreyfus Affair was this famous affair in France in which there was a member of the French army who was Jewish. He was falsely accused of spying for the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It unleashed this giant wave of anti-Semitism. He was basically condemned despite evidence because of the anti-Semitism in Herzl decided, Well, anti-Semitism is too strong a threat. The Jews need some some homeland to call their own. In 1917, Britain declares the Balfour Declaration that says there will be a Jewish homeland in the area of Israel. The amount of land that was promised to the Jews was actually not just what is labeled Israel here, but also Jordan, which at this time was called Transjordan, which makes some sense in the sense that the Arab states around it were going to be Egypt is going to be Saudi Arabia, it was going to be Syria, it was going to be Lebanon. There are a bevy of Arab states that surround this entire region. In 1920, there are pogroms against Jews in Jerusalem. So when people say that there was no conflict in Arabs and Jews until the creation of the state of Israel, that's just a lie. It's not true at all. There were major Arab pogroms against Jews in Jerusalem because Jews wanted to commit the great sin of praying at the Western Wall. This, of course, was not allowed in 1922, is post-World War One. Now the British are given a mandate over the area of Palestine. They start walking back the promises of the Balfour Declaration. The British separate off Transjordan and they call it Jordan. And they say that's going to go to the Arabs in 1929. There's another major riot, another major anti-Jewish riot in Hebron or Hebron. The British, in response to all of this violence and all this rioting, they decide they're going to just continually attempt to appease the Arab population in British mandate Palestine. So they begin restricting land transfers to Jews. In 1937, the Peel Commission suggests a partition plan with control by the British retained of Tel Aviv and Jaffa and Jerusalem, and there would be like a small sliver of land Israel again, but it would be pretty divided, like this little land here, maybe a little bit up here. And then most of the Negev, which is basically just an empty desert. By this point, Jews have been moving to Palestine in increasing numbers because the anti-Semitism in Europe is getting worse, but also because there is this this nascent labor and Zionist movement and they're really making the agricultural areas flourish again. Economic growth in this region at this time is because Jews were moving in and they were bringing their resources with them. They bring their knowhow with them and they were working the land. And this was driving more Arab emigration to land. Also because economic activity always drives population movement. In 1939, under air pressure, the Brits restricted Jewish immigration to 75,000 Jews per year. The Jews are saying, Listen, we have like millions of people who want to move here. And the Brits say we're not doing that 75,000 per year because we have to get along with the Arab population. This is just before the Holocaust, obviously. And the Arabs reject this. The Arabs are very angry about this. They continue to launch low level attacks on the British. They continue to attack Jewish populations. World War two breaks out the Jews, including Jews who are heavily pushing the British to establish a Jewish state and to lift restrictions on Jewish immigration into British mandate Palestine. They side with the Brits, right? They form their own divisions. They're trying to help the British. What they say is that we fight for Jewish emigration to Palestine as though there were no Germans. And we fight the Germans as if there were no British. Right. That's the way the Jews see it in British Mandate Palestine. They're attempting to negotiate the Arab side with Hitler. Hey, during World War Two, you have a huge mean of the Seine. He is the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, one of the Palestinian leaders at the time, the Arab leaders at the time. And he was literally meeting with Hitler, attempting to encourage Hitler to establish a final solution in the Holy Land. Should the Germans be able to conquer that area, which the Germans came pretty close. I mean, you had Rommel literally in Egypt. Rommel was over here. Okay. So fast forward, You're now after World War Two. Still, the British mandate is limiting the amount of Jewish immigration into British mandate Palestine because they're attempting to keep this conflict between the Jews and the Arabs simmering at a lower level. Again, 1947, there is a U.N. partition plan because now the British mandate in Palestine, they want to end it, they want to withdraw. They don't want to be there any more. So the UN says, okay, we're going to vote on a partition plan. It retains Jerusalem as internationally governed. So it would not have been Jewish territory or Arab territory. It would have been internationally governed. It's just this fragmented, ridiculous state. The state for the Jews would have been like a slice here, a little bit of a slice of the coastal area here, and then the Negev Desert down here. The Jews are like, Give us whatever you got right, whatever, whatever you going give us, we will take the Arabs instead decide that they're going to launch a bunch of low level conflict. So there's this kind of low level, quiet war that's going on for about a year with Arabs attacking Jewish settlements and attempting to kill Jews and Jews attempting to defend themselves. May 14th, 1948. The British mandate officially ends. Israel declares its independence. This is Yom Hotham out, or as the Arabs like to call it, the Nakba, they call it a disaster that Israel was established. The leader of Israel at this time is David Ben-Gurion. Ben-Gurion is no right winger. He's no hardcore right winger. Ben-Gurion was a labor socialist. Ben-Gurion in was very much in favor of wide variety of negotiations. He was quite anti-religious and sort of his own persona, but he understood the necessity of there being a Jewish state in their founding documents, they asked the Arabs to stay. If you read the Declaration of Independence of the State of Israel, they explicitly say, we want to be a state for all of our citizens. Yes, we're a Jewish state, but we want Arabs to stay. We want them to become citizens instead, all of the surrounding Arab countries declare war. Israel is surrounded on every side by hostile states, every single side rising out of Lebanon up north. You got Syria. Here you are, Jordan, you got Saudi Arabia, you got Egypt down here. And then there are a bunch of far flung states that are also getting involved. Right. Morocco was part of the 1948 where you have a bunch of states that have decided they are going to invade and they are going to destroy Israel, like they're just going to strangle it in the crib. And they're openly saying this. And not only are they openly saying this, they're telling the Arabs who are living in the Jewish areas, get out and get out of the way so our armies can come in and we can wipe the state off the map. Well, that's not how it ends up. Right. The way that it ends up is that the Jews end up basically retaining pretty much everything that's on this map with the exception of the old city of Jerusalem. Right. So Jerusalem ends up basically split down the middle. Jerusalem is not controlled by the Jews at this point. The Temple Mount is still controlled by the Jordanians. The way that people speak about this particular period is as if there was a Palestinian state. At this point, there was not. By 1964, the Arab states have decided that they need almost a propaganda effort here. So they create the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Palestine Liberation Organization is a terrorist group. It explicitly calls for the destruction of Israel. Now, you will note at this point, Israel does not control any of this or any of this. So when they say Palestine Liberation Organization, they mean this whole thing, right? That whole thing. It's supposed to go away because there wasn't even control that at that point. And they're not calling for Palestine to be liberated from Jordan or from Egypt. They're calling for the complete destruction of the state of Israel. Okay. So in 1967, the Arabs mobilize for an all out war and this includes Egypt, it includes Jordan, include Saudi, it includes Syria. This is going to be the big war where they finally get rid of this nation, Jewish state that is less than 20 years old. Right. And this is just less than three decades after the Holocaust. And Israel instead launches a preemptive war. They see this coming. They destroy the entire Egyptian air force on the ground. And in six days they proceed to take the Golan Heights, which is this area of Syria. Israel takes over the entire Sinai desert, takes all of Judea and Samaria to the Jordan River. It takes all of the Gaza Strip, takes control of the old city of Jerusalem. And they do all of this in six days, which is why it's considered a miracle by the state of Israel. I mean, it's an unbelievable military performance. So in six days, they take what was going to be the war for their destruction and they proceed to expand their borders from this tiny thing to this, this and all of this. Israel then proceeds to give up all of it. So Israel keeps the Golan Heights because that's a military necessity. The UN calls for Israel to withdraw from occupied territories. Now the language here matters. If you care about the UN. I don't happen to care about the UN. I think it's a garbage organization. But if you do care about the UN, there's a resolution put forward by the UN Security Council. It calls for Israel to withdraw from occupied territories, not the occupied territories. Now that makes a difference because if it said the occupied territories, presumably it would mean anything. Israel one it would have to withdraw from. If you care about the UN, which you really shouldn't, but it says occupied territories, which means subject to negotiations. The 67 Arab League summit happens and they agree in Khartoum, Sudan on the three no's no peace, no recognition, no negotiations. And these are the three nos that are going to govern the Arabs all the way through, basically until now, until the Abraham Accords. These were the three nos. The matter is all the way in 1967. So whenever people talk about there needs to be a two state solution, why couldn't they have come to an agreement? Because literally one side said there will be no peace, no recognition and no negotiations. One side has accepted every single peace deal provided to it to this point in time. And one side has said we will not accept any peace deal. And yet somehow there is a moral equivalency between the two sides. Explain that one. Okay. 73, holiest day of the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur. Everybody is fasting. Everybody is praying. And a surprise attack is launched on the state of Israel. The prime minister is Golda meir. She gets caught completely by surprise. They were warned and they didn't take it seriously. Israel suffers extraordinary casualties in the 73 Yom Kippur War and then once again maintains or expands its borders a little bit. 79 Camp David Accords. Finally, there's a breakthrough. Menachem Begin takes over as prime minister of Israel, a very right wing prime minister. There are two major parties in Israel at this time. Likud and Labor is the first Likud prime minister. And one of the things that he does is he comes to a peace accord with Anwar Sadat, who is the nationalist leader of Egypt. And in those peace accords, Israel gives up the entire Sinai desert. Israel gives up the entire thing to Egypt in return for basically a cold peace. Anwar Sadat has been assassinated in 1982. The Jordanian monarchy is deeply afraid that the Palestine Liberation Organization is going to overthrow the monarchy. They expel the Palestinians. The Palestinians end up in Lebanon. Tens of thousands of Palestinians, Palestinian terrorist groups begin firing rockets over into Israel from south Lebanon. In 1982, Menachem Begin launches a war in Lebanon. Israel ends up basically going all the way up to the capital of Beirut and nearly occupying the entire country. And then they end up withdrawing under international pressure in what is considered sort of a disastrous war for the state of Israel. As always, whenever Israel withdraws from a territory, terrorist groups take over and then threaten Israel. This is the constant pattern no matter. The only time this has not happened is with regard to withdrawal from the Sinai Desert, 1987. The Intifada breaks out. This is the Palestinians in the Judea and Samaria region. The reason that I use the term student's memory is they're more historically accurate. People call it the West Bank. Why? Because Jordan occupied it, and this is the West Bank of the Jordan River. So the only reason that it's referred to as the West Bank, which is really historically anomalous, it's on the east side of Israel, but it's on the West Bank of the Jordan. That's a holdover from the time when the Jordanians occupied this entire area. Again, no one cares that Jordan occupied, quote unquote, Palestinian land or the Egypt occupied, quote unquote, Palestinian land. They only care when Jews occupy historically Jewish land. That's when things start to get really hot and bothered. Of course. Anyway, the intifada breaks out in 1987. You get these widespread riots and violent confrontations and terrorist attacks all the way from 1987 to 1991. By this time, Yitzhak Rabin has taken over as prime Minister of Israel and pushed by George H.W. Bush. The government of the State of Israel starts negotiating with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which is a really weird shift considering Yasser Arafat is a master terrorist responsible for tons of murders on his hands. He, at this point has been expelled all the way to Tunis. Right. He's not even in the picture. And Israel brings him out of retirement, basically, and says, why don't we negotiate with you and maybe you can make all of this stop. So in 1993, they signed the Oslo Accords, and that is where you get Bill Clinton presiding over one of the least successful international negotiations in the history of international politics. The Oslo Accords have been a complete and utter failure that ends with Yitzhak Rabin, who is this historic general who has been prime minister of Israel a couple of times by this point, shaking hands with a mass murdering terrorist, Yasser Arafat. And this is going to initiate a new period of health and accord and there's going to be peace. All that the PLO had to do was acknowledge that Israel existed and had a right to exist, stop educating their children in terrorism and cease the violence. They couldn't do any of those things. Right. So none of that happened. Instead, there's an uptick in violence, pretty dramatic uptick in violence. After the Oslo Accords in 1998. Israel again attempts to make some sort of concessions to the Palestinians, this time under the first tenure of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel does not want to govern these areas. Israel is not interested in governing millions of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Orange danger. Mary, the last thing they want to do is have their soldiers wandering around these dangerous areas or to preside over these areas. All they want and all Israel has ever wanted is to separate off from these particular areas and say, listen, you guys rule yourselves, like just stop bothering us, please, okay? And you'll see that this is the continued pattern. 2000 Israel engages in the Camp David, negotiate. Bill Clinton is still president at this point and the prime minister of Israel is now a guy named Ehud Barak. And Ehud Barak is a real dove. Ehud Barak wants to make as many concessions as humanly possible. Right. This picture here, which is just an unbelievable picture, Bill Clinton and Ehud Barak trying to push Yasser Arafat into negotiating right there. All joking. And they're all happy and all this can grab. Ehud Barak offered everything. Ehud Barak offered complete control over the Temple Mount with just like a little bit of a recognition that Israel has a historic claim religiously to the Temple Mount. Arafat turned down flat. He offered control over virtually all of Judea and Samaria. He offered control over the Gaza Strip. A Palestinian state boom done. Arafat does not even negotiate. He just launches a massive round of violence. I remember this because I was actually in Israel right about the time they launched the intifada, and there were suicide bombings on a fairly regular basis. They blew up a sparrows pizza shop. I was supposed to be at that corner like a couple of hours later. This was a thing that was really scary. It was really violent. Remember, he launched that not after Israel did something aggressive. He launched that after Israel offered him everything he could possibly want if he weren't a damn liar who just wanted Israel wiped off the map. This, again, is the great lie is that there is desire for a two state solution from the Palestinian side. So far there has been no evidence whatsoever that this is the case. Okay, 2004, Arafat dies and Mahmoud Abbas takes over. Mahmoud Abbas is himself a terror supporter. He wrote his entire doctoral dissertation on Holocaust denial and why it's correct, Israel in 2005 under the auspices of Ariel Sharon, who's one of the great hawks in Israeli history. He was the general in the 1973 war who ended up pushing all the way down close to Cairo. It is called The Bulldozer. Is this famous general unilateral he withdraws from the Gaza Strip. There are bunch of Jewish areas right in the northern tip of the Gaza Strip. Jewish soldiers went in and removed Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip. These are places people have lived for decades. They remove them and they just turn them over to the Palestinians. Hamas, a terrorist group, immediately Russian and burned everything. They burned the greenhouses, They burned all the Jewish houses. They knocked down all the good infrastructure and then they just took over the place. This is when you start to see a difference emerging among the Palestinians in terms of governance. You got Judaism, Mary, the West Bank here, you've got the Gaza Strip here in 2005, Abbas wins the Palestinian elections, but only because Hamas and Islamic Jihad boycott the elections in 2006 after Israel withdraws from Gaza. Remember, Israel's not in control of anything here. Now, Hamas wins an election. So the first move is not, look, Israel wants to make concessions and make peace with us. The first move is why don't we elect a terrorist group to actually represent us? Okay. In 2008, Israel's response to this is what if we just offer you everything? So who? Olmert becomes prime minister of Israel and he proceeds to offer everything to Abbas. He gives him basically the same offer, but better than the offer. The Barak gave in 2000. He offers everything. He offers Jordan's merit. He he says, we're going to keep some of the big Israeli settlements that exist here, but we're gonna give you land swaps. You can keep the Gaza Strip, everything. Abbas does not even bother to issue a counteroffer. He just walks away from the table and launches violence. Gaza War begins, 2008 missiles flying in from Gaza. This is the first Gaza war. Israel has to go in an operation Cast Lead and shut that down. 2014. This breaks out again. Another giant rocket attack from Hamas in Gaza. Israel has to go back in 2014 and shut it down. And that brings us to today, 2021, another Gaza war in which Hamas has decided to launch rockets at the state of Israel. The real reason for that has nothing to do with land disputes in Jerusalem. The real reason has to do with the fact that Mahmoud Abbas was about to hold an election in April. He canceled it because he knew he was going to lose to Hamas. As always, the best way to garner support when it appears that you're about to go down is to start blaming the Jews and start trying to kill them. You can start an arms race between yourself and Hamas on how many Jews they can kill. So that brings us to where we are right now. In 2021, a few decades ago, private citizens used to be largely that private. Well, I changed the Internet. Think about everything you browse or search for, watched or tweeted. Now imagine all of that data being crawled through and collected and aggregated by third parties into a permanent public record. Your record having your private life exposed for others to see.

Fatah, which is the military wing of the Palestinian Authority, is a terrorist group as well. And Islamic Jihad, you have three terrorist groups running this area right here. And again, Israel has no interest in running those areas. It's the last thing that Israel really wants. It's the reason why Israel has not gone and re invaded these areas or thrown Hamas out. They don't want their soldiers in these particular areas. What Israel has done because they don't wish to be involved in these full scale wars is they've developed the Iron Dome system. So the Iron Dome system is really an incredible piece of technology. So Hamas has been firing rockets at the center of Israel. Israel is a very, very tiny state. If you were to fire a rocket from the Gaza Strip to Jerusalem, about 90 seconds warning before the rocket hits Tel Aviv, which is up here, if you hit Tel Aviv, that's again the 92nd warning. If you're in Ashkelon, which are down here, you're getting 15, 30 seconds warning before the rockets into Israel develops this incredible technology called Iron Dome. This is what an Iron Dome battery looks like. You can see that they load up the battery with a bunch of essentially anti-missile missiles. That's what they are. There is an enemy rocket that is fired. Israel has these very precise radar systems that track the rocket launches. Then there's a control system that estimates the impact point where it's going to hit and then they fire a launcher to intercept the missile. And it doesn't bother defending against rockets. They're going to land in the middle of nowhere. They have these batteries that are set up in all of Israel's major cities. Iron Dome is basically a technological miracle. They're hitting a bullet with a bullet and they're doing so with no time to basically figure out how to do it. It's right now succeeding about 90% rate, which means, by the way, that Israel gets to be nicer to Hamas and it otherwise would be because if all these rockets were actually hitting all the populated areas of Israel, Israel just eviscerate Hamas like any other state, it would have no choice but to go in on the ground and just finish the job, which is why if Hezbollah in the north and the northern Lebanese border decides that it wants to launch war against Israel, they have way more ordnance than Hamas does. And so Israel would be forced to go in full scale and just do what it would have to do. Israel is being incredibly pinpointed about the way that it deals with this conflict is dropping, not bombs on top of buildings, their bombs that basically shake the buildings. They get out and then they bomb the building after everybody gets out. They're calling building managers and telling them to leave. We have tape of them telling building managers, clear the building and the building managers being like, well, we don't want to. And the Israeli saying, well, yeah, but they're kids inside and the building manager being like, okay, well, if you kill kids then it's a good propaganda win for us too. Unbelievable. And yet somehow the world sees some sort of moral equivalence there. Now, there are some international political implications that have changed in the recent past with regard to Israel. I've dealt with just specifically here, the Israeli Palestinian conflict. But one of the things that has happened that is really quite massive is that if you go back there, Israel currently has a cold peace with Egypt. Israel has kind of a cold peace with Jordan. And because the Obama administration really has strengthened Iran, the three no's of Khartoum, which you'll remember, were no peace, no recognition, no negotiation. They've completely disappeared for a wide variety of Arab states which have decided, guess what, the Jews aren't our enemy. Iran is our enemy. And so this is how you ended up with the Abraham Accords, where the UAE and Bahrain and Morocco, all of which have been supportive of these various wars of extinction against the Jewish state, have now decided that they are going to form a quite warm peace with Israel and recognize Israel's existence that fundamentally change the math on the ground. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is trying to walk that back by attempting to provide support to the radicalized Palestinian government of Fatah or of the Hamas or of or of Islamic Jihad. All righty. So let's talk about what exactly happened in the last couple of months that resulted in this round of of new violence. Why don't we begin with the Abraham Accords? The Abraham Accords were this monumental shift in how people thought about the Middle East. So for decades, the conventional wisdom is there will not be peace between Israel and all these surrounding Arab states. It's the reason they call it the Israeli Arab conflict, as opposed to Israel versus the Palestinians, because it was supposed to implicate all of these various countries because of the three no's of Khartoum. The idea was that until Israel made some sort of deal with the Palestinians, there would never be peace in the region ever. No one could ever recognize the presence of Israel until Israel made concessions to the Palestinians. And so under that impression, Israel kept being like, okay, we'll make this concession and this concession and this concession, and Palestinians kept being like, Well, okay, we'll take those concessions. And also, we're not going to do any of the things that you want us to do. So this was completely exploded by the Trump administration and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and mostly, ironically, by Barack Obama. So during the Obama administration, there was a real shift in how the United States treated Iran. So Iran has been threatening Israeli extinction since the Iranian revolution of 79. They've constantly been shouting Death to the Jews, death to America know, destroy the Zionist entity. This has been part of their pitch for a very long time. And now they were developing nuclear weapons. And so Barack Obama had this bizarre vision of the Middle East in which the United States would be able to minimize its presence by essentially setting up Iran as a counterbalance to Saudi Arabia. They would create this realpolitik situation in which Iran had been newly moderated in some bizarre way, and they pushed off the nuclear agenda just long enough to get those moderates in power. And then they would be welcomed into the family of nations and there would be the sort of balance of power between the Sunni and the Shia in the Middle East. And that would solve all problems. This is Barack Obama's new idea. It was a terrible idea because as it turns out, there are no moderates in the government of Iran. It is run by the mullahs. This whole fake notion that the moderates were going to be emboldened by U.S. concessions is complete crap. So the Iranians continue in secret to foster their nuclear development. The Iranians take all the money that the United States is now allowing Iran to receive and spreading terrorism all over the region. So if we had a bigger map of the Middle East, what you would see is that down to the tip of Saudi Arabia is Yemen. And so there's a proxy war going on between Saudi Arabia and Iran in Yemen. The Houthis, which are an Iranian backed terrorist group, are fighting Saudi backed groups in Yemen. And it's led to tremendous death. The United States had basically under Barack Obama, moved away from alliances with both Israel and with Saudi Arabia. And it moved toward this sort of bizarre warmth with Iran, which is a state that wishes fully to destroy both Saudi Arabia and Israel. Well, this forced Saudi Arabia into saying, wait a second, our enemies here are not the Jews. They just don't care about us. Jews are not bothering us. The Jews don't want anything from us. The Jews just want to live there. And here we have this Iranian state that's actually trying to blow up our oil resources and destroy our country. And what be awesome is if we could form some sort of kind of covert alliance. And so all of these Saudi sort of proxy states, including the UAE and Bahrain and all the other Sunni states in the region decided, wait a second, our enemy is not the Jews, our enemy is the Iranians. And so they started fostering relations in kind of covert ways with the Israelis, to the point where even during the Obama administration there was talk about how Israel might use Saudi Arabian airspace in order to strike Iran, which is located over here on the map. There's all this kind of new ties that are being forged, the new Egyptian regime, which is a regime that had been Muslim Brotherhood. The Muslim Brotherhood took over after the Arab Spring that was much vaunted. It was supposed to heal the world. And all of this really didn't. The Muslim Brotherhood was ousted. General al-Sisi took over in Egypt. He's been much friendlier with Israel. The Saudis have been much friendlier with Israel. Then along comes the Trump administration and they decide they're going to turn decades of conventional wisdom about the Israeli-Palestinian issue and a central city on their head. So the idea was, if you can force Israel is making enough concessions, and if you just stop them from saying that they like Jerusalem and they want to keep Jerusalem, if you just stop them from doing all this, maybe, maybe you will wheedle the entire Muslim world into accepting Israel's presence. The Trump administration comes along like not this is this nonsense. Okay, So we can see these burgeoning ties in Israel, these Arab countries. The Palestinian issue is a completely different issue. It's completely separate. So instead, here's what are going to do. Want to make very clear to everybody that we actually back Israel's right to exist and we back Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem and we back Israel sovereignty over the Golan Heights. We're going to take those off the table. The Arabs no longer have a right to expect that Israel is going to give that stuff up, because we say that we're not going to push them on that and we are going to foster ties between Israel and the UAE and Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and shock of shocks. It turns out that all these Arab nations decide our enemy ain't the Jews, our enemy is the Iranians. And so we really should foster ties with these folks and create the sort of new regional security bloc. And that's exactly what happened. Okay. Joe Biden takes over and Joe Biden decides to come on, man, and he says, we're going to ditch all of the progress that was just made. We're going to pretend the Abraham Accords never happened and we're going to start making overtures to Iran simultaneously. We are going to undo another Trump administration policy. So the Trump administration made very clear we are not going to pretend that we are honest brokers between Israel and a bunch of terrorist groups. Instead, we are just going to make clear our support for Israel and we're going to withdraw funding from, for example, Fatah and the Palestinian Authority and the UNRWA and Hamas. We're just going to take away the funding from these various organizations. Biden comes in, he says, I'm going to restore the status quo ante. I'm going to try and get back into the Iran deal and allow Iran to foster terrorism with U.S. taxpayer dollars and with us allowing money to flow into Iran. I'm going to restore aid to all these Palestinian terror groups. And so the Palestinians are like, okay, I guess now's a good time to push. And the Iranians are saying, okay, now is it now's a good time for us to push because we have an administration in power that obviously is not pro-Saudi, that is obviously not pro-Israel. So if we push a little bit, we'll see kind of where exactly how far we can push here. Factor number two is that the Palestinian Authority has not held an election since 2006. Mahmoud Abbas was last elected in 2005. He is now in the 16th year of a four year term. So when people talk about Israel's undemocratic and apartheid, 20% of Israel is Arab. They're Arabs who sit on the Supreme Court. There's a major party called Ra'am, which is part of the Israeli Knesset. It's just a lie that Israel is an apartheid state. The true apartheid state is the Palestinian Authority and Hamas zero Jews live there and they've not held an election in any of these areas for nearly two decades. So Abbas, in an attempt to appease the Biden administration and the incoming Democratic power base in the United States and the international community, he wants to show that he's legit. We're going to hold an election, says Mahmoud Abbas, who is now who's, I believe, 80 years old. It turns out nobody likes Mahmoud Abbas. So Hamas looked like it was about to take over, not just the Gaza Strip, but also the West Bank, Judea and Samaria. And so like a couple of weeks before the election, Abbas, like, you know what, bad idea, no elections. And knowing that this is going to set off a conflagration, Abbas starts pushing violence against Israel, the Fatah, who control all television in the West Bank. They start putting out videos about how it's good if you can kill a Jew. They start really ramping up a lot of the anti-Israel rhetoric. There are a bunch of incidents in which tick tock videos are taken of Palestinian youths in Jerusalem beating up Jews, and these are being celebrated. So there are a couple of pretexts that are that are used in order to redirect from I'm canceling the election too. It's all the Israeli's fault. So in the it's all the Israelis fault category there, particularly two issues that they've been pushing. One is that the Palestinians were barred from entry via the Damascus gate, which is a gate into Jerusalem entry to the Temple Mount. Now, there were some roadblocks placed there because Israel is afraid that people are going to congregate and riot, which they promptly did as soon as Israel removed the roadblocks. So Israel removed the roadblocks, people congregated, they rioted, they did violence. This was used as a pretext to say that Israel was restricting access to the Temple Mount. I've been to the Temple Mount. Muslims have full and free reign over the Temple Mount. The Islamic Waqf controls the temple and they have. Since 1967, Israel won back all of the old city of Jerusalem, including the Temple Mount and Moshe Dayan, who is the general of the Israeli army at the time. He handed over the keys to the Temple Mount, to the Islamic Waqf. And so Jews are not allowed to pray openly on the Temple Mount right now, which is insane. The Muslims complained that on the one hand worship wasn't being allowed there. Not true, 100% not true. During the middle of this chaos, by the way, 100,000 Muslims went up there during Ramadan at the end of Ramadan to pray on the Temple Mount. It doesn't sound like a very good restriction of religious rights there. And so a bunch of Fatah and Hamas members take over Al-Aqsa mosque. They bring in rocks from the surrounding area, they bring in projectiles, they start throwing in the police. They put Hamas flags on the top of the Al-Aqsa mosque. It's a terrorist group, a genocidal terrorist group. They start attacking the Israeli police. When the Israeli police go and shut it down, then they say, Israel is being aggressive in the Al-Aqsa mosque. That's why we need to start firing missiles. That is reason number one. It's a pretext and it's a lie. Reason number two is this long standing legal dispute over an area of Jerusalem known as Sheikh Jarrah. Sheikh Jarrah is sort of an outskirt of Jerusalem. It's a little suburb. It's known by Jews Shimon and Siddiq. It's known by Arabs as Sheikh Jarrah. Hey, so in the 1870s, there were a bunch of Jews who arrived in this area of Jerusalem, and they bought up a bunch of plots of land, and she might have said she might have. Saadiq is a tall, middle class age, and so his grave is supposed to be there. So Jews bought a lot of the territory that are right, Right. They have all the legal land built and all of that heavy Jewish population in Sheikh Jarrah. Up until the 1948 war, the 1948 war happens. And as mentioned, Jordan takes over this entire arena, including the old city of Jerusalem, and they proceed to put barbed wire there. And Jews aren't allowed in freedom of worship. The whole deal during that time, the Jordanian government hands over to some people in Sheikh Jarrah, a legal title to those homes. They say, We took this over. Here's a title. You own the home now. Some people, they didn't give legal title. For whatever reason, it got caught up in the bureaucracy or these people they didn't particularly like. For whatever reason, they don't have the legal title to those homes. Israel in the 67 war wins back Sheikh Jarrah and all the people who had the legal title. They're like, okay, well, I guess you live there now. All the people who didn't have legal title, the people who are the previous landowners came with the legal title and they said, okay, this is our land. We want our house back. And the Israeli courts came up with a solution. And the solution was you can continue to live in the house, but you have to pay rent to the people who own the legal title, which frankly is not a bad solution. For 50 years, the Palestinians were living there no pay rent for 50 years. So the Arizona signs of these particular land titles decide, you know what, we actually would like to knock down these four houses and we want to build an apartment complex there. This is what this whole thing is about, supposedly, which it isn't, is the normal real estate dispute over eviction in terms of rent and all of this and Israeli court fines. Okay, Well, they haven't paid rent, so they're going to be evicted. This is held up. Right. The Israeli government says we're not going to implement this right now. We want this to go all the way to the Supreme Court. It'll be adjudicated there. This is used as a pretext by the Palestinians to riot. It is used as a pretext by Hamas to fire rockets into the area. And the suggestion is this is Israel being aggressive in engaging in ethnic cleansing, which is weird because there are plenty of there are families living in Sheikh Jarrah are not being evicted because either they paid the rent or B, they actually had the legal land titles in the homes in which they were living. East Jerusalem is still extremely heavily Arab. For a country that's being accused of ethnic cleansing, Israel is markedly incompetent at ethnic cleansing. Considering that the population of Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem has vastly and exponentially increased over the course of the last 50 years, those are the pretext for the conflict. The actual reason for the conflict is Abbas canceled the elections. He ramped up the violence, and Hamas in competition said, okay, well, Fatah is going to ramp up the violence. We can't be left out, man. A party is a party. And so they start firing rockets into Israel in civilian centers. Now, Hamas does because they're a terrorist group, as they put all of their rockets in civilian areas to try and stop Israel from attacking them because they know that Israel actually cares about civilians, whereas they do not. A lot of the foreign aid that was being granted and given to Hamas was not being used for actual aid. It was not being used for electricity or water. Israel's been providing electricity and water to the Gaza Strip for free for years. Hamas didn't use any of this money to actually build up infrastructure or help people. They used it to build these giant terrorist tunnels and stock up on rockets. These rockets, by the way, are being provided by the same Iranian government that the American government is currently attempting to negotiate with under Joe Biden, which makes no sense at all. It's also the reason why, by the way, why 200 Democrats just voted last week that they would not place sanctions on any company that doing business with Hamas or donating money to Hamas. There's a bill in 2019, identical bill said cut off funding to any company that does business with Hamas. It passed unanimously in the House. Now that Joe Biden is president and trying to negotiate with Iran, 200 Democrats voted it down and never saw the light of day in the House of Representatives. That is where things currently stand. Israel is attempting to do what it can to wipe out Hamas's capacity to to fire rockets indiscriminately at its civilian population without having to actually do a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip because, frankly, there are no good solutions there. If Israel goes in and wipes out Hamas, then maybe Islamic Jihad takes over, maybe Fatah takes over, maybe the next level of Hamas takes over. The only thing that has actually guaranteed peace in the region at all for any prolonged period of time was, in fact, Israeli troops on the ground staffing these areas. But Israel doesn't want to be there. And so the two alternatives historically have been Israel has to subject itself every few years to a barrage of rocket attacks, go in, knock out some infrastructure, you get a couple of years of peace. Same thing happens in a couple of years. Or you have to have a long term, quote unquote, occupation in which Israel basically attempts to pacify by keeping a certain baseline level of troops in a particular area. So as you see, it took a very long time just for me to go through the basic history of this conflict. And that's the very basic history of this conflict. There's a lot more there. There are a lot of resources out there. But suffice it to say, the media members who try to boil this down to just a border dispute or try to suggest that this is just a matter of Benjamin Netanyahu, it's coming from ignorance and it's coming from stupidity. Do your reading before you bother to comment on the situation. One of the things that you will have noted in the news is that every time there's an uptick in the violence in this particular region that involves Israel, there's widespread anti-Semitic attacks that happen all over the world. You're seeing it happen right now. Every place from L.A. to New York to Europe. And there's this argument that's constantly made by people, particularly on the left. Well, if Israel didn't exist, wouldn't there be less anti-Semitism? Well, first of all, as we've talked, you have to ignore every bit of history from 136 all the way to 1948 to get to that point. There's something quite ironic about somebody beating a Jew in the street over Israel, saying if Israel didn't exist, I would stop beating this Jew. The reality is that not every criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic, Of course, just like not every criticism of the United States is anti-American, but every anti-Semite is anti-Israel, every single one. And there's a heavy crossover between anti-Zionism and antisemitism, for sure."
165,5AJlfW0g2rk,Noam Chomsky - The Israel/Palestine Conflict I,"From April, 2002.",2014-12-02,983271,27681,3459,UCHuLYgw4dGbC2BuZQqPWV1g, this is the 35th year of a harsh brutal and vicious occupation supported unilaterally by the united states constant terror and atrocities suppose palestinians say well we're under terrorist attack for 35 years therefore we have a right to carry out suicide bombings do you accept this does anybody accept it nobody accepts all right then how come everyone accepts the israeli claim to be doing it which is much weaker claim because after all there's no symmetry in this situation they are the military occupiers palestine isn't occupying israel and this isn't just started now it's going on years ago i mean so does that in your mind justify so much of course those who defend suicide bombing and they're very few uh have not don't have a leg to stand on those who defend the israeli atrocities including the u.s government most intellectual opinion a good bit of the west generally yeah they don't have a leg to stand on either and it's and they have a much weaker position for 35 years there has been a harsh brutal miserable military occupation there has not been a political settlement the reason why there has not been a political settlement is that the united states unilaterally has blocked it for 25 years is it supported by the entire world including the majority of the american people the answer to that question is yes there is a political settlement that has been supported by virtually the entire world including the arab states the plo europe eastern europe canada didn't barack put that on the table no he did not he did not what this that is also supported by the majority of the american people it has just been reiterated by saudi arabia the u.s has unilaterally blocked it for 25 years what barack put on the table the the population doesn't know this because people like the western media the media and canada and the united states don't tell them like you can check and see how often you you for example or others have reported what i just said i don't bother checking the answer is zero uh the barack proposal in camp david in the barack clinton proposal in the united st i didn't check the canadian media in the united states you cannot find a map which is the most important thing of course check in canada and see if you can find a map you go to israel you can find a map you can go to scholarly sources you can find a map here's what you find when you look at a map you find that this generous magnanimous proposal guaranteed provided israel with a salient east of jerusalem including the city of malaya du mim which was established primarily by the labor government and clinton in order to bisect the west bank that sailing goes almost to jericho breaks the west bank into two cantons then there's a second set into the north going to the israeli settlement of ariel which bisects the northern part into two cantons so we've got three cantons in the west bank virtually separated all three of them are separated from a small area of east jerusalem which is the center of palestinian commercial and cultural life and of communication so you got four cantons all separated from the west from gaza so that's five cantons all surrounded by uh israeli settlements infrastructure development and so on which also incidentally guarantee israel control of the water resources the reason last comment this does not rise to the level of south africa 40 years ago when south africa established the bantu stands that's the generous magnanimous offer okay and there's a good reason why maps weren't shown because as soon as you look at the map you see it all right however that's the characterization of it but let me just say arafat didn't even bother putting a counter proposal on the table that's not true they negotiated that afterwards that's not true but i i guess my question is if they don't continue to do that that's totally false not only is it false but not a single participant in the meetings says it that's a media fabrication they had a proposal they proposed the international consensus which has been accepted by the entire world the arab states the plo the majority of the american sorry they proposed a settlement which is in accord with an overwhelming international council my question is and it's blocked by the united states the problem that people look at now the middle east is they say it spun out of control how do you get back to the first wave first way we get back is by trying the experiment of minimal honesty okay let's try that experiment if we try the experiment of minimal honesty we look at our own position and we discover what i just described that for 25 years the united states has blocked the political settlement which is supported by the majority of the american population and by the entire world except for israel virtually i mean there's some marginal exceptions uh so for first thing we do is accept the honesty to look at that we take a look at camp david uh and we see yeah it was the same uh the united states was still proposing demanding a bantu stands to style settlement and rejecting the overwhelming international consensus and the position of the american people we then discover that the united states immediately moved to enhance terror in the region so let's continue on september 29th ahud barak put a massive military presence outside the al-aqsa mosque very provocative when people came out of the mosque uh young people started throwing stones these early armies started shooting half a dozen people were killed and escalated the next couple of days uh there was no palestinian fire at this time and it's all in occupied territories in the next couple of days uh israel used us helicopters israel produces no helicopters use u.s helicopters to attack civilian complexes killing about a dozen people and wounding several dozen clinton reacted to that on october 3rd by making the biggest deal in a decade to send israel new military helicopters which had just been used for the purpose i described and of course would continue to be the u.s press cooperated with that by refusing to publish the story to this day they have not published the fact it continued when bush came in one of his first acts was to send israel a new shipment of the most advanced military helicopters in the arsenal that continues right up to a couple of weeks ago with new shipments you take a look at the reports from say janine by british correspondents like peter beaumont and the london observer he says the worst atrocity there was the apache helicopters buzzing around destroying and demolishing everything this is enhancing terror and we may easily continue uh we can take also let me continue on december 15th 14th uh the security council tried to pass a resolution uh calling for what everyone recognizes to be the obvious means for reducing terror namely sending international monitors that's a way of reducing terror this happened to be in the middle of a quiet period which lasted for about three weeks the u.s vetoed it uh ten days before that there was a meeting at geneva of the high contracting parties of the fourth geneva convention uh which has unanimously held for 35 years that it applies to israel uh it the meeting uh condemned the israeli settlements as illegal condemned a list of atrocities uh willful destruction of property murder uh trials torture and so on and so forth so okay what happened to that meeting or i'll tell you what happened to that meeting the u.s boycotted it therefore the media refused to publish it therefore no one here knows that the united states once again enhance terror by refusing to recognize the applicability of conventions which make virtually everything the united states and the uh israel are doing there a a grave breach of the geneva conventions which means a war crime just a minute these conventions were established uh in 1949 in order to criminalize the atrocities of the nazis in occupied territory they are customary international law the united states is obligated as a high contracting party to prosecute violations of those conventions that means to prosecute its own leadership for the last 25 years

Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/France24_en",2021-05-20,10927,127,76,UCQfwfsi5VrQ8yKZ-UWmAEFg, but i wanted to to to make two remarks about things that were said before um first of all uh the worst violence between israel and the palestinians um is around the territory with no settlements and no israeli presence um and the second thing is that is if if uh gaza is close to the world it's not only because of israel but it could be also because egypt closed the the border and there was never a question of firing rockets or putting pressure on egypt even if the egyptians could have changed the situation dramatically in five minutes just you know opening like between france and belgium for example and just explain to our viewers on that score uh so it's the egyptians it's the egyptians who are playing the mediators why ah because because they uh they um they have an interest in keeping the the role of the mediator with between israel and uh and hamas it gives them power they they are not interested in in in a conflict in in gaza they are they are interested in in peace and quiet they don't want a palestinian state because they were they were the occupying force between 49 and 67 and just like the jordanians they didn't even dream of giving the the the palestinians what they support the palestinians today so between 49 and 67 when arabs were occupying the territories no one no one demanded that this territory has become a palestinian state they were talking only about what was in israel at the time uh now in in in in the summer of 2005 israel decided uh in a mutually accepted unilateral uh withdrawal to give a chance uh to the palestinian authority the palestinian authority will be no we're not we don't agree but they will take the territory and you know those who the dreamers at the time thought it was going to be something like singapore and that will create a new dynamic well the palestinians decided to vote for hamas in january of 2006 at four months after the israeli withdrawal they voted for the hamas and the first thing the hamas did with the power was to dig the tunnel through which they abducted the soldier shalit and put fire in gaza it was the first round of violence in gaza and they they this crisis tempted hezbollah so it was also the trigger for the long war in lebanon in 2006 and at this point hezbollah killed the israeli peace camp and opened the way for the longest reign of the right in israel with i don't want to go look we're short on time i don't want to go back to the genesis of it all the accusations it's 15 years no but there's the accusation as well that israel will uh at one point bolstered hamas uh never as a a as a counterfeit a counterforce against fatah in back in the day but neuro day i don't want to talk about history i want to ask you at this point in time today what is the role of egypt and what is egypt's responsibility just for the sake of clarity for the viewers the united nations still considers israel to be the occupying power in the gaza strip it has absolute power over gaza's airspace and borders just so that we're clear because there were too many inaccuracies to respond to in in your guests remarks egypt has a strategic interest in making sure that the this uh aggression ends it has absolutely no interest in seeing the already the catastrophic humanitarian crisis further deteriorate and quite frankly being a major player in the region and maintaining that role and that it has done um as expected um so the the you know the egyptian role will always be extremely important in ensuring uh peace and stability why aren't they opening the border permanently why is israel not respecting its obligations israel is the occupying power and gaza is part of the occupied territory it's not part of egypt but what is why is it i don't understand that is available humanitarian assistance does cross through egypt egypt has opened its hospitals to palestinians injured by israeli strikes egypt has sent its ambulances and palestinians will always be grateful for that the responsibility the onus under international law is on israel to make sure that the connection the contiguity of the palestinian territory is not disrupted the connection with the west bank is not severed and that is on israel not on egypt egypt will remain a very important player in palestinian politics in the palestinian struggle for freedom but that does not abrogate the responsibilities that are defined under international law of israel of high contracting parties of permanent members of the security council including the us and france and others you see mecklenburg your thoughts on this i i must admit if i need to be disingenuous that the fact that israel has responsibility even if it's withdraw i absolutely agree i don't think even the palestinian sovereignty sees what is just been said about about the whole role of egypt there is plenty of criticism among uh among the palestinian authority and among palestinians and gaza on the role of the egyptian because the egyptian are coordinating their own what they are doing with the israelis and not with the palestinians so let's put it on the table let me also say something about 2005 because this is really inaccurate and it's important to the way we look it now there is a clue in the name it was unilateral with law and this was the arrogance of not coordinating that with the palestinian authority could that be possible it was possible it was possible there and it should have been done and at the time the grand strategy the grand plan of ariel sharon was not only to withdraw unilaterally from gaza but do exactly the same in the west bank because he decided that he could actually draw the borders and future borders between the israelis and the palestinians without negotiating it and this is unacceptable in diplomacy this will never be sustainable if you behave so arrogantly even if someone that you regard as your enemy because this enemy is supposed to be your your your your neighbor the very next the very next day and this that's that's what's the mistake that sharon did uh it was a typical mistake workshop we should have learned with this the same goes for him david that it doesn't make the hamas nice in any way or form i don't think anyone of us here would like to see hamas in in power though it's for the palestinians decide who they want to be governed by but the fact is in order to reach a peace agreement we need both sides needs to negotiate in good faith if they are not going to do that in addition only one point you need an honest broker you need someone that can really be the only smoker between the two sides without it it's very difficult all right so you need you need a strong broker that can put pressure on both sides if he's honest it's you know nice to have okay as a strong broker or an honest broker
169,1kYWII25cxM,Can the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict be Solved? | History of Israel Explained | Unpacked,"Oct '23 Hamas-Israel War: youtube.com/watch?v=N1TXC9eQcJ4

This week, we’re asking a simple question - without a simple answer - why not end decades of fighting by creating a Palestinian state right alongside Israel?

The two-state solution might seem like a modern proposal, but over the years there have been plenty of attempts to establish an Arab state alongside a Jewish one.

In fact, there have been six recognizable attempts to establish a Palestinian state, that date back to before the War of Independence in 1948. 

So, why isn’t there a State of Palestine?

Like so many things, it all depends who you ask, with both sides blaming each other for the current circumstances...

Join us as we get to grips with this complicated situation, which seems to have no solution in sight.

#Westbank #idf #raids",2023-06-28,48134,536,0,UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg, the U.N security Council has urged Israel and the Palestinians to avoid actions that could further inflame tension in the occupied West Bank there is growing International concern about escalating violence that's been some of the deadliest in the region that it has seen in years DW correspondent Rebecca ritters went to the West Bank to talk to people on both sides of this conflict it was supposed to be what the Israeli military calls a routine operation [Music] soldiers rated Janine refugee camp to arrest suspected militants but they were met with unexpected resistance [Applause] violence in the israeli-occupied West Bank is taking on a new and worrying form this is the spot where a large roadside bomb was detonated damaging an Israeli vehicle as it was retreating from Janine camp and injuring several soldiers it's the first attack of its kind in several years and as a result the Israeli military say they may have to rethink their tactics balloon as ever it's civilians like gas and turkmen and his family who get caught up in the escalation sadio came down from the stairs and came here during that raid his teenage daughter was in their Courtyard when an Israeli military vehicle drove by she was uploading this video to Snapchat when the bullet came sadil was standing like this she was filming like this and then the bullet hit her here the Israeli military says it's investigating her family are convinced she was killed by Israeli gunfire elsewhere in the occupied West Bank there was more violence the Palestinian militant group Hamas says They carried out this attack in response to the raid in Janine two of their gunmen opened fire at this Roadside restaurant near the Jewish settlement of Le killing four Israeli citizens the attackers came from there one came here and the other one went over there he was first to be hit the girl he was with managed to run away thanks to God then the terrorists entered and fired inside another one of our students was hit in the leg by shrapnel despite the attacks and the risk to their lives these settlers say they aren't going anywhere but as you can see here on the top of the mountains this is one of the ancient place that was mentioned in the Bible in fact their intent on expansion We're Not Afraid we know that this is our homeland this is our home and you fight for your home and we'll do whatever is need to stay here to build to grow to add more life to add more green to those bare mountains after the restaurant shooting the government showed its continuing support for the settlers a day after the attack here in LA Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the authorization of a thousand new housing units here in the settlement a decision he said in his statement was a direct response to terrorism another response was this mobs of extreme settlers rampaged through Palestinian towns torching property and threatening residents sometimes in the presence of Israeli soldiers it's a further escalation in a cycle of violence that looks to be accelerating back in Janine Camp these Palestinian Fighters tell me the situation is getting worse they are trying to kill everybody if they can all over the camp they've been erecting these canopies an attempt to Blind Israeli surveillance drones while they buy their time and prepare for battle we're gonna fight as long as we can stand that's what's gonna happen they are using Rockets they're using planes they're using what all all their army but we we don't stop we are going to continue as long as we can stand if not us our children their children we will continue that's the feeling on both sides this was caused by an Israeli drone targeting militants the first aerial attack against Palestinians in the West Bank in a generation the next chapter in this bloody conflict is being written Here and Now and that was DW's Rebecca Ritter's reporting there and we should note that the Palestinian Hamas group is considered a terrorist organization by Germany the EU and the United States let's get more now we are joined by mirav zonshine she is an Israeli American journalist and a senior analyst on israeli-palestinian Affairs at the international crisis group thank you so much for joining us uh you've been covering this region for more than a decade now how do you assess the mood and the security situation in the occupied West Bank at the moment well I would say that the moon and security situation in the occupied West Bank is always quite bad and there are upticks and flows such as we are seeing now in which the rate of Palestinian casualties last year and this year is higher than probably in a decade due to uh you know continued Israeli raids and now we're also seeing that Israelis and settlers in the West Bank are also starting to once again um become casualties in this conflict Israel's current coalition government includes far-right parties who are supportive of settlers how challenging is de-escalation within this current political context um you know of course uh the Israeli government will say that it's interested in some kind of uh you know resolution down the line but uh netanyahu's National Security advisor recently said in an interview that part of the reason that noblus and Janine and the occupied West Bank have become um you know places of Palestinian when he calls Terror again are because there aren't Jewish settlements in those areas um so I you know I think Israeli policy of continued expansion continued occupation and de facto annexation is a huge driver of violence in this crisis if we focus on the Janine Camp itself and we have to mention that you're sharing your views here um if we're focusing on the Janine Camp Palestinian militants used a roadside bomb against an Israeli raid is that use likely to deter the Israeli military from entering the camp or could it have the opposite effect I mean we're talking here about uh the strongest military power in the Middle East up against an occupied population um and Israel has become quite accustomed in the last decade to very little or no resistance and they're also Palestinian authorities has lost much of its uh Power and ability and legitimacy so you have you know a situation in which two sides are not equal um and in in that Paradigm uh you know Palestinians who who can arm themselves are arming themselves and will try to resist and I believe Israel will continue to up uh it's you know its its ability to what it sees as rooting out Terror so I think this will only escalate I don't think it will deter either side yeah exactly the Israelis would say that they're they're rooting out Terror each side has their own arguments in in this context um when we look at the overall picture now it's two decades since the second intifada uh the Palestinian Uprising how confident are you that we're not heading now for a third well I think the framing of a third and two fata is problematic because of the fragmentation and the the extent to which Israel has managed to um fragment and divide the Palestinian communities the you know between Gaza the West Bank Jerusalem Palestinian citizens of Israel you know elections were supposed to be held in May 2021 they were called off they haven't been held um so talking about a third in tifada is problematic in the sense that Palestinians don't have the ability to organize efficiently on a political level much less on an armed level so I think you're going to see chaos and if you think that chaos is a third and two fata then that you know you could call it that but what we're seeing is definitely an entrenchment of patterns that we've seen for decades now and unfortunately I you know I don't see it getting better or de-escalating thank you very much for joining us to share your view as we mentioned you have been covering this crisis for the past decade mayor of Zone Shine from the international crisis group we appreciate it
173,Tz7JJcO-rWw,The Balfour Declaration explained,Here's why the Balfour Declaration is important to understanding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.,2017-11-03,136434,2909,564,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg," it's been 100 years since the British government issued the Balfour Declaration a document that would later become a cornerstone for the creation of the State of Israel but why is Britain celebrating its colonial legacy while glossing over the hundred years of conflict that followed let's go back to November 2nd 1917 when British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour sent a letter to Lord Walter Rothschild a leader in the British Zionist Federation Balfour's letter expressed sympathy for Jewish Zionist aspirations at the heart of Zionism a political ideology calling for Jews to return to Palestine the Balfour Declaration said the UK would use their best endeavours to facilitate the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine so on that date Zionism became an official objective of Britain's foreign policy but the British had no legal authority to establish a home or a state for anyone and lands that they didn't own a land where 92 percent of the local population were Muslims and Christians who were never consulted and even though they didn't own the land the British would soon control it the lines on the map were in flux that's because well world war 1 was going on and British Allied troops were advancing on Palestine just a few weeks after the Balfour Declaration was issued British general Edmund Allenby conquered Jerusalem the British prime minister at the time David Lloyd George called its capture a Christmas present for the British people during the war the UK made a number of promises that it wouldn't keep him one was - the Sharif of Mecca Hussein Banali he's the great great grandfather of Jordan's King Abdullah the second written promised their support for a single independent and unified Arab state and in return he agreed to be part of the revolt against the Ottoman Caliphate a second commitment was made to France under a secret agreement between colonial powers to divide up the Middle East between them under the sykes-picot agreement Palestine would be an international zone but the agreement wasn't honored later on Britain wanted Palestine for itself then came the third commitment to the British Zionist Federation now this is the one that the British actually honor its ambiguous language created problems but it was a deliberate choice to use the word home rather than state in the Declaration each of the five official drafts of the declaration were carefully reviewed by the foreign office the Zionist project in Palestine was one way for the British government to resolve the problem of growing anti-semitism in Europe it would also protect Britain's interests throughout the region after the war the five colonial powers at the time the UK France Italy the u.s. and Japan gave Britain a mandate for Palestine the British government and the Zionist movement made sure it included the wording of the Balfour Declaration it then became international law and the Balfour Declaration became a legal obligation for Britain the British Mandate of Palestine would last for thirty years a land that was called Palestine by Europeans Palestine by Arabs and Eretz Israel or Land of Israel in Hebrew there's a part of the Balfour Declaration that's often forgotten it backs the idea of a Jewish home provided that nothing would be done to harm the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine in fact in 1917 only 8% of the population of Palestine were Jewish for much of the 1920s and 30s the British facilitated Jewish immigration to Palestine automatically granting each newly arrived Jewish immigrant with the Palestinian passport and as the demographics changed resentment grew between the Jewish and Arab communities of Palestine and towards their occupiers the British when Britain decided to leave in May of 1948 the Zionist paramilitary army was ready with the plan to colonize all of historic Palestine we're talking about a large scale ethnic cleansing more than 700,000 local Palestinians were kicked out of their ancestral homes hundreds of Arab villages were razed to the ground and 15,000 Palestinians were killed that year in several massacres all this happened while tens of thousands of British soldiers were still in Palestine Zionists declared their own state on May 14 1948 and began the process of wiping the word Palestine off them and deleting it from the historic record and that continues to this day 12 million descendants of those indigenous Palestinians refer to Israel's violent birth as Al Nakba or the catastrophe and every year when Israelis celebrate their state Palestinians mark the systematic destruction of their society so British celebrations of the Balfour Declaration are as problematic as the declaration itself the British government is proud of its colonial legacy even though it opened Pandora's box putting in motion events that would lead to future wars between its allies and while celebrating this British declaration Israel cannot escape its own colonial past which continues to the present Palestinians and Arabs call the Balfour Declaration one of the most shameful documents ever created by a colonial power they're demanding that Britain apologize for it not celebrate it"
174,CoFjbnvkmQ0,Israel&#39;s Apartheid Against Palestinians: Cruel System of Domination and Crime Against Humanity,"TAKE ACTION HERE http://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2022/02/israels-system-of-apartheid 

Millions of Palestinians live under Israel’s system of apartheid, and at the heart of this violently racist system, is the Palestinian experience of being denied a home.  

For over 73 years, Israel has forcibly displaced entire Palestinian communities and demolished hundreds of thousands of Palestinians’ homes causing terrible trauma & suffering. Over 6 million Palestinians remain as refugees and today at least another 150,000 are at real risk of losing their homes.  

Israel has created and maintains laws, policies, and practices that deliberately oppress Palestinians and work to ensure Jewish Israeli domination across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). This includes racist seizures of property and planning laws and policies that make it impossible for many Palestinians to build homes. It also allows for mass demolitions of homes built without a permit, something that is routinely denied for Palestinians.  

Apartheid is a crime against humanity and is committed with the specific intent of maintaining a cruel system of control by one racial group over another. Every week, the Israeli authorities displace Palestinians through demolitions or forced evictions, which shows how Israel deliberately disadvantages Palestinians, giving them inferior status to Israeli Jews. 

With more stories coming to light and more people around the world mobilising against these injustices, now is the time for us to work together. As a first step, we must speak out for Palestinians living under Israel’s apartheid. We have the power to demolish this system even if it means one pillar at a time.

#News #Palestine #Gaza #Raid",2023-05-11,108947,927,902,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg, thank you for joining us we begin this NewsHour with Israel continuing to launch airstrikes on Gaza which has destroyed residential buildings in Khan Eunice there was a barrage of Rocket fire from Palestinian factions towards Israel in the early hours of Thursday morning which after a brief pause have continued in the past two hours the latest attacks have killed at least three Palestinians bringing the death toll to 27 in this recent escalation Palestinian media say most of the victims are women and children a funeral has been held in Gaza for a senior commander of the Islamic Jihad movement who was killed in last night's Israeli airstrikes Ali Hassan Gali was a member of the military Council and head of the rocket unit in the alcoots brigades well we have three correspondents across this story this R Mohamed Jam Jun is in West Jerusalem and he'll tell us about the prospects of a ceasefire villain Marx is in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon but first we go to yumnal side who's in Gaza City you know they've been new airstrikes on Gaza in the last hour yes Foley will Israeli airstrikes have and stopped actually taking part in different areas in Gaza again again most airstrikes are in the northern part and in the southern part both in hanones and rabba in the northern part in uh beitelahia and Beth hanoon now these are these uh parts are very adjacent to the borders uh on veteran and bet lahia and so the Israel airstrikes have continued to pound these areas for several hours this day the airstrikes you say have hit Northern parts of Gaza Gaza of course is a densely populated area and despite Israel saying that it's targeting Islamic Jihad positions I imagine that civilians are also being targeted in these strikes it's true I mean with the airstrikes uh and the the the rockets that are falling in these different areas uh there is always a destruction and Casualty is uh falling from the civilians yes these past hours at least these past two hours there hasn't been any casualties but there have been damages in the civilians homes uh also before that prior to that uh one of the airstrikes in bet hanoon caused some injuries among citizens that were rushed to hospital locals say that their injuries weren't serious injuries but this is how it is uh in a densely populated territory every airstrike has a very significant effect on the residential homes and building here for the population the funeral of Ali Gali the Islamic Jihad commander who was killed in last night's Israeli airstrikes drew a lot of people how are these uh killings I mean it's now the fourth Islamic Jihad member to be killed by Israel how is it affecting the group and how are they going to respond well yes uh Folly uh while he uh right after the killing of Ali rally there was a launching of rockets just an instant launching of rockets but then it has been a kosher skull about a couple of hours ago when he was buried there was a resuming to uh the launching of rockets but it was not like yesterday uh the launching uh by the Palestinian factions here it has been very uh very little but many are artillery shells have been fired towards uh the Karim Abu Salem Crossing from the Israeli side and and so it has been on mortar shells mainly but now uh uh Palestinian Islamic Jihad faction here in Gaza have stated that they are going to be responding to the assassination of the Ali rally in particular they said that they're in preparation and their response should not be delayed so we're still expecting to witness more launching of rockets we're expecting a certain amount and kind of retaliation for his killing Yuma thank you very much for that update you're not outside live there in Gaza City let's go to villain marks now who's in Asheville or near the border with Gaza in southern Israel tell us about what you've been seeing and hearing on that side of the Border villain or fully in the last 15 or 20 minutes we've seen at least one attempted interception by the Iron Dome defense mechanism the Israeli military operates just probably about a kilometer further behind us seemingly therefore trying to intercept a rocket coming from Gaza we've heard some much deeper uh boom sounding like artillery or potentially air strikes slightly further down towards the coastline from here inside Gaza as well one assumes and here people remain on high alert earlier this morning we did see people outside businesses were open cafes things like that people walking the streets there is still traffic on local roads but there have been Sirens sounding in smaller communities near here as well as a few kilometers down south from here the town of sterot so clearly these Rockets being fired from Gaza are having an impact the Israeli military talking about the potential according to Israeli media for reserves to be called up for recruitment around this area here in Gaza to try and strengthen what they call security coordination efforts Folly okay Willem thank you for update villain marks live in Ashkelon Mohammed jamjun is joining us now from West Jerusalem Muhammad we've heard talk of course about this possible ceasefire but given the latest developments and these continued airstrikes on Gaza it's difficult to see how the ceasefire is like likely to happen anytime soon foreign it certainly does look as though based on what we're seeing when it comes to rockets and and attacks it certainly doesn't look like a ceasefire is going to happen anytime soon but there's a lot of complicated negotiations going on behind the scenes the conventional wisdom here is that the Israeli government is still open to a ceasefire that they are still talking to Egyptian mediators uh but that there is a sticking point the sticking point we understand is that Islamic Jihad wants a commitment from Israel that if there is to be a ceasefire that the Israeli military will not Target any more leaders of Islamic Jihad for assassination of course over the course of the past two days we've seen four top commanders of Islamic Jihad assassinated by Israel in the Gaza Strip Israel is not willing to make that concession now last we heard from the Prime Minister from Benjamin Netanyahu was last night that was after he had a meeting a situational assessment with the defense minister joov Gallant as well as other members of his security cabinet he came out he made it clear that Israel was going to be the deciding party whether it comes to escalation or de-escalation so yes it is certainly looking like a ceasefire might be further off than we had initially assumed last night but based on the comments that are being made a lot of them unnamed but officials uh high up in the Israeli government to Israeli media based on the comments that we're seeing they do want a ceasefire to come into effect it's just that it's very complicated because of the demands on both sides and really right now it's going to be crucial hours the hours ahead as to whether there is further escalation whether that widens how many groups may be participating but it does seem clear that Israel does want to ceasefire it just at this point really there's no way to tell when that might happen Foley thank you very much for that Mama Jam June live there in West Jerusalem

accusing him of being a warmonger let's watch so Ben is a warmonger Ben has been wrong on basically every single issue you can name he was with you with the vaccine and and every other War Ben is always calling for other people's young men to go and die in some War he seems to love it I don't know he has short man Sy room but he's always behind his desk calling about how important it is that big strong men like me go and die and the reason he tweeted that and said that is because when Hamas and Israel the very early in the conflict I think it was three days in we're discussing possible peace talks he tweeted no absolutely not them kill them all and I said I said Ben as a man who's done his own fighting because I've had a life of pain and violence listen to me peace is always worth a conversation what I said is that we should always be prepared to at least discuss peace he because he's a warmonger said no peace is not worth the conversation you're this you're that because he's always sitting behind his desk he must have a booster chair and he's always running his mouth trying to invoke violence and call for war and I find it kind of hypocritical because a man who's so small he would die he was slapped on the street sitting behind the desk and screaming for other people to be annihilated I think is kind of it's worse than think I believe it's insane I believe if he was sitting here listening to this he would say that what he's screaming for is for Jewish people in Israel be a to defend themselves and he a jewi does is call for war and I agree defending yourself that's all he does that's all he does and calling for war and call and defending yourself is very different than genocide Shapiro also appeared to be the target of a jab from fellow conservative figurehead Tucker Carlson who made this thinly Veil burn this week and it used to be our first defense you would say well in fact there was a guy who used to say facts don't care about your feelings changed his views on that recently but um but that remains true it's a classic Tucker put down kind of backhanded um he is referencing Ben Shapiro there because Ben's famous for that catchphrase um look this is a I don't care about your feelings was around long before Ben Shapiro but yeah and he well popular they've been saying that since uh probably the 80s all right I believe you remember I mean h i was a baby uh in the late ' 80s but you came out of the wom saying fact don't care about your Republicans have been saying this for a while so I'm like he kind of co-oped it and flipped it for a new generation so what we're really talking about here is a massive difference of opinion and it's frankly it's an ideological difference it it's having it's taking on a flavor of a very bitter personal disagreements between Ben Shapiro and Candace Owens now Andrew Tate and Ben Shapiro it's really exploding at the daily wire and it's very acrimonious but it's a ideological difference on foreign policy the right is in fact divided on foreign policy I think in a healthy way there's a debate going on about where the right should be on foreign policy the old the neoconservatism of the ODS of you know Reagan to Bush um is is not does not have nearly the unanimity among conservative thought leaders as it did at that time it was always less popular among the actual Republican base and Republican voters than than the elite Republican support for foreign interventionism suggested there was always an undercurrent of why shouldn't we spend American tax dollars at home what business of it of it is is ours if the Middle East is screwed up are we making it better by being involved there are we making it better by being involved anywhere else how does this help American Security why don't we put America first um this was something Ron Paul really capitalized on when he ran and then it was something that Donald Trump um you know came to totally dominate over the Republican Party by by um by a adopting a totally different View and now we're back we're kind of in we're not totally post Trump but Trump isn't completely in charge at all times he's not front and center all times right now he's actually been laying low and we had a a you know a new War start in the Middle East and conservatives are weighing in and there's a there's a split there are people like Ben Shapiro who want to support Israel no matter what and Ukraine frankly Beno is on the funding Ukraine that's the the Ukraine stuff is very unpopular among Republicans now the Israel stuff's a little bit more split there are a lot of Republicans that that do want to back Israel I mean I mean there's a question of morally supporting Israel and agreeing with Israel and saying their right to do what they're doing is is one question and then but is it Our obligation to provide for their defense at a time where Americans are suffering here and we don't you know have enough Revenue to rebuild Bridges and roads but whatever Ukraine wants whatever Israel wants whatever any other country wants for some reason it's America's job to pay for it I mean it's an age-old question um there isn't a country that exists where people aren't looking to themselves first and what's going on at home more so than they are looking at their neighbors or what's going on abroad money that's just yeah that that's just how it is and I think that coming out of the pandemic you see a lot more people who are buckling down saying hey take care of us first I don't think that that is a trump Mantra as much as it is an American one in the sense that people who don't support and didn't vote for Trump are also feeling that yeah um but we can't slip into an isolationist posture there are reasons why there is support for Ukraine largely because of protecting democracies abroad we've we've always done that um the other piece of that is that we have to understand our role in a global society America cannot afford to be isolationist uh we also can't afford to be warhawks and I I will give you that I think that there has historically been um at least amongst conservatives and conservative leaders um who chose to in many cases where diplomacy could have possibly been enacted chose to go another route and that has had long-term consequences what we're seeing now is a Schism that's been largely driven by by the residuals of two Wars that many people consider failed in Iraq and Afghanistan um you're not going to erase that history and I think that specifically among some of the younger um conservative leaning individuals they've been speaking out on it for a while um younger voters in particular have been speaking out on it for a while but being engaged in Afghanistan for Two Plus decades um the amount of money that was thrown there the fact that go right back to the way it was when we left exactly I that left a bad taste in people's mouths and they're also looking at now um what's going on with Israel and saying hey can we really root out or can they really root out um can they really root out terrorism can they really rule out Hamas um what happens if the rest of the uh rest of the Middle East and other terrorist organizations or unsavory actors end up joining together and getting in this how long will America fund this those are real questions and real considerations they also don't fundamentally believe that there will not come a point where Americans are called to act physically and I think that when if if and when that was to happen you would see huge backlash no matter what side of the aisle you happen to be on yeah um I mean I don't know if benjam got his way we could very well be involved with with ground not you know not to Andrew Tate is a is a figure we've criticized on the show uh repeatedly for you know his own personal entanglements with I me he's accused of sex trafficking he's accused of sexual misconduct all sorts of things that's got to be worked out he deserved do process like everyone else I don't know if allegations are true um but you know he's not someone I usually or frankly ever turned to for advice or good political prognostication but I have to admit he had a he had a point there that you when he wasn't trying to you know balance out height and have some screaming match of who's taller and who's shorter I'm 5' without shoes so I was like whatever you nobody nobody's going against you Amisha uh you're very tall um you can you could put Andrew Tate in his place that' be that' be fun to see um but when he he when he said that peace should always be an option peace should always always be on the table um I I I agree with that and if there's a way for them to get peace that would be better because we're funding by the way we're funding the humanitarian Aid going into Gaza that's that's also us tax dollars where the the US is the number one contributor to the humanitarian aid funds we rich we're also the richest nation on Earth well but it doesn't well yeah and we're very being forced to be very generous I mean we have to we're paying we pay for the bombs to blow the place up then we pay for the the the relief aid for the people who are victims of the bombs why are we doing it we're we like we're blowing up a bridge and then we pay to rebuild it it doesn't make any sense I don't think the American people want to do that I mean you talked about the importance of Defending democracy in Ukraine if it's so important why can't Germany do it why can't Britain do it why can't France do it it's their backyard but is a there is a all hands on deck Europe uh approach to Ukraine so they're not involved obviously we are one we are the largest contributor but there are the European Union is also there I think they should be the largest contributor I think we should butt out of it and look you know if you want to if people want to donate their funds if they want to venmo uh zalinsky or Netanyahu that's fine with me that's totally fine with me you can do that I support your right to do that um I just don't think people people should be obligated to pay for other Count's Wars no matter how just they are um and I question whether they really impact our national security all that much and in fact I I worry that our national security is negatively impacted by being involved as we found as we've learned in the Middle East I think our big UK is going to be around to that point how long this will last because Ukraine can turn into a cold war for all we know there's no quick wrapping of that one so they're not going to win they're not going to win quickly that's for sure and and Russia's assault has been um has been slow walked as well so I that's a very different circumstance than I think what's happening in Israel right now yeah well right Israel is I mean we're seeing the we're seeing the images of the massive civilian casualties and look I you know Bri ban and I argue about this all the time she's very I I mean I don't want to mischaracterize her while she's not here she's way more intensely against what Israel is doing um than I am or is she is she I think sees more legitimacy in Palestinian resistance again I don't want to mischaracterize her so people could just go watch you know what she's had to say on the issue or read what she tweets about it she sees a lot more legitimacy I think to what the Palestinians and and and their representatives are doing in order to resist the situation then I do I don't agree with that at all but I do worry for Israel's security and our own security at this level of Destruction and what it's going to create down the line in addition to being really morally atrocious and you know a lot of innocent people dying you know just because you know you can't you know there were terrorists hiding in my apartment building and the US government blew it up I wouldn't say that was you know Justified even if there were terrorist in it right if you blow up the whole city or the whole country like there has to be some level of proportion to you know what you're doing even if the cause is Justified and I don't know I think we're those typical rules of War yes yeah I think we're not necessarily seeing that so all right that was a far-reaching discussion we had based on a clip of Andrew Tate slamming Ben Shapiro so hope you enjoyed and we'll have more Rising right after [Music] this

pibg on sensitive 5 days ago terrorists from Hamas attacked Israel they murdered and raped civilians they executed the elderly at bus stops they took babies and Holocaust Survivors as hostages and they massacred young people at a festival they may it emerged last night have even beheaded babies in one Village more than 12200 Israelis are now believed to have died and this brutal attack has dragged Israel into war Israel had every right to respond with Force as it done the death toll in Gaza is now more than a thousand and many more will die many of those will be completely innocent people like those who died in Hamas attacks like almost everyone I've been shocked and sickened by the stories and videos emerging from the attack I've Al also been stunned by the moral cowardice of those who celebrated Terror as resistance and brutality as politics I've called out the people who've confed a terror attack with a geopolitical debate and I've spoken to fair-minded people on both sides of that debate I've done all this as a journalist and a human being but with no personal skin in the game my guest tonight on the other hand is one of the most prominent and influential Jewish commentators on the planet Ben Shapiro has been visibly moved and enraged by the tragedies unfolding in Israel and the world has paid attention to his analysis tonight I'm giving the show to him as we tackle all the big questions that have come out of this what is a proportionate response to terrorism should the United States be more involved how do we move forward if everyone involved sees the other side as an oppressor or a Savage and M Del wise Ben Shapiro joins me now Ben uh great to have you on the program I wish it was under different circumstances I want to ask you first of all where were you when you first heard about these attacks so I'd been in Israel for several weeks and we had just gotten home to uh to the United States on Friday morning uh Friday night obviously is Sabbath for for orthodox Jews and it also happened to be one of the biggest celebratory days of the year was a a two-day what we call yum which means no electricity really you can't use your phone you can't use your computer uh my security team showed up at synagogue on Saturday morning and started informing me of what had happened and then news was was kind of bleeding through throughout the day there were various sources you know Maids who were leaving TVs on for example or my security team informing me throughout the weekend of what exactly was happening because of the serious security concerns that arise for Jews all over the planet when there's Mass terror attack in Israel or or anywhere else and um and so you know we were finding out in uh a lagged time what exactly was happening obviously we couldn't watch the videos we couldn't see exactly what was happening until it came back online on Sunday night and we're hit with the news that at that point 700 Jews have been murdered today that number is has been totaled at well over 1,200 Jews have been murdered in in Israel we started to see all of the pictures on our TVs uh I obviously because I'm in touch with with a lot of people on the the ground First Responders uh people on the ground in Israel I started receiving extraordinary levels of of footage and and video and audio and and pictures of what exactly had happened in these places and um yeah I mean these are these are images i' I've been trying to show them to the audience for for one very specific reason uh and that specific reason is to to to understand what evil is you have to look in the face of evil and I I think that you know we in the west have a A peculiar narcissism that we everyone thinks like we do uh that that we value children in a certain way and so everyone values children in a certain way that that if somebody does something truly terrible or evil it must be that there was something that quote unquote drove them to it must be a policy question um but as it turns out that that is not the case because there's literally nothing I think there that could drive people in in the west a normal person to go and to murder a baby in their crib uh in in a civilian area to to simply walk in and gun down grandmothers or to rape a woman and drag her back to the Gaza Strip what what could drive you to do that I can't think of anything that would drive me to do that but a lot of people who are not only driven to do that but but Believe full well in the virtue of what they're doing that is a different mode of thought and that is not something you can negotiate with you've seemed about this for completely understandable reasons to have been more enraged than I think I've ever seen you almost like a simmering volcano as you've talked about this I want to play a clip from your daily wire YouTube channel you have 6 million subscribers and this is part of what was I thought a very powerful address that you made there I am a Jew those have been the words of the Jewish people for three Millennia those were the words of the men women and children of Masada those were the words of the followers of Barba those were the words of Jews and Granada in 1066 and the reinland in 1096 and ketki from 1648 to 1657 and kishinev in 1903 and kevron in 1929 those were the words of Jews in aitz and trinka those were the last words of Daniel Pearl and those are my words too they're the words of my parents the words of my my wife my children over the weekend my people the Jewish people were attacked and murdered mutilated our women were raped our children were kidnapped this happened millions of times before to millions of Jews across history Jew hatred exists because evil exists because there are people who have for literally all of human history hated the Jews and sought to strike at them while they are weak who have blamed the Jews for their own problems who have crafted complex conspiracy theories about the supposed power of the Jews who have sought to destroy to murder to mutilate to rape the Jews from pharaoh to hmon from Hitler to Kamas what reaction have you had to that Ben I think the reaction has been pretty strong and and overwhelmingly positive I think there there are a lot of people not only Jews mostly my audience is people who are not Jewish obviously who who understand the history of the Jewish people who understand what it means when when the greatest Slaughter of Jews on a mass scale happens since the Holocaust and and who understand that it is inextricably linked to a history of anti-Semitism that goes back thousands of years I mean this extermination level anti-Semitism what you see from Hamas it's literally part of their Charter and so the attempt to treat them as a normal political body obviously is foolish I think that a lot of people resonated to that it's the certainly the strongest I felt about anything that happened in my lifetime since 911 um as an American since 911 and as a Jew obviously I I'm I'm watching as people that I know people I'm friends with are getting called up to go to the military and serve in Gaza try to protect the the Israeli citizenry who are Jews and Arabs who are Christians and Jews and Muslims and um and you know I'm watching as you know there there are people out there who are rallying on behalf of of actual terrorist groups murdering children I mean it's an amazing it's an amazing I would say exposure of of ignorance at at at best ignorance at best and Jew hatred at worst do you have any personal connection to anyone who whose life was taken uh I don't uh I'm I'm I'm lucky I would say that I I have um certainly I know a lot of people who do so the way to to talk about the Jewish community in general there are not very many Jews on the planet uh due to conspiracy theories people tend to think there are tens of millions of Jews on the planet the grand total number of Jews on planet Earth is about 15 million about 7 million who live in the state of Israel about six million who live in the United States and what that means is that in general Society you think you know seven degrees of Kevin Bacon with with seven degrees of of connection you can find anyone in among among Jews that that's one that number one so I I certainly know an enormous number of people who uh who have had people who were kidnapped who've had people who were murdered I certainly know personally enormous number of people who are on the ground right now I know Americans who are who are in Israel with me who decided to stay over the last day of the omt over the over the holiday and ended up basically getting stuck there because the the airport was shut down because of Rocket attacks and uh and when the call went out to everybody with medical training to to show up to to help I know American doctors who showed up at the Gaza border to Simply set up triage stations and help people out so I mean it is it's a very small community it's a very close net Community obviously you've spoken a lot about Hamas before uh called them evil uh you did a second video called make God avenge their blood in which you said that Hamas in some ways they are worse the Nazis which some viewed as a very provocative statement why did you say that about them the the Nazis I mean here's a phrase I'll never use again at least the Nazis so at least the Nazis attempted to hide their crimes and so so the Nazis obviously mechanized death they had inet grp group in units that they drove up to to Jewish villages and would mow people down um and then they would bury them and they would try to hide the crimes and it took you know the nberg team years to to undig all of that material in this particular case you have Hamas terrorists who are murdering Jews in their beds and live streaming it and and celebrating it and bragging about it and and talking about how incredible it is and Blasting that sort of stuff out I mean the videos that I've been showing on my show a lot of them are coming directly from Kamas I mean it's Kamas that that is taking contemporaneous video of this sort of stuff and that that's a whole new level of evil that to to celebrate this sort of stuff to treat it as a Triumph I mean I think the thing that that that people really have to realize here is this is not a military operation this was not a military operation I mean people have compared this to ex for example the 1973 y Kor war that was an awful moment in Israel's history when it was taken by surprise by the combined Arab armies around it but that was a military operation with a military objective which was to seize territory this is not a military operation with a military objective this was this was an operation directed specifically at civilians and and when we see death in Gaza which we're going to see and the images are going to be horrifying and terrible it is important to understand that the reason that that is happening is not just because Hamas crossed the border and murdered a bunch of civilians in their beds but also because Hamas literally hides its Weaponry behind civilians Israel is currently right now sending out messages to gazin civilians telling them to get out of particular areas and Hamas is sending out full scale messages telling people to ignore those messages and to stay where they are Hamas is is they there's a reason why their headquarters were for years located underneath a hospital mean it's the the the what they what they they understand that the West again has a peculiar narcissism where we think we would never put our military our military hardware below a hospital that'd be insane um and so if Israel blows up a hospital it must be that Israel is doing that because they're targeting civilians Kamas knows that that's that's why they're doing it that's why they're doing it they literally hide their rocket launchers behind apartment buildings in the hope that Israel will strike back and have to kill civilians in the process Israel cares significantly more about civilian casualties in Gaza than Hamas ever has one of the I mean there have been so many horrendous uh images and videos the poor girl from The Music Festival taken away on the motorbike was just bone chilling to watch um I I saw something on CNN yesterday with Jake Tapper where he's interviewing the relative of a grandmother his grandmother who was murdered and Hamas posted the video of her being murdered onto her Facebook page so her family would watch it I mean when you hear that it's sort of unconscionable it's it's kind of Beyond depravity this is inhumanity I mean Piers you're in the business of words and I'm in the business of words and I've found myself repeatedly over the last few days unable to to find words to describe the kind of thing that we're seeing and again we we stretch I think in the west and I stretch as an American we I think we all stretch to try and find you know what would drive somebody to do something like this and the answer sometimes is that they are just they're I don't know how to say this otherwise they are not like you Hamas is not like you they don't think like you they don't have the same priorities as you they don't have the same values as you and that means that any attempt to buy them off is is bound to fail and and this is inextricably intertwined with the history I mean the fact is Israel turned over the Gaza Strip in 2005 there were no Jews living in the Gaza Strip since 2005 the areas that were attacked in this particular terrorist attack are not areas that are in the so-called settlements theim in Judea Samaria What's called the West Bank that that that's not the area that was attacked the areas that was attacked has been Sovereign Israeli territory since 1947-48 and and that territory was attacked from across a border that is entirely controlled by Hamas which has utilized pretty much every dollar that has that has flooded into that region over the course of 20 years from America from EUR taxpayer dollars that have been used to build up these Terror capabilities and every time there cement shipments into into the the area ruled by Hamas Hamas has used it to build Terror tunnels pipes that have been sent into the area ruled by Hamas that were meant to build sewage systems have been repurposed and used for for Rocket tubes I mean this is this is in it's it's utterly insane and to to try and come up with some sort of territorial solution this is really just a territorial dispute it is not a terror territorial dispute it is is a genocidal group that makes clear its own intentions I don't know how many times people have to tell you who they are before you believe them the reason that I've been saying that Hamas is genocidal for literally my entire career is because they say in their own founding documents that they are genocidal it's not as though they're attempting to avoid cability responsibility for this they are saying it out loud they're begging you to take them seriously also they're also terrorists I mean let's just be crystal clear this is an act of terrorism that we saw at the weekend the worst since 9/11 one of the worst Terror attacks in modern history and yet you have mainstream media the BBC in Britain refusing to describe Hamas as terrorists they call them militants even John Simson one of their senior foreign correspondents and editors said it's not a journalist role to call groups like Hamas terrorists he says calling someone a terrorist means you're taking sides and ceasing to treat the situation with due impartiality the BBC's job is to place the facts before his audience and let them decide what they think honestly and without ranting that's why in Britain throughout the world nearly half a billion watch listen to and read us there's always someone who'd like us to rant sorry it's not what we do but I don't think it's about ranting to describe acts of Terror as being committed by terrorists and the New York Times apparent ly today actually changed uh the wording of a story they they put online and changed the word Hamas terrorist to Hamas gunmen as if they're almost terrified you know literally I mean how ironic of using the word terrorist but what is it about mainstream media two huge examples of it New York Times and the BBC that they won't just call this what it is I think that that a lot of these groups are afraid of the political implications of of just calling a terrorist to terrorist I mean when when you acknowledge that the government of of the Gaza Strip is in fact a terrorist government that has some pretty large scale implications for a lot of the political agendas at play because of course the the great sort of dream of of the West since at least the oso courts has been that territorial concessions and that economic concessions would would solve this problem when it turns out that an entire area is governed by a a government that is in fact a terrorist government it's an actual terrorist group uh then that has some pretty significant implications moving forward for the prospects in the region and it also suggests that Israel has a moral duty which it absolutely does to protect its own citizenry by eviscerating that terrorist group from the planet and the word terrorist has a definition and that definition by any stretch of the imagination is fulfilled by by what Kamas is I mean the BBC's explanation is so bizarre it's almost like suggesting that if you found a a man who had murdered his wife in an apartment and you reported on that you didn't call it murder you just said that some someone was killed a person was killed and and and the person was convicted of murder and you still said Mur we we don't make judgments over here and use language like the word murderer because that would carry some moral implication well yes it turns out that murdering entire families slaughtering entire families burning them I mean some of the stuff that I've been that I've been tweeting out which is stuff I'm getting again directly from First Responders on the ground I mean just a few moments ago I tweeted out I wish I didn't have to tweet out these photos but I think people need to understand the consequences of failing to see evil for what it is it was a it was a photo of some a group of people in in a kaboot called kabut B which is again near the border where 100 bodies were found and they were attempting to Simply escape and Hamas stop the car and burn these people alive I don't know how you don't call that what other goal could you have but to obscure the morality of the situation if if you refuse to call things what what they are I don't it's it boggles the mind it really it truly does I mean what also boggled the mind for me was uh black lives matter Chicago which had a Twitter account with 60,000 followers they actually posted a caricature image of a paraglider saying I stand with Palestine the paragliders were of course were the ones who flew in and killed all the people at the music festival what did you feel when you saw that I mean unsurprising only in the sense that black lives matter as as an organization had all sorts of solidarity statements about Palestine going all the way back to the the original movement in 2014 2015 um but the but seeing them actively take up the the imagery of an actual terrorist attack that's what that is Palestinians are not famous for their for their hangliding and the only reason why that is the image is because literal terrorists use paragliders in order to murder civilians at an electronic dance music festival by the way attended mostly by people of the political left I mean those are not right-wing Israelis who are dancing at an EDM Festival on on a Saturday that's not the way that works um it's it it's only astonishing in either the moral blindness or the anti-Semitism and at a certain point the moral blindness becomes the anti-Semitism because when you are celebrating active Jew murder and you are saying that that's solidarity that's a pretty incredible thing I'd also like to point out here that the argument in favor of Palestinian self-determination did not need to be threatened by any of these people all they could have said is Hamas does not represent Palestinians this does not have any implications for Palestinian self-determination Hamas is a terrorist group and they ought to be eviscerated and they ought to be replaced by a better government that could make peace with none of this is particularly hard the fact that they're lumping together Hamas with the Palestinian cause says an awful lot and it doesn't say anything good in one of the videos you say the only solution is for Israel to Annex the Gaza Strip and kill enough sons of [ __ ] to make sure this isn't a problem again you say anyone who calls for a ceasefire is a terrorist sympathizer under these circumstances now that got a lot of push back uh I guess this comes to the point of appropriate response how far do you go how do you isolate genuine Hamas from perhaps completely innocent Palestinians in Gaza of which there will be many um one person called you a genocidal warmonger for that rhetoric and there's a a person called Muhammad hijab and a video called in responding to benj on Israel he says this first and foremost I'll say yes we condemn any woman child or whatever it may be that's being killed who's Jewish and who's not a non-combatant but why is it the case Ben huh why is it the case that you none of your colleagues or you have been able to offer one single condolence one single condemnation one single word of sympathy for any of the gazin that have been killed don't try and smear us don't try and slander us don't try and attack don't try and produce red earrings and I think you're an ass a jackass and we're not talking about Hamas we're talking about children here we're talking about women here we're talking about elderly people you make me sick you make me sick what's your response to that B that will be I'm sure a reaction you have heard from a lot of people what do you feel about that I mean my obvious response is of course I feel horrible for the people who are being held by Hamas in a state of tyranny for the past 15 years Hamas was the elected government in Gaza in 2006 there hasn't been an election since then all the people who are who are today ranting as as you heard Muhammad hijab doing right there I don't hear them talking about liberating Gaza from Hamas which is the greatest threat to the to the way of life of Gaza on planet Earth again I have nothing but sympathy for Hamas for for the people that Hamas is is governing or the people that Hamas is exploiting really I have nothing but sympathy for civilians there Israel has to defend itself I don't understand exactly what the expectation would be here is is the expectation that because Hamas uses human Shields that Israel therefore has to go home and wait to be to to have its people murdered again Israel tried it the way that that Muhammad hijab and others would like Israel literally pulled in 2005 they literally pulled thousands of Jews out of the Gaza Strip it was called the disengagement and it was massively unpopular in wide swats of Israel they they pulled out they built a wall and they basically said go ahead and govern yourselves and this is the result of that you think Israel you think I you think anyone in Israel no one in Israel wants to reoccupy the Gaza Strip no one that's why Israel has been studiously avoiding reoccupying the Gaza Strip since 2006 despite the fact that theyve been living underground in large parts of Israel for weeks at a time because of Rocket attacks have been fired on a regular basis from the Gaz of strip into major cities let me ask you let me ask you this in Gaza you have two million people many of whom are young people pretty hopeless conditions to live in I think people would agree with that uh not much chance of getting out of there uh they live in very densely populated areas we know from in the last 24 hours that Israel controls water controls Energy power going in there uh many would see that that is a control that Israel shouldn't have have if you want to afford equal rights to people living in in Gaza and then it comes down to proportionate response and how you try and like I say how do you how do you attack Hamas given they're all over Gaza living amongst the general population how do you attack and isolate genuine members of Hamas genuine uh terrorists from the civilian population and given that is almost impossible clearly what is a proportionate response to what's happened here well I frankly I don't believe in proportionate response to terrorism I believe that the way that you stop terrorism is with wildly disproportionate response that doesn't mean in terms of targeting civilians means in terms of killing as many terrorists as humanly possible and allowing them to dictate the terms of Engagement by hiding behind civilians in areas that that they are supposedly responsible for means that the only option for Israel is to surrender to hamas's hatred of its own citizens its willingness to use its own children as human Shields no no country worth its salt could ever do that no no government trying to protect its own citizens could ever do that what exactly is the alternative option other than for Israel to try to kill as many of these terrorists into post Hamas and hopefully help put in place some sort of International overseen Community that would actually govern the Gaza Strip in a in a rational reasonable way that actually maximizes the possibilities of its citizens Israel over the course of the last year allowed some 15,000 work permits to gsin many of those work permits we're now finding out were used by terrorists in order to cross the border the fact that Israel controls the water and the power the reason that Israel controls the water and the power is specifically because if they did not control the water and the power Hamas would be right now hold up with the water and the power indefinitely I mean the fact is that the reason that Israel controls for example the seab border is because if they did not there were attempts to ship weapons in from Turkey multiple times the the The Impossible situation in which Israel finds itself with regard to the Gaza Strip is mirrored only by The Impossible situation which in which Gaz and civilians find themselves and all of that every single iota of that is the result of Hamas which means unless there is a change in status in which is removed from power in which someone else is put in charge this is going to continue again 10,000 10,000 going into the to defend their citizens I agree with you but I would also say that I think that it would also benefit any chance of a peace settlement that if Netanyahu wasn't in charge anymore um I mean apart from anything else this is an unbelievable breach and failure of of security and Military I think part of that can be apportioned to the extraordinary social soci unrest that's been enveloping Israel since his cabinet full of a lot of right-wing heg bangers frankly some of whom have actually call themselves fascists uh have tried to take on the Judiciary and the Supreme Court I don't feel comfortable about that what do you feel about that and do you feel that Netanyahu is the right person should does it need a completely clean leadership now both in Palestine and Israel to try and get to somewhere approaching peace the democratically elected govern of Israel has not had a change in policy despite the fact that until very recently Netanyahu was not the prime minister of Israel it was a joint government run by naali Bennett as well as by yayer Leed who's a member of the hard left who dramatically opposes Benjamin Netanyahu today they formed a Unity government between Benny gon who's a member of the center left and Benjamin Netanyahu who's a member of the Central right leud party in Israel this is not when it comes to foreign policy the reality is that since the rejection of any peace deal by Mahmud abas in 2009 when Aur was the Prime Minister of Israel there's been very little disagreement between any of the parties with regard to foreign policy because they do not have a peace partner the Osa process was killed by the Palestinians and it was killed by the Palestinians when they rejected multiple peace offerings by AUD Barack by Ariel Chiron by AUD om over and over and over again by Yak Rabin by Shimon Perez Benjamin Netanyahu himself in the wi River Accords of 1998 handed over significant portions of the West Bank to the Palestinians so you can say that Netanyahu is a problem that's fine but the reality I was asking you whether I was asking you whether you feel he is a problem that actually all the division that's been caused by his attempt to usurp the power of the Supreme Court as many people see it all that division in Israel has actually diminished his authority uh and that has come at a time when you really need somebody with real Authority well I mean I I don't think that right now that's really the question considering again it's a Unity government and I'm talking to everybody in Israel and all of those divisions heal up in a moment when your children are being slaughtered at the border as it turns out so you know all of the judicial reform conversation is a separate conversation we can critique how fast they went in terms of this Coalition they went too fast they scaled it back there were serious divisions in Israeli Society about what kind of power the Judiciary ought to have there are many people on both sides actually who believe the Judiciary had too much power there are a lot of people on both sides who believe the government went too fast on that internal political divisions have become completely irrelevant here if if Netanyahu were replaced tomorrow by Benny gon which is what a lot of Israelis would hope for if if that were to happen literally tomorrow nothing would reason because this issue this particular issue isas this has tocy of the Israeli government you could find the most left-wing person in in Israeli politics right now which would be Ariel Leed you could put him back in the Prime Minister seat and he would be forced with exactly the same decisions that Netanyahu is faced with right now how do you see to take me forward 20 years in a dream scenario how does the region look in a dream scenario Economic Development which I think is what the Abraham Accords were about and what the burgeoning Saudi peace deal was about and by the way the burgeoning Saudi peace deal is the reason that Hamas did this at the beest of Iran they were afraid of a regional realignment that would create a Sunni Jewish Alliance right oriented largely against the the the Shia power of Iran which is spread through Lebanon Syria and now down into into kamasan uh the the you know the economic development is the only way to move forward for the region that was the premise of the abrahamic again it was the premise of the the nent Saudi peace deal Israel would love to do that with the Palestinian Authority they would love to do that with with anyone governing the Palestinians to provide better economic conditions I one of the great ironies of all this is that 20% of Israel's population is Arab the the Arabs in Israel earn a far better income they they have far better GDP per capita than Arabs who are living under the Palestinian Authority or under the Gaza or under the or under Hamas and when you take polls of Israeli Arabs many of whom are not particularly fond of the state of Israel almost zero of them wish to actually relocate to any of these areas because economic development is economic development the the way out of this is that but in order for that to happen the people on the other side of the table have to actually agree that economic development is a worthwhile thing is an end goal and this goes back to the original point that I was making is that we in the west we believe that Economic Development worthwhile that what we are all seeking is the same sort of peaceful decent life where we leave each other alone and get to live our lives I think that we all we all agree on that but there's a group of people who absolutely do not agree with that and they don't care about the level of Economic Development they would rather live I mean Hamas would rather that its own citizens live in poverty and penury and Orient themselves against the external of the Jews that Economic Development even be allowed to take place I mean I promise you everyone in the Israeli government right to left would love nothing better than economic development of the people surrounding them so they don't have to send their sons and daughters to go fight and die in Gaza do you believe in the concept of a two-state solution I mean if there were a party on the other side to negotiate with and if there if the if the possibility of a two-state solution was real sure I mean but the question is how realistic is that negotiations cannot be the the the Cure All you can't you have to have a partner on the other side of the table the entire premise of the Osa Accords is that you could take an actual terrorist by the name of yasar Arafat you could you could negotiate with him you could make a deal with him and this would magically cure the situation well a deal is not capable of being cut with with literally anyone that's not the way any of this works so in order for there to be any sort of long-term peace including a Palestinian State there would have to be a complete difference in in leadership in in these areas and that would actually require Palestinian moderates to take the four the Palestinian Authority is not a is not a moderate group Islamic Jihad is a terrorist group Hamas is a terrorist group and until that changes nothing's going to change and by the way there is the possibility of that change if you had told me 10 years ago that there would be Saudi Israeli normalization on the table I would have laughed in your face if you told me that Israel would been able to cut peace deals with the UAE and with Morocco I I would have I would have scoffed and I think everyone would have scoffed so there is that possibility but again you cannot make peace with aide that wants to murder you that is not a possibility well on that Point all I would say to that is I'm an Irish Catholic and we had the troubles in Northern Ireland different circumstances I'm not going to try and equate the two uh but there you had people on both sides trying to kill each other you had the IRA trying to kill civilians uh indiscriminately to make their political points and in the end a peace deal was achieved but it was achieved by people sitting down opposite people they knew had been killing civilians and killing people on their side you even had the queen meeting Martin mcginness and Jerry Adams who were the uh you know in mcguinness's case the former Chief of Staff of the IRA ordered some of the most appalling atrocities the queen one of her own relatives was blown to Pieces Lord mount baton by the IRA but she still met with them I was actually at number 10 Downing Street when Tony Blair met mcginness and Adams on the steps for the first time in in 70 years uh as the members of shim Fain and shook their hands I was next in to see him in his office and it was an extraordinary moment to watch and it was a moment many people thought would never happen um do you see any parallel there in terms of what could be achieved with Israel and Palestine only if the leadership changes only if the leadership changes on the Palestinian side that is the only way that happens and again the the the difference here is that the IRA had territorial Ambitions Kamas does not have territorial Ambitions they have genocidal Ambitions the Palestinian Authority has been offered multiple deals over multiple decades and they' have rejected without counter offers virtually every deal they' have ever been offered Islamic Jihad is a terrorist group again if if the IRA was dedicated to the complete Slaughter and eradication of every non-irish britisher in the UK that would be the equivalent of Hamas and that would not be a negotiating position because again could there be successful negotiations with it depends on it depends on the partner right that the example that you're using is is the best example of sides that are incredibly far apart coming together but here we are talking about one side that simple premise if Israel put down all of its guns tomorrow every Jew in the region would be slaughtered if Hamas put down all of its guns tomorrow Israel would leave the Gaza Strip alone it is that simple let me ask you you got into a a Twitter spat with Andrew Tate yesterday he's a converted Muslim he'd been doing a lot of uh supportive tweets uh for the Palestinians and he tweeted at one stage Mr tough guy let me assure you as someone who's done his own fighting as opposed to excitedly encouraging others to do it for him while sitting at home on a comfy chair peace is always worth a conversation what what was that spat about why did you engage with him what do you feel about that well what I feel about that is that he was tweeting that immediately like as terrorists were still running around in southern Israel that was on October 10th and he was still Tweeting while the bodies were fresh and warm in the streets peace is you cannot make peace with people who murdered your children and burned their bodies you can't do that I mean this this rush to Israel I I the murder happens and you immediately say okay well guys now truce now truce now ceasefire that is not no State worth its salt no government on Earth would allow this kind of insanity no government on Earth and no government on Earth would listen to nonsense about how you immediately have to seek peace with a group that seeks your direct extermination again I I can't emphasize enough Israel turned over the Gaza Strip to gazans in 2005 Hamas has governed the area since 2006 the year is currently 20123 Israel has has endured round after round of Rocket fire on its major I for literally almost years and now the idea is the minute that g gazen terrorists rush through the border and murder people in their beds that's the Time For Peace conversation that's the Time For Peace conversation by the way and I'm not gonna be lectured on morality and toughness by by Andrew Tate whose great idea of toughness and morality is pimping women and then bragging about it on air and and trying to quasy walk it back while simultaneously maintaining many of the same positions and flexing his biceps I mean he's got a huge following as you know especially online is it is it dangerous is it Reckless that he's able to tweet from house arrest still of course in Romania that he can tweet on something like this and have the kind of influence that he has listen everyone should be able to tweet whatever it is that they want them all for an open discourse even with people who I think are dead wrong on a lot of these issues but Andrew Tate is dead wrong on a lot of these issues and and the the particularly ridiculous posturing about being a yes you're very yes you're very tough when when you want people to make peace with with terrorists who just murder their children very very tough you mentioned Iran earlier President Biden yesterday came out 10-minute speech you know sounded very tough and very supportive of Israel but never once mentioned Iran was that a a failure by him or are they waiting to establish concrete evidence of Iran's involvement no I think there's a good reason he could have done that and a bad reason that he could have done that and the the bad reason is pretty obvious which is that the United States has unfrozen six billion dollars in assets to to flood into Iran in return for hostages that money is fungible and there's every possibility that money flowing into Iran since since the weakening of sanctions has contributed to Iran's spread of Terror that is not only a possibility that's a probability and everyone knows it so if you avoid mentioning Iran then presumably it avoids blowback that is the bad reason the good reason might be that the United States wants to take down the temperature in the region so right now geopolitically this is a contained conflict this is Israel versus Hamas in the Gaza Strip and everyone of good heart on every side should hope that it remains that way if Hezbollah which is on Israel's northern border and an Iranian client Hezbollah is a massive and significantly more powerful thanas terrorist group that exists and and has say in the government of Lebanon again Israel is surrounded on a lot of sides by terrorist groups that mate his government Hezbollah has about 150,000 much more sophisticated Rockets than than Hamas pointed at Northern Israel everyone understands that if Hezbollah which would only do this at the P of Iran if if Hezbollah were to get in Israel would then be stretched militarily to the point where they would not have any choice but to go full force and what that means is that all of the talk right now about the the supposed disproportionate force that Israel is using in the Gaza Strip talk with which I wildly disagree uh that that will all go out the window because once you are stretched to the point of extermination all bets are off and and the Israeli Air Force will have to be Unleashed on the on the southern border of Lebanon at that point you wouldd have to imagine that that Bashar Assad in Syria starts to get active Iran starts to get active so one of the things that that the possible good reason why he didn't mention Iran is because he's attempting to keep Iran out of the war that basically the idea would be he did say in the speech that any other group that wants to get in don't America to its great credit to our great credit we've stationed a battle carrier an aircraft carrier outside of uh outside of Lebanon in the Mediterranean and basically said tobah that they should not get in uh that is in fact the best available move so again there's a very plausible bad reason why he didn't mention Iran which is to avoid the blowback from his own idiotic Iran policy and there's a possible good reason which is that he's attempting to avoid the broadening of the conflict Donald Trump says as he's want to do with these crises that would never have happened if he was President do you think that may have some truth I think there's some truth to that for sure I think that that that Iran has seen weakness Iran saw an opportunity to to prevent the Saudis from coming into to the Abraham Accords and uh they thought that they could push where they saw mush I mean the withdrawal from Afghanistan made America look weak The Continuous dealings between the United States and Iran despite Iran's openly genocidal intentions with regard to Israel has made America look weak the fact that Robert Mali who is one of the chief negotiators the United States was apparently co-opted by Iranian intelligence groups makes the Americans look look particularly weak and so appearances of weakness in the Middle East matter an awful lot it is it is not politics in western states you where where we try to negotiate we try to have discussions that is not how politics works in the Middle East it is a place where strength is is really the only coin of the realm there is a theory that Hamas have done this spectacularly awful Act of terrorism deliberately on a scale that would go Israel into overreacting and Spark a much a much wider War I mean I think that there's probably truth to that I think that that Hamas I think that's what ran wants I'm not sure that Hamas wanted that I think Hamas uh doesn't want to be wiped off the Earth which they probably will be and ought to be um but I think that that Iran's Hope was that Israel would have to go in incredibly strong as the Gaza Strip and this would provide internal pressure in Saudi Arabia to prevent them from forming an alliance brokered by the Americans with the Israelis I think that was probably the geop political reason for that with that said that does not mean that Israel has any other choice again if if suddenly 1500 terrorists flooded into Great Britain and proceeded to murder 15 to 20,000 people because again Israel is a tiny tiny country it has n million people if if those numbers were made proportionate if if tens of thousands of people were slaughtered in Britain by a group of terrorists I doubt that there' be a lot of British citizens who are sitting around worrying about proportionality or worrying about the geopolitical consequences of protecting their own citizenry there is an interesting uh contradiction I would argue that a lot of uh conservatives in America a lot of Republicans have including a number of presidential candidates from Ronda santis to Trump uh and others um they have signaled that they would want to severely curtail if not stop allog together support for Ukraine and yet Ukraine was invaded um by Russia um a lot of people slaughtered contined to be slaughtered um is there not a contradiction there that these Republicans would be I mean yes full Square behind Israel when it happens to them but not full Square behind Ukraine I mean yes there is a contradiction it depends on on sort of what is being said about Ukraine and it runs the gamut and some of the candidates that you've talked about have talked about ending Aid completely to Ukraine some have talked about continuing Aid to Ukraine and and pursuing some sort of of deal with the Russians that allows them to keep part of the dabass and Crimea which I think is a completely different story and and is an actual off-ramp um but yes anybody who is who is you know sympathetic to Russia in the Russia Ukraine conflict and then it's sympathetic to Israel in this current conflict that that is a a bizarre position to take again I think they serious America is a sovereign country it has its own concerns that are not Israel's concerns and it has its own concerns that are not Ukraine's concerns and those Z those zones always line up um but when it comes to you know a possible contradiction between a completely isolationist position on Ukraine and a an interventionist position or supporter position on Israel of course those things could could clearly be in Conflict my own position by the way on for what it's worth since I yeah as you know be I do this for a living uh my own position on Ukraine has been that the United States should continue to supply Ukraine with the support necessary in order to preserve its government and to preserve its territory and meanwhile there need to be serious talks about what exactly an offramp looks like in Ukraine because virtually no one has spelled out exactly what that looks like and fortunately No One Believes at this point Ukraine is going to be able to completely take back both the donbass and and the Crimea region that that is very complicated having been to Ukraine and interviewed president zalinski met a lot of people there and that was quite a while ago uh there was an unbelievably Steely resolve and I would I would say the same resolve that Israel has about seeding any land now to the Palestinians it's like they just don't want to give an inch of land away to the Russians um that was to a man and woman that I met out there I have an enormous amount of sympathy for that position again that that that position does not necessarily dictate American policy anymore than than Israel's position with regard to say the the so called occupied territories disputed territories should necessarily dictate America's position on that the they realistic consequences and concerns to be had on foreign policy um but if the point that you're making is that lack of moral support in an invasion of a sovereign country by by Russia is in contradiction with moral support for Israel in this I I would say yeah I mean there's certainly inconsistency there I mean the other inconsistency and contradiction it seems to me is the reaction of the world when George Floyd was murdered which was a Despicable killing and the police officer concerned uh is now serving a life sentence quite rightly but that sparked enormous Global protests uh Over America over the UK everywhere uh with people Marching In protest at what they perceive to be a racist murder of one person and yet the reaction within hours of what happened here where as we knew at the time nearly a thousand people in Israel had been murdered uh some in the most utterly horrific circumstances um the reaction was that yes there were big protests again but they weren't really protests they were marches of celebration in America in UK they marched down my local High Street uh celebrating what had happened Pro Palestinian marches I found that extraordinary Jew hatred is a very real thing it's a very real thing and and we've obscured it with a lot of talk about Zionism and anti-zionism and we've scared it with a lot of talk about geopolitics and context but in the end Jew hatred is quite real and when you see crowds in Sydney chaning gas the Jews not free the occupied territories not make a peace deal gas the Jews I'm not sure what we're supposed to read into that other than people mean what they say when they say gas the Jews yeah I mean that's exactly what they mean I mean this is this is Nazi language I mean but as you say the difference between this and the Nazis the Nazis tried to keep the secret um whereas this is all in plain sight I mean the idea of people doing this in cities like Sydney and London and New York it's it's uh it's actually terrifying and I say that again I'm an Irish Catholic I'm not Jewish uh I feel terrified for Jewish people like you say there's only 15 million Jewish people in the world uh it must be when this kind of thing happens in such an indiscriminate manner it must be genuinely terrifying for people for sure and and obviously when you see marches of support it it the the question is always asked how could the Holocaust have happened and the answer is this way when people are are actively in favor of Jews being murdered simply for for being Jews and again it's easy to people people have an amazing ability to to justify whatever it is that they're thinking or feeling at a given time but if you can find a way to justify yourself out of the the murder of of babies in their cribs I I have a I have a hard time figuring that it's anything other than Jew hatred and so if you know as a Jew as a person who you know is very strongly Jewish I'm very active in my Jewish Community as a person with four kids and and a wife and parents and sisters and and all of this you know obviously Jews feel like they are at risk everywhere because of of of this sort of activity and and I will say there's an amazing double standard when it comes to anti-Semitism and its treatment in the media the way that it seems to work in the media these days is if a if if somebody politically says something about George Soros then they will be labeled the Nazi and if somebody actually says I anzi then they will say well there's probably some sort of justification over territorial disputes yeah I want to end Ben uh on a one positive note and it's a montage we have of support for uh the Jewish people and for Israel let's take a look so Ben that last image was of the Brandenburg gate which of course we saw back in the 30s with Nazi swers all over it and today the Israel flag is emblazened uh across it proudly and supportively I mean amid all the Jew hating and you're right that's what it is there's also been an amazing outpouring of Po and that is incredible and we who are Jews obviously appreciate that and um I would just like to say at the very end here that that must be translated into allowing Israel to do what must be done to protect her own citizenry because Goodwill only goes so far as the actual protection of of human lives and uh if the Jews were to rely on The Good Will of the world over the course of history it would have gone very poorly for them that's why the state of Israel exists it exists it never again is never again and in order for that to be reality the the IDF the state of Israel has to be able to defend itself has to be able to defend its citizenry and protect them from the kind of Slaughter and and savagery that we saw over the weekend benir thank you very much indeed for your time today I appreciate it thank you"

and their flock try to create a conflict I don't know whether that will happen today or not we'll know in a few minutes all right we got to go back here because the settler ATV is coming the settlement movement is largely led by religious Jews who believe that it is a god-given obligation to settle the land by any means possible and it really is part of the overall plan to push Palestinians out of the occupied territories see it's right over there that's probably their leader and he's probably going to call the Army now they are religious ideology which I consider a desecration of God's name as a rabbi is that it all belongs to the Jewish people and they believe that they are commanded by God or have a god-given right to expel anybody else backhand actually wins the war then in some in some sense it's entitled to keep the spoils of the war uh there was never a sovereign Palestinian state in this area or any area for that matter [Music] famously in 1987 then U.S president Ronald Reagan urged and Soviet Union president Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall two years later the Wall came down but here in Palestine Israel walls had sprouted and spoiled this land harsh on yielding walls ugly walls it's the Mantra of the new political right Build That Wall Build That Wall as if walls were a solution to the multifaceted multi-layered human challenge of peaceful coexistence [Music] foreign foreign foreign thank you I think it's very interesting as to why in Ireland there is what I would describe as such an unbalanced perception of the conflict here the perception that Israel is if you like the guilty partner and Palestinians are the innocent victims is a total fabrication of the complex reality you have something very different from a system for example from South Africa of apartheid where people are denied their civil liberties because of their racial Origins we have here two national movements straggling that have been caught in a situation of ongoing conflict so to try to portray this conflict there's some baddies trying to make life bad for goodies it's simply a best naive or ignorance of the situation [Music] my name is David Rosen from 1979 to 1985 I was Chief Rabbi violent [Music] hello foreign foreign [Music] foreign decisions I think this is the essence of Zionism establishing the Jewish State on the ruins of the Palestinian lives here and the state should be only for Jews choose a privilege there a Jewish from Brooklyn or from Dublin has more rights in this state than any other Palestinians either from here originally that was expressed from here or a palisina that is living here I'm 59 years old I'm a Jewish Israeli I live in Tel Aviv co-director and founder of decolonizer to expose and challenge the Israeli regime as a colonial regime so if um if you explain this map and the work that you're doing you can see all the destroyed localities in this country since the beginning of Zionist migration here so toward the end of 19th century until today and into the future Zionism is an idea that see the Biblical land of Israel belong only for Jews and it's not a an issue as well in terms of the borders that it's that Israel is a country where the borders aren't clear there are no borders in fact in the Declaration of Independence there's narrow borders and until today it's not exactly clear where the borders of Israel foreign [Music] what's it like living here in this settlement a lot of people at the EU level even the Americans think that this is an illegal settlement no no no no no where the Palestinians expelled from here yes and do you think that they have the right to return here no she can't no well I tell him I give him back why tell him come talk government as little I kill all Jewish I put it in Sea she had the fish hit you think Palestinians want to kill all Jews and throw them into the sea you see how much five well I'm going by four I'm going what what I tell you more [Music] we are here in an area called rashash Bedouin have lived here for generations and generations by their flocks the veteran from the shots were forced out not only during the war in 48 but in the 50s and they've wondered through the Hebron area to the Bethlehem Area moving further and further north until they got to the Jordan Valley and to the areas where we are right now settlers created an outpost here a settlement not even recognized by Israel let alone the rest of the world and they are very very problematic often very violent and they're part of our environment here as well unfortunately these are the settlers they have done everything to push the Bedouin Shepherds out of this area foreign all they're saying is they want all the provocateurs to leave they of course see the fact that we're interfering with their attempts to expel people from where they've been here for 30 years as a provocation my name is Rabbi arik asherman I an organization today called a Torah of Justice taught setic uh I'm 59 I've been engaging in human rights work here for 23 and a half years I was born in the United States in Erie Pennsylvania and I learned from my parents and from my rabbis and from my community that a basic part of what it means to be a Jew is to be concerned about Universal human rights and social justice chapter 1 verse 27 of Genesis that human beings are created in God's image it doesn't say just the Jews are creating God's image [Music] the basic situation here is displacement and dispossession if you can prevent Palestinians from making a living you don't have to fire a shot you don't have to have soldiers coming in and forcing people to leave you just have them living of their own accord because they can't survive here anymore okay foreign [Music] foreign foreign foreign [Music] foreign thank you [Music] foreign foreign foreign [Music] I am a farmer and my father aparma and my grandfather a farmer now I think the last we are strong grow banana with vegetables the life is good in this day no when I speak you about the before this this Sometimes I Cry foreign [Music] [Music] foreign the 4th of September 1997. two Palestinian suicide bombers blew themselves up in benuehuda Street in the center of Jerusalem killing five people that day including three little girls one of these little girls was my 14 years old smadar it was a Thursday afternoon and the beginning of a very long and very cold night which continues until today my name is ramir khanal I'm a 69 years old graphic designer living in Jerusalem born in Jerusalem Seventh Generation I'm a Jew I'm in Israeli and before anything else I am a human being it was the first day of school she was on her way to buy new school books it's not something that you can describe you keep hoping that maybe this time this finger will not turn towards you this time and then you find yourself running in the streets trying to find Hershey completely disappear you go from one hospital to another from police station to police station many long and frustrating hours until eventually very later that night you find yourself in the Bog and this finger is stacked right between your eyes and you see this site which you will never ever be able to forget for the rest of your life [Laughter] Ramadan [Music] Muhammad um foreign [Music] we see there is foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] there is a concept in Zionism it's very important and kind of a religious concept that we Jews have to redeem the land it means that we have to make it a Jewish land it means that only Jews can live in this land also eventually in the state of Israel is a state only for Jews in modern terms showing very well the settler Colonial nature of it it means establishing a new Jewish locality in what's defined by Zionism as Eric Israel the land for the Jews those Jews living as settlers they are illegal for most of the world of course Israel don't see it that way and that's why the settlements are legal for Israel to be able to live in the land where generations of Jewish prayers and hopes and dreams could only fantasize about but I can live here and I can look out from my window and see on the Mount of Olives where my parents are buried and my grandparents are buried is an incredible privilege at the same time there is the tragedy of people suffering and I look out from that same window and I can see a separation wall we have a land that is Holy for three world faiths this of course is the place where according to biblical narrative is the birth of the children of Israel Jesus of course and Christianity was born in this land and Islam sought to affirm the Traditions that had gone before it and therefore there was an attachment to this land as well this piece of territory was the connection between three continents so if you were an imperial power you wanted to control this particular location dating back to the Middle Ages the Turkish Ottoman Empire controlled vast swains of the Mediterranean region present-day Palestine included following the ottoman Empire's first world war defeat Palestine became a British mandated territory even before that war ended and without any consultation with Arab people British foreign secretary James balford declared his government support for the establishment in Palestine of a national home for Jewish people in 1947 against the expressed wishes of the Palestinian people the U.N General Assembly partitioned Palestine establishing one year later the state of Israel Jerusalem would become the shared capital of both States I think the collective guilt of Europeans played a major role on accepting this extravagant idea that 22 percent of a population to claim a a nation's seat over the whole land although they have 22 percent in in 1947 they kicked out the majority of the other population so they become majority and now inside of Israel not West Bank and Gaza you have almost 80 percent Jewish population against 20 percent of Palestinians foreign [Music] alone foreign foreign [Music] not at all come in here to this area sure they always feel too much free to go everywhere and that's why we are the people who get hurt from this and not they do you feel that you are the victim here of the conflict in this country sure in terms of the long-term future for Arabs and Jews same as now because we are different cultures and we see things differently and we don't we don't understand each other like neither them us they don't think the same as us they don't feel the same as us about stuff what's it like to live in a city are they country that is surrounded by walls that you're such a militarized presence on the streets military personnel I'm used to it doesn't bother me actually it makes me feel safe the walls uh impress me the walls show that we have failed as human beings as Israelis as Palestinians we figured out how we can't get along and that's that's depressing [Music] [Laughter] for the past 14 years here in Berlin West of Ramallah Palestinians have gathered after Friday prayers to protest at the occupation of Pate regard as their land by Israeli settlers to Stang Garden a wall like this if you have any sympathy or understanding why people protest on this side of the wall I'd really like to get your opinion he don't have any opinion we just have a gun one two three four few parents are Argentinian born I don't remember of course but they told me that they experienced anti-Semitism even with me don't play with this Jewish boy or some racist comments against Jews and it would have been a factor for many people moving here notwithstanding the Holocaust which was a precursor to the creation of Israel yeah and the Holocaust became a very big justification to have a state only for Jews like like taking the the Holocaust that it's something that happened to us Israelis not necessarily Jews it's us Israelis we are the ones who were killed I think Israel is really abusing the memory of the Holocaust we should struggle to separate holocausts from the state but it is a very controversial assertion to say that Israel is abusing the memory of the Holocaust yes but I'm not the only one who said it I'm not inventing it [Music] wrong lesson from the Holocaust the lesson should have been we should oppose this violent and brutal nationalistic ideas that turn to racism and all those forms of hating others instead the lesson we have to learn by this narrative is to be strong Israelis foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] divinity is terrorist and no I'm not dexterous um exe freedom fighter and I'm still Freedom Fighter what I changed is I don't believe in violence anymore and I believe that we have to fight for our rights in a non-violent way until the end of this occupation but you were thecubator I'm the occupier my name is Udi Gore I was born and raised in Jerusalem I live in Jerusalem and a member of combatants for peace and I also consider myself a Zionist occupier we use our personal stories as ex-combatants to persuade people that there is a chance for transformation between the two nations of course some people think I'm selling out that Israel understands only violence but we can't build our future on the blood of other people for me this is the way to live here because I want my children to have a different future we don't want to live separately we want to live side by side to continue working together the politicians trying to keep us separated by building walls between us by keeping us inside fences and keep controlling our minds by fears and hate and propaganda future when this conflict is over people are going to ask themselves why did we wait so long and such a shame about all the people that died some people will see me as a traitor but for me the fact that promoting peace is considered a strategical threat for the state of Israel it just shows how traumatized we are and how strong has the discourse of the conflict taken over us this is still a democracy there are many places in the world where if we were to do this interview it would be a death sentence at the same time I have to say we have experienced increasing demonization coming from the very top levels of the Israeli government foreign settler in 2015 that wasn't a government official doing it but there's a connection because the hatred trickles down to people that think that we are the enemies of the people our demagogues say that the Traders and someone like myself who is a religious Jew is the greatest Trader of the Traders I often get told take off your keepa take off your religious head covering how can you pretend to be a religious Jew and protect non-jews the problem today is not finding a a peace plan we have more than enough workable peace plans our problem is despair and the only way we can defeat despair is by through our actions and not with us with words but through with our physical actions with our bodies showing that a different reality is possible [Music] is my daughter your initial reaction you want to get even which is natural and most people choose this way but after a while you start asking yourself questions for killing anyone will bring her back we're causing pain to someone will ease this some variable pain and the answer is certainly not so you uh go to the other option which is much more difficult trying to understand what happened to you I was invited to join the parent Circle this was the meeting that changed my life Palestinian I am married they have six kids they're expensive in years in the Israeli jails when I was 17 years old I lost my 10 years old daughter in 2007 to an Israeli Border Police two days later I joined the parent Circle today I'm the spokesperson of the parent Circle and because of the blood of my daughter I think I have the moral authority to raise up our voice and to say no more blood I was so deeply moved you see I was 47 years old at the time and it was the first time in my life I've met Palestinians as human beings people who carry the same burden that I carry who suffer exactly like I suffer and this meeting shook my world completely 21 years ago I lost my 14 years old daughters mother in a suicide bombing in Jerusalem a year later I joined the parent Circle and ever since then I devote my life to express this one message we are not doomed it's not a destiny to keep on killing each other we need to start talking to each other to stop the circle of violence

#israelpalestine #israel #palestine",2023-08-18,745790,42372,9045,UCylNpQCufmDdAhs8CdLmUXQ, though the israeli-palestinian conflict didn't start with the June 1967 war the conflict would draw the borders which shaped history to the present day and gave us the occupied territories in just six days Israel was in control of the West Bank East Jerusalem the Gaza Strip the Golan Heights and the Sinai Peninsula by 1982 Israel had pulled out of the Sinai completely even dismantling settlements in the process but as for the rest of the territories Israel remains earnestly in control despite what Israeli officials say about Gaza there already exists two states for the Palestinians one in a Gaza a full-blown state run by Hamas Israel's own leading expert on international law professor yorum dinstein disagrees writing in his international law of belligerent occupation the proposition that the Israeli occupation in the Gaza Strip is over is not the prevalent opinion and the present writer cannot possibly accept it Human Rights Watch puts it even more directly whether the Israeli Army is inside Gaza or redeployed around its periphery and restricting entrance and exit it remains in control and despite what Israel's current information Minister distollidbarian says the Israeli Supreme Court has held that the West Bank is indeed held by the state of Israel in belligerent occupation the long arm of the state in the area is the military commander it's hard to argue with the fact that the continuing occupation which has been called the world's longest has brought decreasing material conditions and quality of life for the Palestinians whether through home demolitions routine raids in the West Bank the blockade of Gaza which has left nearly half of its citizens unemployed and 80 percent of its water unfit for human consumption to discrimination to checkpoints to settlements the consequences of the June 1967 war are a continuing issue the justification for the war has been in turn the justification for the occupation Israel holds the land today because they faced certain destruction at the hands of the Arabs so the Israeli story holds the conventional wisdom has held that it was only because Egypt's Gamel Abdul Nasser sought to destroy Israel outright that they launched their preemptive attack on the morning of June 5th 1967. according to Israeli historian Avi schleim in his Mammoth history of Israel the Iron Wall The Six Day War was a defensive War it was launched by Israel to safeguard its security not to expand its territory okay so in 1967 the Arabs mobilized for all-out war and this includes Egypt it includes Jordan includes Saudi it includes Syria this is going to be the big war where they finally get rid of this nascent Jewish state that is less than 20 years old in 1967 the Arabs LED This Time by Egypt and joined by Syria and Jordan once again sought to destroy the Jewish State Kamal Abdel Nasser mobilized troops in the Sinai Peninsula in hopes of eliminating the country but what if that weren't true what does that mean for the conflict that would mean that the continuing military occupation of the Occupy territories began

guarantee thank you Atlas VPN and thank you for sponsoring this video the 1967 war needs some context just months before the conflict things had been escalating rapidly between Israel and its neighbors what was once an atmosphere of animosity descended into a road to war on November 16 1966. on that day an armored Brigade of 4 000 Israeli troops accompanied by tanks launched an attack on the village of Samu in the West Bank which was then under the control of Jordan a devastating attack which killed 18 Jordanian soldiers when the first Israeli column reached Samu the soldiers started a carefully planned destruction of houses and property through shelling airstrikes and dynamite the troops destroyed 125 homes along with other buildings this marked the most serious escalation of the arab-israeli conflict since the 1956 Suez Crisis Israel claimed that the attack was a reprisal for Palestinian infiltrators Crossing into Israel from Jordan the explanation had little basis in reality since Jordanian troops had killed more Palestinians Crossing into Israel than the Israelis had nevertheless the outcome of the raid was favorable to Israel since its stoked resentment between the Arab states especially Egypt and Jordan Jordan felt that Egypt had failed to come to its defense the two countries would reconcile though reaching a defense pact which would have important implications in the ensuing Six-Day War also in 1966 the bath party had come to power in Syria their rule would see the adoption of a hard-line stance against Israel and as a result the bath regime began sponsoring Palestinian guerrillas to attack its citizens though the attacks were according to former Israeli intelligence Chief yehoshaphat-harkabi not impressive by any standard the Israeli establishment would become outwardly hostile in its rhetoric and reportedly considered attacking or even overthrowing the Syrian government with army Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin reportedly getting himself in hot water for saying on an Israeli radio show the moment is coming when we will march on Damascus to overthrow the Syrian government the situation was close to boiling over and just two months before the war six Syrian fighter jets were shot down by Israeli forces it's possible that this air War II was instigated by Israel though he wouldn't admit it publicly at the time Israeli defense minister Moshe Dayan would privately tell reporter Rami tal the truth in 1976. it would be published 21 years later after Diane had already died I know how at least 80 percent of the clashes there started in my opinion more than 80 percent it went this way we would send a tractor to plow someplace in the demilitarized area and knew in advance that the syrians would start to shoot if they didn't shoot we would tell the tractor to advance farther until in the end the syrians get annoyed and shoot and then we would use artillery and later the Air Force Israel's strategy of escalation on the Syrian front was probably the single most important factor in dragging the Middle East to war in June 1967. surprisingly Moshe Diane appeared to agree the nature and scale of our reprisal actions against Syria and Jordan had left Nassar with no choice but to defend His Image and Prestige throughout the Arab world thereby setting off a train of escalation in the entire Arab region this escalation culminated in Nasser moving troops into the Sinai and cutting off the Straits of Tehran which proved to be the nail in the coffin and on June 5th war broke out when the Israelis launched the surprise offensive they attacked on a Monday knowing that on Wednesday the Egyptian vice president would arrive in Washington to talk about reopening the Strait of Tehran we might not have succeeded in getting Egypt to reopen the strait but it was a real possibility the Six-Day War was the most spectacular military victory in Israel's history on the morning of Monday June 5th Israel launched a surprise first strike against Egypt's Air Force Egypt had no fortified bunkers to speak of leaving its entire fleet exposed the strike wiped out 90 of its planes just sitting on the ground and just like that virtually the entire Egyptian Air Force was destroyed in less than two hours when Jordan and Syria joined the war their Air Forces were wiped out that same afternoon even in Iraqi Airfield near the Jordanian border was obliterated in all more than 400 enemy planes were destroyed in a day and one Fell Swoop Israel now enjoyed total air superiority against all its neighbors the U.N security Council introduced a ceasefire the next day June 6th by Friday June 9th five days into the war Israel had defeated the ground forces of Egypt and Jordan capturing Gaza the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem now Jordan Egypt and Syria all agreed to cease hostilities but the Israeli offensive continued having already captured the Sinai the West Bank and Gaza Israel continued its offensive on the Northern front to capture the Syrian Golan Heights this move ultimately cost Israel its diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union did Israel invade Syria to safeguard its security interestingly enough an Israeli historian Avi schleim same book where he claims the Six-Day War was a defensive War he cites Moshe dayan's posthumous interview where he describes the Syrian so-called threat you don't strike at the enemy because he is a bastard but because he threatens you and the syrians on the fourth day of the war were not a threat to us the war is often talked about for its lightning speed show of military might and the territory gained but one overlooked detail is the massive displacement that followed the Israeli offensive you see here how the war has destroyed the lives of thousands of families uprooting them from their homes roads throughout the West Bank were framed with long Columns of refugees civilians desperately crossed Rivers through shattered Bridges hoping to seek refuge in Jordan at a cabinet meeting defense minister Moshe Dayan was overjoyed with the number of refugees I hope they all go if we could achieve the departure of 300 000 without pressure that would be a great blessing the nakba or the major ethnic cleansing campaign of 1948 was less than 20 years earlier still fresh and Vivid memories of massacres such as the one at Daria scene compelled many thousands to flee after the war they would not be allowed to return as in 1948 Israeli forces made use of psychological warfare units who blared messages over loudspeakers mounted on Jeeps commanding the Arabs to leave their homes one operation in the city of calcilia forced out as many as twelve thousand people and destroyed over 800 homes the instructions were clear Evacuate the residents and destroy the place this pattern continued throughout the conflict among the largest Villages cleansed were imwas yalu and baitanuba according to Israel's own estimates the war produced as many as 250 000 refugees adding to the more than seven hundred thousand produced as a result of the nakba the tally of displacement grew considerably as a result of this short but bloody and devastating conflict we've discussed the Syrian threat but the principal threat according to the Israelis underscored by their first strike was Egypt so did Israel really face imminent destruction from Egypt in 1967 the dictator of Egypt Gamal Abdul Nasser announced his plan in his words to destroy Israel in 1971 the now retired Lyndon Johnson would publish a political Memoir of the presidential years regarding the Six-Day War Johnson would speak candidly about Egypt which was at the time known as the United Arab Republic or uar during the evening of May 26 I met with Israel's foreign minister Abba eban who said that according to Israeli intelligence the United Arab Republic Was preparing an all-out attack I asked secretary McNamara to give Mr Ebon a summary of our findings three separate intelligence groups had looked carefully into the matter McNamara said and it was our best judgment that a uar attack was not imminent own autobiography published the next year indeed included the shocking admission that Nasser did not want war he wanted Victory without War a similarly worded summary can be found from amazingly the chief of Israel's foreign intelligence service the Mossad Egypt was not ready for a war and Nasser did not want a war even top military brass went against the official version in a speech proclaiming Israel's Victory on June 12 prime minister Levi eschall declared the Arab Leader's hopes of Exterminating Israel were dashed the first challenge to this myth reportedly began with Major General matit Yahoo Pele in front of an audience at the zatva club in Tel Aviv the crowd reportedly went into a shock when they heard the now retired General say the thesis According to which the danger of genocide hung over us and Israel was fighting for her very physical survival was nothing but a bluff which was born and bred after the war pellet had an interesting reason for speaking so bluntly he was actually offended by people saying that to pretend that the Egyptian forces were capable of threatening Israel's existence not only insults the intelligence of any person capable of analyzing this kind of situation but is primarily an insult to the zahal meaning the Israeli Army several other generals Then followed suit there never was a danger of extermination said Ezra Weissman who commanded the Israeli air force during its devastating first strike against Egypt we were not threatened with genocide on the eve of the Six Day War and we never thought of such a possibility observe General and Deputy Chief of Staff Hain barlev and we can't forget the chief of staff who was none other than future Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin who told Le Monde in May 1972 I do not believe that Nassar wanted War and finally from the mouth of another prime minister during his tenure in 1982 Menachem begin stated flatly the Egyptian Army concentrations and the Sinai approaches did not prove that Nassar was really about to attack us we must be honest with ourselves we decided to attack him more than half a century of military occupation while time seemed to have a somewhat civilizing effect on the Jim Crow south or apartheid in South Africa the Palestinians have not shaken their subjugation in fact it has only become Gravely worse with time it came as a shock to the Western World when the second intifada broke out on the heels of the second Oslo Accords which was seen as such a triumphant success for Jews and Arabs alike but whereas the Palestinians Once Upon a Time were able to say drive from Ramallah to Jerusalem in under a half hour or travel from Gaza to the West Bank new checkpoints walls and Israeli permits almost impossible to attain blocked their free movement Arabs now use different buses roads even using different license plates causing the progressive constriction of Palestinian life indeed things only got worse after Oslo more than half a million settlers now reside in the West Bank with no sign of slowing down bulldozing houses to pave way for new ones and with the new Israeli regime more Hardline than ever the prospect of full annexation of the West Bank seems more and more likely by taking the civil administration of the West Bank out of the hands of the military and into civilian control it will be administered by the federal government of Israel with the help of its major Patron the United States in 2019 the Trump Administration officially recognized the Syrian Galan Heights as being under the full sovereignty of Israel when asked by the Press if this sets a dangerous precedent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cited none other than the June 1967 war Israel was fighting a defensive battle to save its Nation I need your help this channel relies on donations and patrons everyone thanks so much for watching this video if you

182,qNoxt-I6MOY,Gaza: 60-Minute Warning | Al Jazeera World Documentary,"In May 2021, missiles from Israeli jets struck and completely demolished four towers in Gaza – that is a fact. What was not clear was the reason for the attacks. Why were these buildings selected for destruction?

Israel claimed the towers were used by Hamas, whose military wing was launching rocket attacks on Israeli towns and cities at the time. Local Palestinians in Gaza, as well as international media and political leaders, disputed this and maintained that the towers housed only businesses, residential apartments and media organisations, including Al Jazeera Media Network and American news agency The Associated Press.

This film charts the story of the attacks - from the 60-minute evacuation warning to the question of the cost of rebuilding - and seeks to establish why these towers were singled out, bombed and destroyed.

#Documentary #Gaza #Palestine #israel",2021-09-29,9450403,45237,9382,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg, [Music] is foreign [Applause] [Music] on the 11th of may 2021 israel launched a military operation against the gaza strip it was called operation guardian of the walls it followed weeks of increasing tension in occupied east jerusalem and in palestinian towns and cities throughout israel israel engaged in several provocations prior to any rockets being directed to from gaza to israel those provocations involve the evictions from sheikh jarrah neighborhood in east jerusalem and then there were the right-wing demonstrations given police protection in israel that marched through east jerusalem neighborhoods shouting slogans to the effect of death to the arabs and very provocative for leading to palestinian resistance and and then finally and perhaps most importantly the entry of israeli security forces to the aksa compound and mosque in the last days of ramadan interfering with the worship in this place that is considered a sacred site as part of this operation israeli warplanes bombed and destroyed four tower blocks in gaza city where palestinians lived and businesses were based these towers were in gaza's busy rumal neighborhood rimal is a commercial district and a residential area where media organizations and international agencies also have their offices [Music] [Music] you have the cassam brigades and sariah goods have an underground network underneath the gaza strip at this point that's been built for 15 years they have the capacity to keep their military operations and their planning separate from the largest uh civilian area in the gaza strip with the least military benefit because rimal is the furthest from the border it's it's the most densely populated area of an urban of the urban environment it militarily makes no sense the demolished towers were attractive to businesses because of the services they provided companies requiring stability rented office space there knowing that electricity water and other essential services were relatively reliable day and night the hanadi tower was known for its sea view it housed serviced hotel style apartments a health club media organizations technology businesses and residential apartments al jauhara tower housed the headquarters of several media organizations including the palestinian national news agency and other tv stations there were also restaurants offices and apartments was in the middle of the busiest street in gaza it contained dozens of shops import and export offices and some local media and there was al-jalaa tower with the bureau of al jazeera media network and the u.s media agency associated press were based on its lower floors were a range of business offices while the upper floors housed residential apartments all these towers are no more rami abdo heads euro mediterranean human rights monitor based in geneva it conducted an investigation into these attacks in gaza and came to broadly the same conclusion as the people on the ground at the time that the four towers had no military purpose whatsoever however the israeli army disagreed claiming the buildings were being used for military purposes so where does the truth lie why were these towers singled out bombed and destroyed this is exactly one of the of the questions that have has to be asked by whatever inquiry that should be held what was the primary goal of these attacks was it really to to damage military objects that were in those buildings or rather a show of force to intimidate the gazan population and if the latter and it does seem like the latter and if the latter that's an illegal attack and that's unlawful and might amount to a war crime the fact that missiles from israeli jets struck the towers is undisputed but what isn't clear is the reason behind the attacks or the process of how exactly a building is selected for destruction one man who may have an idea is yaron he's a retired israeli military commander who worked as a special operations officer at the central command of the israeli army when we know in the first one we know that there is a terror organization or there is a terror activity and one of the buildings or a structure there is a terror structure in gaza so first we start with our intelligent unit and we want to find out if there is civilians and not involve civilians in the building uh or around the building second if we know that there is a civilian there and we use many kind of ways to check this out so we warn them first of all we call them and we ask them to leave the house so the the only ones that will be hated it will be only terrorist in the in the place and not uh civilians or any other people that are not involved foreign [Music] foreign foreign israel has always presented its military operations as those conducted by the most moral army in the world but anyone that's looked scrutinized its behavior from an objective point of view understands this to be propaganda or public relations designed to convince the world of something that's essentially not true or and really the reverse is true [Music] my foreign [Music] a caller from the israeli military gave a warning of the imminent bombing of al-jala a tower with the deadline approaching the owner pleaded on the phone for more time to evacuate hello [Applause] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] the israeli army often produces videos about hamas the palestinian group that has governed gaza since 2006. these videos say that hamas uses civilian facilities in gaza as what it calls human shields and this claim is used by israel to justify attacks like those on the four towers in gaza and other palestinian targets the first responsibility is on the hamas once the hamas using the people there as a human shield once he hiding behind the people so the main things that you should know that maybe the bomb is uh is smart we use a smart bomb but the bomb have no values and have no morale and you don't want to distinguish between terrorists and non-terrorist people especially when the terrorists use the people as a human shield and hide behind them is there is a wider argument that is being presented by israeli spoke spokespeople and that is that gaza in general was taken hostage by the hamas and that um you know and and and that we are um fighting an enemy that is um that is hiding in in civilian areas let's take that argument face value let's let's talk about a hostage situation if guzmans are hostages then you should allow yourself to do what you would be doing if israelis were hostages would you target a whole house with several combatants or terrorists and kill all the israelis that are being held hostages there i mean if israel really wants to to argue that that line that the gazans the gazan civilian population was taken hostage by the hamas well it should treat this situation as a hostage situation after bombing the hanadi al-jala and al-johara towers the israeli army gave its justification for the action it claimed those towers housed hamas intelligence officers it also accused hamas of using al-sharok tower for what it called terrorism purposes foreign israel has claimed at least in one case that i know of that hamas offices and to be precise hamas intelligence was housed in one of the of the towers however there is another principle of international laws of warfare and that is the principle of proportionality it's not enough that the target is legitimate um if uh the expected result of an attack um is massive uh uh damage to civilians and civilian objects that outweighs the military advantage of of erasing the the military target then the attack is also illegal in military terms the principle of proportionality concerns the obligation to weigh military objectives against the risk of harm to civilians armies around the world have the use of advanced weapons technology some guided missiles are able to limit the damage they cause while others are highly destructive and that includes those used to bomb the residential and commercial towers in gaza this choice of missiles gives the attacker the option of creating a targeted explosion in one part of a building or launching a high-impact missile strike capable of destroying an entire tower block israel has precise munitions and bombs that make the notion of a mistaken strike almost impossible to believe in other words these missiles and bombs are so sophisticated in their targeting and are linked to gps systems as to guide them precisely to their intended targets israel in the past has shown that it has this capacity in assassination attacks or what is called by israel targeted killings we had seen instances where missiles were shot at a specific window specific apartment specific rooms [Music] foreign [Music] one of the one of the most important aspects of the principle of proportionality is the test that asks whether the same goal can be achieved with a more targeted more focused more restricted use of force that would put in risk much less civilians and civilian and civilian objects and so if for example um the israeli forces reached the conclusion that there are hamas uh military offices in an apartment building in a in a tower and they are located in one or two floors and they can target those floors only then of course if they target the whole building that would be unproportional in if they knew that the uh strategic military militarily relevant equipment was in the building that they must have known where in the building that it was i mean it would be hard to have the one type of knowledge without the other type of knowledge and i think that a more reasonable interpretation is that this military operation was directed not only at hamas but at the overall population of gaza they had a hybrid motivation of both deterring and destroying what they could of hamas's capabilities but also warning the people that if they tolerate the leadership of hamas they must expect to suffer consequences at the same time i've lived there for a number of years and if there's nowhere safe in gaza they're using the the large weaponry as a spectacle to create an image that it goes on television um that's what it's for it's so that everybody in gaza gasps and says oh my god that is the point of that that is the military objective is to scar civilians it's to terrorize civilians it's to create a punitive cost a penalty for resisting for not just staying in your ghetto on starvation level uh israeli allowances through the checkpoints and to not say anything about it and as soon as you fight back they want to make the cost as heavy as possible while israel and israeli lawyers have been referring to the hamas offices as a justification for the attack other israeli spokes people have said different things they have talked about the um the damage to the towers as an advantage in convincing the palestinian population that the way hamas conducts its affairs will bring about economic collapse that the collapse of the buildings is intimidating and you know it's a show of force now these kind of statements give rise to even deeper suspicions that it's not just uh a disproportional attack but that actually the the target of the attack was not a legitimate target the aim of the attack was not legitimate because intimidating the civil society the pub the population is not a legitimate aim uh in in the laws of warfare foreign foreign foreign there's a lot of talk in the israeli media about as if hamas is separate from the palestinian people as if they wouldn't be protecting their own families they won't put a military installation in the same building as their families because that's not logical um to do as a family member so we have to think of these things in human terms the israelis managed to dehumanize the conflict but nobody in hamas is setting up a dangerous application next to a civilian environment [Music] in 2014 in the protective age operation that when they used a dense area when they hide behind the civilians they will be protected and and um there will be immune in immune there will be immune uh behind these people and i can tell you that in the case of a gelal building they abused they actually abused al jazeera and other media because they knew that we will not hit this building will not bomb this building after al jalaar tower was demolished the president and ceo of the associated press news agency spoke to the media we are shocked and horrified that the israeli military would target and destroy the building housing ap's bureau and other news organizations in gaza they've long known the location of our bureau and new journalists were there as we pressed for proof of the allegations that hamas was inside that same building as the ap and al jazeera bureaus let me bring in the ap's top editor sally busby were you ever informed before yesterday that hamas might be operating there in the building no we've heard the israelis say they have evidence we don't know what that evidence is we think it is appropriate at this point for there to be an independent look at what happened yesterday an independent investigation into what happened yesterday department of security and safety used um um i think the army should present its case and evidence to the public in general it's unconceivable that a residential civilian tower is being pancaked and the army that does it does not explain what was there that justified such a horrendous um brutal attack the people that need to have these proofs people that have the have the proofs and have the all of the details that they they should have about about the hamas and we have it but not every time we can uh expose uh the details to all of the world because some of the some of the evidence are based on intelligent units so we cannot expose everything but we do expose it to united states as an example and to people that need it for uh and to we want them to know and to see that there is a terror infrastructure in this building gaza had a bombing over the weekend that housed a u.s media organization do you feel that that was justified have you received a briefing on that do you want to get a briefing on that at this point to me looks like a major mistake by the israelis uh and i welcome contrary information but this is part of the reason why we need to get a ceasefire very soon israel is not going to provide some sort of proper evidence that these towers were used for military purposes the buildings themselves are commercial buildings the al jalal building is a mil is a media building that has media offices functioning all the time people coming in and out all the time more so than any building in the entire gaza strip other than maybe a hospital people are going in and out of that building all the time the idea that you have a secret facility in that building it just doesn't hold to me so-called dahia doctrine which was developed in the war against lebanon in i think 2006 de gea doctrine was explained by the idf commander-in-chief at the time as deliberately inflicting disproportionate damage on the civilian population as a way of discouraging hezbollah provocations and in my view and in the view of the goldstone uh commission that investigated the 2008-2009 uh military operation in gaza the dahia doctrine has been consistently practiced by israel in other words it has made it part of its policy to engage in disproportionate responses to what it believes to be provocation i do think that israel's attacks against residential buildings against media targets against health care facilities in the gaza strip did help to shift u.s public opinion against israel because it was a very dramatic and very visible affirmation of war crimes that israel was committing that was played out in real time over social media over the news outlet i i never heard that united states criticized about el jalal building as what i know is unity israel gave them the information that they required about the hamas structures that they have in the building and from what i know they guess as they get it but i don't need i don't need to hear about this news i know i know because i know i know the idf and i was serving in the idf we will never hit uh any target or any infrastructure that we we don't know for sure that the it's used by the hamas or by any tier organization you're standing on madison in solidarity to push for an end to the violence happening tonight hundreds marched through downtown chicago as the bloody conflict in the middle east the chicago coalition for justice in palestine rallied in march tonight israel has been exposed it's been exposed downtown tonight brought thousands of people out in support of palestine i think that it's largely the result of grassroots pressure and the pressure from members of congress that resulted in a change in the biden administration and i think especially important was the statement that senator bob menendez who's the chair of the senate foreign relations committee put out after israel flattened that residential building in gaza that housed all the media offices and said that israel needed to be held accountable for what it did and that was very significant because senator menendez has been a champion of israel for many many decades in his congressional career so the fact that you had someone so prominent in such a high position in congress who is so pro-israel say these things i think that that definitely had a a big consideration in terms of changing the domestic dynamics of the politics around is using its right for self-defense international human rights organizations have also criticized the actions of both the israeli army and hamas since the violence human rights watch said quote rocket and mortar attacks during the may 2021 fighting in the gaza strip which killed and injured civilians in israel and gaza violated the laws of war and amount to war crimes in a separate report human rights watch stated it found no evidence that members of palestinian groups involved in military operations had a current or long-term presence in any of the towers at the time they were attacked although israel undertook a number of precautions such as advance warning of attacks in some cases air strikes in such densely populated areas resulted in a high level of civilian fatalities and injuries as well as the widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure such strikes raise serious concerns of israel's compliance with the principles of this distinction and proportionality under international humanitarian law and proportionality under international humanitarian law is found to be indiscriminated and disproportionate in their impact on civilians and civilian objects such attacks may constitute war crimes israel to drive the united nations top human rights official has condemned israel's expulsion of the un's special rapporteur from the country calling it unprecedented and deeply regrettable on monday israeli authorities detained richard falk and held him for 20 hours before putting him back on a plane to geneva israel has understood that its legal arguments are not persuasive so they've tended to attack the the person or the institution for instance they called the icc decision pure anti-semitism you know rather than saying it was wrong for legal grant they didn't bother with the argument and the same thing in in my experience they they want to wound the messenger rather than deal with the message because their arguments are too weak now and that's why i've been saying that the palestinians are winning the legitimacy war their their grievances are gaining more public support and understanding than israel's prop propaganda even though it's heavily subsidized and all kinds of ideological for [Music] is bombing and destruction of its offices by the israeli military in gaza it said it viewed this as a clear act to stop journalists from reporting events on the ground efforts to rebuild gaza following the may 2021 attacks are slow two months after the bombings the world bank the eu and the un concluded a rapid damage and needs assessment report for gaza they estimated the recovery cost to be up to 485 million us dollars over the next two years the human cost was the death of at least 253 palestinians including 65 children killed in the israeli bombardment on the israeli side 12 people including two children were killed by hamas rocket fire [Music] despite the bombing of their offices al jazeera associated press and other media organizations continue to report on events in gaza

----------------------------------------------------",2023-10-20,8468019,364734,35367,UC-CSyyi47VX1lD9zyeABW3w," Hello, friends! It's been two weeks since
the Israel-Palestine war started. And now, the situation in Gaza
is no less than h3ll. Since 9th October, Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza. This means food, supply of medicines, water, and even electricity has been cut off by Israel in Gaza. On top of that, the
continuous bombardment is unimaginable. The scenes coming out of Gaza are shocking. Look at this footage. Entire neighbourhoods have been reduced to rubble. These were the Gazan
buildings that were targeted by Israel. Estimates show that more than 2,800 Palestinian civilians have been k*ll*d. Thousands are still trapped in this debris. The ones who are still alive are trying
to get shelter in hospitals and schools. But by 16th October, water was also running out
in the  United Nations shelters too. The United Nations agency
UNRWA said on 15th October that they are witnessing an
unprecedented human catastrophe in Gaza. Mehmood Matar, a surgeon working in Gaza, told BBC that hospitals are completely overwhelmed. There is no water, no electricity, and the network connection is also unstable. He said that he was looking for water. Another doctor working at
Naseer Hospital in Gaza said that fuel is also going to run out. There are 60 patients on dialysis. 35 patients are in ICU they need ventilators. If fuel runs out, it will not be possible to save them. And this isn't in only one hospital. It's the same everywhere. On 17th October, health officials said that the only oncology hospital in Gaza would be shut down within 48 hours if the situation continues like this. And all cancer patients will be left without critical care. Take a look at the map of Gaza, friends. It is a small place. This strip is spread over just 365 km². If you compare it with the size of New York, you will realize how small it is. Even if you compare it with Delhi, it is almost 1/4th of the size of Delhi. In this small area, 2.3 million people live. This is one of the most
densely populated places in the world. Even before the war began, the living conditions here were very bad. The people who lived here were constantly under Israeli surveillance and could not even travel beyond
Gaza without Israel's permission. It is also important to mention that out of the 2.3 million population, almost half of the population are children. You heard it right. This is the reason why according to the estimates, out of all the people k*ll*d in this war, 60% of them were the women and children living in Gaza. But the situation was so
bad even before the war began that those criticising Israel
called Gaza an open-air prison. As if the place is an open jail. On 7th October, Ham*s attacked Israel, which started this war. But in response, Israel is continuously attacking Gaza. By putting a total blockade on Gaza, due to which, not only Ham*s members are being k*ll*d, but also Palestinian civilians. And now Gaza has turned into h*ll. People say that dolling out collective
punishment like this to the people of Gaza Israel's action is no less than t*rr*rism. The Norwegian Foreign Minister said that it is unacceptable to impose a total blockade. At least humanitarian aid, such as
medicine and food, should be allowed in Gaza. United Nation's Secretary-General
Antonio Guterres had a similar opinion. Israel should allow humanitarian aid in Gaza and Ham*s should release Israeli
hostages without any conditions. Imagine in such circumstances, if you were a common person living in Gaza, what would you have gone through? You don't have electricity, water, internet connection is cut-off, you can't get food from anywhere. And then one day you suddenly see some pamphlets falling from the sky. On those pamphlets, there is a warning from Israel. In the warning, it is written that all the people living in the north of the Gaza Strip should evacuate and go to the south of the Gaza Strip. You can hear the sound of bombardment all around. And now you are being warned to vacate your house as soon as possible and go to the south if you want to survive. According to the estimates, about 1.1 million people live in Northern Gaza. The IDF warned everyone to evacuate and go to the South. The shelters of the United Nations in Northern Gaza were no longer safe. Anyone could be targeted in Northern Gaza, the hospitals, schools or even clinics. The UNRWA pointed out that many pregnant women, children, and elderly people would not be able to move. Where will they go? How will they evacuate? On top of that, the World Health Organization strongly condemned Israel's orders. There are 22 hospitals in northern Gaza which have more than 2,000 patients. How will hospitals be evacuated? Despite this, the Israeli military said that around 600,000 Gazans evacuated from the northern area to the south. 500,000 people did not evacuate, but let's assume that you were
among those who evacuated to the south. But does this mean you will be safe from the bombings? ""Our people that were k*ll*d or injured during these aerial strikes, in their homes in Deir al Balah, which is located in Southern Gaza."" We witnessed instances of airstrikes in Central Gaza, where the homes of many families were destroyed. People living in Southern Gaza aren't safe either. Khan Yunis, a city in Southern Gaza,
had to suffer through multiple airstrikes. A BBC correspondent confirmed
the air strike in southern Gaza a building near the Rafah crossing was damaged indeed. According to the correspondent, Israel hit the area near the
Rafah crossing point at least thrice. This area is very important. Look at this place carefully. Rafah border crossing. This is the border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. If there is no safe place in Gaza, people will obviously think of leaving Gaza. On one side, there is the sea, where you cannot go. On two sides, there is the country of
Israel, where you obviously cannot go. So, the only place that you can flee to is Egypt in the south. And there is only one border crossing here. The Rafah border crossing. So, what would you have done in such a situation? To escape the bombardment, you would have tried to flee Gaza. Thousands of people tried to do this so they gathered at the Rafah border. But Egypt is not ready to open this border. Egypt and other Arab countries say that it is unacceptable for Palestinian
refugees to go to their countries because the Palestinians have their own country. They cannot be thrown out of their own country. In the midst of all this, the danger of the war escalating is also rising because clashes were seen in Israel and Lebanon. North of Israel is Lebanon where the H*zboll*h militant group operates. Like the Ham*s group, H*zboll*h is also backed by Iran and there has already been
a war between H*zboll*h and Israel in 2006, which lasted for a month. Here, I'd like to tell you that if you cannot understand any concept in my videos, you can try ChatGPT,

What has happened now is that in the last few days, there has been a brief r*cket
firing between H*zboll*h and Israel. On 16th  October, an anti-tank
missile was fired from Lebanon which fell on a town in northern Israel, and injured three people. Israel has ordered its civilians to evacuate the area near the Lebanon border. The biggest threat here is that H*zboll*h is actually more dangerous than Ham*s and more powerful. They have lakhs of r*ckets and missiles which can attack anywhere in Israel. On top of that, Iran has also warned Israel that if Israel tries to do a ground invasion in Gaza, that is, if it deploys its army to Gaza on the ground, it can get a response from other places. It should also be noted here that around 900 Indian troops are stationed at the Israel-Lebanon border. They are a part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force. United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. Our Indian troops have been stationed there since 1978. On 15th October it was reported that a r*cket shell fell near the site in southern Lebanon. Thankfully, no casualties were reported. It is still a big mystery how could Ham*s collect more than 5,000 r*ckets in Gaza and how was Israel completely unaware of it? In the last video, I said that Egypt had already warned Israel that an attack was imminent. Later it was found that America also had information about it and they also warned Israel too. There was an update on 28th September by multiple streams of intelligence that Ham*s can launch r*cket attacks across the border. On 6th October, one day before the attack, American officials circulated a report that Ham*s was showing unusual activity. And an attack could happen at anytime. A Middle Eastern diplomat in Washington DC told CNN that his government was repeatedly warning the White House
and thw US intelligence officials that there was a build-up of weapons by Ham*s. He also said that they have so many weapons in Gaza that it was 'beyond anybody's imagination.' So, obviously, the question arises, did the Israeli government already know about this attack and they did nothing? Here, take a look at Israel's internal politics as well. I had talked about this in this video. For the past few years, Israel's politics has been quite unstable. Many elections were held and the current Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been charged with fraud, breach of trust, and taking bribery in three different scandals. Allegations are that billionaires have given him money. He denies this but a corruption trial is going on against Netanyahu which include Cases 1000, 2000, and 4000. These trials are pending. I told you in this video how Prime Minister Netanyahu is trying to interfere with the judiciary. He is trying to change this process of how judges are selected. Citizens in Israel were out on the streets, there were nationwide protests in Israel a while back. Here, you might recall the same lines of Rahat Indori. ""Is there a lot of tension at the borders? Find out if the election is around the corner."" Since the start of this war, Netanyahu has used emergency powers to keep his position secure. Had this war not happened, and the corruption trial against him went on as scheduled, would he have had to resign
from his Prime Ministerial position? That's another important question. Apart from this, another allegation
that is being put on Netanyahu is that he tried to encourage the Ham*s group in the past. On one hand, there was the great
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, whom I talked about in the
video on Israel-Palestine history. He tried unrelentingly to bring
peace between Israel and Palestine. The peace process was almost over when a fanatic shot him. On the other hand, what did Netanyahu do? He leads a right-wing government with the chest-thumping approach. He divided the power between Gaza Strip and West Bank. He ignored the legitimate
Palestinian Authority and President And Ham*s, a t*rr*rist organisation, he tried to negotiate with
them indirectly through Egypt. Look at this article in The Telegraph. ""How Benjamin Netanyahu empowered Ham*s and broke Israel"" This 18th October article from the Times of Israel. ""For years, Netanyahu propped up Ham*s Now it's blown up in our faces"" It states that, according to several reports, Netanyahu had said that they should facilitate transfer funds to Gaza so that there can be a separation between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Ham*s in Gaza. He said that this gap would ensure, that a Palestinian state will never be formed. An extreme right-wing politician from his political party had made a statement in 2015 that Israel's policy is to treat
the Palestinian Authority as a burden and treat Ham*s as an asset. The Israeli government allowed suitcases with millions of
dollars from Qatar to enter Gaza to benefit Ham*s in 2018. These may seem shocking to you but the majority of the Israeli
public already knows about these things. Because thankfully the Israeli media is still free. It does not sit in their government's lap. This is the reason why according to the latest polls, the approval rating of Netanyahu has been falling rapidly since the war started. According to a recent poll, only 29% of the Israelis support Netanyahu now. This has reached an all-time low. Israel is now witnessing protests against Netanyahu's government. People are venting their anger on Netanyahu. With placards in their hands. ""Bibi, you have bl00d on your hands."" ""Go to jail, Bibi."" In another incident, an angry mob shouted at the Israeli Cabinet Minister outside a hospital. And the minister had to go back. That person said, now it's time for them to take control. Them as in Israeli civilians. That's why I say, never have blind faith in any
government, organization, or group. Always take the side of humanity and think about the common people. Whether they are the common people living in Israel or the common people living in Gaza. Now you can click here to
watch the video on the Israel protests from a few months ago, when Netanyahu tried to take over the judiciary. Thank you very much!"
184,BnR4c38gIgM,All About the Israel-Palestine Conflict,"There is much more to say about the Israel-Palestine conflict and the Islamic war on Israel, but the idea was to give a summary of the historical events, especially of major conflicts like wars, and to show who was at fault each time and how we arrived here, in this time where the whole Islamic world manipulates the rest of the world merely by coming together and telling the same false narrative about Israel.

Note: I don't fully side with or support any state. This is merely a stance against the global hate agenda against the nation of Israel, a hate campaign that could also be done against any other nation. Every nation and state has flaws, so does Israel, but the flaws implied by the Islamic World are just the result of their hate of this nation.

Intro & Outro Visual + Intro Music, made by Egyptian Atheist (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpy7iVGpbhNQ2wKH3g7aTVA)",2018-12-02,281764,18825,4669,UCzREuchzOqiawpEpvEM0Tyg," Israel saying that name is enough to get people's attention to cause, some weird looks Or to cause a heated discussion so many people have an opinion about Israel some hate it Others don't even want to recognize it and some are just in love with it and there are some who think that Israel a tiny country with eight and a half million people is responsible for as many problems in the world as you can think Especially the problems in this world but hey let's focus on the conflict we have three parties here Israel the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority and Gaza under Hamas the two Palestine's here are not really a light and Israel deals with both of them separately the peloton and authority in the West Bank is also backed by the Arab League and most of the Islamic world many states don't even want to openly support the hamas-controlled Gaza Strip because Hamas is an Islamist terrorist organization that was elected by the Gaza Population, while some countries openly supported Or at least defended Israel has been very much standing alone in this conflict over the last decades despite their good international relations except for the support of the Jewish Diaspora and the United States of America and Allies that is today essential for Israel's survival but while there are so many conflicts in this world why are so many nations So many unions so many people directly or indirectly involved in this conflict What is really going on let's go into history and find out for better navigation depending on What you're interested in you can go to the specific part of this video through the pinned comment I will talk about the history before the conflict about Zionism the British era where the conflict began the time after Israel's independence Today and lastly the Islamic world against Israel Hebrew people lived in this area over 3,000 years ago in rather traditional sources with some historical support We see the Kingdom of Israel and Judah ruling here 3,000 years ago and more historically documental we find a Jewish autonomous Kingdom the Hasmonean kingdom under the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire Afterwards Jews lost their autonomy and became mere subjects under future rulers until they were expelled and eventually came back the region Was ruled by the Romans the Persian sassanids the Byzantines the Islamic caliphates Egyptian Islamic? dynasties cell chooks the Crusaders the I you beat Caliphate the Mamluks And finally the Ottomans you see what a mess this is Islamic rule came first with the second caliph and companion of Muhammad Omar he conquered this region during the early Islamic conquests and heavily Islamized this region while also admitting the formerly expelled Jews back into the region Jews were previously expelled by others now they were back but they were also reduced to second-class Citizens under the Islamic Limi system with major religious restrictions that included bans on Jews entering specific places holy places for Jews Jews like Christians were also forced to pay protection money and to wear Distinct clothing that marked them as Jews as Jewish infidels completely in accordance with Islamic law Jews underwent massive massacres under both Muslim rule and future Crusader rule and found their peace slowly in the Mamluk Sultanate and eventually in the Ottoman Empire in the Ottoman Empire Jews also became the absolute majority in Jerusalem and a large minority in the region at the end of the 19th century through migration and land purchase but complete religious freedom was never secured and the Ottoman Empire made heavy restrictions on Jewish emigration in the late 19th century an important man Jewish Austrian journalist and activist Theodor Herzl Published a pamphlet in Germany and Austria called des you didn't start the Jewish state informed the modern Zionist movement in this pamphlet he proposed the unity and settlement of Jews in either Argentine or the historic Jewish home Palestine in order to end the seemingly endless suffering of Jews under the rule of others According to him this newfound secular state should be non interventionist in alliance with Europe militarily neutral and defensive a state that doesn't conquer or colonize the land should be taken with the agreement of whoever holds the land to rule in this land autonomously or independently while also helping whoever gave them the land Argentine was an option because the Jewish population At a scara's population of its own and had a lot of potential that Jews could bring out but Palestine was preferred because it was always home to Jews and had religious cultural importance Herzl thought that the Ottoman Sultan would agree because Jews would bring a boom to the economy but things changed not long after World War one broke helped Herzl had died but his dream lived on and it was now the British Empire that ruled over this region not the ottoman empire that lost the war The region was now practically part of the British crown historically a state or a nation Seizes land in war comes to an agreement Or eliminates the previous holder and is then entitled to the land in this case the British took control of the region previously held by the Ottoman Empire and then started making plans for it this is where it gets a bit complicated And weird the Brits made three different Agreements or promises for this region before and after they captured it the first promise Was to grant this land to Hussein bin Ali a leader in Arabia who had been invited by the Brits to revolt against the Ottomans for Arab independence this promise was broken when the Brits gained control over the region by themselves the second promise was the Balfour Declaration a public declaration of support for a Jewish home but also for the protection of the people who lived here and their rights they thought it was possible to create a home for both Jews and Arabs the third was the sykes-picot agreement a secret correspondence between the British and the French in which the region would be split and annexed between the French and the British crown this secret agreement was revealed by the Russian Bolsheviks after the Russian Revolution it contradicted with the promise to the Zionists and also angered all other parties especially the Arabs who saw this rightly as a great treason the plan was a disaster and never came into existence although Conspiracy theorists still claim it is somehow inaction at the end of the World War the League of Nations was formed and regions held by the UK were now officially recognized as mandates a mandate was an entity Administered by whoever has power in order to form new working entities in the controlled regions or to administer them until they can become self-sufficient And independent the UK's aim was clear create a home for both Jews and Arabs but Also keep them close to the UK it didn't really go very Well initially both Jewish and Arab authorities were installed in order to recover from the war stabilize the economy and have equal opportunities for the bright future of their own people the Zionists were fine with it and started working The Arabs were not are they considered all of this an occupation they had no understanding for the war result and didn't want the British Administration and any Jewish influence and immigration at all the Arabs staged major revolts in 1920 21 29 and 36 these riots were very violent and caused a massive displacement of Jews from specific regions and Attracted more Arabs from outside the region the 1936 revolt, was the largest but it Was also a major defeat for the Arabs and? consequently the British expelled many of the responsible Palestinian leaders and some fled one of them was a Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Amin al-husseini who first fled to neighboring lands and Eventually to Nazi Germany and fascist Italy let's come back to that in a bit after this major revolt the Brits ordered a commission known as the peel Commission this Commission investigated the whole conflict and concluded that the Mandate of Palestine had become unworkable and suggested a new plan of the partition of the region into a Jewish state and an Arab state This, was the first official plan for a partition the plan was never adopted due to disagreements on both sides instead of the British crown introduced the white paper in 1939 a one state solution for Jews and Arabs once again you can see that the Brits had big difficulties settling this conflict this plan also restricted Jewish emigration heavily and made restrictions on further land purchase by Jews the Jews had purchased a lot of land from Arabs before and this was seen as a cause of The unrest this deal stayed in effect. Until 1948 and served as a buffer that prevented the conflict from getting Worse Jews had been mostly defensive and retaliatory prior to this plan in that they defended themselves against British authorities and Arab attacks and responded with revenge actions but now some Jewish groups lost hope for a solution and lost their trust in the British crown and Created local violent militia some of these were loyal to the Zionist in charge while others like the group Lahey renounced the Zionists in charge but declared an open violent fight against the British administration and the Arabs this group committed a lot of terrorist attacks like Arab groups would do it before And stopped its activities after the conflict but it, was there during the conflict and this group is Also very often brought up as a series of atrocities made by the Zionists but let's point out again that this group was a minority and was not in accordance with the Zionists in charge the Organization, also wanted to install a totalitarian Hebrew state and seek alliance with Nazi Germany a pretty stupid plan instead of the grand mufti Amin al-husseini whom we mentioned before was in Germany by now and had come together with Hitler already this is an important part of the conflict the mufti met Hitler and asked him to help rid Palestine of Jews and the Brits Hitler didn't officially agree to anything But he embraced the mufti in his forces and promised that if Hitler won the war and the Arabs overpowered the Zionists together they would eliminate any Jewish entity in Palestine the Palestinian Mufti was now a Nazi ally and also part of the infamous SS he made multiple Speeches in which he called Jews the greatest enemies of humankind and the Muslims accused him of being naturally despicable characters supported conspiracy theories of the global Jews Controlling the UK and the u.s. And advocated the removal of Jews from everywhere he sounded very much like Hitler Hitler Also included Palestine in his speeches in the parliament and with cooperation with the mufti the Nazis Distributed a pamphlet to the Arabs in which Jews were described as the Dajjal the prophesied false messiah in Islamic eschatology Who is also an Islamic scripture associated with Jews surprised and Hitler was praised as the great leader who would kill the that jar I don't think I have to expand much on that gladly the two Nazis could never fulfil this plan because Germany lost the war and Hitler Fled to Argentine, where he's still alive today just kidding he's dead in 1947 the Brits had enough they wanted to withdraw from palestine and terminate the mandate so the United Nations General Assembly we made an offer to the local parties whether they accepted or not a final offer the solution was to partition the region into an Arab state a Jewish state and an Internationally controlled Jerusalem although Jerusalem was majorly Jewish the Zionists didn't like it but agreed the Arabs had a different plan The plan was adopted Britain left and civil war broke out immediately the Jews were defensive they were quick and declared the State of Israel during the civil war with Israel becoming a state The civil war turned. Into a war between nations the Israeli Arab. War also known as the Israeli War of Independence it was now Israel and Israeli minorities against local Arabs Egypt Iraq Jordan Syria Saudi Arabia Yemen the Muslim Brotherhood Volunteers from other countries and briefly Lebanon the problem is that all these Arab parties didn't really cooperate With each other because Egypt Iraq Jordan Syria and all the others had their own interests in annexing Palestine Instead of creating a Palestinian Arab state a fact that many people today choose to ignore Israel won the war and with that violence and oppression against Jews in the Arab world increased immensely so that the Jewish exodus from the Arab world happened in a short time the vast majority of Jews from Arab countries were expelled or fled to Israel Israel expelled local Arabs in return this came to be known as the peloton in Exodus still a matter that is discussed today in this war Gaza was occupied by Egypt while Jordan was annexed by the West Bank and East Jerusalem Israel gained even more land than what was originally assigned but the supposed Arab Palestine was now owned by neighboring Arab States the Arab world dug themselves in a hole this is what Israel had with the partition plan and This is what they had now Great job Arab League I really want to ask the question now was this a great Plan wouldn't it have ended much better for the Arabs if they had agreed to the original plan Israel had now enough reason to expand its borders and did that in war can they be blamed for this diplomatically rationally No emotionally he after this piece never really happened over the decades Local Palestinian Arabs staged dozens of attacks together with Egypt and Jordan and never gained anything from that 18 years later Egypt caused another war by closing the Straits of Tiran a sea passage in the south to Israeli ships this was as declared in 1955 by Israel a war caused Israel declared war immediately Syria and Jordan joined on Egypt side and Israel won the war in six days which is why the war is known as the six-day war another great humiliation to the Arab aggressors as a result Israel captured Gaza the Sinai Peninsula the West Bank East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights Now Israel was even bigger the Arab League didn't learn from this mistake they came together after this war and made a historic declaration known as the three knows no peace with Israel no recognition of Israel no Negotiation with Israel the Arab world agreed to this and showed that they weren't interested in settling this conflict without eradicating Israel that occupied such a huge region in the middle of the Arab world around this time local Arabs finally came up with the idea to create their own organizations stop trusting the Arab nations and working to create their own Arab state while to force their own Arab state the organization's PLO pflp Fatah and others at different ideologies like Islamism liberalism or communism but the aim was a one state solution Without Jews but seriously they came up with this fifteen to twenty years after Israel was formed before this the land was just to? Be annexed by other existent Arab nations let's say it Israel didn't steal anyone's land this graph that you always see is completely misleading and wrong a land for Palestinian Arabs was never the plan until now in 1969 for the first time the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, was formed an organization that included the entire Muslim world inside it with the Palestinian Arabs it was only now that the global Muslims supported what they call Palestine today in the 60s and 70s and further on violent Palestinian organizations committed hundreds of attacks against Israeli citizens and Politicians Israel the occupied territories or outside the most significant attack that attracted international attention was the Munich massacre in 1972 when a group called Black September took the Israeli Olympic team Hostage during the 72 Summer Olympics the terrorists killed the entire Israeli Team and then killed a German police officer before they were killed our worst fears have been realized tonight It now said that there were 11 hostages two were killed in their rooms This is more yesterday morning nine Were killed at the airport tonight they're all gone this era Was full of chaos mass shootings bombings stabbings aircraft hijackings and so on in 1973 the Yom Kippur War broke out this was a surprise attack by Egypt in Syria on Yom Kippur the holiest day in Judaism the two nations declared war and attempted to invade Israel despite heavy disapproval from their big ally the Soviet Union Israel won again Soviet leader Brezhnev who was an ally to Egypt in Syria even made a humiliating Statement after this war Hiep said that the Arabs wouldn't listen to reason And were only interested in fighting a hopeless fight he even said that the Egyptian President called him at night and begged him for help which Brezhnev refused Syria and Egypt also committed atrocities Against captive Israelis in this war it was documented and proven that Hundreds of Israelis were tortured and killed in captivity this was a very difficult war Israel agreed to retreat from the Sinai Peninsula and agreed with Egypt to find a peaceful resolution for Gaza and the West Bank Israel had occupied these regions before in wars but never annexed them afterwards Egypt and Israel made peace for the first time and came together for resolutions this was a problem however because the Arab League agreed before that no one could make peace with Israel the Egyptian President Sadat was assassinated by Islamists for making peace with Israel in the following decades the first Intifada was launched a massive uprising of Palestinian Arabs against Israel in order to crush the Zionists And establish one state an upstate it was extremely bloody and was suppressed the PLO led by Yasser Arafat declared Palestine to be an independent state nevertheless in 1988 without having any territory the good thing was that this declaration Also recognized Israel as a state for the first time after 40 years around the same time an extremist Islamist organization was formed that will become very important later Hamas an openly anti-semitic anti Zionist Islamic fundamentalist organization that would encourage manage and commit many terrorist attacks including suicide bombings in the following decades an organization that was almost like Isis at that time Hamas Also declared in their fundamental covenant that the Jews were behind every war and conflict in history that the Holocaust Was their product that they provoked the Holocaust for their own interests and so on talking points that are nowadays found among mentally-challenged conspiracy theorists they also, made clear that death was holy to them that their allegiance was to Allah and that Islam would eventually eradicate Zionism meanwhile the Palestinian Authority led by the PLO sought a different path the Palestinian Authority Entered the Oslo Accords in the 90s with Israel where a solution was to be found up until a summit in the year 2000 but the result Was very strange Israel offered to make peace recognized Palestinian Authority to free Gaza and to give up the West Bank Gradually while also stopping or finding a proper solution to Israeli settlements in the West Bank a great offer what a hope for peace Arafat the leader of the PLO rejected the offer and never made a counteroffer in 2005 Israel retreated from Gaza Completely what happened instead is that Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip but the Gaza population elected a terrorist Organization since then Hamas has been active in a great peace process. Oh no wait Oh Hamas has been active in firing missiles to Israel organizing suicide bombings Broadcasting anti-jewish propaganda on TV organizing massive riots at the Israel border sending children to the border using international funds on military actions turning human buildings and schools into military posts and so on Occasionally Hamas attacks Israeli citizens then israel responds by evacuating targets and bombing them in the media you can see this as Israel bombed the Gaza Strip Coming back to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank things are much better since Israel built a wall and made hefty military Checkpoints in order to prevent further attacks from this side as they had happened all the time before but terrorists are still openly praised and celebrated in the streets families of dead terrorists are given rewards and Anti-israel propaganda is everywhere it almost looks like Palestinian Arabs don't even want peace or estate here is a list of times Palestinians were offered independence and peace All of these were rejected with no counter offers new talks happened and a new one is expected soon in the next months Israel is continuously Establishing Jewish settlements in the West Bank however and if the conflict isn't resolved over the next decades Israel could form a Jewish majority in the West Bank and could eventually absorb the West Bank but the thing is as mentioned before Israel offered many times to give up these settlements to come to a proper solution to give the West Bank to Palestine yeah it looks like the conflict will never end even if Israel came to a final agreement with the Palestinian Authority Hamas is still ruling over the Gaza Strip and Hamas insists on not recognizing the Palestinian Authority as their Representative on not recognizing Israel's existence on being repeatedly impulsively violent against Israel and pushing the same agenda destroy the Zionist enemies so what can we conclude about this conflict and the world we see today that Jew hatred is Disproportionately present in the Islamic world and hating Israel and maintaining conspiracy theories is Always the trend on television even in the most secular countries like Turkey Israel is called a terrorist state an Apartheid state in Israel every human regardless of their religious or ethnic origins has the same legal rights Everyone can be a citizen every citizen can vote and be voted for join the army rise to the highest Ranks be successful in politics teach build whatever company they want to build that is definitely not Apartheid not oppression outside of Israel Gaza is no more under Israeli control Gaza could choose to flourish and rise but they choose to fight as if they were still a subject of Israel world leaders who support Palestine all along find no fault in the Palestinian Arabs and fiercely criticize Israel feeding on the global ignorant of the history of this conflict, while maintaining without fully exposing the still continuing Arab deal not to recognize any Israel and not to make any deals with it did you know that 15 countries do not allow any visitors that hold an Israeli Passport and some of them don't even accept visitors that merely visited Israel before Where is the outrage about this the Jewish population in the Muslim world has faded where is the outrage While ideologues scream free Palestine Palestine itself refused its independence multiple times Where is the outrage? In global news you hear of the Israeli violence against poor Arabs with rocks in their hands When you see images like this you think of courage and oppression Here's something else to think about what is a child doing there in a violent protest where is the outrage why is it that in every Muslim community the Israel-palestine conflict is brought up so that even Muslim activists from Somalia can fiercely speak about destroying and defeating Israel do the same people speak daily about North Korea about Nigeria where tribes kill civilians about Political violence in South Africa about turkey and Kurdistan what unites people of a specific Background and a specific faith in their hate for Israel can't we see that the Arab world and the Islamic world with its collective Mindset fuels this conflict only recently, we have seen a major outrage around the world because the u.s Announced to move its embassy to Jerusalem Israel gained the right to do so half a century ago why would the u.s not recognize a majorly Jewish City annexed by Israel as the result of a defensive war as the capital of Israel where is the out o The outrage is there is just on the wrong side Can't we see that on one side there is a sovereign state that has spent decades on military on Defense on controlling borders but also became a top Contributor in science for the world a country where Arabs have more rights than in the Arab world while on the other side we have two territories that contributed nothing to the world and live on donations from the world territories where you can't even produce anything of cultural or Commerce significance because you have to be busy complaining and protesting all the time and suppressing culture and freedoms and punishing your own people I'm kind of glad that Israel retreated from Gaza and left Gaza alone this way everyone can see how such a territory acts Israel has been standing loyal to the Zionist cause that tio2 Herzl introduced in his ideas of a Jewish state everything is clear to me I don't need to pick a side I can just look at it from a rational point of view and Conclude that Israel has been a successful and peaceful country in the middle of troubled states where democracy and freedom is Non-existent or a major failure I don't even want to imagine what Palestine would look like if it Had accepted the dozen offers for a sovereign state we can just look at other countries in the region Thanks for watching if you have any issues with this episode feel free to tell me in the comment section if you like this video Don't forget to like to subscribe and to share.

of the Jewish and Arab populations in the Holy Land and the root causes of the current conflict.",2023-10-14,38794,1194,134,UChcwi-ZnEFhOtHAPTroiOnw," come Lord [Music] Jesus come Lord Jesus come Lord [Music] Jesus come Lord Jesus and the topic is how Israel came about and what you know some issues around the justice and Injustice of what's going on in Israel and between the Jewish state of Israel and the Palestinians you'll see why the air quotes eventually so let me begin uh kind of at the beginning I think kind of at the beginning yeah this is actually at the beginning uh you don't see what I'm seeing yet but you'll see it in a moment here okay okay we're starting at about 572 BC on the left okay uh my point in these first few slides is that there has been a continual Jewish presence in the holy land from 2000 BC uh until certainly since 500 BC to the present there was a short Interruption perhaps uh at the time of the Babylonian EX Exile okay but there's been a continuous Jewish presence in the Holy Land since long before Jesus okay so after the return from the Exile around 500 BC you see that there was a Jewish Community around Jerusalem and definitely spreading into heon and then in the herodian period which you can think of as around the time that Jesus lived the Jewish um the Jews had had spread and um and uh you can see the hash marks on the on the second map they had spread up to the Sea of Galilee and and north of it and they had uh spread down to the south of the Dead Sea that's the Dead Sea the lower the lower C there I wish there was a way I could put um a pointer on this um and there must be actually because I know that monkey Works has a pointer so there must be a way of putting a pointer on this but in any case the Dead Sea is the lower body of water and the Sea of Galilee is the upper one and um uh maybe I should uh pull up something that I wasn't planning to pull up here which is the um 12 tribes of Israel actually because then you'll see uh in the same kind of a way where the Jews were in the Holy Land um when they first crossed over from Egypt so where do I have the 12 tribes map I know I have it here well yeah I have I have actually two pretty good ones here to bring in okay so uh okay I'll do this one first whoops H okay okay oh how do how can I do this okay okay and then there okay okay so oh and and me I have to want to bring me back okay so here we have the uh Palestine at the time of the 12 tribes that's going back pretty far um anybody wants to argue that the Jews our Interlopers there we can talk we will be talking more about that of course but so here is Palestine divided among the 12 tribes so so let's get to uh again I don't have a I don't have a a marker on this do I I don't have a way to anyway okay you see the um green area in the Middle where it says Benjamin that's around where Jerusalem is uh you see the salt sea so that's the Dead Sea uh oh it says Jerusalem actually right below the green area it says Jerusalem so that's where Jerusalem is you've got the tribe of Judah that is actually goes out into the Gaza Strip um ashalon and Gaza then right north of Judah you have Benjamin then on the um west of Benjamin you have Dan then ephriam then manasse then Zebulon on um then going north Nali and Asher and then going um East you have manasse on the other side of the Jordan River by the way um and the land of Gilead which was not a tribe um and then Reuben uh on the uh east side of the of the Dead Sea of the salt sea so those are the tribes at the time of um the 12 tribes of Israel when when the uh Jews first entered and spread out oh well they spread out they were given land each tribe was given a territory and then let's uh see at the time of uh Christ is what we're looking at now and uh this uh should be maybe a little bit interesting I hope maybe we'll see maybe I talk too much but anyway um again you see the salt sea there um the Jerusalem Judea which is to the west of the salt sea and up where Jerusalem is it says HOSA HOSA for Jerusalem there you see Jericho and uh and then north of Judah which is that pale pink uh you see Samaria which is screen and you can see and Galilee is to the north of Samaria you see that Galilee is to the west of the Sea of Galilee that little sea that's between the pale green and and the kind of orangey pink up top and you can see how to get from Galilee to Judea you'd have to go through Samaria hence Jesus and at the well um you know where the Samaritan woman was and uh so that's that is the state of things at the time of the introduction of the Christian era okay but I really wasn't planning on doing that so I will go back to what I was doing so that is um where the Jews were after they came back from the Babylonian exile and uh after the 12 lost tribes were lost by the way which is what happened to the tribes up North and then at the Arab Conquest let's call that the fifth century you see there's uh Jewish settlements Hebron Gaza Jerusalem uh yafa Nablus which was um sheim in the Old Testament and safad around the Sea of Galilee as well as some on the far side of the Jordan River and then dur during the Crusades you see um and I'm going to stop talking in a moment actually to to see what uh to see where where you guys are at actually because I don't know if I'm losing people or not um but anyway uh during the Crusades you see Jewish communities again in Galilee um and uh around yafa and in Jerusalem Hein and Gaza now interestingly enough during the Crusades maypa maypa guess what side the um the uh the Jews actually fought on on the side of the Arabs during the Crusades um they were on pretty good terms and the Crusaders were not uh uh particularly um uh hospitable to either the Jews or the or the um Arabs I can't called them Muslims they weren't oh they were Muslims by then weren't they uh so I can call them Muslims they might have been solids too anyway so um that's during the Crusades and uh and then in more recent times um under the momls and then in the 16 Century so you can see those Jewish communities were were continuous there and then in the 1800s um in the 1800s they're still there and the uh 1800s saw um the second half of the 19th century saw a lot of Jewish immigration to uh Palestine and so you see by 1914 um there were much larger Jewish communities um the whole area from Jerusalem to the Mediterranean Sea and the whole area around Galilee much larger and then around hia which is um you don't see hia on the map yet but hia is directly west of basically where you see the um Sea of Galilee up north now um let's see what the next slide is okay so uh here we have actually let me see what the title of this map is because that's G to okay so it's the Jews of Palestine 636 to 1880 so it's uh um we we'll work through here um there there are several different symbols there uh the Black Blocks are the holy cities of Jerusalem where there was a continuous Jewish settlement from Biblical times the little black dots are towns and settlements inhabited in part by Jews during the time of the Arab rule from 600 to 1100 uh the cross-hatched areas are where the Jews formed the main population from the 13th to 19th century and the bullseye are the towns and villages with continuous Jewish communities from the 13th to the 19th centuries so you see from the 13th and 19th centuries there were continual Jewish communities in Gaza and heon in Jerusalem in Nablus um and in hia and in safat and in tiberias at the very least and then you see some of the historical events are are discussed there um for instance um uh oh in 1100 ad the Jews take part in the defense of Jerusalem against the Crusaders sorry about that fighting alongside the Arabs um in 1200 the Jews are driven out by the Crusaders from ashalon um which is actually right north of Gaza and many move to Jerusalem and then a lot of Jews came after the expulsion from Spain in 1492 that's when safat really became the center of Jewish uh theology anyway other expulsions in the 15th century um brought a lot of Jews to Jerusalem and to the Galilee um 1100 ad Jews take part in the defense of H against the Crusaders and in 1563 in safat there see pretty much in the middle there middle left right and kind of upper third uh in safat in 1563 the very first Hebrew printing press and the first printing press on the entire Asian continent was a Hebrew one in safat because that was really the center of Jewish learning and Jewish theology after the expulsion from Spain so um I know this I'm getting long winded um and uh you know what I have a request for you guys um keep the chat stream for um what's going on because that way I can use it for instance I see can you do slide five and six again I missed it I don't have numbers on the slides I'm sorry so I can't even tell you what slides five and six are um uh okay so anyway the I'm getting long- winded but my point is the Jews just didn't appear during the Holocaust it wasn't alien territory to the Jews between 70 AD and and 1940 ad okay that is a it's a myth it's a lie the Jewish population and I'll have some population slides um Jewish population was at times 25% % in Palestine it was maybe at times 15% it was maybe at times 30% um uh it may have been 10% at times but it was always significant and by the way it's not like the other 90% were Palestinian um because uh I have a list somewhere I don't have it in front of me of the number of languages spoken in Jerusalem it was like it was like 30 languages I mean there were there were Christians from all over the world in Jerusalem um there were uh Arabs and there were um uh Persians um I mean there were people from all over the Middle East there were people from all over the Christian world and it was a very very very mixed population most of the Palestinian families most of the families that now consider themselves Palestinian um date back at most to the 1830s um when they started to be uh influx of population into Palestine uh mostly from Egypt but from Egypt and Jordan and Syria and so forth and I'll get to that and that population came in in large part not entirely um but it came in in large part because of the development which came with the um uh Jews coming but anyway I'll get there maybe not all today let me go up to the next slide and see what it is okay so what's this slide called it is called Jewish settlement in Palestine from 1880 to 1914 okay so this is this is basically after Zionism began what we call Zionism today the Zionist movement uh a kind of a conscious movement um uh coming beginning in Russia uh in response to the pgrs in Eastern Europe but basically a uh started 1880s that Jews there was this like concerted um ideal of establishing a homeland in Palestine so let's see what this what the emblems here are okay the black dots are towns with mixed populations and the bullseyes are Jewish settlements established between 1880 and 1914 and the uh Hollow circles are Arab towns with very few Jewish inhabitants by 1914 now U there was something else going on around this time beginning of the 20th century which is called pan arabism which is basically um uh there was um for for much for much of the time between Christ and the 20th century there wasn't really any real tension between the Jews in Palestine and the Muslims in Palestine but then when the uh European Jews started coming in in greater numbers and they were um they were they were I don't want to say they were an upper class uh they but anyway they they were coming in they were in better better commercial economic situations than the uh Native uh you know the native Arab peasants uh there was some resentment which came up and there was also a fear that um that they were taking over over and there was also of course the Muslim uh antipathy to the to Jews and part of that Muslim antipathy the reason it wasn't a problem before then is that uh in the Muslim World Jews were accepted and tolerated as um second class citizens that basically had to pay a huge tax just to not be killed and so they were a source of income for the Muslims because basically the Jews were taxed into poverty and they accepted it because they had no place to go and they couldn't fight and so um they were quite a cash cow and so there really wasn't a problem uh when it was really under Muslim domination and it was also true in the other Arab lands um during this period that the Jews were tolerated as a cash cow tax paying minority and when I say tax I don't mean taxes like you know 20% income tax that everyone paid I mean like confiscatory taxes but anyway okay so here we have uh black dots which are towns with mixed population and bullseyes which are the newer Jewish settlements so you can see that there are a bunch of towns s uh including Tel Aviv by the way which were just established as Jewish settlements and there are towns the traditional historic um Arab towns which are now actually still very much Arab towns are the hollow do ralo which is the headquarters of the PLO uh Jericho which is pretty tough to go in if you're a Israeli nablas which is impossible to go in if you're not an Arab jenin which is you know and so forth you can see them there and then um you can see being heavily Jewish and north of the Sea of Galilee uh so here's some statistics there are some statistics there that um in n in 1880 uh the population was was what's that that's about 5% Jewish and by 1914 the population was almost 20% Jewish so you can see why that would have scared the um Arab population and then uh between 1880 and 1914 over 60,000 Jews entered mostly from Eastern Europe um seeking a new Homeland and they basically that northern part of Israel was a uh malarial swamp and they drained it and set up agriculture there and then uh between 1880 and 1903 over 25,000 Jews reached Palestine mostly from Russia and settled on the land and then 1904 to 1914 another 40,000 Jews arrived from Eastern Europe and uh anyway so so anyway you can see that anyway uh you're losing me oh no sound huh H let somebody let me know what the sound situation is okay some people have sound okay so now we're up to where it gets interesting because we're up to World War I we're up to World War I and World War I was really where where all the trouble started you could say uh um let me shrink this map down so you can see what the point of this map is okay World War I you know there were two sides in World War I there was the um losing side the bad guys which was uh among others Germany and turkey turkey was Allied with Germany and then you had the um allies of Britain France uh the United States and so forth and um Germany lost which meant turkey lost but turkey was the Ottoman Empire so the Ottoman Empire lost the Ottoman Empire was huge it was absolutely huge and somewhere here I hope I have a picture of the Ottoman Empire so let me uh find it here um that's not really the picture I wanted so let me pull in another picture of the Ottoman Empire uh here okay okay this is really a picture of the Ottoman Empire before World War I everything that's dark green there was the Ottoman Empire so you can see it was huge it was North Africa uh Egypt going over to Algeria and Morocco and so forth it was um turkey Syria Iraq of course um Israel Lebanon Jordan and uh you know the oil States anyway you can see it on the map right I don't have to read the names but that was the Ottoman Empire uh stretching up into Europe there um yeah pretty scary uh let me let me uh expand so I see okay so um um H I'd better put myself there okay so that's the Ottoman Empire um the way it was before World War I and now the way it was after World War I I can um I'll do I'll use this one uh I don't want to use that one huh uh okay so this is the way it was after World War I and um I don't think you can read the um uh partition of the Ottoman Empire I don't think you can read the uh the uh key on the bottom so let me get the key on the bottom here where you can read it uh which is okay so the blue is okay basically the Ottoman empire was divided up among the winners the French the British and the Italians and the Russians and a small International sphere so the blue is the French the red are the British the green are the Italians and the yellow are the Russians and there you have what happened to the Ottoman Empire I will shrink it in a little bit it became essentially protect of the winning Powers so you see the whole yellow area there uh came under Russian control the whole green area came under Italy control the whole Blue Area including the hollow blue area that says a was British and the whole red area including the hollow excuse me Hollow red area became French um which is okay so that's really and and and you can see huge huge huge swaths of land um I think it was 12 million square miles but I may be no may be something else I think the British part was 12 million square miles so then what you have is um this is the British uh actually I have to I have to to move move this a little bit this is actually where you where the problem starts the British the British controlled area uh of the ex Ottoman Empire included uh what's now Israel what's now Jordan what's now Arabia or at least that part of Arabia what's now Iraq um uh should let me see if I have a better yeah there's a better picture to use okay that that whole pink area is the British protectorate okay that whole big pink area Orange area I should say that was all Britain had and I think that was 12 million square miles now in about 1920 1919 uh the British uh decided to make a Homeland for the Jews out of a tiny tiny tiny slice of their protectorate um well not a tiny tiny tiny slice uh in 1920 the British decided to make a Homeland for the Jews in what I have circled with white there okay that was the original Palestine that was the original British Mandate of Palestine that the British government agreed to give to the Jew as a Homeland and that the um primary Arab leader of the day agreed should be a Homeland and could be a Homeland for the Jews so with that let me go back this is going to go on forever I'm going to have to leave for Mass before I finish um so uh so that I've circled it there just to show that it's only a small part of the British territory and um H let's see what's going on here uh oh I see what's going on here okay so that's only a small part of the uh British territory but I'll zoom in on the part that I've circled in white and that is that it's the Mandate for Palestine to British mandate for Palestine and you see that it encompasses all of what's now Jordan and goes up to the border of Iraq you know and the border of Syria and it's actually anyway I don't know what the N the current countries are that it encompasses but it is a lot more than the state of Israel and it was promised in the balfor Declaration to Israel and here is the um here is the text it's very short text actually it's one paragraph uh his Majesty's government view with favor The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best Endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object uh uh being understood that nothing shall be done which prejudices the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews of any other country and it was a letter from the foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom to the Roth Charles and to the Zionist organization and it was um approved here we have something that uh might be interesting here okay which is this is now a agreement between Amir I'm gonna okay uh let me an agreement between the only recognized Arab leader in the world King fisel uh and it is a treaty between him and the zionists agreement between Amir fisel huseni and Dr wisman and uh uh I just highlighted a couple of things um immediately following the complete of the deliberations of the peace conference the definite boundaries between the Arab State and Palestine shall be determined um uh all necessary measures shall be taken to encourage and stimulate immigration of Jews into Palestine on a large scale and as quickly as possible to settle Jewish immigrants upon the land through closer settlement and intense cultivation of the soil no regulation or law should be made prohibiting or interfering in any way with the free exercise of religion and then um finally so to speak you have the signatures of FAL Ian Hussein and Kim Weisman remember this was that whole British mandate territory that was um under discussion here and here you have actually the signed document so there you have um uh there you have you can read the signature of Kim whitesman pretty easily but the signature of King fisel is a little bit harder to read so so um that was the start of things I'm GNA I'm going to fast forward now um so let me go back to Studio mode and let me get rid of that okay that was the start of things you see the territory that was originally discussed so to speak or originally offered I should say not discussed and then you have um h i don't have everything I thought I had here but I I I can get it easily um uh okay maybe this will do okay okay so I'm fast forwarding so this is going to get a little bit sloppy but what you ended up having by the time uh by the time you got to 1948 you had uh well actually no I should I should use another one I should use this one perhaps instead it'll it'll uh make more sense I think whoops oh man is that really true huh oh I see where it is okay here we are um okay um by the time you um get to um 1948 and the UN partition plan for Palestine uh the Jews had already lost about 80% of the territory that was um originally given to them in the Bal for declaration okay what you have here is uh uh this is really important boys and girls what you have here is the boundaries of Arab the Arab nation of Palestine let's say the the the UN divided up that that whole area on the east side of the Jordan River has already been given to to um to be the air country of Jordan by the way where no Jews were allowed to um own land I don't remember whether they were to live there they certainly were forbidden from owning land there that so that whole area that is time of the um Bal for declaration um boy it would be really good to have the right technology that whole that whole Eastern end which was like 80% of the territory was uh was lost or was given to the Palestinians to be Jordan were given to the same people that were the Arabs living on the other side of the Jordan River the Arabs living on the far side of the Jordan River they were one people the uh first king of Jordan said Palestinians are jordanians jordanians are Palestinians you know they were one you know ethnic historical group they were given 80% to be their country and then about 20 to 25% was held over for the Jews so they already had lost a huge amount of that mandate and then um at the time of the uh United Nations partition they lost another good slice as a matter of fact they lost more than half of what they had left because what you see is that the UN took all of what is um green there and gave it to be the Arab state of Palestine let's say and it took what's orange there and gave it to be the Jewish state of Palestine or Israel and although it looks like a lot of territory everything south of bishea is the Sinai desert okay everything south of Gaza is pretty brutal desert so basically the habitable land the arable land is pretty much all green there um and the UN was not silly in doing that distribution it wasn't a terribly generous distribution to the Jews but they weren't silly because um here you have the uh population distribution it's hard to see because it's all black and white but the um black part of the circles are the um Arab population and the gray part are the Jewish population and you can see that maybe you can't really see because it's you know not a very good picture to look at but um you know the the most of the areas I'll zoom in a little bit for you most of the areas um you know most of those circles a lot of those circles are mostly black right some of the circles are all black like in Gaza there um around Tel Aviv most of the circle is gray around hia half the circle is gray and a lot of the circles in Galilee have a lot of gray but a lot of the circles are pretty darn black and then if you look at land ownership um this is a little easier to see the the uh red is land owned by Jews and the green is land owned by Arabs and you can see how most of the um most of the land in most of the country is actually green there now however the the Arabs who owned that land were not Palestinians they were um absentee landlords in in Egypt and Syria and so forth most of the land was actually held um by as huge huge huge Estates um by you know by Foreign um uh Lords um that then um that then collected uh you know rents or or taxes from The Peasants who um actually worked the land but anyway you can see that a lot of it is Arab and so the the UN partition was not in its from that perspective was not silly whoops wrong one is this the right one yeah but so okay so day one the UN says okay these are you know these are the new boundaries say it's it's UN resolution 181 they say as soon as possible the Jewish community in Jewish Israel will come up with a constitution and a democratic way of establishing a government same thing in the Arab territory so that's what the original boundaries of of Israel were but then as soon as the um state of Israel was established by the in uh five Arab countries launched war first of all the Palestinians in other words the Arabs in the green areas did not accept the un uh division of the land did not did not agree to found a Palestinian state in the green area uh they didn't they didn't you know cooperate or agree to the UN resolution and all of the Arab states surrounding you can see Jordan Egypt Syria Lebanon launched immediate War expecting to be able to eliminate the Jewish state within days a week or two at the most so and they told uh you can see that most of the Arabs were not in the Jewish state area I mean a lot of them some of them were but the Arab states when they launched the war told the Jews who were in that orange area leave leave now leave to the green areas leave to our countries get out of there so that we can kill everything in sight because they were planning to exterminate all of the Jews and as soon as we're finished which shouldn't take more than a few days or a week you can come back and you can have all their property so most not all but most of the Arabs I'll say AR Palestinians who lived in the orange territory left and they left for the green territory um the Jews on the other hand ran around the Jewish government the new Jewish government ran around with trucks with loudspeakers saying don't leave don't leave don't leave we want you as Citizens we want you with full rights and so forth I'm not joking it's well documented um but um but most of the Arabs left nonetheless so um because frankly they were probably they probably thought the Jews would do to them what they wanted to do to the Jews which wasn't the case but anyway so most of the Arabs left and then you have the fact that guess what not only did um Israel survive the onslaught but when there was an armest disagreement that was finally settled on the Israeli territory had increased a little bit not hugely just a little bit I'll bring that whoops I'll bring that up okay so after the um is that true yeah okay so after the war was over with the Armistice lines that's what Israel looked like it's that pink area now and you can see it's a little bit fatter than it was before maybe I can go back to the other one you see how skinny it is uh where Bethlehem there how how tiny as a matter of fact I think it's actually divided into two it's pinched you know it's pinched to nothing there in the middle it's pinched to nothing around Nazareth up top and then after the um after the war you can see that Israel is a little bit less strangled there so that's basically where the Armistice lines were and you can see that um the uh territory well you can see that territory I'll just leave it at that now this is where the occupied territories come in because um the that um oh I know what what what I have to pull up here I think um yeah this is the one I have to pull up now I can't wait to see the um okay I thought this would be a lot easier than it is actually uh if that makes any sense to um a lot easier and quick okay now we get to the Gaza Strip essentially okay this is what happened if anyone's still with me um after after Israel won the um after Israel won the um war in in um 1949 you had Israel proper Israel being what's blue there and you had the territory that had been originally given to be a Palestinian Arab state but it would never became a Palestinian Arab State because the Palestinians didn't accept the UN partition but anyway you see it on the right there in pink and it's an extension of Jordan you see that is striped pink and that became what's the OCC what's now known as the West Bank um the occupied West Bank and you see that little strip at the bottom that's green striped and that became the Gaza Strip what that was was it was when the Armistice lines were drawn in 1949 the Egyptian Army had entered from the south to the point where it held that little Gaza Strip and the Jordanian and other Arab armies had entered from the East and and taken that that bite out that you see that stripe pink however um Egypt did not turn the Gaza Strip into Egypt it did not Annex the Gaza Strip and Jordan did not anex uh ennex the West Bank and the reason they didn't is because what what happened at this point in time now we're talking about 1949 is that the Arabs who had fled the Jewish part of Israel because they wanted to come back with the conquerors um were trapped they were trapped they were trapped by that green line because they couldn't go back into Israel proper and they were trapped by the solid you know where there's solid Jordan because Jordan wouldn't let them in okay so they were trapped there and similarly the ones in Gaza were trapped there they couldn't go into Egypt so they were trapped there and that is the origin of the refugees now they weren't trapped there by Israel they were trapped there by Jordan and Egypt and the entire Arab world did not want to let them out of those little enclaves because as long as they were in those enclaves they were an excuse for Waging War against Israel and they were a ready source of trouble for Israel if Jordan had allowed them to become normal Jordanian citizens and they could live anywhere they wanted in Jordan well the pressure would be off Israel and the same thing with e Egypt and Gaza and Jordan tried actually to give them citizenship and they were expelled I believe they were expelled from the Arab League all the other Arab countries were extremely angry at Jordan because how can you do this to us how can you let the palestini refugees out of that trapped area because as long as they're in that trapped area they are essentially a spearhead for war against Israel the refugee camps where the refugees live lived and there's there's a whole big story there too were until 1967 they weren't prisoners of Israel at all they were entirely prisoners of Jordan or Egypt it was Jordan and and Egypt that had the refugee camps okay what happened is that in the 1967 war Israel um uh uh one one I'll just say one okay they won the the current uh territory of Israel so to speak I'll bring that up there and which encompasses the refugee areas that had been held by Jordan and Gaza okay and that's that's where the Palestinian refugees come from and that's where the West Bank comes from and that's where the as a strip comes from um Antonia have you not been paying attention at all I'm sorry the um I just went through that I I'm sorry I'm sorry I'll be nice I'm sorry I apologize the refugees were um were Arabs who lived in um in Palestine um either in the Jewish section of Palestine or the what was supposed to be the Arab section of Palestine um who did not accept the UN partition that did not did not stay in the Jewish section but left the Jewish section and then got trapped when the uh 1949 War stopped they trapped from between the the border with Jordan the border with Egypt and the border with Israel they were never they were not kicked out of Israel they were not they were not dis displaced by Israel but some of them had had left Israel because um they didn't want to live in a Jewish state or because um they were scared of getting killed by the Arab armies coming in and they got trapped um so anyway and of course it's a very sad situation for them but that's where they come from and that's why they're in this funny kind of No Man's Land let's say but frankly the only reason why for instance um Qatar I think it was catar one of the Arab states one of the oil rich Arab states I'm pretty sure was qar was so desperate for workers that it gave instant citizenship to all Arabs in the Middle East except for Palestinians because because every no Arab country wanted to allow Palestinians out of this trapped situation because then they would not be there to to um be terrorists against Israel so anyway I guess that's it I guess I'm up to the up to now maybe I'll see if there are any questions um uh let's see let's see this is great to know it's complicated it is easy to lose track I had to spend I had to spend like six hours just refreshing refreshing my mind to the point where I could could do this let me expand that um that last map and okay oh the Golan Heights yeah the Golan Heights is a very minor thing but but in the 67 War um Israel took advantage of um improving the defensibility of its borders and it just stole the Golden Heights from Syria yes that's that area up the top there it just took the golen heights which I don't think they had much of a population there but anyway it took them because the Goan heights were were much higher than than the Israeli side of that border and was were continually being shelled from the Golan Heights so they took it for tactical reasons and um and then you see the West Bank there and uh it's basically the green line by the way is known as the green line and it's the Armistice line it's it's not a national boundary by the way and um if anyone says if ever hear anyone say that the occupation is the Israeli occupation of the West Bank is in violation of international law it's not in violation of international law because the international law says that once there is a peace treaty the um basically the occupying Force has to leave guess what there's no peace treaty there's no peace treaty between Israel and any of the Arab states States except for uh Egypt so actually it's still it's still it's still at War and um you know when when you read when you read the law I have it in the other room when you read the law it becomes clear that it it it does it it applies it applies to the short period in between a war and a genuine peace agreement peace settlement of which here isn't one um it's not anyway if you want I could actually redo that analysis I don't think I'm going to do it now uh Gaza gaza's uh not that situation because because um there is a peace treaty with Egypt and uh you may have noticed that Israel actually gave Gaza indep dependence for all that good did um Israel Israel um did give Gaza Independence essentially they have their own government which is Hamas there there no Israeli troops in Gaza there no there's no there's no Jew there's no Jew in Gaza there's no Jewish property in Gaza um Israel gave Gaza essentially Independence it pulled out in like 2007 or so it forced all of the settlers to leave and gave it over to the Palestinians to be the beginning of the Palestinian State and that's what you have now uh of course there's a wall between Gaza and Israel proper and you saw the reason why there's a wall or a fence because if there weren't you know Israel you know it would be Slaughter and um why Egypt doesn't allow gazin into Egypt is you're going to have to ask Egypt that but I think it's for the same reason okay um so um the uh the I'll answer I'll I'll play Devil's Advocate Anga uh the the Jews are the original indigenous people of Israel given that they wiped out the Philistines and they wiped out the moabites and and the other tribes that they were there 2500 years ago the Arabs in Israel are not indigenous people but the um in the 19th century um the Arabs were majority they were majority but they weren't I mean they Wen not indigenous to Palestine most of them came from the other other Arab what's now other Arab countries they weren't even other Arab countries you realize that until after World War I I shouldn't say that like that because of course you don't realize it because it's not your speciality but there but all of those countries let me go back to the um uh to the uh Ottoman Empire okay so I'll go back to the Ottoman Empire here um whoops wrong Ottoman Empire map is this the right one okay okay there we have it um all of those countries that we think of in the Middle East Syria uh let me let me Zoom this in a little bit so it's easier to see what's going on whoops partition of Ottoman Empire this should come on how come it's not working Oh wrong one okay [Music] okay okay all of those countries look at the border um I'm trying to make sure what what are actually borders um the borders were drawn by the British and the French look at the border between Syria and Iraq the nice straight line um or the border between Saudi Arabia and Iraq uh those those th all those countries Syria Lebanon Jordan Iraq Iran um they did not exist before the breakup of the Ottoman Empire the the the the national borders were drawn up by the victors when they carve up the Ottoman Empire and that's one reason you have so much trouble you know the Kurds you know the Kurds in Iraq and the Armenians in in turkey and everything you have you have Waring ethnic groups in these countries because they weren't the the it was the British and the French who decided where the boundaries should be and the boundaries encompassed tribal enemies Encompass different ethnicities so um what made me what started this I I forgot where I started with this um uh so okay so I can see where I started with this if I go back a little bit oh the Jews are the indigenous people of Israel so you know for E for Egyptians you know for Egyptians to go from Egypt to Palestine because Palestine was where the work was was the most natural thing in the world they they were essentially all all it was a tribal people the entire Arab world were tribes and they were not anchored in um you know in in in in in Geographic um uh boundaries they were not primarily anchored in Geographic boundaries anyway the jordanians as yaser Arafat right the first head of the PLO he grew up in Egypt okay he was an Egyptian his family was Egyptian um a lot of the names I'm trying to think of the other names but a lot of the Palestinian last names are names of towns you know in in Lebanon or Syria or Egypt which is where the family was from so um the the Palestinians are not an indigenous people people but um they did go back they certainly go back into the 19th century now very interestingly I better stop because I'm going to have to get to mass but interestingly if you look at the growth of the Arab population in Palestine between the middle of the 19 century and the um middle of the 20th century the Arab population grew um I don't remember the exact dates but the Arab population in the areas that didn't have Jews grew 20% and the Arab population in the areas that did have Jews doubled that's not because the reproduction rate was higher it is because it is the that that doubling of the Arab population was Arabs who migrated to the areas where the Jews were cuz that's where the work was and that's where the money was and that's where probably the roads and the infrastructure were so um you know it's not a terribly indigenous population okay let's see how did you bathe in the Dead Sea did you have to go through the West Bank no um you didn't have to go through the West Bank I'll um I'll pull up the current map whoops cancel this where's the current map of Israel huh do do I not have a current map of isra I must have a current map of Israel what's going on here that's not a current map of Israel anyway no you didn't have to um go through the West Bank I don't think let me I let me pull up a current map um I think this is a current map of Israel you know something I better not I better not I I I don't want to guess okay so maybe you maybe you did maybe you did go through some of the West Bank I don't I just don't I I I don't want to um I don't want to fly by the seat of my pants there how would the two-state work it wouldn't and it was never it was never intended to work um it was a plan the whole two-state solution was a plan to have Israel destroyed um Refugee situation how could it be solved um it could be first of all first of all um if if uh I'm I'm going to put no maybe I won't put myself back up the refugee situation would go away tomorrow if the refugees were willing to live in peace with Israel um there are Muslim Palestinian Arabs I mean any any Palestinian Arab who did not flee Israel in 1948 became a full citizen there are there are Palestinian Arab members of parliament they have they're absolutely on a totally equal basis with Jews and Israel and if the Palestinian Arabs were not at War and did not commit terrorism and so forth and did not have to be fenced off and walled off they would have free movement in Israel and they would be the best off Arabs in the Middle East short of maybe Qatar and the oil Rich States now um the the even the Palestinian refugees in the occupied territories have it better than um um than most Middle Eastern Arabs in terms of in terms of INF infrastructure in terms of Education in terms of whatever as a matter of fact the refugee population in the occupied territories has been swelled by non-refugees this is not a joke who move to the refugee camps because there's so much money that flows into the refugee camps from the UN and from other countries that they actually I mean essentially welfare is a lot better in the refugee camps than it is in let's say Jordan so the population has actually been swollen by non-refugees who want to be refugees but anyway um you know the the refugee problem is is essentially caused by the unwillingness to allow the Jewish state of Israel to exist given that the refugees problem would be solved overnight if the um rest of the Arab world which is whatever 25 times the size of Israel 50 times the size of Israel would let the Palestinian refugees move there I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure uh I mean um I shouldn't make a joke but if if you know if Biden's paying for air tickets for Guatemalans to become illegal immigrants in the United States I'm sure Israel would pay for the plane tickets to fly the Palestinians anywhere they wanted to go in the Arab world and start a new life speaking of which if you're going to talk about refugees and poor refugees there were more Jews who in 1948 had to flee the Arab countries where they had been living no joke in some cases for Millennia for Millennia the Jewish the Jewish community in Baghdad was the oldest Jewish Community the oldest continual Jewish community in the world it dated from 600 BC it was like 2500 years old and um the Jews in throughout the Arab world in 1948 had to flee leaving everything behind abandoning their property uh and flee to Israel um because they were being either forced out or slaughtered in the Arab countes so they the Jewish refugees from the Arab world were actually a larger and worse situation Refugee population than the Arab pop uh refugees from Israel but that's another story [Music] too Lord Jesus come Lord [Music] Jesus"

enemies on all sides whose soldiers are tasked with one Mission never lose a war but the Israeli Defense Force has a hardw reputation for pulling off improbable victories with unconventional tactics and is now leading the fight into Gaza in an effort to wipe out Hamas forced to fight five major conflicts in its first four Decades of existence it secured one improbable win after another including the Yong kipur War The Six Day War and most importantly the war of independence during which it was for the Israel Palestine conflict has led to Untold suffering over these Decades of conflict but the IDF has emerged as one of the world's best armies bristling with high-tech homemade weapons like the Iron Dome and maava tank which allow it to hold off attacks and strike back with overwhelming Force they were among the first to develop combat drones have already deployed AI on the battlefield and are now on the cusp of producing laser cannons they have blasted a missile out of the edge of space are responsible for one of the world's best spy networks and were among the first militaries to allow women to fight on the front line This is the story of how the IDF came to be the weapons the tech and the tactics that made its name and why it looks set to remain one of the absolute best for years to come the IDF has a reputation for doing things differently While most armies are underpinned by strict hierarchy formal discipline and long-standing traditions the Israeli Army is not a lot of which has to do with its history formed by David benan the father of Israel in the midst of the 1948 war of independence the IDF was originally made up of separate Jewish militias thrown together under one banner and forced to fight for their very survival from day one against all the odds the IDF managed not only to defeat the seven Arab armies that invaded Israel on the day of its birth but pushed them back beyond what were intended to be the country's original borders for the Palestinians this was the beginning of the NABA the disaster in English which saw hundreds of thousands displaced from their homes into refugee camps where their descendants live to this day but for the IDF this victory was the Cornerstone of their fearsome reputation and established a deep-seated culture of doing what works over doing things by the book which persists to this day take for example the development of the maava tank widely regarded as one of the world's best which was delivered by Israel's fledgling defense industry on time under budget and in the middle of a recession the brain behind it was Israel tal better known as talik a former commander and hero of the six Day War which Israel fought against Egypt Syria and Jordan in 1967 in the wake of that conflict both France and Britain which until then had been supplying Israel with heavy armor began to restrict the supply convincing Israel it needed to produce its own the tank that talic designed prioritized crew safety above everything else he realized correctly that the hardest part of the vehicle to replace were the men inside who took months to recruit and train and years to perfect in the art of tank warfare working alongside other tank commanders to identify the biggest problems they faced in battle his design included Innovations like moving the engine to the front of the vehicle this meant when the tank was hit headon by a shell the most common way they were attacked back then the engine shielded the crew from the blast it made the tank more vulnerable to being disabled on the battlefield but it ensured the men inside live to fight another day freeing up space at the back also meant it could be fitted with a rear hatch allowing the crew to escape if it was disabled and creating room for it to carry extra men protecting soldiers going into battle and casualties coming back out again tiik also insisted on a low long gun turret which made the maaba hard to see at range and perfect for longdistance sniping a tactic he developed to keep his men out of Harm's Way for as long as possible now on its fifth iteration the maava has evolved according to the principles that talic and the IDF laid down self-reliance utility and safety driven by problems identified in battle take for example the distinctive ball and chain defenses which hang off the back of the turret and were developed to stop Rockets hitting a weak spot that was identified between the turret and the hull or explosive reactive armor special plates which burst outwards to deflect incoming rockets and shells which are now standard the world over but were first adopted by the Israelis it wasn't even their invention it was actually developed by a German who first tried to sell it to the bundas sere but were told they were not planning to strap explosives to their own tanks before Tel Aviv realized the true value of it the logic which inspired that armor later led to the creation of the trophy system which protects the vehicles today it is a one-of-a-kind piece of kit that uses radar to detect in coming rounds and then fires small explosive charges to destroy them in midair completely automated meaning the crew inside don't have to do a thing to activate it Israel claims it has a 95% hit rate which has proved invaluable at stopping Hamas Rockets during the attack on Gaza it is so accurate it can even be used to create a protective bubble for troops operating near the tank as it is able to take out Rockets without harming them each member of a maava crew is now equipped with a VR helmet similar to the ones used in F35 Jets which give them a 360 view of the battlefield outside the tank meanwhile artificial intelligence helps the tanks speak to other units on the battlefield to quickly identify targets and take them out the tradeoff with all this equipment is that the maava is also the world's heaviest tank but since Israel is the only country that uses it trans sporting all that weight long distance isn't an issue years after the idf's creation in 1953 benan took a break from running the country to sit down and write Israel's first and only official security concept outlining what the idf's mission was and setting a blueprint for how it would fight at the top of his priority list was the Israel could never lose a war because doing so would mean the wholesale destruction of the country that means the IDF is defensive it is not designed to start fights but to end them as quickly and as decisively as possible in boran's Vision this meant rapidly mobilizing an overwhelming Force pushing the fight onto the enemy's territory and then crushing the threat utterly this still forms the Bedrock of the idf's defense strategy today which it accomplishes via mandatory conscription for both men and women with only a few exceptions on the basis of religion obligations or disability minimum length of service is 24 months followed by decades spent on standby in the reserves ready to be called up in a time of Crisis such as the October 7th Hamas terror attack and the IDF can mobilize its reserves quicker than virtually every other country in just a few days it had 300,000 pairs of boots on the ground ready to go into Gaza compared to months for Putin to Rally half that number to send into into Ukraine and most combat roles are open to both sexes as well until 2001 female conscripts were funneled into the women's core which took on the bulk of the admin work and other jobs like nursing radio operation and flight control but as a lot of that work started to be automated the IDF decided to allow women onto the front line rather than lose them from the force Al together nowadays almost 90% of roles within the IDF are open to women in and while the numbers who choose to serve on the front line are small they are also growing rapidly there are currently four mixx battalions of which the caracal Battalion was the first which these days has 70% female soldiers a fifth such Battalion is being created 13 of kacal's female soldiers led the fight back on October 7th when they helped reclaim one of the kibuts overrun by Hamas killing a reported 100 terrorists in the process the only positions not open to women are in the armored heavy infantry or special forces units where repeated heavy lifting has led to concerns of injuries though some Light Special Forces should open up to female recuits in 2025 infantry and armor make up the bulk of the IDS forces it operates 22,000 tanks and 5,000 armored vehicles despite its relatively small size but the tip of the spear is its state-of-the-art Air Force named the world's most powerful by Business Insider magazine back in 2014 the iaf is designed to hold up any attack with air strikes until the reserves can be mobilized it relies heavily on American f-16s and Apache helicopter gunships for this but it also operates several dozen latest generation F35 stealth Fighters Israel also has a Navy to keep it safe from threats in the Mediterranean which these days mostly involves stopping Iranian weapons getting two guard by the coast specialist warships are also thought to operate Israel's tactical Nuclear deterrent the final pillar of the IDF is Aman its unconventional Military Intelligence arm which works alongside shinb responsible for domestic security and the infamous Mossad which covers overseas to form the Israeli intelligence Community together these three agencies are responsible for providing the IDF early warning of Terror threats and attacks and are regarded as some of the world's best the spirit of innovation which drives the IDF also carries over into Israel's defense industry which is among the most advanced in the world in total more than 150 defense companies are thought to operate in the country but the main ones are Israel Aerospace Industries the Raphael arms Development Authority and elit systems which acquired Israel military Industries several years ago Innovations produced by these companies include the uzi submachine gun and the Israeli bandage an elasticated dressing designed to stop bleeding which is used by the us but perhaps the most famous is the Iron Dome which was developed by Raphael as a joint project with America and went into action in 2011 it is one of the most advanced missile defenses in use anywhere in the world designed to take down short- range rockets and artillery shells in response to Hamas attacks out of guard which began in 2006 it uses radar to detect incoming rockets and computers to work out whether they are aimed at populated areas before firing Tamir Interceptor missiles to take them down the Tamir travel at 2 and 1 half times the speed of sound Guided by radar before sensors in the missile take over for the last part of its Journey detonating it close enough to the incoming rocket to destroy it meanwhile Israel Aerospace pioneered the use of drones in combat putting some of the first into the skies way back in the 1970s to spy on their enemies before giving them the ability to hit ground Targets in the 1990s today drones are Israel's largest weapon export overtaking missile technology in 2022 off the back of the Ukraine war and earning billions of dollars in Revenue in total Israel's weapon exports earned it 12.5 billion in 2022 alone much of which is pumped back into research and development to ensure the IDF maintains a technological Edge over its foes the next Leap Forward is likely to come straight out of Science Fiction as Raphael is preparing to deploy the next iteration of the Iron Dome dubbed iron beam this uses lasers instead of rockets to shoot down incoming missiles making the system much cheaper to run some estimates suggest it will cost around $2 per Intercept in instead of the current 20,000 meanwhile another futuristic development is the smash 2000 rifle site essentially a targeting computer that mounts on top of a rifle soldiers look through the box site which identifies and outlines possible targets before locking onto one of them with the push of a button the site then calculates the distance to Target and movement before providing a second outline that the soldier should fire at in order to hit it Sharpshooter the company which makes the site says this is particularly useful for taking down drones like the fpvs which have been terrorizing infantry and tanks in Ukraine a new version of the system which is currently in production has been bought by the Americans born into war and given a baptism of fire the IDF now stands tall as one of the world's best military outfits and an example to others of how to accomplish a lot with limited resources it has been responsible for Innovations in both tactics and weapons that are now used the world over and it continues to pump out groundbreaking new systems that ensure it maintains an edge over its foes a lot has changed in its short life it no longer has to contend with other nations and their armies but must instead fight Terror groups embedded within civilian populations that ensures controversy as Innocents will inevitably get caught in the crossfire and the IDF will take part of the blame as is happening now in but it has so far fulfilled its pledge to the nation of never losing a war ensuring that Israel and its people Ure and it does not look likely to break that promise anytime soon"

everywhere what who even are you i am theodore   herzl and i think jews should have a state 
in their ancestral homeland of israel doesn't   the ottoman empire control that region they do 
but we could start by returning there for now   and so jews started returning into the land of 
israel or palestine whatever you want to call it   oh and then the first world war broke out you know 
what you guys need to attack the ottomans what   who even are you don't you guys hate the ottomans 
well i kind of do listen i'll give you a state i'm   listening i'll give you a unified arab state syria 
transjordan the arab peninsula it's all yours   cool during the first world war in an attempt to 
weaken the ottoman empire the british tried to   incite the arabs into a revolt by promising them 
a state in return the revolt indeed took place   and the arabs successfully expelled the ottomans 
from many territories you know what you guys need   a national home finally okay so we are in favor of 
giving you a national home in the land of israel   once the ottomans are out of there cool okay peace 
you know what you guys need to split the middle   east with us i'm listening so i was thinking 
once the ottoman empire is destroyed will divide   the middle east like so aha what is this division 
based on it is based on this line that i drew here   see the line yeah okay that sounds nice okay then 
it settled wait wait before you leave you didn't   promise the region to anyone else right what no 
no way so the middle east is partitioned between   the british and the french and the arabs don't get 
a state um why are there so many jews here relax   it's cool we don't like this i said it's cool 
hey where are we supposed to get a state hello   are you ignoring us so the arabs revolt against 
the french and the british see this and fear a   revolt so they blocked the jews from returning 
into israel wait what but you said we could have   a national home relax it's cool we don't like 
this i said it's cool no we don't like this   okay so britain i was thinking about what you said 
and i've come to the conclusion that we don't like   this at all guys guys chill out it's cool we'll 
give you a state nice cool it will be one state   and it will be neither jewish nor arab what what 
it'll be like a mixed state we don't like this   we despise this why are you always so vulgar why 
are you always so condescending why are you   always so violent guys guys the second world war 
just broke out it did yeah and now it's over oh   that was quick yeah and the majority of the 
jews in europe were killed by the nazis oh no   but i guess the survivors could come here right no 
no but the jews insist on being masters of their   own fate so that nothing like what happened 
during the holocaust can ever happen again   they illegally immigrate into israel and 
their population keeps increasing to the arabs   great displeasure the british and the french 
slowly start to withdraw from the middle east   and new states are given independence states like 
jordan lebanon egypt syria and more but what do   we do with this troublesome lot maybe we should 
hand it over to the u.n the what you know the   u.n the newly formed body that is meant to keep 
the peace oh yeah the u.n did someone mention me   yeah could you fix this mess sure okay yeah we can 
divide the land uh like this right the arabs get   some yeah the jews get some nice everyone's happy 
we're cool with this we hate this no you just hate   everything no we mostly hate you so the british 
leave and the state of israel is established   the arabs immediately attacked the newly formed 
state in what is known as the first arab-israeli   war between israel and all neighboring arab 
states israel won the war and expanded its   territory this is a disaster we lost so much of 
our land and a huge portion of our population   has been expelled let's call it the nakba it 
means disaster so you know that's a good name   well i guess at least we still have 
the west bank and the gaza strip   okay so the gaza strip is mine now 
cheers and i'll take the west bank   what so egypt occupied the gaza strip and jordan 
occupied the west bank and now the palestinians   control zero territory by palestinians i mean 
arabs who lived in the territory of palestine   which was now mostly the state of israel the 
arab states still view israel as a continuation   of colonial power and seek to destroy it this 
led to tensions which resulted in wars like the   second arab israeli war also called the suez 
crisis in which israel conspired with the uk   and france to attack egypt stop the war don't tell 
us what to do stop the war or i invade hungary but   you already invaded hungary stop the war or i nuke 
something what i'll nuke you did somebody say nuke   oh i can't with these two so the british had to 
end their invasion of egypt and this solidified   egypt as the leader of the arab world it 
also weakened british and french influence   in the region israel managed to occupy the sinai 
peninsula but had to withdraw under u.s pressure   and then the third arab israeli war broke out 
it's better known as the six days war in which   israel preemptively attacked and soundly defeated 
all of its neighbors following this israel took   over the west bank the golan heights the sinai 
peninsula and the gaza strip wow gaza cool yeah   have fun so now the palestinians moved from being 
under jordanian and egyptian occupations into   being under israeli occupation the arab league 
met later that year to affirm the three knowns   no peace with israel no recognition of israel and 
no negotiation with israel oh hey it's you guys   long time no see huh give us back our homeland 
it's our homeland no you are foreign occupiers   no we have always been here no we have always 
been here and give us back the sinai why you'd   just use it to attack us no we wouldn't okay 
maybe we would so will you give it back no   so egypt attacked israel in what was called 
the war of attrition its goal was to compel   an israeli withdrawal from the sinai 
egypt what do you even think you're   doing last time we absolutely obliterated 
you what's going to keep us from doing this hi there soviet union how's uh uh who's the 
chairman nowadays it can't be stalin anymore   it's not stalin right is it khrushchev no wait it 
was brezhnev it's brezhnev isn't it hey jordan   remember how you lost the west bank to the cursed 
israelis yeah well you suck i i don't quite follow   get out of here jordan is also palestinian so 
it's ours now do you know we are messing with   so a civil war broke out in jordan between the 
jordanians and the palestinians the palestinians   lost and were expelled from jordan into lebanon 
oh wait israel hasn't been at war for some time   but don't worry about that because egypt and syria 
attacked israel in the yom kippur war the war   started out strong for the arabs but again ended 
in an israeli victory so i'll support the israelis   fine i'll support the arabs that's cool just don't 
nuke anyone huh i won't nuke anyone if you don't   all right or actually i might nuke someone if 
israel does wait what heck i might just nuke   someone for the fun of it oh no you don't i'll 
nuke someone first oh don't make me nuke you guys   guys you can stop fighting now this is getting 
out of hand okay fine so can we keep the sinai   no will you stop trying to destroy us if 
we gave it back we might interesting so   israel gave the sinai peninsula back to egypt in 
exchange for peace lebanon hi we'd appreciate it   if attacks against us stopped coming from your 
territory look this is a difficult time for us   we're kind of in the middle of a civil war here we 
don't really care free palestine stop it freedom   stop it so israel invaded lebanon in order to 
stop the attacks coming out of its territories   it succeeded in driving out the palestinian 
organizations from the country but the power   vacuum allowed another militant group called 
hezbollah to rise so that wasn't so good for   the israelis i hate you guys so much stop being so 
negative you stole our lands and forced us under   an occupation stop trying to kill us and we won't 
have to occupy you stop stealing our lands even as   we speak you're building illegal settlements who 
says they're illegal everyone right except for us   that's it time to riot to attack to free 
our homeland and i'm here too please don't   stop stop that kills people i said stop and so 
the first intifada broke out israel attempted   to crack down on it but the attempts weren't 
entirely successful so the intifada ended with   the oslo accords what are the osler chords well 
basically okay so i recognize that you exist   fine i too recognize that you exist and i also 
recognize that i should negotiate with you   i too recognize that we should negotiate 
so let's negotiate some time in the future   cool i'll give you some self-governance over your 
west bank and the gaza strip nice just so you know   our population hates this agreement yeah ours 
too so much so that the prime minister has been   assassinated over it you don't say yeah but at 
least he managed to make peace with jordan before   that happened oh nice congrats thanks still 
hate you guys though would you two just make peace   already no nah please just come over to camp david 
we'll figure something out fine how's this deal   it gives the palestinians pretty much everything 
they've asked for it does let me see no it doesn't   no deal come on hate you guys oh by the way 
are you trying to take over al aqsa mosque   no yes you are time for another uprising oh come 
on and that's how the second intifada started   it was a bloody affair that included suicide 
bombings from the palestinian side and a hard   crackdown from the israeli side ok ok ok stop 
it stop it we just want peace and quiet will you   leave us alone if we withdraw really you're going 
to withdraw yes so you're leaving palestine no   we're only leaving the gaza strip what but that's 
not nearly enough whatever bye and so israel   unilaterally disengaged from the gaza strip that 
decision misfired however because hamas which was   designated as a terrorist organization by israel 
and various other western powers took over power   in the strip israel responded by blockading 
the gaza strip hey hezbollah take this okay   ouch hey what are you doing we hate you guys iran 
are you supplying hezbollah we also hate you guys   okay now you're gonna get it and so in order 
to remove the threat posed by hezbollah   and in response to a hezbollah raid on israeli 
territory israel invaded lebanon once again in   what was called the second lebanon war or the july 
war or the israel hezbollah war whatever anyways   hezbollah is also designated as a terrorist 
organization by israel and more western powers   so now it's time for israel's favorite game 
name the terrorist organization i hate this game   which of these two is composed 
of palestinians um i think it was   too slow it's hamas while hezbollah is 
anti-israeli it is not palestinian oh i   actually thought they were both next question 
which of these two is composed of sunni muslims   sunni i think was it too slow again it's 
hamas hezbollah is made out of shiite muslims   right i really don't care last question 
which of these two is supported by iran   was it um was it hamas again wrong answer 
both organizations are supported by iran   i hate those guys hate you too remove the blockade 
no remove the blockade and be gone from this land   no hey hey you can't fire indiscriminately into 
civilians we can and we will and that's how   operation hot winter started lift the blockade 
or die no lift the blockade and die or die   what hey don't fire at us free palestine and 
that's how operation cast lead started some call it   the gaza war would you please lift the blockade 
no would you please be gone from this land no   and here we go again and that's how operation 
pillar of defense started why did you attack us   because you kidnapped and murdered three israeli 
teenagers because you didn't lift the blockade   we're not lifting the blockade fine fine and 
that's how operation protective edge started   leave al aqsa mosque alone we're not doing 
anything to al aqsa mosque then lift the   blockade no then be gone from this land no and 
that's how operation guardian of the walls started   and so as you can see the region is 
peaceful and conflict will soon be resolved   trust us we got this i hate you guys i hate 
you too and i also hate you guys i hate you too   i hate all of you you guys want to make peace sure"

Bank another one has sustained serious injuries Israeli soldiers rushed to the scene after reports of a car crash but upon arrival they discovered that the women had been shot tensions have been flaring up between Israel and Palestine we have been telling you this over the last few days we have been getting you the constant updates the conflict now has spread to Lebanon as well last night Lebanon fired 34 rockets at Israel 25 were intercepted by the air defense systems and today Israel has retaliated Israel's military targeted Hamas camps in southern Lebanon residents around the area of rashidir refugee camp reported hearing three loud blasts it is the second most populated Palestinian camp in Lebanon listening to what the residents had to say we are sleeping at night and we suddenly heard a sound we woke up and the roof started to fall on us my brothers were sleeping here we ran outside and sharpened soil and stone started flying around us Israeli missiles also rained down in different areas of Gaza have a look at these visuals now houses and vehicles to destroy it walls and windows were blasted by the powerful explosions there was dirt smashed glass windows in people's homes Israel said its Jets hit 10 targets including tunnels and weapons manufacturing sites of Hamas but this victim had a different story to tell if I was in the car I would have died money in the car can be redeemed but what does the citizen have to do in all of this what are the children my two-year-old sister my parents and siblings have to do in all of this this is a residential area there's nothing here but a home crops a building and some agricultural land two days ago tensions flared up between Israel and Palestine bringing them on the brink of a war but now Lebanon is also getting involved last night's attack was the biggest since 2006 when Israel fought a war with the Hezbollah movement is the whirlpool effect pulling in the neighborhood as well let's not forget how it all started two days ago Israeli police stormed into the Al-Aqsa mosque in the pre-dawn hours in the holy month of Ramadan and what triggered this rate well there were different sides to the story Israel blames it on the worshipers it says Mast agitators locked themselves inside the holy site that They Carried fireworks sticks and stones so the police was forced to enter the compound but the worshipers say something else that they were praying when the police marched in and started hurling stunned grenades at them more than 350 people were arrested and removed from the mosque but the storm did not pass violence erupted once again in the Al-Aqsa mosque this time in the late evening hours pooling is entered the compound once again and tried to evacuate the worshipers they threw stunned grenades and fired rubber bullets why was this happening well the Israeli police says worshipers were hiding weapons that they were carrying firearms so my question is where are these weapons did the police recover any firearms from the worshipers no evidence has been found as per reports the police got hold of firecrackers at the most instead we have videos of the police beating up the worshipers of people being hit by stunned grenades of the injured being carried away on stretchers after all it is the Israeli police we are talking about the one that is controlled by a hard liner like etmar benguer but it did not end there in response to the raid Hamas fired Rockets into Israel from the Gaza Strip seven to nine Rockets were fired sirens on Israel's border were blaring the country's Iron Dome intercepted most of these rockets and then the Lebanese missiles came The Exchange triggered a rebuke from the Prime Minister Netanyahu this is what he said recently I've made it clear that our enemies should not misjudge us the internal debate in Israel will not prevent us from taking action against them wherever and whenever necessary all of us without exception are united on this we have no intention of changing the Status Quo on the Temple Mount we want the situation to be calm and we will take strong action against extremists who use violence there regarding the aggression against us on other fronts we will strike our enemies and they will pay the price for any Act of aggression netanyahu's Coalition is filled with right-wingers and hardliners they told you about benguer but you see he is not the only one there are hardliners on both the sides are they provoking a third in the father for those unworths an interfada is basically a rebellion a widespread

#SomeMoreNews #Palestine #Israel",2021-05-31,768995,47265,6071,UCvlj0IzjSnNoduQF0l3VGng," (Upbeat trombone music) - [Cody] Oh, Cody hungry,
Cody hungry for news. Hello everybody. So Palestine and Israel, we're
not going to talk about it because we're told it's too
complicated to understand or discuss or do anything about, but counterpoint we will talk about it because is it too complicated
to understand could only the Titanic sized intellect
of Jared read 25 books Kushner understand the
intricacies of the conflict? Well, first let's go over
the current situation while media coverage of
Israel-Palestine has improved. If you read certain headlines you may be under the impression that Hamas just suddenly decided
to fire rockets at Israel sparking a bloody conflict. So first we'll talk
about just what happened in the past few weeks, and then we'll go over some more history. As you may've already
seen through social media. On May 7th, and again, on May 10th Israeli police stormed the Al Aqsa mosque the third holiest religious site in Islam during Ramadan police fired stun grenades and rubber bullets inside
the mosque at worshipers, injuring over 300 Palestinians. The police presence was
in response to protests against the looming forced evictions of eight Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah east Jerusalem
by Israeli authorities. East Jerusalem is a
Palestinian territory that has been illegally occupied
by Israel since 1967. Why are Palestinians
facing forced evictions? Well, in a word, ethnic cleansing. I'm sorry. That was two words. For more info on the
definite ethnic cleansing. See our other happy, fun upbeat video on Palestine,
or like, I don't know read what Israeli officials have to say or look at some (beep) maps. But anyway, as it turns out the rocket attacks by Hamas
did not come out of nowhere. And in fact were pretty predictable. Given that Hamas is military leader. Mohammad Dave made a statement on May 5th. The Qassam Brigades will not stand idly by in the face of attacks on the
Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. They will pay a heavy price, if the aggression against our people in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood
does not stop immediately. This was on May 5th in response to police
violence against protestors. The Israeli police has escalation to storming the Al Aqsa
mosque captain days later on May 7th and May 10th. So the rocket attacks aren't
exactly random violence. If Hamas is giving a direct threat and explanation of the violence but Cody says PatrioticAnimaeTittylover69. Are you siding with Hamas?
Do you stand terrorism? Well, thank you PatrioticAnimeTittylover69
for your service, obviously Hamas sucks, but pointing out that Hamas is actions are
not random acts of violence. Isn't the as siting with
them, nor is solidarity with Palestinians as
Ted Cruz and Ben Shapiro and other liars might want you to believe. To be clear, hurting civilians
is never justified even when it's in retaliation. And especially when it's
an escalation of violence. When a mass fires at Israel injuring or killing random civilians,
not only is it a travesty for Israeli civilians
who are harmed, it also undermines public sympathy
for innocent Palestinians. Hammas has actions give
the Israeli military quote unquote justification to
bomb and kill ten fold Gazans and continue to ethnically
cleanse Palestinians. I'm sorry, Wait. I, what I meant to say is Hamas's actions gave Israel justification to do surgical airstrikes against Hamas. That ends up killing
sickening numbers of children. Top doctors destroying their
one coronavirus testing site flattening residencies,
and demolishing buildings housing, media organizations including the Associated Press
and hitting refugee camps. You know, surgical war crimes. Every time the Israeli
military kills a child the doctor destroys media outlets or levels of residential block. They use Hamas as a justification in the name of self-defense, weirdly this right to defend itself is never extended to Palestine but whatever the IDF can bomb
anything it wants, if Hamas even farts within 500 miles of the target. The Israeli government
claimed Hamas was hiding in the AP media building and we showed the U.S evidence despite the secretary of
state Anthony Blinken saying the U.S hasn't seen any of this evidence. Yikes guys, awkward. Maybe work on your story together before you go to the press. (upbeat music) Apparently Hamas is hiding
behind every child killed in Gaza. To put it in terms that we
in the U.S can understand Hamas is a bit like cocaine. Did police do an unwarranted
arrest and a bit of brutality? Oh, well, what do you know? Turns out we put, I mean,
found cocaine in their wallet. Oops, did we do a few war crimes. Well we found Hamas in their wallets. We swear. In the IDFs words, they just had to bomb that refugee camp because
an apartment nearby was used as terror infrastructure in the area of the Al Shati refugee camp. Was it really? Who knows now? Because it's all been
blown to smithereens. Also, apparently the alleged
targets were some computers which were moved before the strike. So, whoops. Israeli prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu indicted with criminal charges of corruption and bribery, argues that
Hamas hide behind civilians. The human shields argument is interesting in that even if it were true,
the answer always seems to be so we murdered the (beep)
out of the human shield. It's like in Die Hard when Hans Gruber holds Holly Gennaro hostage and goes to get to me you'll have to
shoot the hostage or whatever. And then John McClain goes,
okay and shoots both of them. And then the movie ends victorious. And this part of the episode is honestly the most levity we're going
to get with this topic. So like, we have to do an ad and
we're going to, so um here's here's the transition to the that. Okay. Okay. Sorry. (upbeat music) - Hey, it's the ad part for advertising. This year you might be a
little more adventurous in going out. You might just keep staying inside. Maybe it's both. Maybe it's neither somehow. When I do any combination of those I can wear Mack Weldon to
feel stylish and comfortable. And if you haven't guessed Mack Weldon is sponsoring this video and they are offering you

to and from an advertisement while talking about war crimes and stuff. Good God. Okay. Anyway, back to Hamas and the IDF. It's unfair to compare Hamas to the IDF says PatrioticAnimaTittyLover69 the horniest strong man I've ever made up for the sake of an argument. Hamas is evil while the IDF is the most moral army in the world. According to a tweet
from Netanyahu sharing a PragerU video. They have vegan boots for God's sake. Sure, both Hamas and
the IDF bomb civilians but the IDF does it veganlly. It is actually unfair to
compare the IDF to Hamas because the IDF has one of the most well-equipped heavily U.S funded armies in the middle east. Where as Hamas does not. Israel ranks 14th globally
in terms of military funding with over $21 billion in
spending, or almost 6% of its GDP $3.8 billion came from the U.S and military aid to Israel in
2020 and annual commitment. And the U.S sells hundreds
of millions of dollars worth of advanced military equipment
to Israel every year. Israel has compulsory military service of 30 months for men and 24
months for women, sexist! The draft starting 18 years and older. they had over 170,000 active duty military personnel as of 2018. And they have a secret nuclear arsenal. That's not a joke. They literally have an estimated
80 secret nuclear warheads. Meanwhile, Hamas's militant
numbers are estimated in the tens of thousands. Their main weapons are unguided rockets as opposed to Israel's precision missiles. Israel and Egypt have
deployed a military land air and sea blockade around Gaza since 2007. And while the blockades
good at preventing things like clean water
medicine, humanitarian aid from entering the country. It's been unable to
prevent rocket materials from being smuggled into Gaza. Rockets can even be made
out of plumbing pipes, repurpose dud, Israeli bombs,
burning sugar, and fertilizer. Through a patchwork of domestic
production and smuggling. Hamas had an estimated
supply of 7,000 rockets before the current conflict. While it's not nothing, it's
next to nothing compared to Israel's $21 billion price tag military and Israel's highly advanced U.S designed and supported iron dome intercepts. 90% of Hamas's rockets. What this means is a vast difference in the numbers of casualties. That's always weird to compare the numbers of lives loss because
obviously to the families of those killed total body
count, isn't comforting but it needs to be mentioned when one side of the conflict bears the
brunt of the most casualties especially when it comes to civilians. In this most recent skirmish or clash or dust-up or whatever you want to call it attacks by Hamas killed 12 people of the 9 million people in
Israel, including two children. The IDF killed at least 227 of the 2 million people in
Gaza, including 64 children. Gaza is completely surrounded
by superior fire power which is important to keep in mind when Israel's military and police force as well as it legal settler
colonies in the west bank continually instigate acts
of violence or land grabs in Palestine. Israel knows they can
steal land from Palestine, and even if Hamas retaliates the IDF can utterly devastate
Gaza in a hail of missiles. This military dominance is
probably why Israeli authorities and settlers are so bold and
trying to force Palestinians out of their family homes
they've had for over 70 years. These really government might try to argue that kicking grandmothers out of their childhood home is justified because before the 1948 Arab Israeli war those homes had belonged
to Jewish residents. But strangely enough, this
justification isn't used by Israel to allow Arab families to return to their homes they lost after the 1948 Palestinian
Exodus or Nakba. When about half of Palestinian
Arabs were expelled. NPR Daniel Estrin explains the situation of a Palestinian man facing
eviction from his family's home. - One half of his home was
claimed by a settler group years ago. Now he's facing eviction
from the other half. And here's the thing. Israeli law allows Jews
to reclaim these grounds lost in the 1948 war. It does not allow Palestinians
to reclaim property they lost in that war. - As the man facing eviction puts it. This is a racist, racist, racist law. Indeed Israel has a lot of racist laws. Apartheid's generally do. The motivations for the
illegal Israeli settlements and evictions of Palestinian families in east Jerusalem are
made abundantly clear by the people in favor
of illegal settlements. - But its really rightfully ours, if you look at the
history and like the wars and we didn't even start a lot of the wars we conquered these places
rightfully like it's ours. - I don't think there's any answer to it. - Really? - There's only one way to
like I would carpet bomb them. - You would carpet bomb them? - It's the only, it's the only
way you could deal with it. - We take house after house all this area will be Jewish neighborhood. We are not finished the job we are going to the next neighborhood and after that, we'll go more. Our dream that all East Jerusalem will be like West Jerusalem.
Jewish Capitol of Israel. - You are stealing my house. - And if I don't steal it,
someone else is gonna steal it. - No! No... No one is allowed to steal it. - No, I'm from New York, from long island. - From New York. What right do you have to live here? - The right I have is that the owner of the house
wants me to live here and he wants there to be
Jews living in this house and he wants to, and I got
chosen for whatever reason it ended up being me. - So why do you live here? - Because I lived here because it's important to them because not too many
people want to live here. And it's important to, to
strengthen this neighborhood to make sure that this
neighborhood is not lost in any future peace deal. - So your position here
is a political position to keep Palestinians out of it. - Not to keep Palestinians
out of it, to keep Jews in it. - Yup. That's a guy from long island
stealing a Palestinians house just shrugging his
shoulders and going well it's not ethnic cleansing. We're just, you know, kicking everyone out of a certain ethnicity. Now to be clear, this is not fully representative
of everyone in Israel. I mean, obviously this guy's
from (beep) long island and while many Israeli support illegal settlements and annexation, this is obviously not true
of everyone in Israel. Btselem the Israeli information center for human rights in the
Occupied Territories is an activist organization
shining a light on the abuses of the occupation. Breaking the silence is a group of former IDF soldiers who
served in the Israeli military since the start of the Second
Intifada and have taken it upon themselves to expose the
Israeli public to the reality of everyday life in the
occupied territories, and the cases of abuse
toward Palestinians, looting, and destruction of property that they have been witnesses to. It's also important to
note that Israel is very much not necessarily
representative of Jewish people worldwide. American Jews, particularly
those who are young and more secular often question Israel's colonization of Palestinian territory. In 2019, 25% of American Jews
were in favor of completely dismantling all the illegal
Israeli settlements. Oh, and by the way, I keep
calling them illegal settlements because the international
community has agreed that they're (beep) illegal. In contrast, only 6% of Israelis were in favor of such a move. A majority of American
Jews think Netanyahu is not doing a good job. And only one in three
think Israel is making a sincere effort towards
achieving peace with Palestinians. There are Jewish groups
in America dedicated to fighting for the rights of Palestine like the activist group,
Jewish voice for peace. - We are here gathering to remind ourselves remind our community and let the world know that uprooting people and displacing communities
is not a Jewish value. It's not a human value. These kinds of acts is
immoral and unethical. - The reason that there are plenty of Jewish groups who support
Palestinian human rights is that you can't equate
Judaism to Israel's policies. It's not antisemitic to criticize Israel or Israeli policies because Jews in general and a
specific country's government are not the same. Much Like if you show
support for Palestinians you're not in bed with Hamas
terrorists or whatever lying little worm Ted Cruz might say. On the other hand it is actually antisemitic to say that all Jews should or do
support Israel's actions. Alan Dershowitz calling Bernie
Sanders, a self-hating Jew for criticizing Israel
it's just as antisemitic as holding all Jewish people responsible for the Israeli government's actions. It's being reported by the
ADL that there has been a rise in antisemitism following
the recent violence in Gaza on their list of examples. There are some horrific things. They also listed as examples of antisemitism people
holding protest signs critical of zionism. These are not the same. And it's also interesting that pro Palestine
protests are all described as anti-Israel protests, but to be clear. Support for Palestine
or criticism of Israel, doesn't equate to antisemitism and shouldn't be used as motivation for and actually nothing should be used as motivation for antisemitism because antisemitism is dumb as (beep). Also the claim that it is antisemitic to criticize Israel or support
Palestine is not true. And shouldn't be used as an
excuse to ignore the key issue. Now, this is not to say that
religion never plays a role in support for Israeli colonial policy. Support for Israel is weirdly high among Evangelicals who, you know think it's important for the end times prophecy where everyone, but them including Jews will be
sent to hell very cool and very normal religious
fundamentalist to have 35% of here in the U.S. In fact, Israel's
colonization is so popular among U.S Evangelicals
as compared to U.S Jews. Former Israeli Ambassador
to the U.S Ron Dermer said. - People have to understand
the backbone of Israel support in the United States is
the Evangelical Christians. That's the backbone. And it's true because of numbers. And also because of their passionate and unequivocal support for Israel. Look at numbers. - I mean, sure. Evangelicals are only supporting Israel because they think it's prophesized to set in motion the end time during which unrepentant
Jews will go to hell. But hey, got to make friends
where you can find them. Speaking of religion, another argument for the relentless abuse and
killing of people in Gaza is it Hamas are religious
fundamentalists and anti-gay you know, like what we have in America but bad because they're not Christian. Also while Israel does recognize
gay marriages performed in other countries, you can't actually get
gay married while there, but anyway, yes, of
course, of course, sure. Religious fundamentalists suck and have a bad track
record on human rights. I'm not sure that means you
should do collective punishment a war crime or skirmish
crime if you prefer by stealing people's
homes and bombing people. Because if that's the case, we're uh, we're in a bit of trouble here in America, but yeah it's too bad that Gaza
is dominated by Hamas and doesn't have a less
theocratic government like they had back before the 1970s when the Israeli government
helps fund the rise of Hamas. Oh, oh. Kind of like the oopsy the CIA did when they helped create Osama Binladin by funding Mujahideen groups to fight against the Soviets during the cold war, sad trombone noise. (upbeat trombone music) - No like, do the sound. (upbeat trombone music) - Nevermind. As reported by the intercept former (sad trombone music) - Former Israeli military official general Yitzhak Segev admitted as such. Segev was the acting governor of Gaza in the 1980s during Israel's takeover. Until the New York times reporter
that he had provided funds to Islamist as a counterweight
to secular leftists of the Palestinian liberation organization and fought to party. In addition to funding religious
fundamentalists in Gaza, the Israeli military also selectively targeted the secular
PLO and fought the party while allowing Hamas to grow. According to a wall street journal article published in 2009 In Gaza Israel hunted down members of Fatah and other secular PLO factions but it dropped harsh restrictions impose on Islamic activists by the territories
previous Egyptian rulers. Israeli historian Avner Cohen said Hamas to my great regret
is Israel's creation and was an enormous stupid mistake. Or as we like to say on this show and oopsie goofer of colossal proportions. Now, while some historians
view Israel's early fostering of religious extremists in Gaza is a bit of a mistake bombing (beep)
out of Gaza in the name of getting Hamas sure is
benefiting one guy that's right. Prime minister of Israel and indicted of bribery and corruption, man
himself, Benjamin Netanyahu. You see Netanyahu was on
the cusp of losing power. As his political opponents
were nearing the completion of a coalition agreement between the Palestinian and Israeli minority in parliament and right
wing defectors who no longer supported Netanyahu. But as opposition leader
Yair Lapid stated, the fire always breaks out just when it's most convenient
for the prime minister. The attacks on the mosque
and subsequent retaliation by Hamas leading to the bombing of Gaza causing the opposition coalition to fall apart due to tensions among its members. While Netanyahu himself
didn't send out a memo saying please escalate tensions in Gaza. According to the LA Times, around the time that the
coalition forming mandate was passed to Lapid, simmering
tensions in Jerusalem boiled over exacerbated by what turned out to be fateful moves by
allies of the prime minister. Those included Israeli
authorities blocking a central gathering point for Palestinians just outside the Old City during the opening days
of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, police raids on the Aqsa Mosque compound on a plateau sacred to
both Jews and Muslims, and the perspective eviction
of several Palestinian families in the East Jerusalem
neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah. A leader of a country and
his allies wanting to use war and bloodshed for political gain. Shocking, unheard of. I will not look to my right, your left. Well, at least there's a ceasefire, even though the first
cease fire Hamas proposed was rejected by Israel and the U.S block the
UN resolution calling for a cease fire because
it was mildly critical of all the murders the
Israeli military was doing. But after bombing a few more doctors in the associated press building Israel finally agreed to the cease fire. And immediately after that Israeli police and settlers
stormed the Al-Aqsa area arresting Palestinian worshipers. And in Sheik Jarrah Israeli
authorities are still bent on evicting Palestinian residents. Oh, and Israelis are doing mass arrests of Palestinian citizens of Israel for protesting the bombings
of Gaza with citizen You know, the oppressive ethnic
cleansing stuff we talked about in the beginning of the episode except now it's the end of the episode because time is a nightmare
and nothing is ever learned. (upbeat trombone music) But maybe some things are learned because support for
Palestinians is growing in the U.S with a definite
shift in the discourse including progressive
lawmakers being increasingly straightforward about
apartheid in Israel-Palestine and there have been pro-Palestinian
protests cropping up in major cities all over
the U.S and the world. In fact, maybe it's because people finally recognize the extreme badness of all the war crimes against Gazans. That Israel finally agreed to a ceasefire. This conflict skirmish
war crimearama only lasted for 11 days. Whereas the 2014 Gaza war
lasted for seven weeks and killed over 2000
Gazans, 67 Israeli soldiers and 5 Israeli citizens. War crimes are still bad but fewer war crimes is definitely better. They're still silencing journalists who recognize the Palestinians
deserve human rights such as the firing of former
AP journalists, Emily Wilder after being canceled
cultured by conservatives. But people seem to actually
be pissed off by it. And other AP journalists
are rallying behind Wilder. It's weird. It's like, it's like AP journalists. Maybe think it's not good
to silence a pro-Palestinian rights reporter after their
offices were obliterated by Israel in the name
of killing Palestinian. So things are still bad. But people are starting
to see how bad things are and seeing that something
is bad is the first step in making it less bad and possibly at some point
in the future may be good. And that is $20 for old Cody. You see katy bet me that I
couldn't end this episode on a positive note, but ha ha ha I did. And now, old Cody's
going to buy himself 20 of some joke thing that costs a dollar or probably just donate it to one of the charities
in the description. Honestly, pleases just roll the credits. (upbeat music) - Do the trombone again. Do the trombone again! (bluesy trombone music) - Thank you. Hey, thanks for watching. And I'm sorry, I threw that at you. Make sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel

people a country to call their own within Palestine and they named it Israel as the refugees boarded the ships that would take them to their new country they no longer feared the journey they knew

Palestinians live in two main areas the West Bank and the Gaza Strip where the worst of the recent fighting has been it's about 1/5 of the SI of greater London and home to more than 2 million [Music] people Gaza is run by a militant group called hamus but Israel still imposes strict restrictions on the movements of people who live there as well as controlling the airspace and the shoreline it says the security measures are necessary to protect its citizens from rocket attacks by hammer and to stop militants crossing the border into Israel to carry out terrorist attacks but on Saturday the 7th of October 2023 the Border fences were breached armed fighters from hamus launched a surprise attack targeting civilians as well as soldiers thousands of rockets were fired over a th000 Israelis were killed and more than 100 hostages were seized it prompted an immediate response from the Israeli government Israel is at War we didn't want this war it was forced Upon Us in the most brutal and Savage way but though Israel didn't start this war Israel will finish it within hours Israel hit back with attacks on Gaza over a thousand Palestinian people were killed other countries including the United States of America promise their support for Israel if the United States stands with Israel we will not ever failed to have their back and at 10 Downing Street the home of the UK prime minister the Israeli flag was projected onto the building as a sign of solidarity with the Israeli people you may have seen some upsetting pictures of the war on the news this week so what should you do if you're worried about what's been happening we've been getting some advice from an expert so my advice is if you hear or see something on the news that makes you feel anxious or a bit worried talk to the adults at home you might also want to limit the amount of news that you're watching or listening to watching a program like this will help you understand what's happening and if you're a young person in the UK from the Jewish or the Palestinian Community talk to the adults around you particularly if you're feeling blamed for what's going on remember help is [Music] available over the next 6 weeks we've got a series of special reports on how the climate crisis is threatening the survival of our Wildlife all over the world yep we're starting in the Arctic and it's all part of a new documentary from sky kids called save our [Music] Wildlife hello my name is Anisha and I'm 8 years old and I made it my mission to highlight what's happening to our world this is the Arctic at the top of our planet and I've come here because this place is on the front line of our fight against climate [Music] change temperatures here are rising faster than anywhere else on Earth and because of that the ice is melting and turning to water for the Wildlife that lives here it means a daily battle for survival so let's get going I'm setting off from the port of longan which is the closest town to the North Pole and it doesn't take long before we get our first sighting of some Wildlife look look over there a humpback whale what the largest animals on the planet I can't believe how lucky we are to see this oh get in the tail woo I'm really quite emotional about it I'm really happy but I've got to remember the main reason I'm here is to look out for warus and actually it's something we all can do WWF is asking us all to be warus detectives using our computers or tablets what exactly are you asking people to do warus are big powerful animals but they're also increasingly vulnerable to The Climate crisis so we need to better understand walrus in order to safeguard them into the future but that's a really really difficult thing to do because the Arctic is vast it's remote so that's why we think using satellite pictures pictures taken from 400 miles up in the sky can help us to better understand warus and predict them into the future okay it sounds sounds cool but what do we have to do well if you log on to the warus from space platform on the WWF website with your parents you can search for warus in hundreds of thousands of pictures of the Arctic Coastline can you show me how it works sure well here you see a picture and in the top left hand corner of this image you've got a small brown blob well those are actually walrus so once we find all the pictures with walrus then we'll count them but every now and again we go out and we do field work and we fly drones over the warus to make sure that our counts are really accurate and we can help to protect these animals into the future all this has made me even more determined to try and spot some Warriors in the world look over there they wardresses they are [Music] huge I just am so happy I seen such large and wonderful creatures I love their adorable little eyes so tell me more about them I've arranged a chat with one of the world leading experts in polar wildli and of you see their different colors it's because they're molting their hair are you worried what climate change might do to these beautiful warus I am I truly am because all of the animals that I have spent my whole life working on live in sea ice and the sea ice is disappearing and although a lot of people don't understand how important that is think about the rainforest if there's no rainforest there's no rainforest animals right yeah if there's no sea ice there's no sea ice animals that's completely true they need their home just like any animal does so is there a danger that they could become extinct definitely because they're having to spend more time on Shore and on shore they're much more easily prayed upon by polar bears walruses and polar bears are Arch enemies and polar bears generally win but isn't it true that the warus population around here has been going up yeah it's been going up for decades now they became protected in 1952 after they'd been hunted very very heavily but after 1952 no one is allowed to kill them and they've started to do better it's great to hear that warus in this part of the Arctic are protected they're such lovely and sociable creatures look how they're hodling together it's been so special for me seeing the wildlife in this beautiful but fragile place of course it makes me sad that climate change could eventually push these animals towards Extinction but perhaps if we all play our part to look after our planet we can make a real difference and these wonderful creatures can go on living here for many years to come and if you'd like to see Anisha save our Wildlife documentary it's available now on demand from sky kids plus as part of the program Anisha has been painting all of the animals that are featured just like this wonderful walrus if you fancy having a go at that yourself we'd really like to see your paintings of the animals that you love and we might show some of them on the program details of how to send us a picture of your paintings are on our website at first. newws FYI now this week's fake news or fact also has a wildlife theme there have been Reports online about an American woman trying to make a necklace out of giraffe poo could that be a fact or is it a tall tale we'll have the answer later on in the [Music] program first though October is Black History Month and hundreds of schools have been taking part in a special online assembly to find out more the assembly was hosted by fyi's very own jariah here's how we got on I'm about to do something that I've never done before a live stream to over 200,000 people to talk about something think that's really important to me I'm really nervous but excited so come on follow [Music] me good morning everyone and welcome my name is chish and I'm so glad you've joined us we've got schools in Edinburgh St George's School we've got braide school in Northern Ireland balina and we've also got johnstown's Primary School in Karan Wales so all of the nations of the UK are represented give us a away Breen hell school so as part of the assembly I get to tell everyone about my Heritage and some of my role models so some female role models who I admire in my life are my mom she's a social worker so she's always working with children and their families and my aunts one of them's a counselor the other's a nurse and the other one's a teacher so what did everyone think about the assembly I really enjoyed the assembly I thought it was very good to celebrate black people's achievements in the past um they weren't like celebrated enough and they were treated disrespectfully so I think it's nice to show black people that we will respect them and treat them like the same as everyone I feel like we should actually celebrate Black History Month more because it's very important to recognize what black people have done for [Music] society well I was really nervous but it was also really exciting I know School assemblies can be pretty boring sometimes but I reckon this one went down really well good job everyone now how did you get on with this week's fake news or fact earlier we told you about a story we'd spotted online about a woman who wanted to make a necklace out of lumps of giraffe poo well believe it or not it was a fact and here's the proof the woman had been on holiday to Kenya and when she came home to America the PO was confiscated by Customs [Music] officials yeah apparently giraffe poo can only be brought into the USA with proper permits and inspections because without these checks it could cause diseases hey you learn something new every day well that's it for this week so we'll see you next time bye"

198,MlgTkTEVcaQ,Israel Palestinian Conflict: The Truth About the Peace Process, ,2012-08-01,25827,442,191,UCfmSignFWkk1lw4015hCyyQ, having covered israel's legal rights in the west bank we're now going to focus on the peace process many suggest that israel's presence in the west bank what some people call the occupation is the cause of palestinian hostility towards israel and the reason there is no peace but is that really true if israel's presence is the cause of the conflict then it follows that there was no conflict before 1967 when israel was not in the west bank right let's look at the facts the palestinian liberation organization was created in 1964 when the entire west bank and gaza was in arab hence why create the plo in 1964 when israel has no presence in the west bank and gaza what palestine were they liberating the plo emblem gives us the answer the plo was created to remove by force the entire state of israel from the map of the middle east a goal clearly stated in their charter this goal was not new the plo was continuing a long arab history of saying no no to the national self-determination of the jewish people no to recognizing the jewish ancestral homeland let's take a look at the history in 1937 the appeal commission recommended a division of the land a jewish state and an arab state the arab portion would include 96 of the territory that the league of nations had originally designated for the jewish homeland this included far more than just the west bank however instead of accepting the jews as peace partners the palestinian leader hajamin husseini said no and found a partner whose vision was closer to his own in 1947 the united nations recommended the partition plan which again offered the arabs far more than just the west bank the jews said yes the arab leaders again said no and launched a war of extermination israel won that war established the state but did not know a day of peace despite the fact that its arab neighbors held the entire west bank the arabs continued saying no they attacked israel relentlessly using the west bank as a launching pad until israel took it over in a war of self-defense in 1967 after the war the arab league rejected all attempts at peace they continued to choose force over negotiation and at a summit in the city of khartoum we again heard no no no let's fast forward to 1993. israel and the palestinians signed the oslo accords were the palestinians finally saying yes it appeared so israel said yes and gave territorial control to a palestinian government it helped establish but despite signing agreements the palestinian actions said no during the next five years israel saw a significant increase in terrorist attacks which killed hundreds of israelis in 1996 yasser arafat the palestinian leader declares we plan to eliminate the state of israel and establish a purely palestinian state but israel did not give up saying yes in 2000 israel's prime minister barack offers the palestinians 93 of the west bank again the answer is no together with increased terror in 2005 israel withdraws from the gaza strip uprooting 8 500 israeli citizens hoping to advance peace the palestinians again say no this time they increase rocket attacks from gaza against israeli civilians by over 500 percent in 2008 another israeli attempt at yes prime minister olmert accepts nearly all palestinian demands including handing over almost 100 of the west bank with minor land swaps the palestinians again no so what can we conclude 1. the conflict was not caused by israeli presence in the west bank the real cause of the conflict until today is the long-held arab history of saying no no to peace no to the existence of israel because no is consistent with palestinian policy education and media political and religious leaders continuously promote israel's destruction two israel has said yes for decades and has proven that by signing peace with jordan and egypt so where do we go from here how do we achieve peace with some good will mutual recognition of the right to self-determination and real compromises on both sides israel for its part will continue saying yes to a real and enduring peace but for the peace process to succeed the palestinians will have to give up their uncompromising choice of force over negotiation and of choosing no over yes it's about time you
199,nUfWTHbCS78,"Brief History of Israel-Palestine Conflict | Norman Finkelstein Teach-In on Gaza, Israel, and Hamas","Political scientist and bestselling author Norman Finkelstein conducted a teach-in on the current situation in Gaza and Israel at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, via Zoom, on Tuesday October 17th, 2023.",2023-10-25,135711,4229,501,UCtL5p5kTIgWA3bcskUccdyw," I'm going to do two things number one I'm going to try in a succinct away as possible to run through the history of the Israel Palestine conflict with a focus as I proceed to the Gaza constituent the Gaza part of the Israel Palestine conflict and then secondly to just give a rudimentary picture of what Gaza is so let me begin with the history as all of you know there's always a kind of partisanship embedded in deciding where to begin some people want to begin with the kingdom of Judea in some 2,000 years ago other people want to begin with the Arab inhabitation of Palestine and the Zionist settlers who came over to displace them I am going to forego for reasons of time I'm going to forgo either or both of those starting points and I'll choose my own arbitrary and I admit it to be arbitrary my own arbitrary starting point departure point there were two communities in Palestine by 1947 there was a Jewish Community it went by the title of the yesu and it constituted roughly 600,000 Jews or zionists whichever term you prefer and the second Community consisted of Arabs uh or if you prefer Palestinian Arabs and that Community amounted to roughly 1,300,000 since the early part of the 20th century there was some cooperation but mostly I think it's fair to say there was a competition and a conflict between the indigenous population of Palestine at the time the Palestinian Arabs and the Jewish settlers or colonizers at the time it was called the Jewish Colonization Society Jewish colonizers uh there was a competition uh and eventually that competition became a full F fledged uh conflict it was clear after World War II that a resolution to the conflict had to be found and the issue originally the issue was managed by the British what was called the British mandate over Palestine I won't detail you detain you with the um background to that it's not so important for our purposes uh after World War II the British despaired of finding a resolution to this conflict between the Jewish and the Arab communities and so they threw the Bulls so to speak into the court of the United Nations the United Nations sent over several fact finding um committees the British had their own fact finding committee there was a large number of voluminous uh and I would say quite impressive reports that were produced and at some point the uh General assembly had to find some sort of resolution and that resolution came in the form of UN resolution 181 it's sometimes called the partition resolution um and the partition resolution you can say I think it's fair to say it wasn't attempting to find a formula based on Justice it wasn't a moral inquiry or a moral resolution it was very much approached as a practical pragmatic problem there are these two communities here they don't get along their fundamental aspirations differ in fundamental ways and there doesn't seem to be any prospect that they can get along and so the decision was made by the majority there were minority opinions also but not worth going into those now the majority opinion was to partition Palestine between those two communities the Palestinian Arab and the zist Jewish communities according to the partition the Jewish Comm Community would comprise approximately 56% of Palestine that is to say 56% was allocated to the Jewish Community uh even as the population was 600,000 and 44% was allocated to the Arab population even as its population was about 1,300,000 well for various reasons not worth going into but perhaps obvious to some members who are listening some members of the audience um the Arab side formerly did not accept the partition resolution on two grounds ground number one they were the indigenous population ground number two they were the majority population ation the Jewish side forly accepted the partition but they were still determined to control or gain territorial control over the whole land of Israel which the Zionist movement regarded as belonging to it based on several grounds I'm not going to go into to them in any event the conflict quickly degenerated after the partition resolution it quickly degenerated into open Warfare not just between the two communities in Palestine but also with the neighboring Arab states as a consequence of that Warfare which sometimes called the first Arab Israeli War as a consequence of that Warfare there were two uh basic results which bear on the conflict today the first result was there was a mass explosion from the area that became Israel there was a mass explosion of the Palestinian Arab population of roughly the estimates are roughly 90% of the population within the area that became Israel roughly 90% of the population was expelled and of that it comprised about 750,000 Palestinian Arabs of those 750,000 roughly 250,000 the estimates are between 250,000 and 300,000 uh as I proceed you'll forgive me I'm not going to give every estimate I'll give what I take to be credible estimates though I confess I can't determine what is and what isn't a credible estimate I'll just tell you what I find in books I've read so roughly 250,000 Palestinians were expelled from the area that became Israel and they ended up of the 750,000 about a third of the 750 ,000 who were expelled they ended up in Gaza and they overwhelmed numerically the actual uh population Arab population in Gaza the bottom line there and here I'm going to just fast forward to the present and then get back to where we were the bottom line is Gaza is overwhelmingly a refugee population so roughly 70% of the people of Gaza are classified under international law as refugees or descendants of refugees so one fact you have to always bear in mind when you hear the word Gaza that the population of Gaza is overwhelmingly a refugee population and that overwhelming Refugee population they began so to speak their life in Gaza already as refugees so when you hear now in the news about the possibility of an ethnic cleansing of Gaza for most for about 70% refugees and descendants of refugees were talking about a twice over explosion okay let's go back to right after the 19 48 war I said there were two major consequences for our purposes first the mass exposion and secondly Israel now it's declared itself a state Israel did not abide by the UN resolution of 56% being allocated to it it expanded its borders to 80% of Palestine the only areas of the what's called British mandated Palestine the only areas that did not come under Israeli control where What's called the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip with those two exceptions the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip uh Israel now controlled all of historic or British mandated Palestine um now for reasons of time and I won't keep repeating myself but for reasons of time we're going to fast forward from 1948 to 1967 in 1967 there was another conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors it's sometimes called the Six Day War I prefer the June 1967 war during the June 1967 war Israel now expanded its borders a second time and it now controlled the whole of the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip and those two areas the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip under international law constituted occupied territories and there is a large body of international law on the legal status the rights and duties of an occupying power uh in the course of its occupation uh they are usually embodied in What's called the hag regulations and the Fourth Geneva Convention now now just as in 1947 the United Nations again was came came to play a major role in trying to find a solution to this seemingly intract intractable problem the uh problem was first debated and disputed in the UN General Assembly a resolution couldn't be found found and then it was thrown into the court of the UN Security Council and the UN Security Council in November 1967 produced what's still considered the landmark resolution after 181 in 1947 the second Landmark resolution which still constitutes under international law the legal basis for trying to resolve the conflict they produced or passed without uh any dissenting votes unanimously UN resolution 242 UN resolution 242 had two prongs prong number one was the uh international law principle based in the UN Charter and stated in the preambular paragraph to UN resolution 242 preambular paragraph simply means the Preamble and the preamble to UN resolution 242 States quote it's inadmissible to acquire territory by War under current under the current Le uh International System it's inadmissible to acquire territory by War in accordance with that principle Israel was obliged to relinquish control of the territories it had acquired during the 1967 war those territories being and again I'll beg your Indulgence but for my repeating myself but unless you get the basic facts everything else is just mystical so let me again reiterate the basic facts under international law it being inadmissible to acquire territory by War Israel was legally bound under international law to relinquish control of the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip that you might call the quidd in the quidd Pro quote quidd pro quo basically your obligation their obligation the quo was Israel is a state under international law it's a member state of the United Nations and therefore it has the same rights and duties as any other member state of the United Nations and therefore since the UN Charter calls for peaceful relations between states the Arab states had the obligation to ex recognize Israel's right to live at peace with its neighbors and those were the two the mutually uh uh the the the two preconditions for a resolution of the conflict and it sometimes came to be called the land for peace uh the land for peace um terms for resolving the conflict Israel had to relinquish the control over the territories it had acquired the Arabs had to recognize Israel's right to live at peace with its neighbors in the region now I didn't mention and I don't want to go into it now I didn't mention the fact that in the course of the June 1967 war Israel not only conquered the West Bank in Gaza it also conquered the Egyptian s I and it conquered the um uh Syrian Golan Heights I'm going to leave that aside as I said I want to hone in on why we're uh here today namely the issue of Gaza so that was the formula full land full withdrawal in exchange for a full piece that was the formula that was presented by the UN and it's still the security Council and it's still the basis for any resolution of the conflict um beginning now I'm going to now hone in just on the Palestinians and they'll get to Gaza in a moment the Palestinians at that point their leadership was called the Palestine Liberation Organization it was abbreviated the PLO and the central figure the key figure in the PLO was a person named Yasser Ara effect beginning in the early 1970s the Palestine Liberation Organization signaled that it was prepared to accept the terms of UN resolution 242 that is to say it was prepared to recognize Israel as a state in the region with all the rights that acre to a state namely the right to live at peace with its neighbors and the Palestinians demanded in return and this was endorsed by the International Community the right their right in return to exercise their self-determination as a people within the West Bank and Gaza within that 20% of historic Palestine which Israel was Duty bound to relinquish control of over and which the Palestinians now acques would constitute the territorial borders of their state so the Palestinians had by 19 early 1970s the Palestinians had met their Duty their obligation under international law to recognize Israel as a state and they expected as UN resolution 242 stated that then they would have their right having uh acknowledged their Duty they now wanted their right to exercise self-determination within the West Bank including East Jerusalem and gazum the Israelis on the other hand were determined to keep all of what they regarded as their quote unquote historic Homeland and they didn't want to relinquish control of large parts of the West Bank and any of Gaza they were quite determined and they dug in their heels uh not to accept those terms for resolving the conflict International pressure then began to build on Israel to accept the Palestinian recognition of them as a state and to carry out a withdrawal from the territories they occupied come 1982 uh Israel uh came under a lot of pressure to acknowledge the Palestinian willingness to settle the conflict what was called there's a very good book it might be in your library it's called dilemas of security or dilemma of security and it's written by an Israeli political scientist who has since passed named anner Yaniv and anner Yaniv uh wrote In the book that Israel was faced with a major dilemma by the end of the 1970s and the early 80s and now I'm using his term he said the major dilemma was the Palestinian peace offensive in quotation marks the Palestinian peace offensive the Palestinians were determined to settle the conflict in accordance with international law but that would have compelled Israel to carry out a withdrawal from the territories which it considered belong to it by historic right and that was not going to relinquish control of in 1982 in June 1982 Israel contrived contrived a CIS belli a pretext to launch a war in Lebanon and in the course of that war which began in 1982 and climaxed in September 1982 Israel killed the estimates are between 15 and 20,000 Palestinians and Israelis overwhelmingly civilians after the war or at the end of the war climaxed in the major massacres of Palestinian refu Palestinians and refugee camps in Lebanon uh you can check it on your own because there's a voluminous literature on it it's called the Sabra and chatila massacres at the end of the Sabra and chatila massacres the PE was effectively defeated and it was forced into Exile and at that point 1980 uh we're talking about roughly 1982 uh and at that point there was a feeling that the Palestine question had now been eliminated uh the uh Arab states and the International Community took very little interest in it and the people in the West Bank in Gaza were now left to what you might call their own devices they realized there was not going to be any International pressure exerted on Israel on the one hand and on the other hand unless they did something on their own that is to say took their fate into their own hands um this occupation would go on through eternity and so in December 1987 December 7th 1987 a nonviolent civil Revolt erupted first in Gaza and then that civil Revolt quickly spread to the West Bank and that came to be called the first in i n t Ina ad a or with sometimes without the H and it happens just to speak on the biographical note that I first became involved in the Israel Palestine conflict in June 1982 joined the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and then in 1988 and every year thereafter I went to uh the West Bank much less so Gaza uh and witnessed the Palestinian civil Revolt overwhelmingly nonviolent in the first two years from 1987 to 1989 uh really 1988 to 1990 to be more precise because it was December 1987 uh and uh Israel was determined to crush that revolt and brought to bear uh massive Force the defense minister at the time Yak Rabin formulated the slogan uh uh under the egis of which Israel carried out its massive repression he called for the use of and now I'm quoting the phrase Force might and beatings to repress this civil nonviolent Revolt uh and the pales the fact of the matter is that the Israelis were uh successful this isn't the first time in history obviously that might triumphed over right and that eventually led to what came to be called the Oslo Accord the Oslo Accord which you'll hear a lot about if you ever follow this subject Beyond this evening the Oslo Accords was signed in 19 uh 93 September 133 1993 and the essence of the Oslo Accord was that the PLO formerly recognized Israel on paper formerly recognized Israel and the Palestinians got virtually nothing in return all they because they were defeated during the first intifa and the Victor gets the spoils uh what the Palestinians got in return was a promise of something in the future that was really the essence of it there was supposed to be a 5-year interim period in which Israel and the and the Palestine Liberation Organization would find a resolution to the conflict but that never happened and Israel was able successfully to recruit the PLO uh as its the expression that came to be used as its subcontractor among the Palestinians uh the PLO took the perquisites of power namely the monies the VIP status and all the other assorted uh perquisites of power and they became what the current term is the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Authority is basically an administrative and police uh network uh that acts at as at Israel's behest now we're going to fast forward a little uh to 2000 I fast forward now to 2006 and that's going to begin so far I've talked about the Israel Arab dimension of the problem then the Israel Palestine dimension of the problem and now I'm going to to reduce our scope even more and focus on the Gaza dimension of the problem in 2006 there were parliamentary elections in the West Bank and Gaza and the International Community in particular the United States exhorted all Palestinians to participate in these elections and then two surprisingly thing two surprising things happened number one Hamas the Islamic movement agreed to participate in the elections number two to everybody's surprise including Hamas uh Israel excuse me Hamas won the elections Jimmy Carter the former US president he was one of the eyewitnesses to the elections and he called them I'm quoting him now completely honest and fair elections immediately as Hamas won the election Israel followed by the US and the EU uh imposed a brutal blade on Gaza it punished the people of Gaza for electing the wrong party party into power and that's the beginning you'll often hear about the blockade of Gaza 2006 marks the beginning of the blockade and the blockade was imposed because the people of the Palestinian people were told to carry out elections and they did carry out the elections as they were told to do but then they elected the wrong party into power in fact at the time Hillary Clinton the senator from New York at the time she lamented that the US made a mistake and it didn't rig the election in any event uh after that the Hamas was now in power a block was imposed on Gaza and um Hamas be began to undergo what you might call a political Evolution and part of that political Evolution was that it seemed prepared it made statements obviously whether or not the statements would prove on in practice to be substantive they clearly made statements that including to Jimmy Carter that they were prepared to negotiate a settlement with Israel on on the basis of the terms of international law and UN resolution 242 those uh peaceful or I should say diplomatic uh efforts by uh Hamas reached an impass because Israel didn't accept the legitimacy of Hamas as a negotiator ating partner and from there on in things begin to rapidly deteriorate and here I'm going to go quite expeditiously uh because I can't go into the details and if it comes up during questions and answers I'll be happy to respond to specific queries beginning in 2008 uh the people of Gaza now start to undergo or experience uh a succession of brutal Israeli massacres in Gaza there were several massacres preceding 20089 I don't have time to go through all of them in detail but the ma the first major major Massacre occurs in uh 2008 it begins on December 26 6 2008 and it lasts until January 17th 2008 it's called operation um castled in the course of operation castled Israel killed about 12 thou 1200 1,00 Gins including 350 children it destroyed approximately 6,300 100 homes in Gaza and it decimated the infrastructure of Gaza the factories the um electrical plants the water sewage plants um were decimated in the course of that Massacre uh inflicted on Gaza then there were several other massacres including on board board the humanitarian flotilla led the flagship of which was the maavi mamra on May 31st a humanitarian flotilla was headed to Gaza it had 10,000 tons of basic necessities for the people of Gaza who were suffering under the inhuman illegal blockade of Gaza and uh the flotilla was attacked under international waters by Israeli Commandos and by the end of the attack in the dead of night uh eight passengers were killed then in 2012 there was another Israeli operation against Gaza called operation pillar of defense and then in July August uh 2014 there was the most Savage of the massacres in Gaza it was called operation protect itive Edge at the time the head of state for that particular Massacre was Benjamin Netanyahu now today in the New York Times Benjamin Netanyahu was described as essentially a pnik who only uh in his past he was only inclined towards what the New York Times called targeted operations and the New York times describe what happened in 201 uh4 operation protective Edge the New York Times described it as quote Limited in nature the operation was limited in nature well other people had different opinions of that limited operation first of all let me give you the statistics Israel killed about 2200 Goins of which approximately 550 were children Israel destroyed uh 18 uh 18,000 18,000 homes in Gaza the head of the international Committee of the Red Cross Peter moer he went to Gaza after the end of the uh conflict and he said and bear in mind we're talking about the international the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross whose Bas his job description is to visit combat zones and he said publicly that never in his professional life had he ever witnessed the magnitude of Destruction that he saw in Gaza this is what the New York Times calls an operation that was limited in n nature in the same way Sarah Roy the very honorable scholar at Harvard University she's the son of survivors she's the daughter excuse me she's the daughter of survivors of aitz concentration camp she's written the definitive economic study of Gaza the de the D development of Gaza uh and uh she said she had never seen such economic psychological and physical destruction as she witnessed in 2014 with operation protective Edge and now I'm going to fast forward to the present uh not going through uh well no there's one other I have to go through and then I'll get to the presid in 2018 the people of Gaza they decided to try something new many people in the International Community uh had exhorted the people of Gaza and the Palestinians generally but the people in Gaza to try Civil Disobedience that armed struggle as it were was not yielding any results so to try Civil Disobedience now as I've already told you they tried Civil Disobedience once during the first inter now the people of Gaza suffering under this blockade in 2018 tried it again it was called the Great March of return and the great March of return like the first in started out overwhelmingly nonviolent but then Israel as in the first in and also the second in which I didn't mention because time didn't allow it uh during the Israel during the uh great March excuse me the Palestinians attempted nonviolent Civil Disobedience and what did Israel do well the record is quite well documented in a un report and also by Human Rights Watch if you look at the UN report they state now again you're free to check the sources and challenge me and I'm I welcome that we all can learn from each other examining scrutinizing statements by the other side uh the UN report found that Israel was targeting children in the great March of return they were targeting medical personnel they were targeting journalists and they were targeting people with physical disabilities those who participated in the great margin return who were in wheelchairs or on crutches and the evidence show that Israeli snipers were overwhelmingly targeting the ankles of the demonstrators so as to inflict permanent life-changing disabilities on them so having said that we're now going to move up to the present I won't now discuss the events of October 7th and further I wanted to provide the background and then I'll take questions from you on how I understand the current situation including what happened on October 7th I wanted to use the first half to just must present the background"
