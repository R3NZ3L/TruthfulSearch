For years, the Philippine government have been looking for better ways to curb the dengue epidemic. The solution came in 2016, in the form of a dengue vaccine by Sanofi Pasteur – Dengvaxia.\n\nEager to tame the outbreak, the country quickly launched a dengue vaccination program, starting with children.\n\nAfter more than 800,000 Filipino schoolchildren were given at least one dose of the vaccine, however, Sanofi Pasteur dropped a bomb – Dengvaxia was potentially harmful for those who had never had dengue.\n\nWhat ensued was mass hysteria, court cases and the start of mistrust in vaccines.\n\nBarnaby Lo looks at the consequence of the dengue vaccine scare, and how it impacts the prevention of diseases like polio, measles and new viruses like the one that causes COVID-19. #Philippines #Vaccine #Virus\n\nSubscribe to us on YouTube: https://goo.gl/lP12gA\nDownload our APP on Apple Store (iOS): https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cctvnews-app/id922456579?l=zh&ls=1&mt=8\nDownload our APP on Google Play (Android): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imib.cctv'",2021-02-10,6468,142,26,UCgrNz-aDmcr2uuto8_DL2jg,CGTN,2013-01-24,3080000,124462

Honestly I’m very hesitant at first and just let time passed hehe so I can observe first. My child has asthma and I really had to consult with her pedia and discuss with us how safe for children with comorb. So finally we decide to have her vaccinated. \nThe steps were easy. Just a tip for you to secure first a med cert from your pediatrics doctor and then go to your LGU’s (Local Government Unit) Facebook page and look for the link to the registration. Register your child and choose a schedule. On site pls bring photocopy of your child’s ID (birth certif or school ID), parent’s or guardian’s ID too. The process was smooth and easy and very organized. Kudos to Marikina LGU and to Philippine Government for this initiative we thank all the health workers and the volunteers also!

371,GfJeUwsw-UI,"Side Effects of AstraZeneca Vaccine | First Dose in Cebu City, Philippines","'Hello Guys! I recently got my first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine here in Cebu City, Philippines and I am sharing in this vlog if there are any side effects. The vaccination was held at Robinsons Galleria Mall in Cebu City and apart from that there are many sites in different areas in Metro Cebu. The following vaccines are available in the Philippines Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Sinovac, Sputnik V with the other brands still being ordered and it is also be available in Cebu City.  The process in getting yourself vaccinated changes from time to time so I suggest that you coordinate with your Local Government Unit on their respective vaccine rollout. During the vaccination, you will be interviewed and they will let you know what are the side effects (adverse effects) and what to do about it.\n\nThe road to herd immunity is still far ahead but I would like everyone to encourage to get the vaccine ASAP. In the Philippines, the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) along with the Local Government Unit (LGU) in coordination with Department of Health (DOH) and the rest of the agencies are given autonomy how to rollout the vaccines just like in Cebu City. Some were done through online appointments, some are first come first serve via walkin and some are on house to house.  I hope this vlog will help you understand a bit more of it and if there are any adverse effects and what to do about it. \n\nIn your place what are your experiences in getting the vaccine? Have you already have your first shot? Any side effects? Which sites in Cebu City or in the Philippines you had it?

377,6AaFocCinuA,Road to Immunity: Understanding the COVID-19 Vaccine and a Post-Pandemic Philippines,"'For the past year, countries have implemented public health and safety measures to curb the pandemic, while scientists, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies around the world focused on the quest for a vaccine. While there is still uncertainty about how much longer and how deep the pandemic would continue to damage our social and economic conditions, the development and eventual deployment of the vaccine sparked a sense of hope in all of us.\n\nHowever, it seems like this development poses another layer of issues. Reports show that countries that have started their vaccine rollout have been beset by problems. Several challenges on vaccine efficacy and public trust have crippled even the most advanced societies. In this webinar, we shall touch on the long-standing debate on the relevance, efficacy, and safety of vaccines through the lens of public health.
