33,E4iygQ--7dk,"A Brief History of the name Palestine and its derivative Adjective Palestinian:

 1.	Palestine is Judea, the Roman name for ‚ÄòLand of the Jews‚Äô when the Roman Emperor Hadrian re-named this land as Palestina in 135 CE. Since then, it was never an Islamic State. [‚ÄòIn the 2nd century CE, the Romans crushed the Jewish revolt and Judea was renamed Syria Palestina‚Äô ‚Äì Jewish Virtual Libr.]

2.	The Pre-Islamic Arabs were in the Roman armies and witnessed both Jerusalem‚Äôs destruction and the name change of Judea. [Flavius Josephus Wars, Book V, Ch 13, 4]. As well, the Quran mentions Israel as the land of the Jews. Thereby, the Muslim people would be fully aware Palestine referred to the Jews for 2,000 years.

3.	The historical archives of the Persians, Greeks, Romans, British, French and Americans refer to Palestine as the ‚Äòhistorical homeland of the Jews‚Äô, not of the Muslim peoples. America‚Äôs early Presidents initiated Israel‚Äôs return prior to Britain and Herzl: ‚ÄúRestoring the Jews to their national home in Palestine is a noble dream. My emancipated hope is the restoring of the Jews to their nation home in Palestine‚Äù - President Abraham Lincoln to Canadian Zionist Wentworth Monk; 1863. 

4.	The term Palestine was introduced in the Hebrew Bible from the term Plishtim [‚ÄòInvaders‚Äô]. The Muslims disdained the name Palestine, as they do the term ‚ÄòZionists‚Äô today. In 1947, the Arabs virtually begged of Britain not to use this name for the land. Thereby, the usurping of this name in the 1960‚Äôs is not credible as a mark of land ownership, because it was not one of historical usage by the Arabs. 

5.	 A host of Islamic scholars and historians decried and rejected Muslims as Palestinians.: ‚ÄúAllah Gave the Land of Israel to the Jews. The al-Aqsa Mosque was built on top of Solomon‚Äôs Temple.‚Äù - Eleventh century historian Muhammad Ibn Ahmad al-Maqdisi and fourteenth century Iranian religious scholar Hamdallah al-Mustawfi // ‚ÄúThere is no such thing as ‚ÄòPalestine‚Äô in history, absolutely not.‚Äù - Arab-American historian and Princeton University Professor, Philip Hitti, testifying before the Anglo-American Committee in 1946] 

6.	A host of Jewish organizations and Institutions were called by the prefix of Palestine or Palestinian in the 20th century, including ‚ÄòThe Jewish Palestine Brigade‚Äô in Britain‚Äôs WW2 Military Forces; The [Jewish] Palestine Symphony Orchestra; Today‚Äôs Jerusalem Post media was called ‚ÄúThe Palestine Post‚Äù. 

7.	 There are no Arab Muslim Palestinians on record prior to the 20th century; the land was referred only as the homeland of the Jews. It is validated by a host of archives by many nations, and some one million Archaeological relics. Thereby, the nativity claim can only apply to Jews. In fact, there was never a time of no Jews in Palestine the past 2,000 years, as evidenced by the Crusaders, Islamic invasions and the previous Ottomans. 

8.	Generally, real natives do not usurp the name of other natives, especially one they disdained. [‚ÄúThere is a propaganda war going on now with regard to the term ‚ÄòPalestine.‚Äô It is specifically employed to avoid the use of the name Israel, and must be considered an anti-Israel term.‚Äù - Dr. Thomas McCall, the Senior Theologian of Levitt Ministry, quoting Zola Levitt.] 

9.	 The previous Islamic Ottoman rulers of Arabia declared Palestine as the homeland of the Jews. - ‚ÄúWho can challenge the rights of the Jews in Palestine? Good Lord, historically it is really your country‚Äù - Ottoman Mayor and scholar Yusuf Diya al-Khalidi; Jerusalem, 1899. 

10.	 Judea‚Äôs original, previous name was Israel in 1002 BCE, established under King David; and again in 1947 when this country was re-established by the UN. ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô is mentioned in the Quran as one belonging to the Jews. [Joshua J. Mark , Ancient History Encyl.) 

11.	 All Religious Scriptures acknowledge Palestine as the ‚ÄòLand of Israel‚Äô; ‚ÄòLand of Judea‚Äô; and ‚ÄòLand of the Jews‚Äô ‚Äì including the Hebrew Bible [1 Samuel 13:19]; The New Testaments [ ‚ÄòAnd he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.‚Äô - Matt. 2:21]; The Quran - [Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:20-21.]; and the Dead Sea Scrolls. 

12.	 The Original Philistines converted to the Hebrew Belief and became Israelites. The term Palestine is derived from the Philistines, a Greek Island people who invaded Canaan some 4,000 years ago. The Philistines converted to the Hebrew belief under a peace offer by King David, and held prominent positions in David‚Äôs army. [‚ÄúThey (the Philistines) met with a severe defeat, however, early in the reign of David (2 Samuel 5:20), he succeeded in reducing them to a state of vassalage (2 Samuel 8:1). In the year of the fall of Samaria (721 B.C.) they became vassals of Sargon. After the time of the Assyrians the Philistines cease to be mentioned by this name. In the ebb and flow of warring nations over this land it is more than probable that they were gradually absorbed and lost their identity. - [The Catholic Encyl.). / The Philistine cities lost their independence to Assyria, and revolts in following years were all crushed. [Myers 1997, p. 313.] / The theory of the ‚ÄúLost Ten Tribes‚Äù calls for (1) all inhabitants of the Northern Kingdom of Hoshea to be deported by Shalmaneser and Sargon, 722-718 B.C [Hearyhim, Weebly, Armstrongism] / They (the Canaanites) were indeed assimilated into the Israelite nation. When the Assyrians overran the Kingdom of Israel, they did not leave any Canaanite aside, as they had all become Israelites by that time. Therefore, the only people that can trace back a lineage to the ancient Canaanites are the Jews. The Canaanites did not exist any longer after the 8th century b.c.e. and they were not annihilated but assimilated into the Jewish people. - [The True Identity of the So-called Palestinians, imninalu] / The Bible describes the Philistines as remaining ‚Äúsubdued‚Äù during David‚Äôs reign [Philistine; New World Enycl.]/ Josephus, Antiquities, Book 11, Ch.1] & [Esdras 13:39] Q. How then did the Muslims become Palestinians, an adjective of Palestine, in the 1960‚Äôs, and have been using this name as the antithesis of Judea and Israel¬¨¬¨¬¨? A. The Palestinian Name Deception: Those in the West who manoeuvred this name upon Muslims did so to mock, if not desecrate, the history, belief and culture of the Muslim people. Thereby it should be overturned by honourable Muslims.","a brief history of the name palestine and its derivative adjective palestinian:

892,a34zpFaoBoM,"The issue that people don't seem to understand is how this extermination was actually started and the reasons behind it. Though it's easy to point fingers and blame, society must begin to address the double standards that provoke such attacks to even begin and who it is that conducted the initial strike. The constant atrocities committed against Palestinians since 1948 have always been suppressed by Western media, though even the slightest form of retaliation in any form has always been seen as ""an act of terrorism."" Now before one can quickly choose a side, you must first understand that Hamas is not innocent in the slightest and does not follow the complex guidelines of war as ruled in the Quran though journalists must begin to stray from the demand of condemnation as it further enforces the double standards put in place. This inequity is supported by the shaming of Hamas as it suggests that while one side must be condemned, the other can run free of judgment, avoiding condemnation for the duration of their inhumane acts of violence towards the entirety of the localized Palestinian population. Universally, the expectation to condemn Hamas seems non-complex, though it proves to be the opposite in nearly every scenario when reflecting on the never-ending acts of the Israeli government. In no way does the Muslim or Arab population accept the actions of Hamas, though the barbaric response by Israel is not a response of self-defense but rather revenge. The redundancy in biased media coverage and the sympathetically neglectful approach from journalists toward Palestinian supporters comes at the cost of misinformation and provoking anger among the Muslim community, ultimately displaying them in a pessimistic manner. Overall, the action of blaming one party for the start of this conflict is harmful to not only the victims but in finding justice for those affected by said conflict. Neither side is innocent, though the extreme response and disregard for humanity by Israel has found its way to prevail even in this society, and their constant facade of innocence and victim must be overlooked. Finally, people must find sympathy for the dark history of Palestinian treatment by Israel as it's paramount to understanding the true reasons behind the merciless genocide being carried out against the Palestinians.  May the lost lives of all innocent souls be granted peace at last.","the issue that people don't seem to understand is how this extermination was actually started and the reasons behind it. though it's easy to point fingers and blame, society must begin to address the double standards that provoke such attacks to even begin and who it is that conducted the initial strike. the constant atrocities committed against palestinians since 1948 have always been suppressed by western media, though even the slightest form of retaliation in any form has always been seen as ""an act of terrorism."" now before one can quickly choose a side, you must first understand that hamas is not innocent in the slightest and does not follow the complex guidelines of war as ruled in the quran though journalists must begin to stray from the demand of condemnation as it further enforces the double standards put in place. this inequity is supported by the shaming of hamas as it suggests that while one side must be condemned, the other can run free of judgment, avoiding condemnation for the duration of their inhumane acts of violence towards the entirety of the localized palestinian population. universally, the expectation to condemn hamas seems non-complex, though it proves to be the opposite in nearly every scenario when reflecting on the never-ending acts of the israeli government. in no way does the muslim or arab population accept the actions of hamas, though the barbaric response by israel is not a response of self-defense but rather revenge. the redundancy in biased media coverage and the sympathetically neglectful approach from journalists toward palestinian supporters comes at the cost of misinformation and provoking anger among the muslim community, ultimately displaying them in a pessimistic manner. overall, the action of blaming one party for the start of this conflict is harmful to not only the victims but in finding justice for those affected by said conflict. neither side is innocent, though the extreme response and disregard for humanity by israel has found its way to prevail even in this society, and their constant facade of innocence and victim must be overlooked. finally, people must find sympathy for the dark history of palestinian treatment by israel as it's paramount to understanding the true reasons behind the merciless genocide being carried out against the palestinians.  may the lost lives of all innocent souls be granted peace at last."

1472,Tz7JJcO-rWw,"Fascinating account, well put together video. 

One must not forget either, that In the First World War (1914‚Äì1918) the British sided with the Arabs to fight against the Ottoman Empire of that time. The Ottoman Turks lost that war and both Britain and France alongside the US had a meeting in Paris in 1919 where it would be decided what the fate of Turkey's lands would become in the Middle East.

The Arabs had been reassured that if they fought against the Turks, they would be given their own empire and land on which  they could rule and govern. This promise was BROKEN however, by the British at the so called 'Peace Conference'. The subsequent Arab lands ended up in the control of both Britain and France and would remain so up until they believed the Arabs were ready to rule them themselves.

To get to the depth of this period of history, one must understand the involvement of Jews in all of this. You see, the history of the Jewish people stretches back a very long time and that is not surprising as its one of the oldest Abrahamic faiths extending its origins to even before Bibical times.  When the Roman empire was reigning supreme and controlling large swathes of territory stretching from Europe to the Middle East, the Jews lived in and around a region what is now commonly called Palestine.  They were driven out of there by the Romans around 70AD and as a result Jews would migrate around the world and settle down where they could. This would happen over the course of around two millennia.

Eventually at the end of 19th Century, a man named Theodor Herzl, an Austro-Hungarian Jewish lawyer and Political activist became the pioneer and founded of what we refer to as 'The Zionist Movement'. 

The idea behind the Zionist movement was simply to establish a Jewish homeland, with Zion meaning 'promised land'.  It just so happened that this 'promised land' would be smack bang in the middle of modern day Palestine. Theodor Herzl advocated and staunchly believed that it was the place God intended the Jews to live.

Sometime around 1917, Lord Balfour, a British Government Ministor promised that the British Government would assist the Jews in establishing a homeland in Palestine. This became known to the world as 'The Balfour Declaration'. 

Ultimately what this did was put Britain in a complicated situation since this very same land was initially promised to be handed back to the Arabs, land which it must be noted never belonged to the British, the French and certainly not to USA.","fascinating account, well put together video.

1550,JN4mnVLP0rU,You have provided one of THE most concise and ethno-graphically accurate depictions of both the static and dynamic socio/geo-political drivers in this tangled region! The mention of the adaptation of Sykes-Picot geopolitical borders from that of the Ottomans and the fact that the Ottoman's version had already disregarded the ethnic diversities in their calculations makes it so much more comprehendible to today's observer! Everyone uses something that's already there rather than taking the adequate time to put something together from scratch!
