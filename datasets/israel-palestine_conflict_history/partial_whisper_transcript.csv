1,Bno1m1zhIWs," NARRATOR: Israel. It's the only Jewish
nation in the world, and it didn't officially
exist until 1948. But many people associate
Israel with its ongoing conflict with Palestine. A violent dispute over
land, political control, and resources. To understand why, we have to
look back a few thousand years. Both Jews and Muslims have
strong religious and cultural ties to the region
dating back about 4,000 years to Abraham
considered the father of the two religions. According to the Old Testament,
God told Abraham and his people to settle in a
land called Canaan, which is in the approximate
region of modern day Israel. In 1,000 BCE King
Saul established the Israelite monarchy, which
continued under King David and his son, Solomon who
built the first Jewish temple in Jerusalem. This historical legacy became
part of the Jewish claim to the land of Israel. The land would continue
to be conquered and ruled by various groups, including
Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Egyptians,
Fatimids, Seljuks, Crusaders, Mamluks,
and the Ottomans, who called the region Palestine. It would become
home to many sites considered sacred by Jews,
Muslims, and Christians alike. During these
transitions Jews were forced to flee the area
creating a diaspora, dispersion of people from their homeland. But in Europe, the Jewish
diaspora also faced oppression and persecution. So in the 1880s
many Jewish people started emigrating back to
the promised land in Ottoman controlled Palestine. By 1914 there were more than
75,000 Jews in the area. After World War I, Great Britain
took control of modern day Israel, Palestine, and
Jordan from the Ottomans. In 1922 the League of Nations
approved a British declaration that promised a national
home for the Jewish people in Palestine, but it would
be more than two decades before that promise
was fulfilled. In 1939 World War II broke out. More than 6 million Jews were
murdered in the Holocaust with millions more displaced. In 1947 after the war was
over, the United Nations decided to partition
Palestine into two countries, the Jewish
state of Israel and the Arab state of Palestine. Israel agreed to the partition
and borders were drawn for two states, but many Arab residents
thought the partition unfairly favored the Jewish population. Violence soon broke out. On May 14th, 1948
the state of Israel was established With
David Ben-Gurion as it's prime minister. Almost immediately
the Arab League, a group of surrounding
Arab countries, rejected the partition
and attacked. Israel fought back and
after more than nine months of conflict, it's
armed forces occupied much of the land
designated to become the Arab state of Palestine. Egypt took control
of the Gaza Strip. Jordan, then called Transjordan,
took control of the West Bank. The original plan for a
Palestinian state was scrapped. This historic event was a
victory for many Jewish people, but approximately 720,000
Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes, many taking
refuge in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. This war would be
remembered in Hebrew as the War of Independence and
in Arabic as The Catastrophe. Tension between Jews and
Arab Muslims in the region would continue for decades. Fighting between Israel
and its Arab neighbors continued on and off
for the next 60 years. In 1964 the Palestine
Liberation Organization formed to consolidate
the power of many small Palestinian groups. In the 1967 six-day war
Israel defeated the armies of Egypt, Syria, and
Jordan, and gained control of significant territory. In 1987 following an incident
with the Israeli defense forces that left four
Palestinian refugees dead, Palestinian militia
led a violent uprising known as the First Intifada that
resulted in hundreds of deaths. After the First Intifada
Israel and the PLO created a timetable for
peace, the Oslo Accords. Further peace talks in
2000 proved unsuccessful when agreements
could not be reached on issues like the
status of Jerusalem, the rights of refugees, and
increased Jewish settlements in Palestinian lands. Later that year
Ariel Sharon, who would become Israel's
prime minister, visited the Temple Mount,
home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. An act many Palestinians
found offensive. Violent protests,
riots, attacks, and suicide bombings broke out. This period of violence
called the Second Intifada lasted nearly five
years and marked the end of any peace that had
come from the Oslo Accords. The violence ended in 2005
when Israel withdrew from Gaza. In 2006, a militant Sunni
Islamist group, Hamas, won the Palestinian
legislative elections. Many countries consider Hamas
a terrorist group because of their methods, such as
carrying out suicide bombings, and calling for the
destruction of Israel. Hamas and Israel continued
to clash violently. In 2017, Hamas called
for the formation of a Palestinian state
using the 1967 borders, but it did not formally
recognize Israel as a state. So Israel did not accept. Today, Palestine continues
to fight for statehood. The conflict is
further complicated by Israelis who continue
to settle in the West Bank. Several countries
have pushed for peace agreements in recent
years, and many suggest a two state solution. Though a peaceful solution
has yet to be achieved, the region remains a
place of significance for people of many ethnic
and religious backgrounds."," NARRATOR: Israel. It's the only Jewish

Arabs who obviously would be displaced from a territory that they had inhabited for centuries opposed the Bal for declaration the British could not totally ignore them for they had held the British against the Ottomans in the first world war as well so the British limited Jewish immigration trying to appease both sides by the 193s Arabs and Jewish settlers had begun fighting openly in Palestine the tragedy of Jews and Judaism reached an unbelievable apotheosis during the second world war when the German Nazis under Hitler designed a horrific unimaginable plan to kill every Jew in their domain in what is now known as the Holocaust Jews were was sent to concentration camps where they were enslaved starved and gassed to death it was beyond belief that human beings could sing to such depraved barbarism at the end of the second world war the urge to create a Homeland for Jews acquired a moral momentum when Jewish settlers discovered that the British were still reluctant to leave

3,iRYZjOuUnlU," One of the biggest myths about the Israel-Palestine
conflict is that it's been going on for centuries, that this is all about ancient religious hatreds. In fact, while religion is involved, the conflict
is mostly about two groups of people who claim the same land. And it really only goes back about a century,
to the early 1900s. Around then, the region
along the eastern Mediterranean we now call Israel-Palestine had been under Ottoman rule
for centuries. It was religiously diverse, including mostly
Muslims and Christians but also a small number of Jews, who lived generally in peace. And it was changing in two important ways. First, more people in the region were developing
a sense of being not just ethnic Arabs but Palestinians, a distinct
national identity. At the same time, not so far away in Europe,
more Jews were joining a movement called Zionism, which said that Judaism was not just a religion
but a nationality, one that deserved a nation of its own. And after centuries of persecution, many believed
a Jewish state was their only way of safety. And they saw their historic homeland in the Middle
East as their best hope for establishing it. In the first decades of the 20th century, tens of thousands of European Jews moved there. After World War One, the Ottoman Empire collapsed,
and the British and French Empires carved up the Middle East, with the British taking
control of a region it called the British Mandate for Palestine. At first, the British allowed Jewish immigration. But as more Jews arrived, settling into farming
communes, tension between Jews and Arabs grew. Both sides committed acts of violence. And by the 1930s, the British began limiting Jewish
immigration.  In response,  Jewish militias formed to fight both the local Arabs and to resist British rule. Then came the Holocaust, leading many more
Jews to flee Europe for British Palestine, and galvanizing much of the world in support
of a Jewish state. In 1947, as sectarian violence between Arabs and Jews there grew, the United Nations approved a plan
to divide British Palestine into two separate states: one for Jews, Israel, and one for
Arabs, Palestine. The city of Jerusalem, where Jews, Muslims, and Christians all have have holy sites, it was to become a special international zone.   The plan was meant to give Jews a state, to
establish Palestinian independence, and to end the sectarian violence that the British
could no longer control. The Jews accepted the plan and declared independence as Israel. But Arabs throughout the region saw the UN plan as just more European colonialism trying to steal their land. Many of the Arab states, who had just recently
won independence themselves, declared war on Israel in an effort to establish a unified Arab Palestine where all of British Palestine had been. The new state of Israel won the war. But in
the process, they pushed well past their borders under the UN plan, taking the western half
of Jerusalem and much of the land that was to have been part of Palestine. They also expelled huge numbers of Palestinians
from their homes, creating a massive refugee population whose descendants today number
about 7 million. At the end of the war, Israel controlled all
of the territory except for Gaza, which Egypt controlled, and the West Bank, named because
it's west of the Jordan River, which Jordan controlled. This was the beginning of the decades-long
Arab-Israeli conflict. During this period, many Jews in Arab-majority
countries fled or were expelled, arriving in Israel. Then something happened that transformed the
conflict. In 1967, Israel and the neighboring Arab states fought another war. When it ended, Israel had seized the Golan
Heights from Syria, the West Bank from Jordan, and both Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula from
Egypt. Israel was now occupying the Palestinian territories,
including all of Jerusalem and its holy sites. This left Israel responsible for governing
the Palestinians – a people it had fought for decades. In 1978 Israel and Egypt signed the US-brokered
Camp David Accords and shortly after that, Israel gave Sanai back to Egypt as part of
a peace treaty. At the time this was hugely controversial
in the Arab world. Egypt President Anwar Sadat was assassinated
in part because of outrage against it. But it marked the beginning of the end of
the wider Arab-Israeli conflict. Over the next few decades, the other Arab
states gradually made peace with Israel, even if they never signed formal peace treaties. But Israel's military was still occupying
the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza, and this was when the conflict became
an Israeli-Palestinian struggle. The Palestinian Liberation Organization, which
had formed in the 1960s to seek a Palestinian state, fought against Israel, including through
acts of terrorism. Initially, the PLO claimed all of what had
been British Palestine, meaning it wanted to end the state of Israel entirely. Fighting between Israel and the PLO went on
for years, even including a 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon to kick the group out of Beirut. The PLO later said it would accept dividing
the land between Israel and Palestine, but the conflict continued. As all of this was happening, something dramatic
was changing in the Israel-occupied Palestinian territories: Israelis were moving in. These people are called settlers, and they
made their homes in the West Bank and Gaza whether Palestinians wanted them or not. Some moved for religious reasons, some because
they want to claim the land for Israel, and some just because housing is cheap — and
often subsidized by the Israeli government. Some settlements are cities with thousands
of people; others are small communities deep into the West Bank The settlers are followed by soldiers to guard
them, and the growing settlements force Palestinians off of their land and divide communities. Short-term, they make the occupation much
more painful for Palestinians. Long-term, by dividing up Palestinian land,
they make it much more difficult for the Palestinians to ever have an independent state. Today there are several hundred thousand settlers
in occupied territory even though the international community considers them illegal. By the late 1980s, Palestinian frustration
exploded into the Intifada,  which is the the Arabic word for uprising. It began with mostly protests and boycotts
but soon became violent, and Israel responded with heavy force. A couple hundred Israelis and over a thousand
Palestinians died in the first Intifada. Around the same time, a group of Palestinians
in Gaza, who consider the PLO too secular and too compromise-minded, created Hamas, a violent
extremist group dedicated to Israel's destruction. By the early 1990s, it's clear that Israelis
and Palestinians have to make peace, and leaders from both sides sign the Oslo Accords. This is meant to be the big, first step toward
Israel maybe someday withdrawing from the Palestinian territories, and allowing an independent Palestine. The Oslo Accords establish the Palestinian
Authority, allowing Palestinians a little bit of freedom to govern themselves in certain areas. Hard-liners on both sides opposed the Oslo
accords. Members of Hamas launch suicide bombings to try to sabotage the process. The Israeli right protests peace talks, with
ralliers calling Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin a traitor and a Nazi. Not long after Rabin signs the second round
of Oslo Accords, a far-right Israeli shoots him to death in Tel Aviv. This violence showed how the extremists on
both sides can use violence to derail peace, and keep a permanent conflict going as they
seek the other side's total destruction. That's a dynamic that's been around ever since. Negotiations meant to hammer out the final
details on peace drag on for years, and a big Camp David Summit in 2000 comes up empty. Palestinians come to believe that peace isn't coming, and rise up in a Second
Intifada, this one much more violent than the first. By the time it wound down a few years later, about 1,000
Israelis and 3,200 Palestinians had died. The Second Intifada really changes the conflict.
Israelis become much more skeptical that Palestinians will ever accept peace, or that it's even worth trying. Israeli politics shift right, and the country
builds walls and checkpoints to control Palestinians' movements. They're not really trying to solve the conflict
anymore, just manage it. The Palestinians are left feeling like negotiating
didn't work and violence didn't work, that they're stuck under an ever-growing occupation
with no future as a people. That year, Israel withdraws from Gaza. Hamas
gains power but splits from the Palestinian Authority in a short civil war, dividing Gaza
from the West Bank. Israel puts Gaza under a suffocating blockade,
and unemployment rises to 40%. This is the state of the conflict as we know
it today. It’s relatively new, and it’s
unbearable for Palestinians. In the West Bank, more and more settlements
are smothering Palestinians, who often respond with protests and sometimes with violence,
though most just want normal lives. In Gaza, Hamas and other violent groups have
periodic wars with Israel. The fighting overwhelmingly kills Palestinians,
including lots of civilians. In Israel itself, most people have become
apathetic, and for the most part the occupation keeps the conflict relatively removed from
their daily lives, with moments of brief but horrible violence. There's little political will for peace. No one really knows where the conflict goes
from here. Maybe a Third Intifada. Maybe the Palestinian
Authority collapses. But everyone agrees that things, as they are now, can't 
last much longer -- that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians is too unstable to last, and that, unless something dramatic changes, whatever comes next will be much worse."," One of the biggest myths about the Israel-Palestine
conflict is that it's been going on for centuries, that this is all about ancient religious hatreds. In fact, while religion is involved, the conflict
is mostly about two groups of people who claim the same land. And it really only goes back about a century,
to the early 1900s. Around then, the region
along the eastern Mediterranean we now call Israel-Palestine had been under Ottoman rule
for centuries. It was religiously diverse, including mostly
Muslims and Christians but also a small number of Jews, who lived generally in peace. And it was changing in two important ways. First, more people in the region were developing
a sense of being not just ethnic Arabs but Palestinians, a distinct
national identity. At the same time, not so far away in Europe,
more Jews were joining a movement called Zionism, which said that Judaism was not just a religion
but a nationality, one that deserved a nation of its own. And after centuries of persecution, many believed
a Jewish state was their only way of safety. And they saw their historic homeland in the Middle
East as their best hope for establishing it. In the first decades of the 20th century, tens of thousands of European Jews moved there. After World War One, the Ottoman Empire collapsed,
and the British and French Empires carved up the Middle East, with the British taking
control of a region it called the British Mandate for Palestine. At first, the British allowed Jewish immigration. But as more Jews arrived, settling into farming
communes, tension between Jews and Arabs grew. Both sides committed acts of violence. And by the 1930s, the British began limiting Jewish
immigration.  In response,  Jewish militias formed to fight both the local Arabs and to resist British rule. Then came the Holocaust, leading many more
Jews to flee Europe for British Palestine, and galvanizing much of the world in support
of a Jewish state. In 1947, as sectarian violence between Arabs and Jews there grew, the United Nations approved a plan

4,1wo2TLlMhiw," Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today, we're going to talk about Israel and Palestine, hopefully, without a flame war. Yeah, yeah big ask, Mr. Green, I mean, that fight goes back thousands and thousands of years. Except, thousands of years ago... there wasn't an Islam yet, so, yeah, no. Also, let me submit that very little of this conflict between Israel and Palestine over the last several decades has been about, like, theological differences between Islam and Judaism. No one's arguing about whether the most important prophets descended from Abraham's son Isaac, or his son Ishmael, right? It's not about whether to fast during Yom Kippur or Ramadan. It's about land. Portraying the conflict as eternal or as religious makes it feel intractable in a way that frankly, it isn't. So instead, let's begin as most historians do in the late 19th century. And instead of talking about religion, let's follow the lead of historians like James Gelvin and discuss competing nationalisms. [Theme Music] Ok, so in the late 19th century, the Ottoman Empire ruled over what we now know as Palestine. The population there, according to Ottoman records from 1878, was 87% Muslim, 10% Christian and 3% Jewish. Everybody spoke Arabic as the daily language, and in Jerusalem the religious populations were roughly equal. To give you a sense of life in Ottoman Palestine, an Arab Orthodox Christian musician named Wasif Jawhariyyeh grew up in Jerusalem in the first decade of the 20th century learning the Quran in school and celebrating both Passover and Eid with his Jewish and Muslim neighbors. Ottoman Palestine was, in short, a place in which people of different religious faiths lived peacefully together. Alright, let's go to the Thought Bubble. The late 19th century was the Golden Age of nationalism in Europe, and no place was crazier than the Hapsburg Austro-Hungarian Empire in which at least 10 different nations all wanted their own state. And in that hyper-nationalistic empire lived a Jewish journalist named Theodor Herzl who had hoped that Jews could assimilate into European nations but soon became convinced that the Jewish people needed to leave Europe and settle in their own state. The concept of Jewish nationalism came to be known as Zionism. It's important to keep in mind that most Zionists were secular Jews, so they imagined Israel as a state for Jews more than a Jewish state. In 1917, the British government, hoping to gain the support of Jewish people, issued the Balfour Declaration, promising, quote, ""The establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people,"" a bold promise considering that Palestine was still technically Ottoman, as they hadn't yet lost World War One. Of course, they would soon, but it turned out that the British were overpromisers when it came to Palestine, because a year before the Balfour Declaration, the British had secretly promised the French that they would divide up the Arab territories and the Brits would keep Palestine. Furthermore, in 1915, other British officials had promised the ruler of Mecca, Sharif Hussein, that he would rule over an Arab state including Palestine if he led an Arab revolt against Ottoman rule,
which Hussein promptly did, so basically the Brits had promised Palestine to the Meccans, to themselves, and to the Zionists. What could go wrong? Thanks, Thought Bubble. So shortly after the end of the war, the British established a colony in Palestine with the idea that they'd rule until the Palestinians were ready to govern themselves, at which point the people living in Palestine were like, ""Well, now seems good,"" and the British were like, ""Yeah, but maybe not just yet."" Meanwhile, the British established separate institutions for Christians, Jews, and Muslims, making it difficult for Palestinian Christians and Muslims to cooperate and easier for the British to, quote, ""divide and rule"" the inhabitants of Palestine. Again, what could go wrong? Meanwhile, the British did attempt to honor the Balfour Declaration's promise to, quote, ""facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions."" Between 1920 and 1939, the Jewish population of Palestine increased by over 320,000 people. In fact, by 1938, Jews were just under 30% of the population of Palestine. And the growing Jewish population focused on purchasing land from absentee non-Palestinian Arab landowners and then evicting Palestinian farmers who were living and working there. By controlling both the land and the labor, they hoped to establish a more secure community within Palestine, but of course, these practices heightened tensions between Jewish people and Arab Palestinians between the 1920s and the 1930s. Along the way, Palestinian Arabs began to think of themselves as the Palestinian nation, and that growing sense of nationalism erupted in 1936, when the Palestinians revolted against the British. With the help of Jewish militias, the British brutally suppressed the Palestinian revolt, but in the aftermath, the British issued a white paper, limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine, and calling for the establishment of a joint Arab and Jewish state in Palestine within ten years. This managed to leave no one happy. The Zionists were angry at Britain for limiting Jewish immigration at a time when Jews particularly needed to leave Europe, and the Arab Palestinians were unhappy about the prospect of waiting ten years for a state. And then came World War II, which was actually quite a peaceful time in Palestine. But then it ended, and tensions resumed, and the British realized that colonies like Palestine were far more trouble than they were worth, so they handed the issue of Palestine over to the newly created United Nations. They were like, ""Oh hey there, United Nations! For your first problem..."" So in November of 1947, the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into separate Palestinian and Jewish states. The Partition Plan called for two states roughly equal in size, but the borders looked like a jigsaw puzzle. I mean, you do not look at this map and think, ""Yeah, that's gonna work!"" Sure enough, it didn't, and soon after the plan was announced, the cleverly named 1948 Arab-Israeli War broke out, with Israel on the one side and the Palestinians and many Arab states on the other. The Israelis won, and when an armistice was signed in 1949, Israel occupied a third more land than they would have had under the UN proposal. Meanwhile, Jordan controlled and later annexed the West Bank and the old city of Jerusalem, and Egypt controlled the Gaza strip. Over 700,000 Palestinians fled their homes and became refugees in the surrounding Arab countries. To Israelis, this was was the beginning of their nation; to the Palestinians, it was the nakba, the catastrophe, as they became stateless. Over the next 18 years, nothing changed territorially, and then, in 1967, Israel and several Arab states went to war again. It was called the Six-Days War because -- get this -- it lasted six days. Israel won, and then gained control over the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Heights. So the 1947 proposal looked like this; by 1967, things looked like this. Then the UN passed Resolution 242 - man, they are good at naming resolutions! - which outlined a basic framework for achieving peace, including Israel withdrawing from the territory acquired in the war, and all participants recognizing the rights of both a Palestinian and an Israeli state to exist. This of course did not happen. After the war, the broader Israeli-Arab conflict morphed into a more specific Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and this is a nice moment to note that not all Muslims are Arabs, not all Arabs are Palestinians, and not all Palestinians are Muslims. Like, there's a significant Christian minority of Palestinians, for instance. Palestinian is a word used to describe the ethnic identity of those who have historically lived in Palestine. There were, for instance, lots of Christians in the Palestinian Liberation Organization, or PLO, formed in 1964 and led by Yasser Arafat. The PLO oversaw guerrilla groups that attacked civilians, but also used nonviolent approaches to try to achieve a Palestinian state, and meanwhile, the Israeli government began to establish Jewish settlements in what had been Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. There are now over 350,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, and over 200,000 in East Jerusalem, and these settlements are illegal, according to international law, but Israel counters by saying that they aren't really illegal because Palestine isn't really a state. By the late 1980s, Palestinians launched the first intifada, which literally means ""shaking off."" And this began with, like, boycotts of Israeli products and services and refusing to pay Israeli taxes, but when the Israeli armed forces cracked down on protesters, violence ensued. And the first intifada also saw the founding of Hamas, which launched the first suicide bombing against Israel in 1993. Hamas gained support partly because of its militancy, but mostly because of its social welfare projects in Gaza. It built and staffed schools, mosques, and clinics. The most important legacy of the First Intifada was the emergence of peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis. This led to the Oslo Accords,
and the peace process, based on our old friend, United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. But there were a lot of issues to resolve - I mean, putting aside the question of, like, how to make two states that don't look like a jigsaw puzzle, there was the question of the Jewish settlement, and the right for Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to Palestine. Water rights, which are a big deal in that part of the world, and so on. It's very complicated! So then came the Clinton talks. Oh, it's time for the Open Letter! But first, let's see what's inside of the globe. Oh, look! It's a collection of philandering American presidents. An Open Letter to Bill Clinton: Hey, Bill, so your talks probably came closer than any other time in recent history to an actual peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was willing to give up more land currently claimed by Israel than at any other time in the past; even Yasser Arafat was surprised. Although not all the questions got addressed, you were definitely closing in on something. But in the end, it didn't happen, and since then, not to criticize you, things have gotten kind of worse and worse and worse. Worst of all, that was your big legacy moment. Now all you've got is the conflict in Northern Ireland getting resolved while you were president. In short, it could have been amazing, but instead it was kind of... neeeeh. Kind of like your presidency, actually! At least you always have those vodkas-soaked hugs with Boris Yeltsin to look back on. Best Wishes, John Green. So the Clinton talks failed; Ehud Barak's government was undermined, and then, in September of 2000, Prime Minister candidate Ariel Sharon led a group of 1,000 armed guards to the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. To Muslims, this is known as the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and it's the third-holiest site in Islam, behind only the Kaaba in Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. And it's the holiest site in Judaism, so in short, it's a pretty touchy place to march to with a thousand armed guards. So the events sparked a massive protest, which eventually led to the much more violent Second Intifada, in which more than three thousand Palestinians and one thousand Israelis were eventually killed. In 2002, the Israelis, claiming to act in defense of civilians, began construction of a wall around the West Bank, but instead of following the borders established after the 1967 War, the barrier was built to include many Israeli settlements on the Israeli side. To Israelis, that was about self-defense; to Palestinians, it was an illegal land grab. Then, in 2005, Yasser Arafat died, and in an election shortly thereafter, Hamas won a majority of the parliamentary seats. Since then, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have sort of divided how to govern Palestine, and it's also sort of been poorly governed. In the past ten years, Hamas has frequently launched rocket attacks into Israel; Israel has responded with extended and extremely violent invasions of Palestinian territory that have seen thousands of Palestinians killed, many of them militants, but also many not. Both parties claim to be responding to the provocations of the other, but much of the conflict reflects the consistent failure on all sides to understand the legitimacy of the other's narrative. To Palestine, the Palestinian people have been denied a state not just since the formation of Israel, but also for decades before that, and now they live under what amounts to a military occupation. And that's all true. To Israel, the Jewish people clearly need a homeland, which the United Nations established. And they certainly aren't the first nation state to consolidate and increase their territory via military victory. And they need to protect their nation against the many active threats made against them by their neighbors. That's also true! It's important to understand the internal logic of these competing nationalist visions. For both Zionists and Palestinian national visions to eventually work, it's necessary to understand the right of each to exist and the legitimacy of each's historical narrative. But these problems aren't thousands of years old, and they aren't intractable. They emerged in the British Mandatory Period. But let's hope that by understanding this isn't an endless religious war, that we might be closer to seeing its end. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

Between 1920 and 1939, the Jewish population of Palestine increased by over 320,000 people. In fact, by 1938, Jews were just under 30% of the population of Palestine. And the growing Jewish population focused on purchasing land from absentee non-Palestinian Arab landowners and then evicting Palestinian farmers who were living and working there. By controlling both the land and the labor, they hoped to establish a more secure community within Palestine, but of course, these practices heightened tensions between Jewish people and Arab Palestinians between the 1920s and the 1930s. Along the way, Palestinian Arabs began to think of themselves as the Palestinian nation, and that growing sense of nationalism erupted in 1936, when the Palestinians revolted against the British. With the help of Jewish militias, the British brutally suppressed the Palestinian revolt, but in the aftermath, the British issued a white paper, limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine, and calling for the establishment of a joint Arab and Jewish state in Palestine within ten years. This managed to leave no one happy. The Zionists were angry at Britain for limiting Jewish immigration at a time when Jews particularly needed to leave Europe, and the Arab Palestinians were unhappy about the prospect of waiting ten years for a state. And then came World War II, which was actually quite a peaceful time in Palestine. But then it ended, and tensions resumed, and the British realized that colonies like Palestine were far more trouble than they were worth, so they handed the issue of Palestine over to the newly created United Nations. They were like, ""Oh hey there, United Nations! For your first problem..."" So in November of 1947, the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into separate Palestinian and Jewish states. The Partition Plan called for two states roughly equal in size, but the borders looked like a jigsaw puzzle. I mean, you do not look at this map and think, ""Yeah, that's gonna work!"" Sure enough, it didn't, and soon after the plan was announced, the cleverly named 1948 Arab-Israeli War broke out, with Israel on the one side and the Palestinians and many Arab states on the other. The Israelis won, and when an armistice was signed in 1949, Israel occupied a third more land than they would have had under the UN proposal. Meanwhile, Jordan controlled and later annexed the West Bank and the old city of Jerusalem, and Egypt controlled the Gaza strip. Over 700,000 Palestinians fled their homes and became refugees in the surrounding Arab countries. To Israelis, this was was the beginning of their nation; to the Palestinians, it was the nakba, the catastrophe, as they became stateless. Over the next 18 years, nothing changed territorially, and then, in 1967, Israel and several Arab states went to war again. It was called the Six-Days War because -- get this -- it lasted six days. Israel won, and then gained control over the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Heights. So the 1947 proposal looked like this; by 1967, things looked like this. Then the UN passed Resolution 242 - man, they are good at naming resolutions! - which outlined a basic framework for achieving peace, including Israel withdrawing from the territory acquired in the war, and all participants recognizing the rights of both a Palestinian and an Israeli state to exist. This of course did not happen. After the war, the broader Israeli-Arab conflict morphed into a more specific Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and this is a nice moment to note that not all Muslims are Arabs, not all Arabs are Palestinians, and not all Palestinians are Muslims. Like, there's a significant Christian minority of Palestinians, for instance. Palestinian is a word used to describe the ethnic identity of those who have historically lived in Palestine. There were, for instance, lots of Christians in the Palestinian Liberation Organization, or PLO, formed in 1964 and led by Yasser Arafat. The PLO oversaw guerrilla groups that attacked civilians, but also used nonviolent approaches to try to achieve a Palestinian state, and meanwhile, the Israeli government began to establish Jewish settlements in what had been Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. There are now over 350,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, and over 200,000 in East Jerusalem, and these settlements are illegal, according to international law, but Israel counters by saying that they aren't really illegal because Palestine isn't really a state. By the late 1980s, Palestinians launched the first intifada, which literally means ""shaking off."" And this began with, like, boycotts of Israeli products and services and refusing to pay Israeli taxes, but when the Israeli armed forces cracked down on protesters, violence ensued. And the first intifada also saw the founding of Hamas, which launched the first suicide bombing against Israel in 1993. Hamas gained support partly because of its militancy, but mostly because of its social welfare projects in Gaza. It built and staffed schools, mosques, and clinics. The most important legacy of the First Intifada was the emergence of peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis. This led to the Oslo Accords,
and the peace process, based on our old friend, United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. But there were a lot of issues to resolve - I mean, putting aside the question of, like, how to make two states that don't look like a jigsaw puzzle, there was the question of the Jewish settlement, and the right for Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to Palestine. Water rights, which are a big deal in that part of the world, and so on. It's very complicated! So then came the Clinton talks. Oh, it's time for the Open Letter! But first, let's see what's inside of the globe. Oh, look! It's a collection of philandering American presidents. An Open Letter to Bill Clinton: Hey, Bill, so your talks probably came closer than any other time in recent history to an actual peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was willing to give up more land currently claimed by Israel than at any other time in the past; even Yasser Arafat was surprised. Although not all the questions got addressed, you were definitely closing in on something. But in the end, it didn't happen, and since then, not to criticize you, things have gotten kind of worse and worse and worse. Worst of all, that was your big legacy moment. Now all you've got is the conflict in Northern Ireland getting resolved while you were president. In short, it could have been amazing, but instead it was kind of... neeeeh. Kind of like your presidency, actually! At least you always have those vodkas-soaked hugs with Boris Yeltsin to look back on. Best Wishes, John Green. So the Clinton talks failed; Ehud Barak's government was undermined, and then, in September of 2000, Prime Minister candidate Ariel Sharon led a group of 1,000 armed guards to the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. To Muslims, this is known as the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and it's the third-holiest site in Islam, behind only the Kaaba in Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. And it's the holiest site in Judaism, so in short, it's a pretty touchy place to march to with a thousand armed guards. So the events sparked a massive protest, which eventually led to the much more violent Second Intifada, in which more than three thousand Palestinians and one thousand Israelis were eventually killed. In 2002, the Israelis, claiming to act in defense of civilians, began construction of a wall around the West Bank, but instead of following the borders established after the 1967 War, the barrier was built to include many Israeli settlements on the Israeli side. To Israelis, that was about self-defense; to Palestinians, it was an illegal land grab. Then, in 2005, Yasser Arafat died, and in an election shortly thereafter, Hamas won a majority of the parliamentary seats. Since then, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have sort of divided how to govern Palestine, and it's also sort of been poorly governed. In the past ten years, Hamas has frequently launched rocket attacks into Israel; Israel has responded with extended and extremely violent invasions of Palestinian territory that have seen thousands of Palestinians killed, many of them militants, but also many not. Both parties claim to be responding to the provocations of the other, but much of the conflict reflects the consistent failure on all sides to understand the legitimacy of the other's narrative. To Palestine, the Palestinian people have been denied a state not just since the formation of Israel, but also for decades before that, and now they live under what amounts to a military occupation. And that's all true. To Israel, the Jewish people clearly need a homeland, which the United Nations established. And they certainly aren't the first nation state to consolidate and increase their territory via military victory. And they need to protect their nation against the many active threats made against them by their neighbors. That's also true! It's important to understand the internal logic of these competing nationalist visions. For both Zionists and Palestinian national visions to eventually work, it's necessary to understand the right of each to exist and the legitimacy of each's historical narrative. But these problems aren't thousands of years old, and they aren't intractable. They emerged in the British Mandatory Period. But let's hope that by understanding this isn't an endless religious war, that we might be closer to seeing its end. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

7,ZQUtT3pnw5Q," Decades of fighting thousands of deaths and it seems tensions are as high now as they ever were here's how Israelis and Palestinians got to where they are today even more Bloodshed in the late 19th century the Jewish communities of Europe faced widespread intolerance in Western Europe their peers discriminated against them and viewed them as socially inferior and in Eastern Europe Jews were often the victims of violent pams which were attacks by mobs that left many dead and wounded this anti-semitic attitude pushed European Jewish intellectuals and political activists to agitate for a solution to the growing Prejudice and this movement eventually became known as Zionism early Zionist thinkers like Theodore herel and Leon pinsker wrote tracks discussing solutions to combat anti-Semitism and they began to engage many of their peers herel and pinsker argued that the answer to the question of the Jews discrimination in Europe was the creation of a separate Jewish homeland where Jews could live in Peace and Freedom from the beginning the zionists were split on how to incorporate Judaism and Many religious Jews rejected and actively rallied against Zionism some of the earliest Zionist leaders saw the movement as more secular than religious arguing the Jewish Community was a dispersed nation and not just a religion beginning in the 1880s various Jewish groups began to encourage immigration to Palestine to escape the increasingly nasty Russian pagam in 1884 pinsker organized a conference in kavit Poland to merge these groups and the zionists together as the lovers of Zion and in 1897 the zionists officially named Palestine as the place for the Jewish homeland unfortunately no one told the Palestinian Arabs in 1878 before Zionist immigration began Palestine was overwhelmingly Arab according to the 1878 ottoman census there were only roughly 25,000 Jews compared with the more than 400,000 Arabs who made up over 85% of the population the initial Zionist immigration to Palestine occurred in several waves the first of which began in 1882 and saw the first Jews make it to Palestine from Russia by 1914 the Jewish population had more than doubled since 1878 to 60,000 but the Arab population had also increased to 731 th000 much of the land the zionists settled on was purchased by large Zionist and Jewish organizations like the Jewish National Fund which they bought from from absentee land owners and not the Arab peasantry themselves the land Acquisitions quickly brought the zionists into conflict with the Arab residents who were often working the land when it was sold and were subsequently kicked out in addition to tensions over land Zionism began to conflict with the burgeoning Arab nationalist movement among the Palestinians which sought to unite the larger Arab worlds together they saw the zionists and a Jewish State as impediments to that goal and relations between the two groups deteriorated quickly not yet a wash with violence this was probably the most peaceful time in the entire Israeli Palestinian conflict prior to World War I Palestine was officially part of the Ottoman Empire however by the end of the War the British had overtaken the Ottomans which they achieved with the help of the Arab people through the Arab Revolt yet at the same time the British cabinet began to drift into the Zionist political orbit as prominent zionists made inroads with British politicians by 1917 the zionists actions began to bear fruit and on November 2nd 1917 the British issued the now famous Balor declaration the Declaration was named after its author Arthur balfor the British foreign secretary who wrote his Majesty's government views with favor The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people while the letter also promised safeguards for the non-jewish communities in Palestine the Arabs officially rejected the Declaration the letter public published on November 2nd 1917 led to the creation of the state of Israel when the war ended Palestine entered the League of Nations mandate system which was created to help govern former ottoman territories until they formed sustainable governments of their own Britain officially gained control of mandatory Palestine in 1923 and it was clear the British prioritized creating a Jewish rather than an Arab State the formal mandate included the language of the Balor declaration and it recognized a Jewish agency to speak for the zionists while the Palestinian Arab executive was afforded no such Acceptance in addition many British officials were Pro Zionist and harbored racist feelings towards the Palestinian Arabs already the odds seem to be against the Palestinians and favoring the zionists from 1922 to 1936 the Jewish population in Palestine increased by over 300,000 to almost 30% of its total bringing zionists and Arabs into closer contact and leading to increased tensions in 1929 disturbances in Jerusalem at the Wailing Wall led to the deaths of 133 Jews and 116 Arabs however no appreciable change in British policy followed as they ignored recommendations to limit Zionist immigration with tensions brewing and the British seemingly favoring the zionists it was only a matter of time before the Powder Keg erupted unhappy with their ineffective leadership and increasing Zionist immigration the Arabs staged a large scale strike and Revolt from 1936 to 1939 disturbances began in April when Arabs murdered a Jewish bus passenger and soon a local strike morphed into a nationwide Palestinian movement there were violent attacks on both sides leaving 1,000 Arabs and 80 Jews dead within 6 months from October 1936 until July 1937 the strike was on hold along with the violence and the British sent in an investigative commission yet when the commission recommended a SE separate Jewish and Palestinian State both sides rejected it during the renewed Revolt Palestinians murdered Jewish settlers and began terrorizing the countryside with armed bands hoping to end the Zionist experiment in their Homeland the Revolt conclusively failed and the British Army and Zionist paramilitaries finally put down the disorder in March 1939 by then there were already 5,600 dead a little over half of whom were Arab Palestine was crumbling at the seams following the ARA Revolt of 1936 to 1939 Palestine was in complete shambles during the uprising the British dissolved the Palestinian leadership and deported most of its members leaving much of the movement in the hands of Rebel bands and the peasantry the Revolt had failed in its primary goal of removing the British and their support for the zionists claims to occupation but the British did moderate their policies towards Palestine afterward after the uprising the British announced the white paper which was a complete break from their previous policies it repudiated the idea that Palestine was meant to be a Jewish State restricted Jewish immigration to 15,000 a year and stopped certain land transfers from Arabs to Jews the British issued the white paper just as the Holocaust was beginning leaving the Jewish Community incredibly upset and disenchanted when fighting broke out in the Middle East during the second world war however it was zionists and not Arabs who fought alongside the British while the Zionist paramilitaries gained Munitions and valuable combat experience fighting with the BR British the Arabs were afforded no such opportunity after the war the zionists were determined to remove the British from authority over Palestine and declare independence they lashed out violently through acts of sabotage and Terror such as the bombing of the british's HQ at the King David hotel in 1946 which killed 41 once again Palestine was engulfed in turmoil and bloodshed by 1947 palestine's situation had deteriorated completely and the British needed an exit by then the League of Nations was defunct and had been replaced by the United Nations in February the British presented the Palestine question to the UN however reaching a satisfying answer was far from Easy by the end of 1946 the population stood at roughly 1.84 million inhabitants with only 33% being Jewish and 58% being Muslim Arab in addition even after Decades of land transfers the zionists only controlled 6% of the land in Palestine while on the ground the Arabs seem to have the stronger position at the UN it was a different story The zionists effectively mobilized influential American supporters to pressure un delegates to vote favorably for them in contrast the Palestinian leadership had been in Exile since the failure of the Arab Revolt leaving them largely without close representation on behalf of the Palestinians spoke the leaders of the surrounding Arab states but they were more concerned with appearing to care rather than actually creating a Palestinian state in November 1947 the UN issued resolution 181 but it was a solution beset with problems un 181 recommended Palestine be partitioned into both Jewish and Arab states which was anathema to the Palestinians who controlled most of the land that was earmarked for the zionists assured by the surrounding Arab states that they would back them militarily the Palestinians rejected un1 181 out of hand while the zionists supported it in late 1947 as the British withdrew and the United Nations stood by Palestine devolved into hellish violence within 24 hours of the un's announcement of their partition plan Arabs began attacking and shooting at Jews in hia and Tel Aviv and fighting soon erupted between them both sides targeted civilians including bombing public areas no one was safe many of the Zionist paramilitaries were experienced and well-coordinated and they were far superior in combat compared to the less organized Palestinian resistance by the spring of 1948 8 things had largely shifted to the zionists punctuated by atrocities against civilians like the shocking Zionist massacre at Deer yine which left over 100 Arab villagers dead the Palestinian resistance began to crumble on May 15th 1948 Israel formally declared independence though this hardly ended the Bloodshed instead the Arab countries of Egypt Syria Lebanon Iraq and trans Jordan invaded Israel intending to evict the zionists in favor of the Palestinian Arabs however the Israelis had a numerical superiority of forces and a strong determination to win and they threw back the invading armies in a stunning Victory they were a highly prepared uh highly dedicated well-armed fighting force when it was all over in July 1949 Israel controlled almost all of the territory designated for themselves and Palestine according to un1 181 except for the Gaza Strip near Egypt and the West Bank including Old Jerusalem known in Israel as the war of independence the Palestinians have a different name Al nakba or the catastrophy perhaps the worst Legacy resulting from the Palestinian Wars was the giant Refugee crisis left in its wake amidst the violence many Palestinian Arabs fled Israel to the nearby Arab countries of Syria Lebanon and trans Jordan as well as the Egyptian Gaza Strip it's widely estimated that at least 750,000 Palestinians were left displaced by the fighting Israel and the Palestinians were unable to agree on terms to readmit the refugees and as a result none were Israeli settlers quickly moved into former Palestinian homes and Villages now bereft of their former owners while the Palestinians languished and Scattered and squalid refugee camps even while the fighting was still ongoing thousands of refugees illegally made their way back into Israel often looking to reclaim pieces of their former lives like clothing or crops they had been attending to when the war broke out in 1956 when the Suz crisis broke out in Egypt things again turned dark in Gaza the Israelis invaded Egypt on October 29th and within days there were reports of several massacres of Palestinians in Gaza by 1964 the Palestinian situation was increasingly destitute but that year sparked a small Beacon of Hope for Palestinian Unity the creation of the Palestinian Liberation Organization or PLO the PLO was the first organization run by Palestinians for the benefit of their people and it offered them a semblance of optimism on June 5th 1967 Israel went to war with three neighboring aggressor states which would be known as the six- day war by the war's end on June 11th 1967 Israel had destroyed the Egyptian Syrian and trans Jordan armies and had gained the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza the West Bank and Jerusalem and even the Golden Heights from Syria in short it was a cataclysmic change for the Palestinians it meant even more displacement and hopelessness amidst the fighting around 380,000 refugees fled camps in the West Bank Gaza and Goen Heights to the surrounding Arab states in addition now occupying these areas Israel absorbed 1.5 million Palestinian refugees into their borders it was hardly a stable situation politically the collapse of the Arab armies during the fighting completely disenchanted the Palestinians with the wider Arab leadership after nearly two decades they were no closer to reclaiming their pre 1948 homes and the failures in June seemed to underscore the impossibility of them ever returning to make matters worse the Israelis began to create settlements in their newly conquered areas from Syria and in East Jerusalem in the West Bank at times evicting Arabs to make way for Israeli settlers this angered the Palestinians and caused International outrage late in 1967 the United Nations passed resolution 242 calling for Israel to leave the territories however ambiguous language allowed Israel to claim legal basis for the occupation which still exists today following the Six-Day War and the start of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories things declined even further for the Palestinian refugees the actions of many in the Israeli government like prime minister golden mayair who refused to acknowledge their existence only angered the Palestinians further feeling ignored on the world stage and confined to filthy and FedEd refugee camps a small minority of Palestinians began to violently lash out so of the worst attacks were the load airport massacre in 1972 which left 25 dead and 72 wounded and the kirat Shona Massacre in 1974 when Arab gunmen killed 18 including many women and children both of these attacks were carried out by the popular front for the liberation of Palestine the pflp a terrorist group based in Palestine at the 1972 Munich Olympics the Palestinian Affiliated terrorist group Black September kidnapped several members of the Israeli Olympic team team and in the ensuing struggle all 11 Israelis died at their hands causing International outrage in 1973 Israel was once again thrust into combat against its neighbors during the yam Kipper or Ramadan War which ended with important political consequences the Egyptians apparently have taken control of at least a portion of the East Bank of the suaz Israel defeated the Egyptians and syrians in the fighting and by the end of the fighting Israel was firmly aligned with the United States once again the Palestinians found themselves left out in the cold and the attacks by terrorist groups continued by the late 1970s the conflict in Israel was again beginning to bleed into the surrounding Arab states and in particular Lebanon and Egypt Lebanon was already in turmoil from an ongoing Civil War and it became a Haven for many militant PLO members following the 1967 6-day war by 1978 the pl's presence in Lebanon was becoming untenable for Israel as they launched deadly crossb border attacks in March a terrorist assault killed more than 40 people in Israel and left at least 70 wounded in response the Israeli Defense Forces or IDF invaded Lebanon which resulted in more than 300 PLO deaths and 12200 civilian deaths this caused 100,000 more civilians to flee in panic later that year the Egyptians Israelis and American President Jimmy Carter held peace negotiations at Camp David to discuss the future of the Sinai occupation but the PLO was not invited in 1979 the negotiations led to the camp David Accord and while Israel agreed to leave Sinai but not Gaza the question of the Palestinians was unaddressed leaving them completely ignored in 1982 the IDF once again entered Lebanon following the attempted assassination of an Israeli Diplomat in London they evicted 11,000 PLO from Beirut before leaving the city though they maintained a presence in southern Lebanon for years to come this again removed the Palestinian leader ERS ship from the Palestinian community and did nothing to quell the overall chaos and tension by 1987 the Palestinians had endured 20 years of occupation and 40 Years of displacement they were becoming increasingly marginalized and subjugated under Israeli occupation as the Israeli Defense Forces controlled and restricted nearly every aspect of their lives the Palestinians were also upset over the increased number of Israeli settlers moving into occupied territories and Israel's oppression of Palestinian political activists in late 1987 the Palestinians discontent finally boiled to the surface in what is known as the first inapa when IDF soldiers shot Palestinian protesters following a car accident in December both the West Bank and Gaza erupted with violence at the heart of the Palestinian struggle was a desire for National self-determination meaning the creation of a Palestinian State the inapa lasted until 1992 gradually becoming more and more violent at first the Palestinians through rocks and Molotov cocktails but soon guns and explosives entered the pictures as the idf's reprisals intensified which included shutting off water and electricity and destroying private property by 1991 there were more than 1,000 dead Palestinians over 37,000 more wounded and another 35,000 to 40,000 had been arrested politically the inata dramatically changed the territories a new militant terrorist group called Hamas formed in 1988 with the explicit purpose of replacing an Israeli state with a Palestinian one and they started carrying out attacks against civilians and IDF soldiers within the territories the Palestinian struggle had entered a new and much more violent phase and showed little progress for peace the first inapa had exposed deep Rifts within Israel not just from a refugee perspective but also among Israelis themselves the widespread violence and huge toll on the Palestinians put their plight front and center to the Israelis and some of them began to openly sympathize with the Palestinians this new attitude along with the election of a more socially liberal labor party combined to create the atmosphere for the first ever comprehensive Israeli Palestinian peace talks the peace process began with the 1991 Madrid conference which the US had pushed for as a solution to the conflict the Israelis met with a joint Jordanian Palestinian delegation in Madrid and public talks continued for a few years but they were not very productive however SE secret negotiations directly between the Palestinian Liberation Organization and Israel commenced and those eventually led to the Oslo one Accords in 1993 in September 1993 Israel the PLO the US and Russia officially signed the first of the Oslo Accords with Oslo 1 For the First Time The PLO and Israelis mutually recognized each other as legitimate Representatives the PLO agreed to publicly renounce terrorism and the Accords also laid out a plan for for future Palestinian self-government though not a full State in 1995 the Oslo 2 Accords were signed which gave the Palestinians slightly more autonomy and control and called for Israeli forces to withdraw from some occupied areas internationally expectations could not have been higher for peace in the Middle East but all parties would soon be sadly shaken to reality at first there was widespread optimism and hope that Oslo could lead to a stable framework for peace but both sides worked to undermine the Accords with tragic efficiency from the Palestinian perspective the Accords did little to alleviate their harsh living conditions their already precarious economic situation still declined the illegal settlements continued the new Palestinian Authority or PA was seen as corrupt and the goal of an actual State seemed just as far away in addition militant terrorist groups like Hamas actively worked to destroy the Accords through numerous terrorist attacks against the Israeli public from the Israeli perspective the Oslo Accords were supposed to guarantee peace from terrorism but Hamas shattered any illusion the PLO or PA could enforce peace measures and stop the bombings in addition the militant and terroristic factions of the Israelis committed their own atrocities such as when an Israeli settler killed 29 Palestinians at a mosque and hibron in 1994 or when they assassinated their own prime minister yitzak Rabin in 1995 in 1996 the Israelis elected Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister which was a symbolic end to the peace process started in Madrid as Netanyahu stopped implementing the Oslo agreements and began increasing the pace of settlements the US tried to salvage the peace process through the 1998 y River Accords but these two conclusively failed when the Oslo Accords collapsed in the late 1990s after years of acrimony many people likely felt that the Israeli Palestinian peace process was dead the peace talks briefly restarted in 2000 at Camp David but no Accord was ultimately reached with tensions already high over the breakdown of the peace process the actions of conservative Israeli politician Ariel Chiron in September 2000 set off a new wave of violence Chiron took 1,000 supporters and marched on the Temple mount in Jerusalem which also contains the sacred aloa mosque Chiron wanted to demonstrate Israeli power but his rhetoric and actions severely angered the Palestinians leading to Stone throwing and demonstrations in response the IDF began shooting and killing demonstrators and the aloa inata was underway peace talks later in the year once again broke down due to violence on the ground and in 2001 the Israelis elected Chiron as the new prime minister compared with the first the aloa inapa was much more violent and characterized by intensive bombing campaigns by Islamic terrorists Additionally the aloa inapa was also much less widespread and less organized among the Palestinians and it was also more costly by the summer of 2003 24 Palestinians and 780 Israelis died in the chaos after the violence of the aloa inata claimed thousands of lives the Israelis began new tactics in the occupied territories in 2005 the Israelis began disengagement or removing the illegal Jewish settlers from Palestinian territory by August the Gaza settlements were no more but the West Bank settlements were untouched even worse for the West Bank the Israelis began building massive barriers to separate the Jewish settlement from the Palestinians areas additionally they built them on Palestinian rather than Israeli land reducing the Palestinians territory even further in the 2006 West Bank elections the terrorist organization Hamas won a stunning Victory taking control for the first time in March 2006 Hamas formally took over the Palestinian Authority ushering in a new era for the West Bank with hamas's refusal to even recognize Israel's right to exist any potential peace talks between the Israelis and the PA were non-starters that summer Hamas and their political Rivals Al fatah began open Warfare in the West Bank characterized by rocket fire and explosive grenades Hamas was in control of Gaza by the following summer Rockets also made their way into Israel and Hamas launched raids that ended with the kidnapping of an Israeli soldier beginning in 2007 due to security concerns over Hamas Israel instituted a complete blockade of Gaza extending over the land sea and air from the moment Hamas took over the Palestinian Authority in 2006 and gained control of Gaza in 2007 it was obvious they were on a crash course with Israel in March 2008 Hamas sent hundreds of missiles over the Gaza border into Israel and the Israelis responded with a two-day assault that killed 116 Palestinians the Israelis launched a massive invasion of Gaza on January 3rrd 2009 after smashing Hamas with air strikes the week prior Israel claimed the attack was in response to Hamas continuing to fire Rockets into Israel and on the day of the invasion Hamas launched another 70 Rockets killing at least four after 3 weeks of warfare the death toll was 1200 Palestinians compared with just 13 Israelis and the Israelis called for a ceasefire Israel remained in Gaza until January 21st 2009 when they withdrew to the Gaza perimeter reports emerged that the Israelis had used white phosphorus during the fighting which could have constituted a war crime if used against civilians by the end more than 1300 Palestinians had died no one's coming to help us not able to stop ground it's very from 2012 to 2018 Gaza was permeated by sporadic violence between Hamas and Israel and thousands of civilians were caught up in the Bloodshed in November 2012 Israel re-entered Gaza for 8 days in response to more Hamas rocket fire into Israel resulting in over 150 dead Palestinians and five dead Israelis before a ceasefire could take effect in July 2014 Israel was back in Gaza this time after Israeli teenagers had been abducted and killed by Hamas in the West Bank the Israelis withdrew after another 1,881 Palestinians and 67 Israelis died in 2018 Gaza City was again a flame and a wash with violence as the Israelis killed at least 170 Palestinians between March and November with Hamas retaliating with rocket fire it was an endless cycle of violence and the civilians felt the brunt of the pain in the West Bank which was not under Hamas control things were also deteriorating the refugee crisis was as bad as ever and by 2021 the United Nations estimated there were at least 871 th000 registered refugees in the West Bank in addition Israeli settlements expanded causing the UN to issue resolution 2334 in 2016 designating them illegal When Donald Trump became the president of the United States in 200 17 it came after he extensively talked up Israel in his campaign in late 2017 Trump acknowledged Jerusalem as the capital and began working to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem which served to Anchor the Palestinians in 2020 Trump helped broker the Abraham Accords which called for Israel and the United Arab Emirates to establish normalized relations while also getting Israel to suspend annexing the occupied West Bank however Trump's actions did little to stop the viol on the ground in Gaza and the West Bank and the killings continued in May 2021 the Israelis evicted six families from a Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem which brought waves of protests in response to the protests Israel invaded killing 20 and leaving more than 300 injured the year 2022 was even more violent and in March Palestinian attacks killed 11 Israelis by the end of the year after numerous Israeli reprisals 166 Palestinians were dead in the West Bank alone much like 2022 ended for the occupied territories 2023 began largely the same way with Israeli raids into the West Bank by January 26th 2023 30 Palestinians were already dead following raids into Janine in search of Islamic Jihad terrorist group members that day Palestinians in Gaza fired rockets at Israel in retaliation and on January 27th a Palestinian gunman shot and killed seven Israeli settlers outside a synagogue near a West Bank Israeli settlement by June the Israelis were using helicopter gunships during their Janine raids resulting in even more Palestinian deaths as of June 19th 2023 the death toll for the year was already 130 Palestinians and 25 Israelis setting it up to be one of the worst years on record for both sides still nobody could have predicted what came next as the next escalation of the Israeli Palestinian conflict would be one of the most devastating in history the 2023 Hamas attacks on October 7th 2023 the Hamas terrorist organization viciously attacked Israel in one of the worst provocations in the history of the Israeli Palestinian conflict Hamas sent a barrage of rockets over the Gaza border into Israel and carried out a devastating ground attack throughout the southern part of the country within a day there were already 700 dead Israelis and the fighting was only beginning in response to the attack the Israelis immediately declared war on Hamas and began a counter offensive which claimed the lives of at least 1,500 and wounded more than 6,600 Palestinians in Gaza by October 13th in addition the Israelis also shut off the power and restricted supplies of food and Medicine by then the Israeli death toll had climbed to over 1,200 people with more than 3,000 wounded innocent people murdered wounded entire families taken hostage by Hamas some of hamas's most Sinister plans included taking hostages thought to be around one 150 many of these hostages were taken from the Nova Music Festival that was underway when the attack was launched and excruciating footage showed the militants murdering innocent civilians as they fled for their lives the true Devastation of the 2023 Hamas Terror attacks won't be known for years but it was the worst flare up in [Music] decades"," Decades of fighting thousands of deaths and it seems tensions are as high now as they ever were here's how Israelis and Palestinians got to where they are today even more Bloodshed in the late 19th century the Jewish communities of Europe faced widespread intolerance in Western Europe their peers discriminated against them and viewed them as socially inferior and in Eastern Europe Jews were often the victims of violent pams which were attacks by mobs that left many dead and wounded this anti-semitic attitude pushed European Jewish intellectuals and political activists to agitate for a solution to the growing Prejudice and this movement eventually became known as Zionism early Zionist thinkers like Theodore herel and Leon pinsker wrote tracks discussing solutions to combat anti-Semitism and they began to engage many of their peers herel and pinsker argued that the answer to the question of the Jews discrimination in Europe was the creation of a separate Jewish homeland where Jews could live in Peace and Freedom from the beginning the zionists were split on how to incorporate Judaism and Many religious Jews rejected and actively rallied against Zionism some of the earliest Zionist leaders saw the movement as more secular than religious arguing the Jewish Community was a dispersed nation and not just a religion beginning in the 1880s various Jewish groups began to encourage immigration to Palestine to escape the increasingly nasty Russian pagam in 1884 pinsker organized a conference in kavit Poland to merge these groups and the zionists together as the lovers of Zion and in 1897 the zionists officially named Palestine as the place for the Jewish homeland unfortunately no one told the Palestinian Arabs in 1878 before Zionist immigration began Palestine was overwhelmingly Arab according to the 1878 ottoman census there were only roughly 25,000 Jews compared with the more than 400,000 Arabs who made up over 85% of the population the initial Zionist immigration to Palestine occurred in several waves the first of which began in 1882 and saw the first Jews make it to Palestine from Russia by 1914 the Jewish population had more than doubled since 1878 to 60,000 but the Arab population had also increased to 731 th000 much of the land the zionists settled on was purchased by large Zionist and Jewish organizations like the Jewish National Fund which they bought from from absentee land owners and not the Arab peasantry themselves the land Acquisitions quickly brought the zionists into conflict with the Arab residents who were often working the land when it was sold and were subsequently kicked out in addition to tensions over land Zionism began to conflict with the burgeoning Arab nationalist movement among the Palestinians which sought to unite the larger Arab worlds together they saw the zionists and a Jewish State as impediments to that goal and relations between the two groups deteriorated quickly not yet a wash with violence this was probably the most peaceful time in the entire Israeli Palestinian conflict prior to World War I Palestine was officially part of the Ottoman Empire however by the end of the War the British had overtaken the Ottomans which they achieved with the help of the Arab people through the Arab Revolt yet at the same time the British cabinet began to drift into the Zionist political orbit as prominent zionists made inroads with British politicians by 1917 the zionists actions began to bear fruit and on November 2nd 1917 the British issued the now famous Balor declaration the Declaration was named after its author Arthur balfor the British foreign secretary who wrote his Majesty's government views with favor The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people while the letter also promised safeguards for the non-jewish communities in Palestine the Arabs officially rejected the Declaration the letter public published on November 2nd 1917 led to the creation of the state of Israel when the war ended Palestine entered the League of Nations mandate system which was created to help govern former ottoman territories until they formed sustainable governments of their own Britain officially gained control of mandatory Palestine in 1923 and it was clear the British prioritized creating a Jewish rather than an Arab State the formal mandate included the language of the Balor declaration and it recognized a Jewish agency to speak for the zionists while the Palestinian Arab executive was afforded no such Acceptance in addition many British officials were Pro Zionist and harbored racist feelings towards the Palestinian Arabs already the odds seem to be against the Palestinians and favoring the zionists from 1922 to 1936 the Jewish population in Palestine increased by over 300,000 to almost 30% of its total bringing zionists and Arabs into closer contact and leading to increased tensions in 1929 disturbances in Jerusalem at the Wailing Wall led to the deaths of 133 Jews and 116 Arabs however no appreciable change in British policy followed as they ignored recommendations to limit Zionist immigration with tensions brewing and the British seemingly favoring the zionists it was only a matter of time before the Powder Keg erupted unhappy with their ineffective leadership and increasing Zionist immigration the Arabs staged a large scale strike and Revolt from 1936 to 1939 disturbances began in April when Arabs murdered a Jewish bus passenger and soon a local strike morphed into a nationwide Palestinian movement there were violent attacks on both sides leaving 1,000 Arabs and 80 Jews dead within 6 months from October 1936 until July 1937 the strike was on hold along with the violence and the British sent in an investigative commission yet when the commission recommended a SE separate Jewish and Palestinian State both sides rejected it during the renewed Revolt Palestinians murdered Jewish settlers and began terrorizing the countryside with armed bands hoping to end the Zionist experiment in their Homeland the Revolt conclusively failed and the British Army and Zionist paramilitaries finally put down the disorder in March 1939 by then there were already 5,600 dead a little over half of whom were Arab Palestine was crumbling at the seams following the ARA Revolt of 1936 to 1939 Palestine was in complete shambles during the uprising the British dissolved the Palestinian leadership and deported most of its members leaving much of the movement in the hands of Rebel bands and the peasantry the Revolt had failed in its primary goal of removing the British and their support for the zionists claims to occupation but the British did moderate their policies towards Palestine afterward after the uprising the British announced the white paper which was a complete break from their previous policies it repudiated the idea that Palestine was meant to be a Jewish State restricted Jewish immigration to 15,000 a year and stopped certain land transfers from Arabs to Jews the British issued the white paper just as the Holocaust was beginning leaving the Jewish Community incredibly upset and disenchanted when fighting broke out in the Middle East during the second world war however it was zionists and not Arabs who fought alongside the British while the Zionist paramilitaries gained Munitions and valuable combat experience fighting with the BR British the Arabs were afforded no such opportunity after the war the zionists were determined to remove the British from authority over Palestine and declare independence they lashed out violently through acts of sabotage and Terror such as the bombing of the british's HQ at the King David hotel in 1946 which killed 41 once again Palestine was engulfed in turmoil and bloodshed by 1947 palestine's situation had deteriorated completely and the British needed an exit by then the League of Nations was defunct and had been replaced by the United Nations in February the British presented the Palestine question to the UN however reaching a satisfying answer was far from Easy by the end of 1946 the population stood at roughly 1.84 million inhabitants with only 33% being Jewish and 58% being Muslim Arab in addition even after Decades of land transfers the zionists only controlled 6% of the land in Palestine while on the ground the Arabs seem to have the stronger position at the UN it was a different story The zionists effectively mobilized influential American supporters to pressure un delegates to vote favorably for them in contrast the Palestinian leadership had been in Exile since the failure of the Arab Revolt leaving them largely without close representation on behalf of the Palestinians spoke the leaders of the surrounding Arab states but they were more concerned with appearing to care rather than actually creating a Palestinian state in November 1947 the UN issued resolution 181 but it was a solution beset with problems un 181 recommended Palestine be partitioned into both Jewish and Arab states which was anathema to the Palestinians who controlled most of the land that was earmarked for the zionists assured by the surrounding Arab states that they would back them militarily the Palestinians rejected un1 181 out of hand while the zionists supported it in late 1947 as the British withdrew and the United Nations stood by Palestine devolved into hellish violence within 24 hours of the un's announcement of their partition plan Arabs began attacking and shooting at Jews in hia and Tel Aviv and fighting soon erupted between them both sides targeted civilians including bombing public areas no one was safe many of the Zionist paramilitaries were experienced and well-coordinated and they were far superior in combat compared to the less organized Palestinian resistance by the spring of 1948 8 things had largely shifted to the zionists punctuated by atrocities against civilians like the shocking Zionist massacre at Deer yine which left over 100 Arab villagers dead the Palestinian resistance began to crumble on May 15th 1948 Israel formally declared independence though this hardly ended the Bloodshed instead the Arab countries of Egypt Syria Lebanon Iraq and trans Jordan invaded Israel intending to evict the zionists in favor of the Palestinian Arabs however the Israelis had a numerical superiority of forces and a strong determination to win and they threw back the invading armies in a stunning Victory they were a highly prepared uh highly dedicated well-armed fighting force when it was all over in July 1949 Israel controlled almost all of the territory designated for themselves and Palestine according to un1 181 except for the Gaza Strip near Egypt and the West Bank including Old Jerusalem known in Israel as the war of independence the Palestinians have a different name Al nakba or the catastrophy perhaps the worst Legacy resulting from the Palestinian Wars was the giant Refugee crisis left in its wake amidst the violence many Palestinian Arabs fled Israel to the nearby Arab countries of Syria Lebanon and trans Jordan as well as the Egyptian Gaza Strip it's widely estimated that at least 750,000 Palestinians were left displaced by the fighting Israel and the Palestinians were unable to agree on terms to readmit the refugees and as a result none were Israeli settlers quickly moved into former Palestinian homes and Villages now bereft of their former owners while the Palestinians languished and Scattered and squalid refugee camps even while the fighting was still ongoing thousands of refugees illegally

wanted to demonstrate Israeli power but his rhetoric and actions severely angered the Palestinians leading to Stone throwing and demonstrations in response the IDF began shooting and killing demonstrators and the aloa inata was underway peace talks later in the year once again broke down due to violence on the ground and in 2001 the Israelis elected Chiron as the new prime minister compared with the first the aloa inapa was much more violent and characterized by intensive bombing campaigns by Islamic terrorists Additionally the aloa inapa was also much less widespread and less organized among the Palestinians and it was also more costly by the summer of 2003 24 Palestinians and 780 Israelis died in the chaos after the violence of the aloa inata claimed thousands of lives the Israelis began new tactics in the occupied territories in 2005 the Israelis began disengagement or removing the illegal Jewish settlers from Palestinian territory by August the Gaza settlements were no more but the West Bank settlements were untouched even worse for the West Bank the Israelis began building massive barriers to separate the Jewish settlement from the Palestinians areas additionally they built them on Palestinian rather than Israeli land reducing the Palestinians territory even further in the 2006 West Bank elections the terrorist organization Hamas won a stunning Victory taking control for the first time in March 2006 Hamas formally took over the Palestinian Authority ushering in a new era for the West Bank with hamas's refusal to even recognize Israel's right to exist any potential peace talks between the Israelis and the PA were non-starters that summer Hamas and their political Rivals Al fatah began open Warfare in the West Bank characterized by rocket fire and explosive grenades Hamas was in control of Gaza by the following summer Rockets also made their way into Israel and Hamas launched raids that ended with the kidnapping of an Israeli soldier beginning in 2007 due to security concerns over Hamas Israel instituted a complete blockade of Gaza extending over the land sea and air from the moment Hamas took over the Palestinian Authority in 2006 and gained control of Gaza in 2007 it was obvious they were on a crash course with Israel in March 2008 Hamas sent hundreds of missiles over the Gaza border into Israel and the Israelis responded with a two-day assault that killed 116 Palestinians the Israelis launched a massive invasion of Gaza on January 3rrd 2009 after smashing Hamas with air strikes the week prior Israel claimed the attack was in response to Hamas continuing to fire Rockets into Israel and on the day of the invasion Hamas launched another 70 Rockets killing at least four after 3 weeks of warfare the death toll was 1200 Palestinians compared with just 13 Israelis and the Israelis called for a ceasefire Israel remained in Gaza until January 21st 2009 when they withdrew to the Gaza perimeter reports emerged that the Israelis had used white phosphorus during the fighting which could have constituted a war crime if used against civilians by the end more than 1300 Palestinians had died no one's coming to help us not able to stop ground it's very from 2012 to 2018 Gaza was permeated by sporadic violence between Hamas and Israel and thousands of civilians were caught up in the Bloodshed in November 2012 Israel re-entered Gaza for 8 days in response to more Hamas rocket fire into Israel resulting in over 150 dead Palestinians and five dead Israelis before a ceasefire could take effect in July 2014 Israel was back in Gaza this time after Israeli teenagers had been abducted and killed by Hamas in the West Bank the Israelis withdrew after another 1,881 Palestinians and 67 Israelis died in 2018 Gaza City was again a flame and a wash with violence as the Israelis killed at least 170 Palestinians between March and November with Hamas retaliating with rocket fire it was an endless cycle of violence and the civilians felt the brunt of the pain in the West Bank which was not under Hamas control things were also deteriorating the refugee crisis was as bad as ever and by 2021 the United Nations estimated there were at least 871 th000 registered refugees in the West Bank in addition Israeli settlements expanded causing the UN to issue resolution 2334 in 2016 designating them illegal When Donald Trump became the president of the United States in 200 17 it came after he extensively talked up Israel in his campaign in late 2017 Trump acknowledged Jerusalem as the capital and began working to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem which served to Anchor the Palestinians in 2020 Trump helped broker the Abraham Accords which called for Israel and the United Arab Emirates to establish normalized relations while also getting Israel to suspend annexing the occupied West Bank however Trump's actions did little to stop the viol on the ground in Gaza and the West Bank and the killings continued in May 2021 the Israelis evicted six families from a Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem which brought waves of protests in response to the protests Israel invaded killing 20 and leaving more than 300 injured the year 2022 was even more violent and in March Palestinian attacks killed 11 Israelis by the end of the year after numerous Israeli reprisals 166 Palestinians were dead in the West Bank alone much like 2022 ended for the occupied territories 2023 began largely the same way with Israeli raids into the West Bank by January 26th 2023 30 Palestinians were already dead following raids into Janine in search of Islamic Jihad terrorist group members that day Palestinians in Gaza fired rockets at Israel in retaliation and on January 27th a Palestinian gunman shot and killed seven Israeli settlers outside a synagogue near a West Bank Israeli settlement by June the Israelis were using helicopter gunships during their Janine raids resulting in even more Palestinian deaths as of June 19th 2023 the death toll for the year was already 130 Palestinians and 25 Israelis setting it up to be one of the worst years on record for both sides still nobody could have predicted what came next as the next escalation of the Israeli Palestinian conflict would be one of the most devastating in history the 2023 Hamas attacks on October 7th 2023 the Hamas terrorist organization viciously attacked Israel in one of the worst provocations in the history of the Israeli Palestinian conflict Hamas sent a barrage of rockets over the Gaza border into Israel and carried out a devastating ground attack throughout the southern part of the country within a day there were already 700 dead Israelis and the fighting was only beginning in response to the attack the Israelis immediately declared war on Hamas and began a counter offensive which claimed the lives of at least 1,500 and wounded more than 6,600 Palestinians in Gaza by October 13th in addition the Israelis also shut off the power and restricted supplies of food and Medicine by then the Israeli death toll had climbed to over 1,200 people with more than 3,000 wounded innocent people murdered wounded entire families taken hostage by Hamas some of hamas's most Sinister plans included taking hostages thought to be around one 150 many of these hostages were taken from the Nova Music Festival that was underway when the attack was launched and excruciating footage showed the militants murdering innocent civilians as they fled for their lives the true Devastation of the 2023 Hamas Terror attacks won't be known for years but it was the worst flare up in [Music] decades"
8,6foH3Zc82ZQ," On November 2, 1917,  Britain's Foreign Secretary,  Arthur Balfour, wrote a letter that would set off a conflict  still being fought more than 100 years later. His Majesty's government view with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement
of this object. When Balfour wrote of his government's intent  to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine, 90% of the people living there were not Jewish. Just 31 years later, most of them were gone. This is the story of the British promise that led to the destruction of Palestine  and the creation of the State of Israel. Let's start with the obvious question: Why were the British making promises
about other people's countries? Short answer? Empire is one hell of a drug. This was World War I,  and the British were making lots of promises. In addition to promising 
a Jewish homeland in Palestine, They promised Arab leaders independence if they rose up against Britain's enemy, 
the Ottoman Empire. The Arabs did. Hollywood even made a movie about it. - Arabia's for the Arabs now. - That's what I've told them anyway. That's what they think. That's why they're fighting. Oh, surely. A month after Balfour's letter, British troops took Palestine, ending 400 years of Ottoman rule. The people who lived
there were Arabs, mostly Muslims, but they were Christian and Jewish minorities too. There was also a tiny number of European Jews who in the late 1800s had started 
building small colonies there. At a time when many Jews were suffering
horrific persecution in Europe, they felt Palestine could be an escape. The idea of building up a Jewish presence
in Palestine became known as Zionism, but it stayed a fringe movement
among European Jews. Many of them felt they shouldn't have to leave
their countries to avoid persecution. But Zionism, as a political movement,
took a big step forward with an Austrian man called Theodor Herzl. And this guy is a very important name
in this story. In 1896, he published “Der Judenstaat” -  or in English, “The Jewish State.” In it, he said, the only way for Jews to avoid Europe's anti-Semitism was not just to leave, but to have their own country. And Herzl didn't just write. The next year he organized a conference
in Basel, Switzerland: The First Zionist Congress. The attendees agreed on a program which sought, among other things, to establish  a Jewish homeland in Palestine  and promote Jewish settlement in Palestine. From here on out, the Zionist movement became very active, setting up funds to promote Jewish immigration to Palestine, companies to buy land there, and recruiting representatives  to advocate for their cause with different governments. A few days after the conference, Herzl
wrote this in his diary. He was only off by one year.  Ok, so that is a lot of history, but it's important because the Zionist movement is a critical
part of the story going forward. Especially after it found a friend in
the British government where a lot of high ranking officials supported Zionism,
sometimes for unexpected reasons. Prime Minister Lloyd George, for example,
was a Christian zealot who believed gathering the Jewish people in Palestine
would bring Jesus Christ back to earth. Others, like Balfour,
believed that getting the Jewish people out of Europe and into their own country
would be a good thing. Herzl was pretty visionary when he wrote that the anti-Semitic nations will become our allies. Meanwhile, the Zionist assured Britain that their future country would be a reliable ally. So, that's the back story of how  European anti-Semitism, Zionism and British imperialism all led to the Balfour Declaration. This British promise to build  a homeland for Jews in Palestine. Now we're going to look at how Britain did that. World War I  had been a conflict between rival empires and the winners set up the League of Nations to distribute the losing side's 
territories between them. They called it the Mandate System -  putting territories once controlled by  by the Ottoman and German empires under the, until they became independent. Hm. Britain was given the mandate over Palestine, but the Palestinian people
were never asked what they wanted or what independence
would look like to them. Listen to what Balfour wrote to one of his colleagues. Instead, it was the Zionists
who were consulted about  what their vision for Palestine was. And so the mandate ended up incorporating
not just the Balfour Declaration, but several clauses requiring Britain
to ensure the establishment of a Jewish home in Palestine. British rule was very accommodating
to the Zionist project. The Jewish community in Palestine
grew with big waves of immigration. They had their own schools and factories
and even their own militia, the Haganah. And they were led
by the Polish-born David Ben-Gurion, the leader of their representative
body, the Jewish Agency. To the Palestinians, it was clear that Britain wasn't delivering 
them independence. It was delivering their country to other people. In 1936, they went on strike. British forces tried to break the strike  with arrests, torture, mass punishment 
and executions. Leaders were exiled, weapons
confiscated and houses blown up. Palestinian fighters attacked
British and Jewish targets,  while British and Haganah forces would carry out joint raids on Palestinian villages. Something had to change. The British government sent a commission
called the Peel Commission to figure it out,
but their proposed solution was typical: Just draw another British line on the map. Divide the country, give this part to the Jews
and this part to the Palestinians and make that part of 
Transjordan next door. Oh, and because the Palestinians 
were a majority in the country,   250,000 of them would have to 
be removed by force to make the Jewish state viable. Remember, these were the proposals
that were meant to calm things down. Spoiler: they didn't. Instead, the revolt continued until 1939,
by which time about 10% of Palestine's adult male population had either been
killed, injured, arrested or exiled. The British government really needed a solution -  so here comes another report. The commission is studying
the 20 year old Jewish settlements in British-mandated Palestine. The 1939 White Paper created a conflict between the British and the Zionists  for the first time, because it rejected partition and said the solution was for Palestine
to gain independence within 10 years, with everyone
living there sharing it together. Crucially,
it also imposed severe limits on Jewish land purchases and immigration. To the Zionists, this felt like a betrayal. In response, some set off bombs across the
country, killing dozens of Palestinians. But soon everyone was distracted by something much bigger. More than 60 million
people were killed in World War II, including 6 million Jews murdered 
in Nazi death camps. Jewish survivors fled Europe with a large number of them
trying to find safety in Palestine, despite the British limit on Jewish
immigration. This set off a more direct confrontation
between the Zionists and the British, with Palestinians often targeted as well. The Zionists knew two things: The Zionists knew two things: Militarily, they were stronger than the Palestinians and Britain was exhausted by World War II, so it wouldn't have the stomach
to keep fighting in Palestine. They were right. In 1947, after 30 years of occupation,
Britain announced it was quitting Palestine and asked the newly formed
United Nations to clean up its mess. Alright, 1947 and 1948
are the most pivotal years in this story. So let's take a look
at how things are lining up. During British rule,  Jews had gone from 10% to 30% of the population. and owned about 6% of the land. Under Ben-Gurion's leadership,
the Jewish Agency was pretty much functioning
as a government for the Jewish community, And the Zionist militias
had tens of thousands of soldiers, modern weapons and officers
who had already fought in World War II. On the other side, the Palestinians hadn't been allowed to develop
their own administration or military. But as they waited for the UN’s solution, they were still the majority all over the country. In November 1947, the UN - then only made up of a fraction
of the world's countries - voted to partition Palestine. This plan marks off 55% of the country  for a Jewish state. But the UN never explained   how it could be a Jewish state when half the people in its territory were Palestinian. To nobody’s surprise Palestinians -  and in fact all Arabs - rejected the UN’s plan. Ben-Gurion and the Zionist leadership accepted, but they saw an opportunity.
With the British on the way out, the Zionists knew they would have
the strongest military in Palestine. Their forces were instructed
to seize more territory than they'd been awarded by the UN
and to do what was necessary to reduce the number of Palestinians
in it. In cities like Haifa, the militias set off
car bombs in Palestinian neighborhoods. They attacked villages
and forced residents out. - Haganah troops have driven the Arabs out 
of the beleaguered city, taking many prisoners. After inspecting parts of western
Jerusalem that have been emptied
of Palestinians,  Ben-Gurion said: One of the events that helped speed up
these changes took place on April 9, 1948, when the village of Deir Yassin scene was attacked. A British government report to the United Nations describes the scene. 250 people were killed in circumstances
of great savagery. Women and children were stripped, lined up, photographed
and then slaughtered by automatic firing. The story of what happened at Deir Yassin set off panic all over the country. As news spread, people fled, fearing they would be next. Historians have recorded dozens
of similar massacres during this period. Each time they would result in
entire communities fleeing. By the time Britain ended its mandate 
on May 15th, 1948, 250,000 Palestinians had fled. The night before David Ben-Gurion
announced the founding of the State of Israel,  with himself as its first prime minister. He was standing under a giant 
portrait of Herzl, 51 years after Herzl had predicted
this very moment. The Zionist militias came together
as the newly formed Israel Defense Forces, but the fighting wasn't over. With the British out of the way, soldiers from several Arab
countries entered Palestine, but the Israeli army was better equipped,
better organized and,  unlike the Arab armies,  had a unified command and backing
from several European countries. Israeli forces pushed into places
that the UN had assigned to the Palestinian state, like the towns of Lydda and Ramleh. 50,000 people were forced to flee
from there, many on foot, in what became known as the
Lydda Death March. After being emptied, the towns were given
Hebrew names: Lod and Ramla. Like in many other empty
towns, the buildings and homes were taken over by the new Israeli state
and given to Jews. By the time the UN secured an armistice, three quarters of the Palestinian people
had become refugees. In Arabic, they call this the Nakba -  literally, the catastrophe. The new state of Israel made up 78%
of what had been Palestine. The remaining parts were annexed by Jordan
or taken over by Egypt. A year later, the UN passed a resolution calling for all Palestinian refugees to be allowed to return home. They never have been. Palestine had been erased. In the decades since, attempts to resolve this conflict
have again tried to partition the land. With each successive attempt,
the territory offered to Palestinians in their historic homeland shrinks
even more. Ironically, Israel is still struggling
to maintain the population advantage it gained in 1948
when it forced all those people out because in 1967,
it occupied the West Bank and Gaza, bringing all the Palestinians living
there under its rule. And so today,  the population of Jews and non-Jews  in this land is roughly equal. But those living under occupation
have no rights, no citizenship
and no prospect of independence. The Nakba era tactics of settlement, home
demolitions and expulsion are still used against them. Israel has taken the land but wants nothing to do with 
the millions under its rule. International, Israeli
and Palestinian human rights groups say this system is a form of apartheid. To see if that's an accurate 
description of Israel  more than 100 years after Balfour’s promise, watch this video here."," On November 2, 1917,  Britain's Foreign Secretary,  Arthur Balfour, wrote a letter that would set off a conflict  still being fought more than 100 years later.

from the ottoman Capital Constantinople in Turkey the sultan ruled over the the last of the great Islamic Empires it had been an almost terminal decline for decades yet the fate of the Ottoman Empire was to be sealed by the outbreak of the first world war in August [Music] 1914 in Europe Germany's rapid Advance was halted by Britain and France along the western front in the East Russia's war against Germany and Austria Hungary so reached [Music] deadlock the powerful weapons of the Industrial Age were killing thousands of men in the trenches of every Army all of the leading Powers expected the war to be over within a matter of months so in that sense all of them are surprised at the end of 1914 when not merely is the war going on but it shows every sign of being likely to go on for a very long time at that point they began to think about new ways of winning the war Britain's prime minister aswith felt that with the stalemate in Europe it was essential to widen the conflict together with foreign secretary Lord gray Minister for war Lord Kitchener and the first Lord of the admiralty Winston Churchill they masterminded a complex strategy to undermine the Central Powers this was a global war and the British saw the Middle East very much in a global context the traditional British preference for sidh shows as people um unfavorably call it the indirect strategy the way of attacking the soft underbelly as church WIll called it of the enemy and the soft underbelly was seen to be turkey Britain's secret plan involved on the one hand a military diversion and on the other a devious use of diplomacy through bribery subversion and double dealing all these devices focused on the enemy's weakest link turkey's Ottoman Empire diplomacy in general has always had a secret Dimension to it where but where discretion ends and conspiracy begins is an open question but during the period up to and during the first world war there was a particularly intense set of negotiations and discussions between the major Imperial powers between the French the Russians and the British in particular cut in the Italians as well about what would they do when the war was over and when the Ottoman Empire broke up the British government hoped that by striking a deal Over The Spoils of War it would strengthen the alliance against the Central [Music] Powers amongst the Allies Russia had long sought access to the Mediterranean in a secret treaty of March 1915 Britain and France offered what was to the zar a prize of vital geopolitical importance Constantinople it is that hey Outlet into the wider world and into the Mediterranean and it is the one thing of course the British and the French have been attempting to prevent the Russians from achieving so this is a complete Volta fche this is this is the British the French and the Russians coming to an agreement over something which was up to this point almost inconceivable Italy's King Victoria Emanuel was another Target for bribery Britain France and Russia tried to tempt Italy a pro- German state to join the Allies in April 1915 a secret treaty offered Italy a substantial bit of Ottoman real estate in Anatolia again it's another power coming into the equation and being offered territorial advancement which in Normal circumstances would have been quite inconceivable the bribe worked Italy joined the allies and declared war on the Central Powers in August 1915 but Britain's strategy to undermine the enemy via the Ottoman Empire also required subversion by using domestic opposition to weaken maybe even destroy it Britain exploited a new movement sweeping through the empire [Music] nationalism nationalism in the sense of believing that there are peoples with a clear cultural identity and that these people should have independent that idea spread to the Middle East as to other parts of the world in the latter part of the 19th century so you had the beginnings in the Ottoman Empire of a Turkish nationalism this came to a head when The Young Turks took power in a coup in 1908 and started to impose their language and culture on the Arabs of the empire but this only reawakened an interest amongst Arabs in their own [Music] Heritage a thousand years before Arabs had brought the technology and literature of the East to the west and their religion Islam had encompassed much of Asia North Africa and Southwestern Europe the idea of recovering that historic grander had remained in the consciousness of Arab intellectuals by the start of the first world war the antagonism between Arab and Turk had increased the very fact that the Turks were saying we want to have a unified empire meant the Arabs said wait a minute we're not part of this so all of this literary and nationalistic Revival then took a much more political form and therefore you got the emergence of Arab nationalism they had arrived at the conclusion that remaining in the Ottoman Empire was becoming hopeless that they couldn't actually share power with the Turks and they began thinking of having their own state by the summer of 1915 British intelligence confirmed that the Arab nationalist movement was the Breakthrough the government was looking for Britain and her French Ally dispatched officers to sound out Arab leaders both the French and the British started you could say seducing various local Arab leaders that if you side with us we'll give you your Independence so why don't you leave the Ottomans and various people were tempted as a result if they they thought they could actually gain independence why not side with the Europeans against the Ottomans the idea was to tempt the Arabs into a revolt against their ottoman overlords and create a diversion which would tie down the Central Powers in the Middle [Music] East ironically the impetus for such a diversion had come not from London but from the Arab world in the hijas in Western Arabia Sheriff Hussein its ruler was set on extending his political and geographical domain he believed he might be able to do it with the help of the British in turn the British were impressed by Sheriff Hussein's family credentials as custodians of the holy places of Islam they called themselves hashimites they're called the family hashimites because that's the family or the tribe of the Prophet Muhammad they were the bani Hashim the sons of Hashim so he was Sharif Hussein was the leader of the hashimites he was the person responsible for Mecca and Medina and although he had worked with the Ottomans before the first world war once the first world war happened he saw this was his chance a chance too for the British who saw support for Sheriff Hussein as a way to threaten the Sultan's hold on the caliphate the political leadership of the Islamic world the briti because they were fighting the Ottomans and the Ottomans were claiming to be the real representative of Islam they wanted a counterforce and the counterforce was represented by Sharif Hussein being a descendant of the Prophet but Sharif Hussein was speaking of liberating Arab lands building a new national state he wanted to be king of the Arabs not simply of Arabians in July 1915 Sheriff Hussein smuggled a message to the British High Commissioner in Cairo Sir Henry mcmah offering to raise a substantial Arab Force against the automans in return for British support for Arab Independence in the ensuing secret correspondence between the two men Sheriff Hussein was given to understand that he could expect British support in achieving some of his Ambitions in the event of an ottoman defeat this letter of October the 26th 1915 outlined the main point point of the arrangement the actual document itself is absolutely Riven with ambiguity there's no doubt about that the question is whether Hussein recognizes that my sense of Hussein is that he does recognize it in other words there is no wool being poured over his eyes because he's perfectly aware that if he's going to create a modern Arab Empire he's going to need some logistical Economic Development and that can only come from the outside world taking Britain's assurances of support at face value Hussein together with his sons fisel and Abdullah amassed a sizable Force the new Army was commanded by the young and charismatic fisel who had captured the imagination of the Arab masses in the Quest for Arab Independence yet even as Hussein and fisel mobilized their troops the British were preparing to sell them short back in London in the spring of 1916 Britain was negotiating with France about the future shape of the Middle East behind closed doors Sir Mark Sykes of the British foreign office had been meeting his French opposite number franois George Pico Britain knew it was vital to offer the French a stake in The Spoils of the Ottoman Empire should they win the war there was an awareness on the British side that they had made such huge sacrifices that one couldn't just ignore um French Ambitions and that French were determined to have their historical piece of the lant poor over a map of the Levant Sykes and Pico personally Drew in the areas they wish to see under their control their secret deal amounted to the virtual carve up of the Middle East in area a for the French and area B for the British the imperialists intended to exercise power indirectly they would appoint advisers and take charge of the finances in their respective spheres of influence then there was the area colored blue which was to be be directly controlled by France this included what was then known as greater Syria where the French traditionally had commercial and religious interests as for the area colored pink known as Iraq with its strategic ports Railways and oil this was to be under British rule the area colored yellow represented Palestine and was envisaged as an international Zone except for Hyer [Music] what the British wanted was the oil of Iraq and they concentrated on getting Iraq and getting away from Iraq to the Mediterranean in order to transport this oil so they got haa on the Palestinian coast and they got most of Iraq the syes Pico agreement was a pretty shameful document and and I wouldn't attempt to defend it but it was drawn up by people who were sort of operating under the old um kind of balance of power considerations in an imperial frame of [Music] mind unaware of these secret dealings behind their backs asan and fisel proclaimed Independence and in June 1916 attacked the Turkish troops the the Arab revolt against the Ottomans had begun the Turkish Garrison at Mecca was soon overrun and the sea port at jida seized by 1917 Hussein and fil's forces had pushed North and engaged the ottoman Turks along the hijaz railway the British saw the Arab Revolt as part of its Strat strategy for creating a military diversion against the Central Powers in a pinsa movement Britain had launched a campaign from the southwest to ensure control of the sez canal and the Levant and from the southeast it was fighting to secure the oil wells of Iraq all this to attack the Central Powers at their weakest point the Ottoman Empire the Arabs hitched their fortunes to the British they considered themselves to be fighting with the Allies but at the same time they were not merged into the British army that they continued to act as an independent Army called the northern Army while the Arab Army Advanced northwards Britain's General Allenby had crossed the sez canal and by the spring of of 1917 his forces had reached the frontier of [Music] Palestine the war in Europe however was still not going well for Britain the attempted push through the German lines at the Som had produced little territorial gain and the cost in lives was colossal in Lon there had been a change of leadership the new prime minister Lloyd George felt that the Allied war effort needed a fresh impetus although America had so far been neutral in the war Lloyd George was convinced that could be changed he believed there was one powerful Group which might influence the American government Lloyd George thought that the American decision um whether to join or not would defend critically on public opinion and the Jewish support could tilt the scales in One Direction or or the other you've got to remember that the British foreign office greatly overestimate the political power of International jewelry particularly the wealthy financial and Commercial uh Jewish Elites what is extraordinary about this situation is that here you have particularly the British seeing the Jewish world as one Collective monolithic entity and in that sense they start looking at the role of the Jews in the war as being something which might be important and from the point of view of the Allies something else quite remarkable this monolithic Collective entity is pro- German many Jews in the upper echelons of German Society did indeed have close connections to the Kaiser's foreign office a new Jewish nationalist movement Zionism had also being able to establish its headquarters in [Music] Berlin Zionism had originated in the 1880s after Theodore Herzel published a book espousing the virtues of a Jewish State this caused a sensation amongst Jewish intellectuals in Germany Austria and Russia who shared herzl's outrage at the escalation of anti-jewish [Music] sentiments the end of the 19th century saw the rise of anti-Semitism all over Europe in Austria in Germany in France but particularly in Eastern Europe in Poland and in Russia and the prgram against the Jews in Russia gave rise to the establishment ofion the lovers of Zion societies uh in a number of Russian cities who started to promote and to finance and to sponsor colonization immigration to Palestine [Music] Herzel came to the conclusion that the Jews were not safe anywhere in Europe and the only solution was for the Jews to have a state of their own over which they could exercise sovereignty and where they would not be a [Music] minority what had also so given Zionism its appeal was the way in which it fitted in to Historic Jewish aspirations scattered throughout the world since the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in the first century ad many Jews had cherished the idea of returning one day to what their scriptures had told them was the promised land in fact there had already been a small community of indigenous Jews in Palestine but even when some European Jews established settlements throughout the late 19th century the whole Jewish Community by 1914 constituted barely 8% of the [Music] population the Zionist leader in Britain Heim vitman had been lobbying the government for a guarantee that in the event of an ottoman defeat it would support Jewish immigration to Palestine by early 19177 Lloyd George's view of Jews as globally influential convinced him that Zionism was another nationalist movement which should be co-opted to the Allied cause in March Mark syes began negotiations with vitman there is a a be in the Bonnet of people like Mark Sykes but actually the Jews do ultimately look to each other and look to their own interest and if that interest as they are being told by vitman is what we really want is Palestine they're prepared to believe it they're prepared to go along with it as negotiations with vitman continued over the following months the war deteriorated rapidly for the [Music] Allies the German sub Marine campaign was seriously weakening Britain's Merchant Fleet and although America had entered the war on the Allied side President woodro Wilson was not yet willing to supply a significant number of troops Britain's latest attempt to keep up the pressure on the Western Front soon became bogged down in the muddy trenches of passionale as thousands of young men's lives were wasted in another fruitless campaign morale amongst the soldiers plummeted but the most serious threat to the Allied War Machine came from the East Russia was on the verge of collapse after massive defeats at the hands of the Germans the war weary country was disintegrating with food shortages strikes and demonstrations when the Zar was deposed in a revolution Britain and France became greatly alarmed the point is that once Russia and its war effort begins to collapse essentially the Germans have won the first World War unless they bring the Americans in there's no way that the British and the French on their own are ever going to defeat [Music] Germany in October the British government received an intelligence report suggesting that Jews were significant influence in the leadership of the Bolshevik party the new revolutionary movement emerging as the dominant force in Russia Lloyd George feared that these Communists would take Russia out of the war with the Americans still refusing to commit sufficient forces he knew it was time to act he instructed his foreign secretary Arthur balour to issue a pledge to capture the hearts and Minds minds of the Jewish people his Majesty's government view with favor The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best Endeavors to facilitate the achievements of this object the balour Declaration was issued on November the 2nd 1917 just as British forces were occupying Palestine I would say that the Balo declaration has to be understood not as an idealistic gesture but it has to be understood within the framework of British Imperial policy and Lloyd George was the main instigator of that uh declaration because he believed that it would serve Britain's interests but this was also the first time that any major European power had given official backing for the Zionist goal of making Palestine into a Jewish homeland yet Sheriff Hussein had understood that Palestine had been promised as part of his deal for Arab Independence anticipating Arab outrage at the prospect of a Jewish homeland in a largely Arab Province the Bal for declaration had also stated that nothing shall be done which may Prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine the Declaration nonetheless appear to indicate British support for Jewish immigration there were only a mere 80,000 out of some like 700,000 people in Palestine who were Jews the in uh indigenous inhabitants of Palestine were referred to as non-jewish inhabitants and that that Palestine was being identified even at that stage as a Jewish land and all the others had no defined identity they were simply non-jewish the baffo Declaration was what it says a declaration it wasn't a treaty it wasn't a signed agreement it was a declaration in support of the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine in fact the only treaty Britain had signed in regard to Palestine was with the French the secret Sykes Pico agreement on November the 7th within a few days of the balour Declaration the Bolsheviks took power in Russia ly George hoped that it would have the desired effect of appeasing the Jews in the Communist leadership what is it that they supposedly so want as Jews je Palestine now the whole argument is is totally illogical it's a nonsense argument because these particular people if one were to think of people like trosky or zinovev or yaff some of the key Jewish leaders in the Russian Revolution the November Revolution these these people of course are internationalists there were 15 to 20 Jews in the higher echelons of the Bolshevik party most of them were anti Zionist and after they came to power they um soon after they came to power they issued a declaration to say that Zionism is a capitalist Ploy a capitalist idea the wildly inaccurate intelligence report on which Lloyd George based his strategy was to have major implications for Britain within weeks Russia's new leaders did exactly the opposite of what he had expected not only did they pull out of the war they opened up the archives of the zaris foreign office and published The Secret treaties the very treaties Britain had engineered with her allies to carve up the Ottoman Empire and to which Russia had been privy that of course is a very great embarrassment to the Western allies because the Allies have been doing all sorts of deals behind the scenes in which they have handed out to each other large sections of the world meanwhile openly preaching that they are fighting the war in defense of democracy and of course also telling among others the Arabs that they are supporters of self-determination for the peoples of the Ottoman Empire publication of the secret treaties by the bolik certainly created an enormous suspicion in the Arab world and this meant that the Sharif Hussein and the others said wait a minute what's going on what a why are you not giving us independence and secondly why are you dividing us up into Zone a and Zone B and at that point of course the Arabs realized that not only were the had the British got their own particular interests for example in the ports of Palestine or in Iraq but that they had promised other things to the [Music] French aid Arab confusion and suspicion General aleny entered Jerusalem on foot together with Sykes Pico and a number of other Allied notables his British Le forces had captured the holy city in December 1917 the leaders of the Arab Revolt however were nowhere to be [Music] seen fearing that Hussein and fisel might lose heart the British government forwarded a message to them reiterating British commitment to Arab Independence the Arab race shall be given full opportunity of once again forming a nation in the world this can only be achieved by the Arabs themselves uniting and Great Britain and her allies will pursue a policy with this ultimate unity in view Hussein stayed loyal to the Allied cause still prepared to accept Britain's word on Arab Independence although he spoke of settling accounts after the war from alam's point of view he continued to rely on Arab support in the war against the Ottomans but now that Jerusalem had been occupied by the British one party seized the initiative in April 1918 Heim vitman and the international Zionist commissioner traveled to Palestine to lay the foundation for a Hebrew University their Hope was that it would become the intellectual Hub of Zionism vman's visit however caused widespread alarm and indignation among the Arab population and when he and the chief Rabbi of Jerusalem met General alanby it looked as if Britain Was preparing to honor the balfor Declaration 6 months later alam's forces entered Damascus with their Ally fil's Northern army they had pushed the ottoman troops North through Palestine into Syria the Arab Revolt did contribute to the victory of the allies first of all it protected the British flank in Palestine second it kept a number of Turkish and German troops preoccupied and third the the British could have never legitimized what they were doing unless they had the blessing of a particular Arab Force [Music] on the 3rd of October the people of Damascus flocked to fil's Victory Parade if he was to seize power he knew it was of great importance to make his presence felt and to be seen by the Arab people as their [Music] liberator later the same day however fisel met with General alanby at the Victoria Hotel in Damascus Allenby warned him that his rule in Syria would be [Music] limited the British by that time knew that they were going to hand over Syria to the French so they couldn't actually accept faad as a legitimate Ruler all they could do is to pay him uh his salary and the expenses of his army and his administration undaunted by alen's warnings fisel assumed the title of governor of Damascus with the support of his father Sheriff Hussein he set about creating a power base for their goal of an independent Arab state on the 31st of October the Ottomans were finally [Music] defeated and at 11:00 on the 11th of November 1918 the guns fell silent in Europe as the war with the Central Powers came to an [Music] end the peace conference at Versailles began in January 1919 representatives of the Victorious allies such as the French prime minister clo and the American president woodro Wilson gathered to sort out what was to be done with the former territories of the defeated Empires now the liberal use of promises by the British government had to be prioritized they did indeed make pledges to the Arabs but they also made pledges to the Jews and they also made pledges to the French and the Russians and everybody else and these people saw the world as an imperial world not only did they want to carve out the Middle East they wanted to carve up Russia they thought this was the last great moment in which the Imperial Powers would be able to sit down and grab what was going particularly since there was no one to stop them but Britain and her old Ally France were up against the American President woodro Wilson's vision of a new world order which promoted National self-determination Nation once Independence had seemed to be a possibility that this principle of self-determination uh supported by the Americans was going to be offered to all those who were to be liberated from former Empires like the hapsburgs and the Ottomans what the Palestinians wanted was an independent state in fact fisel had come from Damascus to plead the the Arab cause but the future of Palestine in the Middle East formed part of Britain's pledge to France in the syes Pico car up in the event woodro Wilson's principles about self-determination were forgotten when it came to the people of the Middle East Britain and France were free to go ahead with their agreement but what of the promises Britain had made to the Jews regarding Palestine foreign secretary Arthur Baler in a confidential memo during the Versa peace talks with America France and Italy wrote the four Great powers are committed to Zionism and Zionism be it right or wrong good or bad is rooted in agong Traditions in present leads in future hopes of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land that might sound like a warm endorsement of Zionism yet further in the post-war memorandum balur hints at a much more cynical agenda so far as Palestine is concerned the powers have made no Declaration of policy which at least in letter they have not always intended to [Music] violate the verai peace conference was concluded on June the 28th 1919 with the creation of the League of Nations the first Global Institution for peace and security its Covenant provided that the Arab and other territories seeded by the defeated Ottoman Empire should be administered by mandates which meant in effect that Britain and France were given the authority to impose their rule over the Arab [Music] territories on November the 21st 1919 franois George Pico the co-architect of the Sykes Pico agreement and the French General guro arrived in beut and so began the imposition of the French mandate for Syria and [Applause] Lebanon the British forces who had occupied the region since ounting the ottoman Turks during the last months of the war were handing over power to the French thus fulfilling their wartime pledge fisel who had been the governor of Damascus now for 16 months had been consolidating his position when he was proclaimed King by the Syrian National Congress the French were incensed and general guro sent in his troops by August the 7th 1920 fisel had been deposed and had to flee to [Music] Palestine the promises to Sharif Hussein and fisel of a single independent state were now a distant memory for the Europeans the whole issue of spheres of influence meant that what appeared what was at first appeared to be willingness to accept a single Arab state was in fact seriously diluted and then on top of that of course the very fact of there being at French area and a British area meant that in effect this was the seed of partition so you had both Independence was denied but also the unity of this area was denied the boundaries and governments of the middle eastern states that emerged bore the unmistakable imprint of the Sykes Pico agreement the French half of the previously ottoman province of great Assyria became the Mandate for Lebanon and Syria the other half became the British mandate for Trans Jordan and Palestine in the East the ottoman area of Mesopotamia which included the oil fields of mul was given to Britain as the Mandate for Iraq so this was basically the importance of the sapo agreement to divide what is called the Fertile Crescent between Iraq and Syria and let Britain get access to the oil of the area and be able to exploit it in the future but British rule was initially rejected by the Iraqi people until fisel was installed as King in July 1921 Britain hoped The Limited Pate devolved to him would serve to bate the frustrated demands for Arab Independence but Sheriff Hussein expected more from the British he never gave up the idea that the British had promised him Independence not only in Arabia but in Syria and Iraq as well and he wanted the British to fulfill their promises Sheriff Hussein's dream of an Arab Kingdom ruled by the hashemites was only partially fulfilled for although his other son Abdullah became king of trans Jordan their old rival ibin saoud swept the hash ites out of hijaz when he conquered the whole of the Arabian peninsula in Jerusalem an Administration was established by the British in the spring of 1920 there were no plans for devolving power in Palestine Palestine was a land sacred to three religions Jews were a small minority who had lived harmoniously with Christians and the much larger community of Muslims for hundreds of [Music] years but the balfor Declaration promising Jews a homeland in Palestine had been incorporated into the British mandate at Versailles Palestine was thus to be open for new European Jewish immigration with celebrations and parades in support of Zionist activities it seemed as if the British were going to honor their pledges to the Jews and ignore Palestinian hopes of Independence the Arabs had a strong case but very poor Advocates um the zionists had a case it wasn't as strong as that of the local Arabs but they had brilliant Advocates Zionism is one of the greatest Public Relation success stories of the 20th century and K vitman exemplified these traditional Jewish skills of advocacy and uh persuasion some of these skills were clearly in evidence when vitman and various Zionist groups helped finance land purchases and the building of settlements for immigrant Jews at the same time political and security organizations were created to support the emerging Jewish homeland the Arab community in Palestine was [Music] incensed the Palestinians couldn't conceive their country being divided or given away to another Community H which had nothing to do with the Middle East in the first place and was almost holy European at the time so to them it seemed absurd that 600 to 700,000 should give up their land their homes their Villages their towns and hand them over to a minority which was dispersed uh throughout Palestine and Palestine after all is named after Ser its people who are the Palestinians in 1925 Arthur balur tour the new Jewish settlements in Palestine although he was fated as a hero of the Zionist cause the immigration of European Jews was to have unforeseen consequences for British rule in Palestine I believe that the Balo declaration was one of the most serious mistakes in British imperial history it uh committed Britain to uh support of Jewish nationalism in Palestine after the war and uh it did not uh produce any immediate benefits for Britain without the Bala declaration there could have been no genuine development of a Jewish National home and the follow through in 1948 where you get the creation of a state of Israel simply would not have happened it requires the umbrella of the British to be there in effect to support the emerging Jewish National home militarily at the bottom line the very fact that there are British troops British policemen there to protect the Jewish communities is ultimately Central to the situation it could not have been done in any other [Music] way throughout the 1930s and 40s the years of Nazi persecution and the Holocaust Jewish immigration to Palestine increased rapidly but what was seen by the Arabs as an alien incursion and the Jews as a fulfillment of historic rights led to polarization and violence in response to ter terrorist acts by Arabs Britain restricted the immigration but the policy only stimulated Jewish terrorism against this background Britain relinquished its mandate and the state of Israel was born in 1948 when the first of several Wars between the new state and its Arab neighbors began thousands of Palestinian Arabs fled their [Music] Homeland thus the Strategies employed by Britain to win the first world war inadvertently left a deep divide between Arab and Jew the most serious consequences of British policy during the war was the encouragement of Arab nationalism and Jewish nationalism and in the aftermath of the first World War was left with this Legacy of double dealing and of betrayal which was to haunt her for a long long time clearly it played a role in dividing the Arab world into different states in allowing the establishment of the state of Israel and in frustrating Arab desires but if what happened in syes Pico and everything else that happened in the first world war is used as an excuse for the problems of the Middle East now I I think that would be a mistake but yes the roots of what we see today certainly arose from the double dealing of the first world war and from the frustrated expectations of that [Music] time"," get access to hundreds more exclusive history documentaries by downloading the history hit app the bitter struggle between Arab and Jew for control of the holy land has caused Untold suffering in the Middle East for Generations it is often claimed that the crisis originated with Jewish immigration to Palestine and the foundation of the state of Israel yet the roots of the conflict are to be found much earlier in British double dealing during the first world war this is a story of intrigue among rival empires of misguided strategies and of how conflicting promises to Arab and Jew created a legacy of Bloodshed which has determined the fate of the Middle [Music] East [Music] during the first World War the British the French and the Russians had these secret plans to carve up the Ottoman Empire because they believed that would balance out their Imperial Ambitions but tough luck for the Turks the Arabs and anyone else who got in the way certainly all the seeds were planted then in the sense that it was the British who promised the Arabs Independence on the one hand and a Jewish homeland on the other and you could not simply reconcile one with the other the British scattered promises to anyone who might be of some use to them without thinking about the consequences so British duplicity British double dealing went along with way to perpetuate the conflict in Palestine at the end of the day when you're fighting a war you are very liberal in what you're offering in terms of a post-war settlement when you get down to the conference table when the war has ended and you have to start honoring your agreements you then have to decide what's in your interest or not and but you saw the Middle East as a western flank for that power in India and that power in as in general the story of Britain's involvement in the Middle East and the ensuing struggle between Arab and Jew begins with her Colonial past at the beginning of the 20th century King Edward iith ruled over a vast Empire with interests in every part of the world India became increasingly important because uh it was the second pillar of British power in the world moving the Indian army about was extremely important in extending British interests and British influence across the globe and the SE Canal was of course the quick way to do that it's very important for the British geopolitical position to ensure the SE Canal remains safe and [Music] secure with this aim in mind Britain had become the only European power to establish a major foothold in the Middle East in the principalities around the Persian Gulf in Aiden and in Egypt Britain had annexed Egypt from turkey's Ottoman Empire in 1882 and by the time it was made a protectorate in 1914 Cairo had become the center of British power in the Middle East the presence of Imperial troops in the region was of vital strategic importance for the Ottoman Empire under Sultan muhamed I was in

amongst the Allies Russia had long sought access to the Mediterranean in a secret treaty of March 1915 Britain and France offered what was to the zar a prize of vital geopolitical importance Constantinople it is that hey Outlet into the wider world and into the Mediterranean and it is the one thing of course the British and the French have been attempting to prevent the Russians from achieving so this is a complete Volta fche this is this is the British the French and the Russians coming to an agreement over something which was up to this point almost inconceivable Italy's King Victoria Emanuel was another Target for bribery Britain France and Russia tried to tempt Italy a pro- German state to join the Allies in April 1915 a secret treaty offered Italy a substantial bit of Ottoman real estate in Anatolia again it's another power coming into the equation and being offered territorial advancement which in Normal circumstances would have been quite inconceivable the bribe worked Italy joined the allies and declared war on the Central Powers in August 1915 but Britain's strategy to undermine the enemy via the Ottoman Empire also required subversion by using domestic opposition to weaken maybe even destroy it Britain exploited a new movement sweeping through the empire [Music] nationalism nationalism in the sense of believing that there are peoples with a clear cultural identity and that these people should have independent that idea spread to the Middle East as to other parts of the world in the latter part of the 19th century so you had the beginnings in the Ottoman Empire of a Turkish nationalism this came to a head when The Young Turks took power in a coup in 1908 and started to impose their language and culture on the Arabs of the empire but this only reawakened an interest amongst Arabs in their own [Music] Heritage a thousand years before Arabs had brought the technology and literature of the East to the west and their religion Islam had encompassed much of Asia North Africa and Southwestern Europe the idea of recovering that historic grander had remained in the consciousness of Arab intellectuals by the start of the first world war the antagonism between Arab and Turk had increased the very fact that the Turks were saying we want to have a unified empire meant the Arabs said wait a minute we're not part of this so all of this literary and nationalistic Revival then took a much more political form and therefore you got the emergence of Arab nationalism they had arrived at the conclusion that remaining in the Ottoman Empire was becoming hopeless that they couldn't actually share power with the Turks and they began thinking of having their own state by the summer of 1915 British intelligence confirmed that the Arab nationalist movement was the Breakthrough the government was looking for Britain and her French Ally dispatched officers to sound out Arab leaders both the French and the British started you could say seducing various local Arab leaders that if you side with us we'll give you your Independence so why don't you leave the Ottomans and various people were tempted as a result if they they thought they could actually gain independence why not side with the Europeans against the Ottomans the idea was to tempt the Arabs into a revolt against their ottoman overlords and create a diversion which would tie down the Central Powers in the Middle [Music] East ironically the impetus for such a diversion had come not from London but from the Arab world in the hijas in Western Arabia Sheriff Hussein its ruler was set on extending his political and geographical domain he believed he might be able to do it with the help of the British in turn the British were impressed by Sheriff Hussein's family credentials as custodians of the holy places of Islam they called themselves hashimites they're called the family hashimites because that's the family or the tribe of the Prophet Muhammad they were the bani Hashim the sons of Hashim so he was Sharif Hussein was the leader of the hashimites he was the person responsible for Mecca and Medina and although he had worked with the Ottomans before the first world war once the first world war happened he saw this was his chance a chance too for the British who saw support for Sheriff Hussein as a way to threaten the Sultan's hold on the caliphate the political leadership of the Islamic world the briti because they were fighting the Ottomans and the Ottomans were claiming to be the real representative of Islam they wanted a counterforce and the counterforce was represented by Sharif Hussein being a descendant of the Prophet but Sharif Hussein was speaking of liberating Arab lands building a new national state he wanted to be king of the Arabs not simply of Arabians in July 1915 Sheriff Hussein smuggled a message to the British High Commissioner in Cairo Sir Henry mcmah offering to raise a substantial Arab Force against the automans in return for British support for Arab Independence in the ensuing secret correspondence between the two men Sheriff Hussein was given to understand that he could expect British support in achieving some of his Ambitions in the event of an ottoman defeat this letter of October the 26th 1915 outlined the main point point of the arrangement the actual document itself is absolutely Riven with ambiguity there's no doubt about that the question is whether Hussein recognizes that my sense of Hussein is that he does recognize it in other words there is no wool being poured over his eyes because he's perfectly aware that if he's going to create a modern Arab Empire he's going to need some logistical Economic Development and that can only come from the outside world taking Britain's assurances of support at face value Hussein together with his sons fisel and Abdullah amassed a sizable Force the new Army was commanded by the young and charismatic fisel who had captured the imagination of the Arab masses in the Quest for Arab Independence yet even as Hussein and fisel mobilized their troops the British were preparing to sell them short back in London in the spring of 1916 Britain was negotiating with France about the future shape of the Middle East behind closed doors Sir Mark Sykes of the British foreign office had been meeting his French opposite number franois George Pico Britain knew it was vital to offer the French a stake in The Spoils of the Ottoman Empire should they win the war there was an awareness on the British side that they had made such huge sacrifices that one couldn't just ignore um French Ambitions and that French were determined to have their historical piece of the lant poor over a map of the Levant Sykes and Pico personally Drew in the areas they wish to see under their control their secret deal amounted to the virtual carve up of the Middle East in area a for the French and area B for the British the imperialists intended to exercise power indirectly they would appoint advisers and take charge of the finances in their respective spheres of influence then there was the area colored blue which was to be be directly controlled by France this included what was then known as greater Syria where the French traditionally had commercial and religious interests as for the area colored pink known as Iraq with its strategic ports Railways and oil this was to be under British rule the area colored yellow represented Palestine and was envisaged as an international Zone except for Hyer [Music] what the British wanted was the oil of Iraq and they concentrated on getting Iraq and getting away from Iraq to the Mediterranean in order to transport this oil so they got haa on the Palestinian coast and they got most of Iraq the syes Pico agreement was a pretty shameful document and and I wouldn't attempt to defend it but it was drawn up by people who were sort of operating under the old um kind of balance of power considerations in an imperial frame of [Music] mind unaware of these secret dealings behind their backs asan and fisel proclaimed Independence and in June 1916 attacked the Turkish troops the the Arab revolt against the Ottomans had begun the Turkish Garrison at Mecca was soon overrun and the sea port at jida seized by 1917 Hussein and fil's forces had pushed North and engaged the ottoman Turks along the hijaz railway the British saw the Arab Revolt as part of its Strat strategy for creating a military diversion against the Central Powers in a pinsa movement Britain had launched a campaign from the southwest to ensure control of the sez canal and the Levant and from the southeast it was fighting to secure the oil wells of Iraq all this to attack the Central Powers at their weakest point the Ottoman Empire the Arabs hitched their fortunes to the British they considered themselves to be fighting with the Allies but at the same time they were not merged into the British army that they continued to act as an independent Army called the northern Army while the Arab Army Advanced northwards Britain's General Allenby had crossed the sez canal and by the spring of of 1917 his forces had reached the frontier of [Music] Palestine the war in Europe however was still not going well for Britain the attempted push through the German lines at the Som had produced little territorial gain and the cost in lives was colossal in Lon there had been a change of leadership the new prime minister Lloyd George felt that the Allied war effort needed a fresh impetus although America had so far been neutral in the war Lloyd George was convinced that could be changed he believed there was one powerful Group which might influence the American government Lloyd George thought that the American decision um whether to join or not would defend critically on public opinion and the Jewish support could tilt the scales in One Direction or or the other you've got to remember that the British foreign office greatly overestimate the political power of International jewelry particularly the wealthy financial and Commercial uh Jewish Elites what is extraordinary about this situation is that here you have particularly the British seeing the Jewish world as one Collective monolithic entity and in that sense they start looking at the role of the Jews in the war as being something which might be important and from the point of view of the Allies something else quite remarkable this monolithic Collective entity is pro- German many Jews in the upper echelons of German Society did indeed have close connections to the Kaiser's foreign office a new Jewish nationalist movement Zionism had also being able to establish its headquarters in [Music] Berlin Zionism had originated in the 1880s after Theodore Herzel published a book espousing the virtues of a Jewish State this caused a sensation amongst Jewish intellectuals in Germany Austria and Russia who shared herzl's outrage at the escalation of anti-jewish [Music] sentiments the end of the 19th century saw the rise of anti-Semitism all over Europe in Austria in Germany in France but particularly in Eastern Europe in Poland and in Russia and the prgram against the Jews in Russia gave rise to the establishment ofion the lovers of Zion societies uh in a number of Russian cities who started to promote and to finance and to sponsor colonization immigration to Palestine [Music] Herzel came to the conclusion that the Jews were not safe anywhere in Europe and the only solution was for the Jews to have a state of their own over which they could exercise sovereignty and where they would not be a [Music] minority what had also so given Zionism its appeal was the way in which it fitted in to Historic Jewish aspirations scattered throughout the world since the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in the first century ad many Jews had cherished the idea of returning one day to what their scriptures had told them was the promised land in fact there had already been a small community of indigenous Jews in Palestine but even when some European Jews established settlements throughout the late 19th century the whole Jewish Community by 1914 constituted barely 8% of the [Music] population the Zionist leader in Britain Heim vitman had been lobbying the government for a guarantee that in the event of an ottoman defeat it would support Jewish immigration to Palestine by early 19177 Lloyd George's view of Jews as globally influential convinced him that Zionism was another nationalist movement which should be co-opted to the Allied cause in March Mark syes began negotiations with vitman there is a a be in the Bonnet of people like Mark Sykes but actually the Jews do ultimately look to each other and look to their own interest and if that interest as they are being told by vitman is what we really want is Palestine they're prepared to believe it they're prepared to go along with it as negotiations with vitman continued over the following months the war deteriorated rapidly for the [Music] Allies the German sub Marine campaign was seriously weakening Britain's Merchant Fleet and although America had entered the war on the Allied side President woodro Wilson was not yet willing to supply a significant number of troops Britain's latest attempt to keep up the pressure on the Western Front soon became bogged down in the muddy trenches of passionale as thousands of young men's lives were wasted in another fruitless campaign morale amongst the soldiers plummeted but the most serious threat to the Allied War Machine came from the East Russia was on the verge of collapse after massive defeats at the hands of the Germans the war weary country was disintegrating with food shortages strikes and demonstrations when the Zar was deposed in a revolution Britain and France became greatly alarmed the point is that once Russia and its war effort begins to collapse essentially the Germans have won the first World War unless they bring the Americans in there's no way that the British and the French on their own are ever going to defeat [Music] Germany in October the British government received an intelligence report suggesting that Jews were significant influence in the leadership of the Bolshevik party the new revolutionary movement emerging as the dominant force in Russia Lloyd George feared that these Communists would take Russia out of the war with the Americans still refusing to commit sufficient forces he knew it was time to act he instructed his foreign secretary Arthur balour to issue a pledge to capture the hearts and Minds minds of the Jewish people his Majesty's government view with favor The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best Endeavors to facilitate the achievements of this object the balour Declaration was issued on November the 2nd 1917 just as British forces were occupying Palestine I would say that the Balo declaration has to be understood not as an idealistic gesture but it has to be understood within the framework of British Imperial policy and Lloyd George was the main instigator of that uh declaration because he believed that it would serve Britain's interests but this was also the first time that any major European power had given official backing for the Zionist goal of making Palestine into a Jewish homeland yet Sheriff Hussein had understood that Palestine had been promised as part of his deal for Arab Independence anticipating Arab outrage at the prospect of a Jewish homeland in a largely Arab Province the Bal for declaration had also stated that nothing shall be done which may Prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine the Declaration nonetheless appear to indicate British support for Jewish immigration there were only a mere 80,000 out of some like 700,000 people in Palestine who were Jews the in uh indigenous inhabitants of Palestine were referred to as non-jewish inhabitants and that that Palestine was being identified even at that stage as a Jewish land and all the others had no defined identity they were simply non-jewish the baffo Declaration was what it says a declaration it wasn't a treaty it wasn't a signed agreement it was a declaration in support of the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine in fact the only treaty Britain had signed in regard to Palestine was with the French the secret Sykes Pico agreement on November the 7th within a few days of the balour Declaration the Bolsheviks took power in Russia ly George hoped that it would have the desired effect of appeasing the Jews in the Communist leadership what is it that they supposedly so want as Jews je Palestine now the whole argument is is totally illogical it's a nonsense argument because these particular people if one were to think of people like trosky or zinovev or yaff some of the key Jewish leaders in the Russian Revolution the November Revolution these these people of course are internationalists there were 15 to 20 Jews in the higher echelons of the Bolshevik party most of them were anti Zionist and after they came to power they um soon after they came to power they issued a declaration to say that Zionism is a capitalist Ploy a capitalist idea the wildly inaccurate intelligence report on which Lloyd George based his strategy was to have major implications for Britain within weeks Russia's new leaders did exactly the opposite of what he had expected not only did they pull out of the war they opened up the archives of the zaris foreign office and published The Secret treaties the very treaties Britain had engineered with her allies to carve up the Ottoman Empire and to which Russia had been privy that of course is a very great embarrassment to the Western allies because the Allies have been doing all sorts of deals behind the scenes in which they have handed out to each other large sections of the world meanwhile openly preaching that they are fighting the war in defense of democracy and of course also telling among others the Arabs that they are supporters of self-determination for the peoples of the Ottoman Empire publication of the secret treaties by the bolik certainly created an enormous suspicion in the Arab world and this meant that the Sharif Hussein and the others said wait a minute what's going on what a why are you not giving us independence and secondly why are you dividing us up into Zone a and Zone B and at that point of course the Arabs realized that not only were the had the British got their own particular interests for example in the ports of Palestine or in Iraq but that they had promised other things to the [Music] French aid Arab confusion and suspicion General aleny entered Jerusalem on foot together with Sykes Pico and a number of other Allied notables his British Le forces had captured the holy city in December 1917 the leaders of the Arab Revolt however were nowhere to be [Music] seen fearing that Hussein and fisel might lose heart the British government forwarded a message to them reiterating British commitment to Arab Independence the Arab race shall be given full opportunity of once again forming a nation in the world this can only be achieved by the Arabs themselves uniting and Great Britain and her allies will pursue a policy with this ultimate unity in view Hussein stayed loyal to the Allied cause still prepared to accept Britain's word on Arab Independence although he spoke of settling accounts after the war from alam's point of view he continued to rely on Arab support in the war against the Ottomans but now that Jerusalem had been occupied by the British one party seized the initiative in April 1918 Heim vitman and the international Zionist commissioner traveled to Palestine to lay the foundation for a Hebrew University their Hope was that it would become the intellectual Hub of Zionism vman's visit however caused widespread alarm and indignation among the Arab population and when he and the chief Rabbi of Jerusalem met General alanby it looked as if Britain Was preparing to honor the balfor Declaration 6 months later alam's forces entered Damascus with their Ally fil's Northern army they had pushed the ottoman troops North through Palestine into Syria the Arab Revolt did contribute to the victory of the allies first of all it protected the British flank in Palestine second it kept a number of Turkish and German troops preoccupied and third the the British could have never legitimized what they were doing unless they had the blessing of a particular Arab Force [Music] on the 3rd of October the people of Damascus flocked to fil's Victory Parade if he was to seize power he knew it was of great importance to make his presence felt and to be seen by the Arab people as their [Music] liberator later the same day however fisel met with General alanby at the Victoria Hotel in Damascus Allenby warned him that his rule in Syria would be [Music] limited the British by that time knew that they were going to hand over Syria to the French so they couldn't actually accept faad as a legitimate Ruler all they could do is to pay him uh his salary and the expenses of his army and his administration undaunted by alen's warnings fisel assumed the title of governor of Damascus with the support of his father Sheriff Hussein he set about creating a power base for their goal of an independent Arab state on the 31st of October the Ottomans were finally [Music] defeated and at 11:00 on the 11th of November 1918 the guns fell silent in Europe as the war with the Central Powers came to an [Music] end the peace conference at Versailles began in January 1919 representatives of the Victorious allies such as the French prime minister clo and the American president woodro Wilson gathered to sort out what was to be done with the former territories of the defeated Empires now the liberal use of promises by the British government had to be prioritized they did indeed make pledges to the Arabs but they also made pledges to the Jews and they also made pledges to the French and the Russians and everybody else and these people saw the world as an imperial world not only did they want to carve out the Middle East they wanted to carve up Russia they thought this was the last great moment in which the Imperial Powers would be able to sit down and grab what was going particularly since there was no one to stop them but Britain and her old Ally France were up against the American President woodro Wilson's vision of a new world order which promoted National self-determination Nation once Independence had seemed to be a possibility that this principle of self-determination uh supported by the Americans was going to be offered to all those who were to be liberated from former Empires like the hapsburgs and the Ottomans what the Palestinians wanted was an independent state in fact fisel had come from Damascus to plead the the Arab cause but the future of Palestine in the Middle East formed part of Britain's pledge to France in the syes Pico car up in the event woodro Wilson's principles about self-determination were forgotten when it came to the people of the Middle East Britain and France were free to go ahead with their agreement but what of the promises Britain had made to the Jews regarding Palestine foreign secretary Arthur Baler in a confidential memo during the Versa peace talks with America France and Italy wrote the four Great powers are committed to Zionism and Zionism be it right or wrong good or bad is rooted in agong Traditions in present leads in future hopes of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land that might sound like a warm endorsement of Zionism yet further in the post-war memorandum balur hints at a much more cynical agenda so far as Palestine is concerned the powers have made no Declaration of policy which at least in letter they have not always intended to [Music] violate the verai peace conference was concluded on June the 28th 1919 with the creation of the League of Nations the first Global Institution for peace and security its Covenant provided that the Arab and other territories seeded by the defeated Ottoman Empire should be administered by mandates which meant in effect that Britain and France were given the authority to impose their rule over the Arab [Music] territories on November the 21st 1919 franois George Pico the co-architect of the Sykes Pico agreement and the French General guro arrived in beut and so began the imposition of the French mandate for Syria and [Applause] Lebanon the British forces who had occupied the region since ounting the ottoman Turks during the last months of the war were handing over power to the French thus fulfilling their wartime pledge fisel who had been the governor of Damascus now for 16 months had been consolidating his position when he was proclaimed King by the Syrian National Congress the French were incensed and general guro sent in his troops by August the 7th 1920 fisel had been deposed and had to flee to [Music] Palestine the promises to Sharif Hussein and fisel of a single independent state were now a distant memory for the Europeans the whole issue of spheres of influence meant that what appeared what was at first appeared to be willingness to accept a single Arab state was in fact seriously diluted and then on top of that of course the very fact of there being at French area and a British area meant that in effect this was the seed of partition so you had both Independence was denied but also the unity of this area was denied the boundaries and governments of the middle eastern states that emerged bore the unmistakable imprint of the Sykes Pico agreement the French half of the previously ottoman province of great Assyria became the Mandate for Lebanon and Syria the other half became the British mandate for Trans Jordan and Palestine in the East the ottoman area of Mesopotamia which included the oil fields of mul was given to Britain as the Mandate for Iraq so this was basically the importance of the sapo agreement to divide what is called the Fertile Crescent between Iraq and Syria and let Britain get access to the oil of the area and be able to exploit it in the future but British rule was initially rejected by the Iraqi people until fisel was installed as King in July 1921 Britain hoped The Limited Pate devolved to him would serve to bate the frustrated demands for Arab Independence but Sheriff Hussein expected more from the British he never gave up the idea that the British had promised him Independence not only in Arabia but in Syria and Iraq as well and he wanted the British to fulfill their promises Sheriff Hussein's dream of an Arab Kingdom ruled by the hashemites was only partially fulfilled for although his other son Abdullah became king of trans Jordan their old rival ibin saoud swept the hash ites out of hijaz when he conquered the whole of the Arabian peninsula in Jerusalem an Administration was established by the British in the spring of 1920 there were no plans for devolving power in Palestine Palestine was a land sacred to three religions Jews were a small minority who had lived harmoniously with Christians and the much larger community of Muslims for hundreds of [Music] years but the balfor Declaration promising Jews a homeland in Palestine had been incorporated into the British mandate at Versailles Palestine was thus to be open for new European Jewish immigration with celebrations and parades in support of Zionist activities it seemed as if the British were going to honor their pledges to the Jews and ignore Palestinian hopes of Independence the Arabs had a strong case but very poor Advocates um the zionists had a case it wasn't as strong as that of the local Arabs but they had brilliant Advocates Zionism is one of the greatest Public Relation success stories of the 20th century and K vitman exemplified these traditional Jewish skills of advocacy and uh persuasion some of these skills were clearly in evidence when vitman and various Zionist groups helped finance land purchases and the building of settlements for immigrant Jews at the same time political and security organizations were created to support the emerging Jewish homeland the Arab community in Palestine was [Music] incensed the Palestinians couldn't conceive their country being divided or given away to another Community H which had nothing to do with the Middle East in the first place and was almost holy European at the time so to them it seemed absurd that 600 to 700,000 should give up their land their homes their Villages their towns and hand them over to a minority which was dispersed uh throughout Palestine and Palestine after all is named after Ser its people who are the Palestinians in 1925 Arthur balur tour the new Jewish settlements in Palestine although he was fated as a hero of the Zionist cause the immigration of European Jews was to have unforeseen consequences for British rule in Palestine I believe that the Balo declaration was one of the most serious mistakes in British imperial history it uh committed Britain to uh support of Jewish nationalism in Palestine after the war and uh it did not uh produce any immediate benefits for Britain without the Bala declaration there could have been no genuine development of a Jewish National home and the follow through in 1948 where you get the creation of a state of Israel simply would not have happened it requires the umbrella of the British to be there in effect to support the emerging Jewish National home militarily at the bottom line the very fact that there are British troops British policemen there to protect the Jewish communities is ultimately Central to the situation it could not have been done in any other [Music] way throughout the 1930s and 40s the years of Nazi persecution and the Holocaust Jewish immigration to Palestine increased rapidly but what was seen by the Arabs as an alien incursion and the Jews as a fulfillment of historic rights led to polarization and violence in response to ter terrorist acts by Arabs Britain restricted the immigration but the policy only stimulated Jewish terrorism against this background Britain relinquished its mandate and the state of Israel was born in 1948 when the first of several Wars between the new state and its Arab neighbors began thousands of Palestinian Arabs fled their [Music] Homeland thus the Strategies employed by Britain to win the first world war inadvertently left a deep divide between Arab and Jew the most serious consequences of British policy during the war was the encouragement of Arab nationalism and Jewish nationalism and in the aftermath of the first World War was left with this Legacy of double dealing and of betrayal which was to haunt her for a long long time clearly it played a role in dividing the Arab world into different states in allowing the establishment of the state of Israel and in frustrating Arab desires but if what happened in syes Pico and everything else that happened in the first world war is used as an excuse for the problems of the Middle East now I I think that would be a mistake but yes the roots of what we see today certainly arose from the double dealing of the first world war and from the frustrated expectations of that [Music] time"

11,fGH94HoSJ2s," This is the Balfour Declaration. Signed in 1917, 
It set out British support for the creation of a   homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine. It’s 
a famous document, a crucial piece of the puzzle   in understanding today’s conflicts in the middle 
east. But this it the beginning of the story.  In fact, when the Balfour declaration was signed 
the British had already promised this land to   Arabs as an independent state and promised 
the French government that it would be an   internationally administered zone – and even then, 
most of the land was still under Ottoman control.  So why did Britain make these three conflicting 
promises? How did it try to resolve them? And   how did Britain’s strategy in the Middle 
East help to cause a century of conflict? How's that is that okay? That's good yeah. Well at the turn in 20th century Britain's 
primary interest in the Middle East isn't oil,   we might think of oil, oil and the Middle East 
they always sort of go together especially now.   But what we're really looking at then is an 
imperial lifeline it's the Suez Canal. The   Suez Canal is the quickest route from the 
Empire, especially India the jewel in the   crown of the British Empire, to Britain. You don't 
have to go all the way around the horn of Africa. Britain had controlled Egypt since 
1882 and believed that the Sinai   Desert was enough of a buffer to defend 
the canal. But when the First World War   began in 1914 the Ottoman Empire 
took Germany's side. In February   1915 the Ottomans launched a surprise attack 
across the desert to attack the Suez Canal. It's easily beaten off by the British and Indian 
defenders, but the British are really worried that   the Ottomans are going to use Sinai as a launchpad 
for further attacks on the canal. There's then a   total mind change in British strategy back in 
London. There's stalemate on the Western Front,   the Russians are collapsing into revolution, 
and the idea now is to look for a quick victory   somewhere else away from France and Flanders. And 
Lloyd George thinks Palestine is where we can do   it. We can knock the Ottomans out of the war, but 
also the Suez Canal will be safe from any threat. The area Britain had set its sights on was 
a larger one than today's Israel/Palestine,   made up of different regions east and 
west of the River Jordan. There were   small Christian and Jewish populations, 
but the majority were Muslim Arabs.   After centuries of Ottoman rule many many 
Arabs now wanted a nation of their own. Nationalism is growing across the multinational 
empires of Europe during the late 19th and early   20th centuries and the Ottoman Empire is no 
stranger to this. The main reason for this   is in 1908 there's a revolution within Turkey 
to try to strengthen and modernise the Empire,   it's called the Young Turk Revolution. And what 
happens is some very nationalistic Turks take over   the government and are really into centralizing 
and pushing the idea of Turkish identity. And this   really starts to rile a lot of these Arab 
leaders and this is where we start to get   Pan-Arab nationalism coming up and the idea of one 
independent land for all of those Arab peoples. One of those leaders was Sharif Hussein 
of Mecca. In charge of the Islamic holy   cities of Mecca and Medina, he was held in high 
regard by the local people. The British decided   to use this to their advantage, promising him 
rulership over an independent Arab state if   he rebelled against Ottoman rule. Sure enough in 
1916 the revolt began with Hussein's sons Faisal   and Abdullah leading the fighting. As British 
and Commonwealth troops under General Allenby   advanced through Palestine. Arab militia with 
help from T. E. Lawrence distracted the Ottomans. This is a typical Arab head cloth and its 
accompanying agal which is the headband that   you keep the head cloth firmly on your head. And 
these were actually worn by an Arab who took part   in in that Arab Revolt up through the Hejaz and 
into Palestine and Syria towards the end of the   war. This comes from the regular forces of the 
Sharifian Army these men were former Ottoman   soldiers and they volunteered to fight for 
Arab Independence. And they were particularly   important because of their previous military 
training and skills with modern weapons such   as artillery and machine guns. So these men of the 
Arab forces, they attack lines of communication,   they blow up railways, they attack small 
garrisons, and that makes it very difficult for   the Ottomans to move troops and supplies around. 
And finally of course on the 1st of October 1918,   Faisal and the Arab army have the honor 
of taking the surrender of Damascus. But while the battle for Palestine was still 
raging, the British were doing secret backroom   deals elsewhere. Between November 1915 and 
January 1916 British and French diplomats   Mark Sykes and Francois George Picot carved 
up the Ottoman Empire into British and French   spheres of influence. The borders were largely 
arbitrary, with little regard for ethnicity or   religion of the local populations. France would 
receive modern day Syria and Lebanon as well as   parts of Turkey and Iraq while Britain claimed the 
rest of modern day Iraq and southern and eastern   Palestine. The remainder of the territory 
was to be under International control. What the British are really looking for is an 
extra large buffer zone again for the Suez Canal,   it's all about the Suez Canal. The idea of making 
Palestine an international area, is really because   the British don't want to give this to the 
French, but the French don't want the British   to have it. So it's a compromise and in fact this 
whole agreement is a compromise. It's a wartime   compromise between two countries that happen to 
be allies, but are both still big political and   imperial rivals and they will go back to being 
imperial rivals after the First World War. Having already made commitments to Arab 
nationalists and the French government,   in November 1917 the British made one more promise 
regarding the land in Palestine, this time to   Zionists seeking to set up a national Jewish 
State. Zionism was a social movement that began   in the 1800s. It was founded on the belief that 
Judaism was not only a religion but a nationality   and that Jewish people deserved a state like 
British or French people did. Due to historical   and religious ties to the region, Palestine became 
the desired location for this future Jewish state. So this armband or brassard was worn by a 
Palestinian Jewish volunteer with British forces   serving in that area of the Middle East during 
1918. Interestingly there were three battalions   of Jewish volunteers, one battalion of British, 
one of Americans, and one of Palestinian Jews.   The British volunteers weren't really interested 
in Zionism at all, they were more interested in   using that military service, service to the crown 
to assimilate into British society. It was really   the American volunteers and the local Jewish 
volunteers from Palestine who were really fired   up by Zionism and wanted to use this to defeat the 
Ottoman Empire and secure that Jewish homeland. So   what this object shows us and the story behind it 
is that although Zionism was a popular movement,   the majority of Jews were not Zionists 
and didn't want to move to Palestine. Jewish immigration to Palestine had been slowly 
increasing throughout the 1900s, mainly fueled   by brutal antisemitic and terrible pogroms in 
Russia. By 1914 the Jews in Palestine numbered   around 60,000 or 8% of the population. But for the 
British it was Zionists elsewhere that they were   concerned with. In an effort to win the support 
of Jewish communities in both Allied countries   like the United States, and enemy countries 
like Austria Hungary, the UK foreign secretary   signed the Balfour declaration. Vowing to set up a 
national home for the Jewish people in Palestine. So the Balfour for declaration is signed 
in late 1917, in fact just after Allenby's   victory at the Third Battle of Gaza and 
this map shows the situation just before   that battle. And it shows the confidence the 
British have that they are going to win the   war in the Middle East. Let's face it, on 
this map, they haven't taken all of this   territory yet but they're already looking 
at the postwar settlement in this area. There are people within the British cabinet, Prime 
Minister Lloyd George is one of them, who thinks   that having a Jewish homeland in Palestine is 
the right thing to do. But it's also politically   expedient. The British and French War efforts 
by this time are pretty much under pressure,   there's a manpower crisis, there's a crisis in 
raw materials. The Americans have joined the war   in April 1917 and we really need the Americans to 
to ramp up and get stuck into the war effort. So   the idea is by supporting this Zionist idea it 
will get Jewish financiers and industrialists   in America on side and they will put big pressure 
on the American government to keep them involved   in the First World War and fight for the Allied 
cause. This idea, this is an antisemitic idea   that the Jews control world finance and business 
across capitalist countries. And that idea takes   hold and is one of the reasons we think they 
can put pressure on the American government. The declaration was vague. It said that 
the homeland would be ""in Palestine"",   but didn't say where. It also vowed to 
protect ""civil and religious rights of   existing non-Jewish communities"" but made 
no mention of their political rights. For the British these conflicting promises 
were worth making to assure that they came   out on top in the world's first Total War. And 
they were effective, Britain and France were   victorious over the Central Powers in 1918. But 
now that the war was at an end, the British would   have to face the consequences. The choices they 
made would help to spark a century of conflict. Having captured Damascus in 1918, the British 
military left Faisal and his men in charge of   a military occupation zone, an area that 
Faisal declared the Arab Kingdom of Syria.   However the French were not happy. Hoping to 
maintain their influence in the region they   expelled Faisal in a short war. It was 
a crushing blow to the pan-Arab cause. Instead it was the victorious Allied Powers 
who drew the new borders of the Middle East   in a series of conferences from 1919 to 1923. 
With the formation of the League of Nations,   Britain and France took control under a series 
of mandates. These were intended to prepare   the local populations for independence. 
Initially France was given the mandates   for Syria and Lebanon while Britain was 
given the mandates for Mesopotamia and   Palestine. But after Faisal's defeat the 
British decided to split Palestine in two.   Faisal was given the crown of Mesopotamia and 
his brother Abdullah was given the crown of the   newly created Transjordan. The remainder 
of Palestine would be strictly British. So this 1924 map shows the Palestine that 
came into being after the First World War.   It is not part of a pan-Arab state, in 
fact there is no pan Arab state in this   region. Also it is not an internationally 
controlled area or an area in which the   French have any control at all. It is a 
British administered League of Nations   mandate. What this Mandate for Palestine 
does have however written into its statute   is the Balfour Declaration of a home 
for the Jewish people in Palestine. Jewish immigration to mandatory Palestine continue 
to grow. By 1931 there were 176,000 Jewish people   living there, making up 17% of the population. 
This led to increased tensions, riots, and   violence between the new arrivals and local Arabs, 
who, along with existing Christian populations,   were starting to see themselves not only as 
Arabs but as distinctly Palestinian people. What these new Jewish settlers bring 
in is lots of financial backing and   they start to buy up more and more land. 
So it's more of the fertile agricultural   land of Palestine which actually makes the 
Jewish population increasingly economically   dominant in the area. The British government 
gets very very worried about this. In 1930   the Colonial Secretary puts forward a white 
paper to drastically limit Jewish immigration   into the Palestine mandate. The following 
year 1931, pressure from Zionists within   the British government and also World Zionist 
leaders talks Ramsey McDonald in to dropping   the white paper. And from that moment there is 
no limit on Jewish immigration into Palestine. This reversal coincided with events elsewhere 
that would supercharge the conflict. In 1933   Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany and 
began instituting a wave of antisemitic   policies. This sent shock waves through the 
Jewish communities of Europe. However for   those seeking to flee options were few, with most 
governments maintaining strict limits on Jewish   immigration. For many Jews, Zionists or not, 
traveling to Palestine became the only option. By 1936 the Jewish contingent inside 
Mandatory Palestine had doubled to 28%   of the population. Now tensions began to 
escalate at an alarming rate what began as   a general strike among Palestinian Arabs in 
1936 devolved into violent attacks on Jewish   settlements and British military installations. 
This event became known as The Great Revolt. From this point really you can see 
Palestinian Arab nationalism as opposed   to pan-Arab nationalism. They're fighting 
against an issue, that Jewish homeland and   British control in the region, that no other 
mandate or any other has to fight against.   And they want their own Palestinian State, an 
independent country free from British control. The British response was to crush the revolt as 
quickly as possible with overwhelming strength.   They brought a surge of new troops, more 
men than were serving in India at the time,   and declared martial law in 1937. Favoring tactics 
of collective punishment they destroyed homes   and burned villages to the ground, they 
used aerial bombing even on urban areas,   and arrested killed or exiled Arab 
leaders fracturing their movement. In addition the British use Jewish auxiliary 
units to fight the Arabs during the revolt.   But this is a real turnaround from 1921 
when they disband the Jewish Legion. Now   in 1936/37 the British are so overstretched 
that they really don't care. They just need   boots on the ground to sort this situation 
out and to end this revolt as quickly as   possible. So by the end of the Arab Revolt 17% 
of the Arab male population are either killed,   wounded, imprisoned, or exiled. This 
really weakens the Arab cause in   Palestine just at the moment when the Jewish 
population is getting more and more power."," This is the Balfour Declaration. Signed in 1917, 
It set out British support for the creation of a   homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine. It’s 
a famous document, a crucial piece of the puzzle   in understanding today’s conflicts in the middle 
east. But this it the beginning of the story.  In fact, when the Balfour declaration was signed 
the British had already promised this land to   Arabs as an independent state and promised 
the French government that it would be an   internationally administered zone – and even then, 
most of the land was still under Ottoman control.  So why did Britain make these three conflicting 
promises? How did it try to resolve them? And   how did Britain’s strategy in the Middle 
East help to cause a century of conflict? How's that is that okay? That's good yeah. Well at the turn in 20th century Britain's 
primary interest in the Middle East isn't oil,   we might think of oil, oil and the Middle East 
they always sort of go together especially now.   But what we're really looking at then is an 
imperial lifeline it's the Suez Canal. The   Suez Canal is the quickest route from the 
Empire, especially India the jewel in the   crown of the British Empire, to Britain. You don't 
have to go all the way around the horn of Africa. Britain had controlled Egypt since 
1882 and believed that the Sinai   Desert was enough of a buffer to defend 
the canal. But when the First World War   began in 1914 the Ottoman Empire 
took Germany's side. In February   1915 the Ottomans launched a surprise attack 
across the desert to attack the Suez Canal. It's easily beaten off by the British and Indian 
defenders, but the British are really worried that   the Ottomans are going to use Sinai as a launchpad 
for further attacks on the canal. There's then a   total mind change in British strategy back in 
London. There's stalemate on the Western Front,   the Russians are collapsing into revolution, 
and the idea now is to look for a quick victory   somewhere else away from France and Flanders. And 
Lloyd George thinks Palestine is where we can do   it. We can knock the Ottomans out of the war, but 
also the Suez Canal will be safe from any threat. The area Britain had set its sights on was 
a larger one than today's Israel/Palestine,   made up of different regions east and 
west of the River Jordan. There were   small Christian and Jewish populations, 
but the majority were Muslim Arabs.   After centuries of Ottoman rule many many 
Arabs now wanted a nation of their own. Nationalism is growing across the multinational 
empires of Europe during the late 19th and early   20th centuries and the Ottoman Empire is no 
stranger to this. The main reason for this   is in 1908 there's a revolution within Turkey 
to try to strengthen and modernise the Empire,   it's called the Young Turk Revolution. And what 
happens is some very nationalistic Turks take over   the government and are really into centralizing 
and pushing the idea of Turkish identity. And this   really starts to rile a lot of these Arab 
leaders and this is where we start to get   Pan-Arab nationalism coming up and the idea of one 
independent land for all of those Arab peoples. One of those leaders was Sharif Hussein 
of Mecca. In charge of the Islamic holy   cities of Mecca and Medina, he was held in high 
regard by the local people. The British decided   to use this to their advantage, promising him 
rulership over an independent Arab state if   he rebelled against Ottoman rule. Sure enough in 
1916 the revolt began with Hussein's sons Faisal   and Abdullah leading the fighting. As British 
and Commonwealth troops under General Allenby   advanced through Palestine. Arab militia with 
help from T. E. Lawrence distracted the Ottomans. This is a typical Arab head cloth and its 
accompanying agal which is the headband that   you keep the head cloth firmly on your head. And 
these were actually worn by an Arab who took part   in in that Arab Revolt up through the Hejaz and 
into Palestine and Syria towards the end of the   war. This comes from the regular forces of the 
Sharifian Army these men were former Ottoman   soldiers and they volunteered to fight for 
Arab Independence. And they were particularly   important because of their previous military 
training and skills with modern weapons such   as artillery and machine guns. So these men of the 
Arab forces, they attack lines of communication,   they blow up railways, they attack small 
garrisons, and that makes it very difficult for   the Ottomans to move troops and supplies around. 
And finally of course on the 1st of October 1918,   Faisal and the Arab army have the honor 
of taking the surrender of Damascus. But while the battle for Palestine was still 
raging, the British were doing secret backroom   deals elsewhere. Between November 1915 and 
January 1916 British and French diplomats   Mark Sykes and Francois George Picot carved 
up the Ottoman Empire into British and French   spheres of influence. The borders were largely 
arbitrary, with little regard for ethnicity or   religion of the local populations. France would 
receive modern day Syria and Lebanon as well as   parts of Turkey and Iraq while Britain claimed the 
rest of modern day Iraq and southern and eastern   Palestine. The remainder of the territory 
was to be under International control. What the British are really looking for is an 
extra large buffer zone again for the Suez Canal,   it's all about the Suez Canal. The idea of making 
Palestine an international area, is really because   the British don't want to give this to the 
French, but the French don't want the British   to have it. So it's a compromise and in fact this 
whole agreement is a compromise. It's a wartime   compromise between two countries that happen to 
be allies, but are both still big political and   imperial rivals and they will go back to being 
imperial rivals after the First World War. Having already made commitments to Arab 
nationalists and the French government,   in November 1917 the British made one more promise 
regarding the land in Palestine, this time to   Zionists seeking to set up a national Jewish 
State. Zionism was a social movement that began   in the 1800s. It was founded on the belief that 
Judaism was not only a religion but a nationality   and that Jewish people deserved a state like 
British or French people did. Due to historical   and religious ties to the region, Palestine became 
the desired location for this future Jewish state. So this armband or brassard was worn by a 
Palestinian Jewish volunteer with British forces   serving in that area of the Middle East during 
1918. Interestingly there were three battalions   of Jewish volunteers, one battalion of British, 
one of Americans, and one of Palestinian Jews.   The British volunteers weren't really interested 
in Zionism at all, they were more interested in   using that military service, service to the crown 
to assimilate into British society. It was really   the American volunteers and the local Jewish 
volunteers from Palestine who were really fired   up by Zionism and wanted to use this to defeat the 
Ottoman Empire and secure that Jewish homeland. So   what this object shows us and the story behind it 
is that although Zionism was a popular movement,   the majority of Jews were not Zionists 
and didn't want to move to Palestine. Jewish immigration to Palestine had been slowly 
increasing throughout the 1900s, mainly fueled   by brutal antisemitic and terrible pogroms in 
Russia. By 1914 the Jews in Palestine numbered   around 60,000 or 8% of the population. But for the 
British it was Zionists elsewhere that they were   concerned with. In an effort to win the support 
of Jewish communities in both Allied countries   like the United States, and enemy countries 
like Austria Hungary, the UK foreign secretary   signed the Balfour declaration. Vowing to set up a

in late 1917, in fact just after Allenby's   victory at the Third Battle of Gaza and 
this map shows the situation just before   that battle. And it shows the confidence the 
British have that they are going to win the   war in the Middle East. Let's face it, on

THOUSANDS OF ISRAELIS WOULD MOVE TO THOSE TERRITORIES AND SETTLE, VIOLATING INTERNATIONAL LAW SET BY THE UNITED NATIONS.  PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE GROUPS STEPPED UP TERROR ATTACKS. A TACTIC BACKED BY THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, OR PLO, WHICH STARTED TO REPRESENT PALESTINIANS ON THE WORLD STAGE IN THE MID-1960'S. THIS INCLUDED AIRLINER HIJACKINGS AND THE 1972 MUNICH OLYMPIC MASSACRE, A TERRORIST ATTACK THAT PLAYED OUT ON TELEVISION SCREENS ACROSS THE WORLD AND ENDED WITH THE DEATHS OF 11 ISRAELIS, ONE GERMAN POLICE OFFICER, AND FIVE PALESTINIAN GUNMEN.  THEN, IN DECEMBER 1987, A COMBINATION OF FACTORS LED TO LARGELY SPONTANEOUS PALESTINIAN PROTESTS, CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, AND VIOLENT ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAELI SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS. IT WAS THE FIRST PALESTINIAN INTIFADA, OR ""UPRISING."" THE ISRAELI MILITARY RESPONDED WITH BRUTAL FORCE, AND OUT OF THE FIRST INTIFADA EMERGED HAMAS. >> WHEN HAMAS EMERGED UNDER ISRAELI MILITARY OCCUPATION, THE ISRAELI APPROACH WAS TO TOLERATE IT. JOHN: YOSSI ALPHER IS A FORMER MOSSAD OFFICIAL AND FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE JAFFEE CENTER FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES AT TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY. >> IT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE STRICTLY RELIGIOUS, NOT POLITICAL.

JOHN: A DISTANCE THAT, FOR PALESTINIANS, PROVED TOO FAR. THE INTIFADA LASTED ANOTHER FOUR YEARS. ALMOST 2000 WERE KILLED, WITH PALESTINIAN DEATHS OUTNUMBERING ISRAELI DEATHS THREE TO ONE.  HOPE FOR PEACE CAME IN 1993, WHEN THE PLO AND ISRAEL SIGNED THE FIRST OSLO ACCORDS, THE PRODUCT OF SECRET TALKS OVERSEEN BY THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT. BOTH SIDES COMMITTED TO NEGOTIATING AN END TO THE CONFLICT AND CHARTING A PATH TO PALESTINIAN SELF-RULE IN THE WEST BANK AND GAZA.

A YEAR LATER, SHARON LED A MARCH ON THE TEMPLE MOUNT TO ASSERT ISRAELI CLAIMS TO THE BITTERLY-CONTESTED SITE.  THE STREETS OF EAST JERUSALEM AND RAMALLAH IN THE WEST BANK ERUPTED IN VIOLENCE.  THE SECOND INTIFADA WAS UNDERWAY. FIVE YEARS OF PALESTINIAN SUICIDE BOMBERS DETONATING THEMSELVES IN ISRAELI BUSES AND CAFES.  SHARON, BY THEN PRIME MINISTER, ORDERED ISRAELI TROOPS INTO THE WEST BANK AND GAZA. THE SECOND INTIFADA'S DEATH TOLL SURPASSED 4300 PEOPLE. AGAIN, MORE PALESTINIANS THAN ISRAELIS. >> RATHER THAN IMMEDIATELY CLAMP DOWN IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE PEACE PROCESS, ARAFAT CYNICALLY THOUGHT THAT THE VIOLENCE WOULD ACT AS LEVERAGE. THIS IS A TOTAL MISREADING OF DYNAMICS ON THE ISRAELI SIDE, A TOTAL STRATEGIC MISTAKE.  THE SECOND INTIFADA KILLED ANY RESIDUAL READINESS ON THE PART OF THE ISRAELI PUBLIC TO BACK THE OSLO PROCESS AND TO CONTINUE TURNING OVER TERRITORIES. JOHN: ISRAEL BEGAN BUILDING A SECURITY WALL BETWEEN THE WEST BANK AND ISRAEL, AND RENEWED EXPANSION OF WEST BANK JEWISH SETTLEMENTS. IN LATE 2003, PRIME MINISTER SHARON PROPOSED UNILATERALLY PULLING ALL ISRAELI TROOPS FROM GAZA AND DISMANTLING THE SETTLEMENTS THERE. >> IT PAINS ME A LOT, BUT I'VE REACHED A DECISION AND I AM GOING TO CARRY IT OUT. JOHN: IN AUGUST 2005, SOME 8000 ISRAELI SETTLERS ABANDONED 21 SETTLEMENTS. ISRAEL GAVE UP ALL GOVERNING AUTHORITY INSIDE GAZA, BUT CONTINUED TO CONTROL ITS BORDERS. THE NEXT YEAR, HAMAS WON GAZA'S FIRST LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS IN A DECADE. FATAH, THE PARTY AFFILIATED WITH THE PLO, PLACED SECOND. TENSIONS AMONG PALESTINIAN FACTIONS WOULD GO FROM BAD TO WORSE. THE HAMAS LEADERS IN GAZA PRESSED THEIR HARD LINE TOWARD ISRAEL. >> ISRAEL IS OUR ENEMY WHO OCCUPIED OUR LAND AND KILLED OUR LEADERS AND DEMOLISHED OUR HOMES AND JAILED OUR SONS AND UPROOTED OUR TREES. WE WILL NEVER BE ITS ALLY. JOHN: HAMAS ROUTED FATAH FROM GAZA IN EARLY 2007, PUTTING CONTROL OF THE TERRITORIES UNDER DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS. GAZA RULED BY HAMAS, AND THE WEST BANK GOVERNED BY THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY. ISRAEL IMPOSED A BLOCKADE ON GAZA, LIMITING THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS AND PEOPLE IN AND OUT. IT WAS, IN PART, A RESPONSE TO CONTINUED HAMAS ATTACKS OUT OF THE GAZA STRIP. THE U.N. SAYS THE BLOCKADE HAS DEEPENED THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS FOR THE MORE THAN TWO MILLION PALESTINIANS LIVING THERE.  >> YOU CAN IMAGINE SOCIALLY, POLITICALLY, PERSONALLY, ETHICALLY WHAT THAT MEANT.

RECURRING ROCKET FIRE FROM GAZA INTO ISRAEL HAS LED TO A SERIES OF MAJOR ISRAELI AIR AND GROUND ASSAULTS ON GAZA.  MORE RECENTLY, THERE'S BEEN FRICTION OVER ISRAELI RESTRICTIONS BARRING YOUNG MUSLIM MEN FROM VISITING THE AL AQSA MOSQUE ON TEMPLE MOUNT, AND EARLIER THIS MONTH, OVER ISRAELI SETTLERS GATHERING AT THE MOSQUE FOR JEWISH PRAYERS.

AND ABOVE IT, TEMPLE MOUNT, ALSO HALLOWED GROUND FOR MUSLIMS, WHO REFER TO IT AS AL HARAM AL-SHARIF, THE NOBLE SANCTUARY. IN 1948, ISRAEL DECLARED INDEPENDENCE, WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY THE FIRST OF WHAT WOULD BE MANY WARS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ITS ARAB NEIGHBORS.  HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ARABS WERE EVICTED. AN EVENT KNOWN IN THE ARAB WORLD AS THE NAKBA, ""THE CATASTROPHE."" MORE THAN HALF A MILLION FLED TO REFUGEE CAMPS IN THE WEST BANK, GAZA, JORDAN, LEBANON, AND SYRIA.  >> SOME WERE EXPELLED BY FORCE, SOME WERE TERRORIZED AND FLED.  JOHN: HISTORIAN YEZID SAYIGH WAS A PALESTINIAN NEGOTIATOR IN PEACE TALKS IN THE 1990'S.  >> THESE WERE THE PEOPLE WHO WENT FROM BEING FARMERS AND PEASANTS TO BEING REFUGEES TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON HANDOUTS.   JOHN: IN 1967, WITH STUNNING SPEED, ISRAEL DEFEATED A SURPRISE ATTACK BY EGYPT, JORDAN, AND SYRIA IN THE SIX-DAY WAR. SEIZING GAZA FROM EGYPT, THE GOLAN HEIGHTS FROM SYRIA, AND FROM JORDAN, THE WEST BANK AND THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN OF THREE FAITHS, EAST JERUSALEM. THOUSANDS OF ISRAELIS WOULD MOVE TO THOSE TERRITORIES AND SETTLE, VIOLATING INTERNATIONAL LAW SET BY THE UNITED NATIONS.  PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE GROUPS STEPPED UP TERROR ATTACKS. A TACTIC BACKED BY THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, OR PLO, WHICH STARTED TO REPRESENT PALESTINIANS ON THE WORLD STAGE IN THE MID-1960'S. THIS INCLUDED AIRLINER HIJACKINGS AND THE 1972 MUNICH OLYMPIC MASSACRE, A TERRORIST ATTACK THAT PLAYED OUT ON TELEVISION SCREENS ACROSS THE WORLD AND ENDED WITH THE DEATHS OF 11 ISRAELIS, ONE GERMAN POLICE OFFICER, AND FIVE PALESTINIAN GUNMEN.  THEN, IN DECEMBER 1987, A COMBINATION OF FACTORS LED TO LARGELY SPONTANEOUS PALESTINIAN PROTESTS, CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, AND VIOLENT ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAELI SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS. IT WAS THE FIRST PALESTINIAN INTIFADA, OR ""UPRISING."" THE ISRAELI MILITARY RESPONDED WITH BRUTAL FORCE, AND OUT OF THE FIRST INTIFADA EMERGED HAMAS. >> WHEN HAMAS EMERGED UNDER ISRAELI MILITARY OCCUPATION, THE ISRAELI APPROACH WAS TO TOLERATE IT. JOHN: YOSSI ALPHER IS A FORMER MOSSAD OFFICIAL AND FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE JAFFEE CENTER FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES AT TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY. >> IT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE STRICTLY RELIGIOUS, NOT POLITICAL. THAT ILLUSION DID NOT LAST LONG. IT WAS SEEN AS A KIND OF FOIL THAT ISRAEL COULD MANIPULATE AGAINST THE PLO.   JOHN: IN 1988, PLO LEADER YASSER ARAFAT RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST, BUT HAMAS HELD TO ITS BELIEF THAT ISRAEL SHOULD BE ELIMINATED. >> THEY WANTED TO APPEAR MORE MILITANT. IT'S HUGELY IRONIC THAT, OF COURSE, ISRAEL AT THAT TIME HAD AN INTEREST IN TOLERATING HAMAS, IF NOT ACTIVELY ENCOURAGING IT UNTIL, YOU KNOW, THE APPRENTICE TURNED ON THE SORCERER, SO TO SPEAK.  JOHN: IN 1989, ARAFAT SPOKE FROM EXILE IN TUNISIA WITH THE LATE JIM LEHRER.   >> YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT OUR LIVES ARE AS REFUGEES, AS HOMELESS, STATELESS. >> DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE CLOSE TO ACHIEVING THIS, ACHIEVING YOUR STATE? >> YES. >> HOW CLOSE, HOW MUCH TIME WILL IT TAKE? >> NOT MORE THAN A DISTANCE OF A STONE'S THROW. JOHN: A DISTANCE THAT, FOR PALESTINIANS, PROVED TOO FAR. THE INTIFADA LASTED ANOTHER FOUR YEARS. ALMOST 2000 WERE KILLED, WITH PALESTINIAN DEATHS OUTNUMBERING ISRAELI DEATHS THREE TO ONE.  HOPE FOR PEACE CAME IN 1993, WHEN THE PLO AND ISRAEL SIGNED THE FIRST OSLO ACCORDS, THE PRODUCT OF SECRET TALKS OVERSEEN BY THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT. BOTH SIDES COMMITTED TO NEGOTIATING AN END TO THE CONFLICT AND CHARTING A PATH TO PALESTINIAN SELF-RULE IN THE WEST BANK AND GAZA.  IT TRIGGERED A VIOLENT BACKLASH FROM RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS AMONG BOTH ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS, INCLUDING HAMAS.  >> I AM VERY SAD AND VERY SHOCKED. JOHN: AND IN 1995, A RIGHT-WING JEWISH EXTREMIST ASSASSINATED ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN. THE NEXT YEAR, BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, AN OUTSPOKEN CRITIC OF THE ACCORDS AND LEADER OF THE RIGHT-WING LIKUD PARTY, WAS ELECTED PRIME MINISTER.  >> NETANYAHU BASICALLY SAID OSLO IS A MISTAKE. THIS WAS THE POSITION OF THE SETTLERS, THE POSITION OF THE RIGHT WING. NETANYAHU VERY MUCH RODE TO POWER PRESENTING HIMSELF AS THE EXPERT ON TERRORISM. JOHN: BY 1999, LIKUD HAD BEEN DEFEATED AND NETANYAHU REPLACED AS PARTY LEADER BY ARIEL SHARON, A FORMER MILITARY COMMANDER. A YEAR LATER, SHARON LED A MARCH ON THE TEMPLE MOUNT TO ASSERT ISRAELI CLAIMS TO THE BITTERLY-CONTESTED SITE.  THE STREETS OF EAST JERUSALEM AND RAMALLAH IN THE WEST BANK ERUPTED IN VIOLENCE.  THE SECOND INTIFADA WAS UNDERWAY. FIVE YEARS OF PALESTINIAN SUICIDE BOMBERS DETONATING THEMSELVES IN ISRAELI BUSES AND CAFES.  SHARON, BY THEN PRIME MINISTER, ORDERED ISRAELI TROOPS INTO THE WEST BANK AND GAZA. THE SECOND INTIFADA'S DEATH TOLL SURPASSED 4300 PEOPLE. AGAIN, MORE PALESTINIANS THAN ISRAELIS. >> RATHER THAN IMMEDIATELY CLAMP DOWN IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE PEACE PROCESS, ARAFAT CYNICALLY THOUGHT THAT THE VIOLENCE WOULD ACT AS LEVERAGE. THIS IS A TOTAL MISREADING OF DYNAMICS ON THE ISRAELI SIDE, A TOTAL STRATEGIC MISTAKE.  THE SECOND INTIFADA KILLED ANY RESIDUAL READINESS ON THE PART OF THE ISRAELI PUBLIC TO BACK THE OSLO PROCESS AND TO CONTINUE TURNING OVER TERRITORIES. JOHN: ISRAEL BEGAN BUILDING A SECURITY WALL BETWEEN THE WEST BANK AND ISRAEL, AND RENEWED EXPANSION OF WEST BANK JEWISH SETTLEMENTS. IN LATE 2003, PRIME MINISTER SHARON PROPOSED UNILATERALLY PULLING ALL ISRAELI TROOPS FROM GAZA AND DISMANTLING THE SETTLEMENTS THERE. >> IT PAINS ME A LOT, BUT I'VE REACHED A DECISION AND I AM GOING TO CARRY IT OUT. JOHN: IN AUGUST 2005, SOME 8000 ISRAELI SETTLERS ABANDONED 21 SETTLEMENTS. ISRAEL GAVE UP ALL GOVERNING AUTHORITY INSIDE GAZA, BUT CONTINUED TO CONTROL ITS BORDERS. THE NEXT YEAR, HAMAS WON GAZA'S FIRST LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS IN A DECADE. FATAH, THE PARTY AFFILIATED WITH THE PLO, PLACED SECOND. TENSIONS AMONG PALESTINIAN FACTIONS WOULD GO FROM BAD TO WORSE. THE HAMAS LEADERS IN GAZA PRESSED THEIR HARD LINE TOWARD ISRAEL. >> ISRAEL IS OUR ENEMY WHO OCCUPIED OUR LAND AND KILLED OUR LEADERS AND DEMOLISHED OUR HOMES AND JAILED OUR SONS AND UPROOTED OUR TREES. WE WILL NEVER BE ITS ALLY. JOHN: HAMAS ROUTED FATAH FROM GAZA IN EARLY 2007, PUTTING CONTROL OF THE TERRITORIES UNDER DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS. GAZA RULED BY HAMAS, AND THE WEST BANK GOVERNED BY THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY. ISRAEL IMPOSED A BLOCKADE ON GAZA, LIMITING THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS AND PEOPLE IN AND OUT. IT WAS, IN PART, A RESPONSE TO CONTINUED HAMAS ATTACKS OUT OF THE GAZA STRIP. THE U.N. SAYS THE BLOCKADE HAS DEEPENED THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS FOR THE MORE THAN TWO MILLION PALESTINIANS LIVING THERE.  >> YOU CAN IMAGINE SOCIALLY, POLITICALLY, PERSONALLY, ETHICALLY WHAT THAT MEANT. AN IMMENSE POOL OF BITTERNESS AND RESENTMENT.  JOHN: FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS, TENSIONS HAVE SIMMERED BETWEEN PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS, OCCASIONALLY ERUPTING INTO A FULL BOIL. RECURRING ROCKET FIRE FROM GAZA INTO ISRAEL HAS LED TO A SERIES OF MAJOR ISRAELI AIR AND GROUND ASSAULTS ON GAZA.  MORE RECENTLY, THERE'S BEEN FRICTION OVER ISRAELI RESTRICTIONS BARRING YOUNG MUSLIM MEN FROM VISITING THE AL AQSA MOSQUE ON TEMPLE MOUNT, AND EARLIER THIS MONTH, OVER ISRAELI SETTLERS GATHERING AT THE MOSQUE FOR JEWISH PRAYERS. AND NOW, THE NEWEST, MOST-VIOLENT CHAPTER IS BEING WRITTEN IN THE BLOOD OF BOTH PEOPLES. ♪"

14,kI_spMxp6t8," on November 2nd 1917 Britain's foreign secretary Arthur balfor wrote a letter that would set off a conflict still being fought more than a 100 years later his Majesty's government view with favor The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best Endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object when Baler wrote of his government's intent to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine 90% of the people living there were not Jewish just 31 years later most of them were [Music] gone this is the story of the British promise that led to the destruction of Palestine and the creation of the state of Israel [Music] let's start with the obvious question why were the British making promises about other people's countries the short answer Empire is one hell of a drug this was World War I and the British were making lots of promises in addition to promising a Jewish homeland in Palestine they promised Arab leaders Independence if they rose up against Britain's enemy the Ottoman Empire the Arabs did Hollywood even made a movie about it Arabia's for the Arabs now that's what I've told them anyway that's what they think that's why they're fighting oh surely a month after bal's letter British troops took Palestine ending 400 years of Ottoman rule the people who lived there were Arabs mostly Muslims but they were Christian and Jewish minorities too there was also a tiny number of European Jews who in the late 1800s has started started building small colonies there at a time when many Jews were suffering horrific persecution in Europe they felt Palestine could be an escape the idea of building up a Jewish presence in Palestine became known as Zionism but it stayed a fringe movement among European Jews many of them felt they shouldn't have to leave their countries to avoid persecution but Zionism as a political movement took a big step forward with an Austrian man called Theodore Herzel and this guy is a very important name in this story in 1896 he published duden or in English the Jewish state in it he said the only way for Jews to avoid Europe's anti-Semitism was not just to leave but to have their own country and Herzel didn't just right the next year he organized a conference in basil Switzerland the first Zionist Congress the attendees agreed on a program which sought among other things to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine and promote Jewish settlement in Palestine from here on out the Zionist movement became very active setting up funds to promote Jewish immigration to Palestine companies to buy land there and recruiting representatives to advocate for their cause with different governments a few days after the conference Herzel wrote this in his diary at Basel I founded the Jewish state in 5 years perhaps and certainly in 50 years everyone will perceive it he was only off by one year okay so that is a lot of history but it's important because the Zionist movement is a critical part of the story going forward especially after it found a friend in the British government where a lot of high-ranking officials supported Zionism sometimes for unexpected reasons prime minister Lloyd George for example was a Christian Zealot who believed Gathering the Jewish people in Palestine would bring Jesus Christ back to Earth others like balur belied that getting the Jewish people out of Europe and into their own country would be a good thing Herzel was pretty Visionary when he wrote that the anti-semitic Nations will become our allies meanwhile the zionists assured Britain that their future country would be a reliable Ally so that's the backstory of how European anti-Semitism Zionism and British imperialism all led to the balur Declaration this British promise to build a Homeland for Jews in Palestine [Music] now we're going to look at how Britain did that World War I had been a conflict between rival Empires and the winners set up the League of Nations to distribute the losing SES territories between them they called it the mandate system putting territories once controlled by the Ottoman and German Empires under the quote tutelage of advanced Nations until they became independent H Britain was given the Mandate of over Palestine but the Palestinian people were never asked what they wanted or what Independence would look like to them listen to what Baler wrote to one of his colleagues for in Palestine we do not propose even to go through the form of Consulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the country instead it was the zionists who were consulted about what their vision for Palestine was and so the Mandate ended up incorporating not just the balford Declaration but several Clauses requiring Brit to ensure the establishment of a Jewish Home in Palestine British rule was very accommodating to the Zionist project the Jewish community in Palestine grew with big waves of immigration they had their own schools and factories and even their own militia the hag and they were led by the polish-born David benuron the leader of their representative body the Jewish agency to the Palestinians it was clear that Britain wasn't delivering them Independence it was delivering their country to other people in 1936 they went on strike British forces tried to break the strike with arrests torture Mass punishment and executions leaders were exiled weapons confiscated and houses blown up Palestinian Fighters attacked British and Jewish targets while British and Hagan forces would carry out joint raids on Palestinian Villages something had to change the British government sent a commission called the peel commission to figure it out but there proposed solution was typical just draw another British line on the map divide the country give this part to the Jews and this part to the Palestinians and make that part of trans Jordan next door oh and because the Palestinians were a majority in the country 250,000 of them would have to be removed by force to make the Jewish State viable remember these were the proposals that were meant to calm things down spoiler they didn't instead the Revolt continued until 1939 by which time about 10% of palestine's adult male population had either been killed injured arrested or exiled the British government really needed a solution so here comes another report the commission is studying the 20-year-old Jewish settlements in British mandated Palestine the 1939 white paper created a conflict between the British and the zionists for the first time because it rejected partition and said the solution was for Palestine to gain independence within 10 years with everyone living there sharing it together crucially it also imposed severe limits on Jewish land purchases and immigration to the zionists this felt like a betrayal in response some set off bombs across the country killing dozens of Palestinians but soon everyone was distracted by something much bigger more than 60 million people were killed in World War II including 6 million Jews murdered in Nazi death camps Jewish survivors fled Europe with a large number of them trying to find safety in Palestine despite the British limit on Jewish immigration this set off a more direct confrontation between the zionists and the British with Palestinians often targeted as well the zionists knew two things militarily they were stronger than the Palestinians and Britain was exhausted by World War II so it wouldn't have the stomach to keep fighting in Palestine they were right in 1947 after 30 years of occupation Britain announced it was quitting Palestine and asked the newly formed United Nations to clean up its mess all right 1947 and 1948 are the most pivotal years in this story so let's take a look at how things are lining up during British rule Jews had gone from 10% to 30% of the population and owned about 6% of the land under boran's leadership the Jewish agency was pretty much functioning as a government for the Jewish community and the Zionist militias had tens of thousands of soldiers modern weapons and officers who'd already fought in World War II on the other side the Palestinians hadn't been allowed to develop their own Administration or military but as they waited for the UN solution they were still the majority all over the country in November 1947 the UN then only made up of a fraction of the world's countries voted to partition Palestine this plan marked off 55% of the country for a Jewish state but the UN never explained how it could be a Jewish State when half the people in its territory were Palestinian to nobody's surprise Palestinians and in fact all Arabs rejected the un's plan Boron and the Zionist leadership accepted but they saw an opportunity with the British on the way out the zionists knew they would have the strongest military in Palestine their forces were instructed to seize more territory than they'd been awarded by the UN and to do what was necessary to reduce the number of Palestinians in it in cities like haa the militia set off car bombs in Palestinian neighborhoods they attacked Villages and forced residents out hagard troops have driven the Arabs out of The Bard City taking many prisoners after inspecting parts of Western Jerusalem that have been emptied of Palestinians Boron said in many Arab neighborhoods in the west you do not see even one Arab if we persist it is quite possible that in the next 6 or 8 months there will be considerable changes in the country and to our advantage one of the events that helped speed up these changes took place on April 9th 1948 when the village of dein was attacked a British government report to the United Nations describes the scene 250 people were killed in circumstances of great savagery women and children were stripped lined up photographed and then slaughtered by automatic firing the story of what happened at diasen set off Panic all over the country as news spread people fled fearing they would be next historians have recorded dozens of similar massacres during this period each time they would result in entire communities fleeing by the time Britain ended its mandate on May 15th 1948 250,000 Palestinians had fled the night before David Boron announced the founding of the state of Israel with himself as its first prime minister he was standing under a giant portrait of Herzel 51 years after Herzel had predicted this very moment the Zionist militias came together as the newly formed Israel Defense Forces but the fighting was wasn't over with the British out of the way soldiers from several Arab countries entered Palestine but the Israeli Army was better equipped better organized and unlike the Arab armies had a unified command and backing from several European countries Israeli forces pushed into places that the UN had assigned to the Palestinian State like the towns of LDA and RAM 50,000 people were forced to flee from there many on foot in what became known as the LD the death march after being emptied the towns were given Hebrew names L and ramla like in many other empty towns the buildings and homes were taken over by the new Israeli State and given to Jews by the time the UN secured an Armistice 3/4 of the Palestinian people had become refugees in Arabic they call this the neba literally the catastrophe the new state of Israel made up 78% of what had been Palestine the remaining parts were annexed by Jordan or taken over by Egypt Egypt a year later the UN passed a resolution calling for all Palestinian refugees to be allowed to return home they never have been Palestine had been erased in the decade since attempts to resolve this conflict have again tried to partition the land with each successive attempt the territory offered to Palestinians in their historic Homeland shrinks even more ironically Israel is still struggling to maintain the population Advantage it gained in 1948 when it forced all those people out because in 1967 it occupied the West Bank in Gaza bringing all the Palestinians living there under its Rule and so today the population of Jews and non-jews in this land is roughly equal but those living under occupation have no rights no citizenship and no Prospect of Independence the neba era tactics of settlement home demolitions and expulsion are still used against them no we want nak no Israel has taken the land but wants nothing to do with the millions under its rule International Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups say this system is a form of

15,ZXfuqUhzESg," [Music] the bitter struggle between Arab and Jew for control of the holy land has caused Untold suffering in the Middle East for Generations it is often claimed that the crisis originated with Jewish immigration to Palestine and the found ation of the state of Israel yet the roots of the conflict are to be found much earlier in British double dealing during the first world war this is a story of intrigue among rival empires of misguided strategies and of how conflicting promises to Arab and Jew created a legacy of Bloodshed which has determined the fate of the Middle East [Music] during the first World War the British the French and the Russians had these secret plans to carve up the Ottoman Empire because they believed that would balance out their Imperial Ambitions but tough luck for the Turks the Arabs and anyone else who got in the way certainly all the seeds were planted there then in the sense that it was the British who promised the Arabs Independence on the one hand and a Jewish homeland on the other and you could not simply reconcile one with the other the British scattered promises to anyone who might be of some use to them without thinking about the consequences so British duplicity British double dealing went a long way to perpetuate the conflict in Palestine at the end of the day when you're fighting a war you are very liberal in what you're offering in terms of a post-war settlement when you get down to the conference table when the war has ended and you have to start honoring your agreements you then have to decide what's in your interest or not and which saw the Middle East as a western flank for their power in India and that power nation in [Music] general the story of Britain's involvement in the Middle East and the ensuing struggle between Arab and Jew begins with her Colonial past at the beginning of the 20th century King Edward iith ruled over a vast Empire with interests in every part of the world India became increasingly important because uh it was the second pillar of British power in the world moving the Indian army about was extremely important in extending British interests and British influence across the globe and the sewi canal was of course the quick way to do that it's very important for the British geopolitical position to ensure the SE Canal remains safe and secure with this aim in mind Britain had become the only European power to establish a major foothold in the Middle East in the principalities around the Persian Gulf in Aiden and in Egypt Britain had annexed Egypt from turkey's Ottoman Empire in 1882 and by the time it was made a protectorate in 1914 Cairo had become the center of British power in the Middle East the presence of Imperial troops in the region was a vital strategic importance for the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Muhammad I was an alliance with Britain's much-feared rival Germany together with the ostroh Hungarian Empire these countries made up the Central Powers and pitted against them with the three allies Britain France and Russia from the ottoman Capital Constantinople in Turkey the sultan ruled over the last of the great Islamic Empires it been an almost terminal decline for decades yet the fate of the Ottoman Empire was to be sealed by the outbreak of the first world war in August [Music] 1914 in Europe Germany's rapid Advance was halted by Britain and France along the western front in the East Russia's war against Germany and Austria Hungary also reached Deadlock the powerful weapons of the Industrial Age were killing thousands of men in the trenches of every Army all of the leing powers expected the war to be over within a matter of months so in that sense all of them are surprised at the end of 1914 when not merely is the war going on but it shows every sign of being likely to go on for a very long time at that point they began to think about new ways of winning the war Britain's prime minister aswith felt that with the stalemate in Europe it was essential to widen the conflict together with foreign secretary Lord gray Minister for war Lord Kitchener and the first Lord of the admiralty Winston Churchill they masterminded a complex strategy to undermine the Central Powers this was a global war and the British saw the Middle East very much in a global context the traditional British preference for sideshows as people um unfavorably call it the indirect strategy the way of attacking the soft underbelly as church will call it of the enemy and the soft underbelly was seen to be turkey Britain's secret plan involved on the one hand a military diversion and on the other a devious use of diplomacy through bribery subversion and double dealing all these devices focused on the 's weakest link turkey's Ottoman Empire diplomacy in general has always had a secret Dimension to it whether but where discretion ends and conspiracy begins is an open question but during the period up to and during the first world war there was a particularly intense set of negotiations and discussions between the major Imperial powers between the French the Russians and the British in particular cutting in the Italians as well about what would they do when the war was over and when the Ottoman Empire broke up the British government hoped that by striking a deal Over The Spoils of War it would strengthen the alliance against the Central Powers amongst the Allies Russia had long sought access to the Mediterranean in a secret treaty of March 1915 Britain and France offered what was to the Zar a prize of vital geopolitical importance Constantinople it is that key Outlet into the wider world and into the Mediterranean and it is the one thing of course the British and the French have been attempting to prevent the Russians from achieving so this is a complete vatche this is this is the British the French and the Russians coming to an agreement over something which was up to this point almost inconceivable Italy's King Victoria Emanuel was another Target for bribery Britain France and Russia tried to tempt Italy a pro- German state to join the Allies in April 1915 a secret treaty offered Italy a substantial bit of Ottoman real estate in Anatolia again it's another power coming into the equation and being offered territorial advancement which in normal circumstances would have been quite inconceivable the bribe worked Italy joined the allies and declared war on the Central Powers in August 1915 but Britain's strategy to undermine the enemy via the Ottoman Empire also required subversion by using domestic opposition to weaken maybe even destroy it Britain exploited a new movement sweeping through the Empire nationalism nationalism in the sense of believing that there are peoples with a clear cultural identity and that these people should live independent that idea spread to the Middle East as to other parts of the world in the latter part of the 19th century so you had the beginnings in the Ottoman Empire of a Turkish nationalism this came to a head when The Young Turks took power in aoup in 1908 and started to impose their language and culture on the Arabs of the Empire but this only reawakened an interest amongst Arabs in their own [Music] [Music] Heritage a thousand years before Arabs had brought the technology and literature of the East to the West and their religion Islam had encompassed much of Asia North Africa and Southwestern Europe the idea of recovering that historic grander had remained in the consciousness of Arab intellectuals by the start of the first world war the antagonism between Arab and Turk had increased the very fact that the Turks were saying we want to have a unified empire meant the Arabs said wait a minute we're not part of this so all of this literary and nationalistic Revival then took a much more political form and therefore you got the emergence of Arab nationalism they had arrived at the conclusion that remaining in the Ottoman Empire was becoming hopeless that they couldn't actually share power with the Turks and they began thinking of having their own state by the the summer of 1915 British intelligence confirmed that the Arab nationalist movement was the Breakthrough the government was looking for Britain and her French Ally dispatched officers to sound out Arab leaders both the French and the British started you could say seducing various local Arab leaders that if you side with us we'll give you your Independence so why don't you leave the Ottomans and very people were tempted as a result if they they thought they could actually gain independence why not side with the Europeans against the Ottomans the idea was to tempt the Arabs into a revolt against their ottoman overlords and create a diversion which would tie down the Central Powers in the Middle East ironically the impetus for such a diversion had come not from London but from the Arab world in the hijaz in Western Arabia Sheriff Hussein its ruler was set on extending his political and geographical domain he believed he might be able to do it with the help of the British in turn the British were impressed by Sheriff Hussein's family credentials as custodians of the holy places of Islam they call themselves hashimites they call the family hashimites because that's the family or the tribe of the Prophet Muhammad they were the bani Hashim the sons of Hashim so he was Sharif Hussein was the leader of the hashimites he was the person responsible for Mecca and Medina and although he had worked with the Ottomans before the first world war once the first world war happened he saw this was his chance a chance too for the British who saw support for Sheriff Hussein as a way to threaten the Sultan's hold on the caliphate the political leadership of the Islamic world the British because they were fighting the Ottomans and the Ottomans were claiming to be the real representative of Islam they wanted a counterforce and the counterforce was represented by Sharif Hussein being a descendant of the Prophet but Sharif Hussein was speaking of liberating Arab lands building a new national state he wanted to be king of the Arabs not simply of Arabians and July 1915 Sheriff Hussein smuggled a message to the British High Commissioner in Cairo say Henry mcmah offering to raise a substantial Arab Force against the Ottomans in return for British support for Arab Independence in the ensuing secret correspondence between the two men Sheriff Hussein was given to understand that he could expect British support in achieving some of his Ambitions in the event of an ottoman defeat this letter of October the 26th 1915 outlined the main points of the arrangement the actual document itself is absolutely Riven with ambiguity there's no doubt about that the question is whether Hussein recognizes that my sense of Hussein is that he does recognize it in other words there is no wool being poured over his eyes because he's perfectly aware that if he's going to create a modern Arab Empire he's going to need some logistical economic development and that can only come from the outside world taking Britain's assurances of support at face value Hussein together with his sons fisel and Abdullah amassed a sizable Force the new Army was commanded by the young and charismatic fisel who had captured the imagination of the Arab masses in the Quest for Arab Independence yet even as husin and fisel mobilized their troops the British were preparing to sell them short back in London in the spring of 1916 Britain was negotiating with France about the future shape of the Middle East behind closed doors some Mark Sykes of the British foreign office had been meeting his French opposite number Francois George Pico Britain knew it was vital to offer the French a stake in The Spoils of the Ottoman Empire should they win the war there was an awareness on the British side that they had made such huge sacrifices that one couldn't just ignore um French Ambitions and the French were determined to have their historical piece of the Levant pouring over a map of the Levant syes and Pico personally Drew in the areas they wish to see under their control their secret deal amounted to the virtual carve up of the Middle East in area a for the French and area B for the British the imperialists intended to exercise power indirectly they would appoint advisers and take charge of the finances in their respective spheres of influence then there was the area colored blue which was to be directly controlled by France this included what was then known as great Assyria where the French traditionally had commercial and religious interests as for the area colored pink known as Iraq with its strategic ports Railways and oil this was to be under British rule the area colored yellow represented Palestine and was envisaged as an international Zone except for Hyer what the British wanted was the oil of Iraq and they concentrated on getting Iraq and getting away from Iraq to the Mediterranean in order to transport this oil so they got haa on the Palestinian coast and they got most of Iraq the Sy P agreement was a pretty shameful document and I wouldn't attempt to Def defended but it was drawn up by people who were sort of operating under the old kind of balance of per considerations in an imperial frame of mind unaware of these secret dealings behind their backs Hussein and fisel proclaimed Independence and in June 1916 attacked the Turkish troops the Arab revolt against the Ottomans had begun the Turkish Garrison at Mecca was soon overrun and the sea port at jida seized by 1917 Hussein and fil's forces had pushed North and engaged the ottoman Turks along the hijaz railway the British saw the Arab Revolt as part of its strategy for creating a military diversion against the Central Powers in a pinsa movement Britain had launched a campaign from the southwest to ensure control of the sez canal and the Levant and from the southeast it was fighting to secure the oil wells of Iraq all this to attack the Central Powers at their weakest point the Ottoman Empire the Arabs hitched their fortunes to the British they considered themselves to be fighting with the allies but at the same time they were not merged into the British army that they continued to act as an independent Army called the northern Army while the Arab Army Advanced northwards Britain's General aleni had crossed the sez canal and by the spring of 1917 his forces had reached the frontier of Palestine the war in Europe however was still not going well for Britain the attempted push through the German lines at the Som had produced little territorial gain and the cost in lives was colossal in London there had been a change of leadership the new prime minister Lord George felt that the Allied war effort needed a fresh impetus although America had so far been neutral in the war Lloyd George was convinced that could be changed he believed there was one powerful Group which might influence the American government Lloyd George thought that the American decision um whether to join or not would defend critically on public opinion and the Jewish support could tilt the scales in One Direction or or the other you've got to remember that the British foreign office greatly overestimate the political power of international jewry particularly the wealthy financial and Commercial uh Jewish Elites what is extraordinary about this situation is that here you have particularly the British seeing the Jewish world as one Collective monolithic entity and in that sense they start looking at the role of the Jews in the war as being something which might be important and from the point of view of the Allies something else quite remarkable this monolithic Collective entity is pro-german many Jews in the upper echelons of German Society did indeed have close connections to the Kaiser's foreign office a new Jewish nationalist movement Zionism had also been able to establish its headquarters in Berlin Zionism had originated in the 1880s after Theodore Herzel published a book espousing the virtues of a Jewish State this caused a sensation amongst Jewish intellectuals in Germany Austria and Russia who shared herzl's outrage at the escalation of anti-jewish [Music] sentiments the end of the 19th century saw the rise of anti-Semitism all over Europe in Austria in Germany in France but particularly in Eastern Europe in Poland and in Russia and the program against the Jews in Russia gave rise to the establishment ofion the lovers of Zion societies uh in a number of Russian cities who started to promote and to finance and to sponsor colonization immigration to Palestine Herzel came to the conclusion that the Jews were not safe anywhere in Europe and the only solution was for the Jews to have a state of their own over which they could exercise sovereignty and where they would not be a [Music] minority what had also given Zionism its appeal was the way in which it fitted in to Historic Jewish aspirations scattered throughout the world since the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in the first century ad many Jews had cherished the idea of returning one day to what their scriptures had told them was the promised land in fact there had already been a small community of indigenous Jews in Palestine but even when some European Jews established settlements throughout the late 19th century the whole Jewish Community by 1914 constituted barely 8% of the [Music] population the Zionist leader in Britain Heim vitman had been lobbying the government for a guarantee that in the event of an ottoman defeat it would support Jewish immigration to Palestine by early 1917 Lord George's view of Jews as globally influential convinced him that Zionism was another nationalist movement which should be coopted to the Allied cause in March Mark Sykes began negotiations with vitman there is a a be in the Bonnet of people like Mark Sykes that actually the Jews do ultimately look to each other and look to their own interest and if that interest as they are being told by vit man is what we really want is Palestine they're prepared to believe it they're prepared to go along with it as negotiations with vitman continued over the following months the war deteriorated rapidly for the [Music] Allies the German submarine campaign was seriously weakening Britain's Merchant Fleet and although America had entered the war on the Allied side President woodro Wilson was not yet willing to supply a significant number of troops Britain's latest attempt to keep up the pressure on the Western Front soon became bogged down in the muddy trenches of passionale as thousands of young men's lives were wasted in another fruitless campaign morale amongst the soldiers plummeted [Music] but the most serious threat to the Allied War Machine came from the East Russia was on the verge of collapse after massive defeats at the hands of the Germans the war weary country was disintegrating with food shortages strikes and demonstrations when the Zar was deposed in a revolution Britain and France became greatly alarmed the point is is that once Russia and its war effort begins to collapse essentially the Germans have won the first World War unless they bring the Americans in there's no way that the British and the French on their own are ever going to defeat Germany in October the British government received an intelligence report suggesting that Jews were a significant influence in the leadership of the Bolshevik party the new revolutionary movement emerging as the dominant force in Russia L George feared that these Communists would take Russia out of the war with the Americans still refusing to commit sufficient forces he knew it was time to act he instructed his foreign secretary Arthur balour to issue a pledge to capture the hearts and minds of the Jewish people his Majesty's government view with favor The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best Endeavors to facilitate the achievements of this object the balour Declaration was issued on November the 2nd 1917 just as British forces were occupying Palestine I would say that the B declaration has to be understood not as an idealistic gesture but it it has to be understood within the framework of British Imperial policy and Lloyd George was the main instigator of that uh declaration because he believed that it would serve Britain's interests but this was also the first time that any major European power had given official backing for the Zionist goal of making Palestine into a Jewish homeland yet Sheriff Hussein had understood that Palestine had been promised as part of his deal for Arab Independence anticipating Arab outrage at the prospect of a Jewish homeland in a largely Arab Province the balur Declaration had also stated that nothing shall be done which may Prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine the Declaration nonetheless appeared to indicate British support for Jewish immigration there were only a m 80,000 out of some like 700,000 people in Palestine who were Jews the in uh indigenous inhabitants of Palestine were referred to as non-jewish inhabitants and that that Palestine was being identified even at that stage as a Jewish land and all the others had no defined ident they were simply non-jewish the B Declaration was what it says a declaration it wasn't a treaty it wasn't a signed agreement it was a declaration in support of the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine in fact the only treaty Brit had signed in regard to Palestine was with the French the secret Sykes Pico agreement on November the 7th within a few days of the balour Declaration the Bolsheviks took power in Russia ly George hoped that it would have the desired effect of appeasing the Jews in the Communist leadership what is it that they supposedly so want as Jews Palestine now the whole argument is is totally illogical it's a nonsense argument because these particular people if one were to think of people like trosky or zenov or yaff some of the key Jewish leaders in the Russian Revolution the November Revolution these these people of course are internationalists there were 15 to 20 Jews in the higher echelons of the bolic party most of them were anti-zionist and after they came to power they um soon after they came to power they issued a declaration to say that Zionism is a capitalist Ploy a capitalist idea the wildly inaccurate intelligence report on which Lord George based his strategy was to have major implications for Britain within weeks Russia's new leaders did exactly the opposite of what he had expected not only did they out of the war they opened up the archives of the zaris foreign office and published The Secret treaties the very treaties Britain had engineered with her allies to carve up the Ottoman Empire and to which Russia had been privy that of course is a very great embarrassment to the Western allies because the Allies have been doing all sorts of deals behind the scenes in which they have handed out to each other large sections of the world meanwhile openly preaching that they are fighting the war in defense of democracy and of course also telling among others the Arabs that they are supporters of self-determination for the peoples of the Ottoman Empire publication of the secret treaties by the Bolsheviks certainly created an enormous suspicion in the Arab world and this meant that the Sharif Hussein and the others said wait a minute what's going on what a why are you not giving us independence and secondly why are you dividing us up into Zone a and Zone B and at that point of course the Arabs realized that not only with the had the British got their own particular interests for example in the ports of Palestine or in Iraq but that they had promised other things to the [Music] French air Arab confusion and suspicion General aleny entered Jerusalem on foot together with Sykes Pico and a number of other Allied notables his British Le forces had captured the holy city in December 1917 the leaders of the Arab Revolt however were nowhere to be seen fearing that Hussein and fisel might lose heart the British government forwarded a message to them reiterating British commitment to Arab Independence the Arab race will be given full opportunity of once again forming a nation in the world this can only be achieved by the Arabs themselves uniting and Great Britain and her allies will pursue a policy with this ultimate unity in view hsein stayed loyal to the Allied cause still prepared to accept Britain's word on Arab Independence although he spoke of settling accounts after the war from alam's point of view he continued to rely on Arab support in the war against the Ottomans but now that Jerusalem had been occupied by the British one party seized the initiative in April 1918 Haim vitman and the international Zionist commission traveled to Palestine to lay the foundation for a Hebrew University their Hope was that it would become the intellectual Hub of Zionism vman's visit however caused widespread alarm and indignation among the Arab population and when he and the chief Rabbi of Jerusalem met General aleny it looked as if Britain Was preparing to honor the Bal for declaration 6 months later alam's forces entered Damascus with their Ally fil's Northern army they had pushed the ottoman troops North through Palestine into Syria the Arab Revolt did contribute to the victory of the Allies first of all it protected the British flank in Palestine second it kept a number of Turkish and German troops preoccupied and third the the British could have never legitimized what they were doing unless they had the blessing of a particular Arab Force on the 3rd of October the people of Damascus flocked to fil's Victory Parade if he was to seize power he knew it was a great importance to make his presence felt and to be seen by the Arab people as their liberator later the same day however fisel met with General aleny at the Victoria Hotel in Damascus alanb warned him that his rule in Syria would be limited the British by that time knew that they were going to hand over Syria to the French so they couldn't actually accept Fel as a legitimate Ruler all they could do is is to pay him uh his salary and the expenses of his army and his administration undaunted by alen's warnings fisel assumed the title of governor of Damascus with the support of his father Sheriff Hussein he set about creating a power base for their goal of an independent Arab State on the 31 first of October the Ottomans were finally [Music] defeated and at 11:00 on the 11th of November 1918 the guns fell silent in Europe as the war with the Central Powers came to an [Music] end the peace conference at versailes began in January 1919 representatives of the vict notorious allies such as the French prime minister clo and the American president woodro Wilson gathered to sort out what was to be done with the former territories of the defeated Empires now the liberal use of promises by the British government had to be prioritized they did indeed make pledges to the Arabs but they also made pledges to the Jews and they also made pledges to the French and the Russians and everybody else and these people saw the world as an imperial world not only did they want to carve out the Middle East they wanted to carve up Russia they thought this was the last great moment in which the Imperial Powers would be able to sit down and grab what was going particularly since there was no one to stop them but Britain and her old Ally France were up against the American President woodro Wilson's vision of a new world order which promoted National self-determination once Independence it seemed to be a possibility that this principle of self-determination uh supported by the Americans was going to be offered to all those who were to be liberated from former Empires like the hapsburgs and the Ottomans what the Palestinians wanted was an independent state in fact fisel had come from Damascus to plead the Arab cause but the future of pal in the Middle East formed part of Britain's pledge to France in the Sykes Pico carve up in the event woodro Wilson's principles about self-determination were forgotten when it came to the people of the Middle East Britain and France were free to go ahead with their agreement but what of the promises Britain had made to the Jews regarding Palestine foreign secretary Arthur Baler in a confidential memo during the Versa peace talks with America France and Italy wrote the four Great powers are committed to Zionism and Zionism be it right or wrong good or bad is rooted in agong Traditions in present needs in future hopes of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land that might sound like a warm endorsement of Zionism yet further in the post-war memorandum balur hints at a much more cynical agenda so far as Palestine is concerned the powers have made no Declaration of policy which at least in letter they have not always intended to violate the Versa peace conference was concluded on June the 28th 199 19 with the creation of the League of Nations the first Global Institution for peace and security its Covenant provided that the Arab and other territories seeded by the defeated Ottoman Empire should be administered by mandates which meant in effect that Britain and France were given the authority to impose their rule over the Arab territories on November the 21st 1919 franois George Pico the co-architect of the Sykes Pico agreement and the French General guro arrived in beut and so began the imposition of the French mandate for Syria and Lebanon the British forces who had occupied the region since ounting the ottoman Turks during the last months of the war were handing over power to the French thus fulfilling their wartime pledge fisel who had been the governor of Damascus now for 16 months had been consolidating his position when he was proclaimed King by the Syrian National Congress the French were incensed and general guro sent in his troops by August the 7th 1920 fisel had been deposed and had to flee to Palestine the promises to Sharif Hussein and fisel of a single independent state were now a distant memory for the Europeans the whole issue of spheres of influence meant that what appeared what was at first appeared to be willingness to accept a single Arab state was in fact seriously diluted and then on top of that of course the very fact of there being a French area and a British area meant that in effect this was the seed of partition so you had both Independence was denied but also the unity of this area was denied the boundaries and governments of the middle eastern states that emerged bore the unmistakable imprint of the Sykes Pico agreement the French half of the previously ottoman province of great Assyria became the Mandate for Lebanon and Syria the other half became the British mandate for Trans Jordan and Palestine in the East the ottoman area of Mesopotamia which included the oil fields of mul was given to Britain as the Mandate for Iraq so this was basically the importance of the sypo agreement to divide what is called the Fertile Crescent between Iraq and Syria and let Britain get access to to the oil of the area and be able to exploit it in the future but British rule was initially rejected by the Iraqi people until fisel was installed as King in July 1921 Britain hoped The Limited Pate devolved to him would serve to bate the frustrated demands for Arab Independence but Sheriff Hussein expected more from the British he never gave up the idea that the British had promised him Independence not only in Arabia but in Syria and Iraq as well and he wanted the British to fulfill their promises Sheriff Hussein's dream of an Arab Kingdom ruled by the hashemites was only partially fulfilled for although his other son Abdullah became king of trans Jordan their old rival ibin saoud swept the hashemites out of hijaz when he conquered the whole of the Arabian pen pinula in Jerusalem an Administration was established by the British in the spring of 1920 there were no plans for devolving power in Palestine Palestine was a land sacred to three religions Jews were a small minority who had lived harmoniously with Christians and the much larger community of Muslims for hundreds of [Music] years but the Bal for declaration promising Jews a homeland in Palestine had been incorporated into the British mandate at Versailles Palestine was thus to be open for new European Jewish immigration with celebrations and parades in support of Zionist activities it seemed as if the British were going to honor their pledges to the Jews and ignore Palestinian hopes of Independence the Arabs had a strong case but very poor Advocates um the zionists had a case it wasn't as strong as that of the local Arabs but they had brilliant Advocates Zionism is one of the greatest Public Relation success stories of the 20th century and K vitman exemplified these traditional Jewish skills of advocacy and uh persuasion some of these skills were clearly in evidence when vitmen and various Zionist groups helped finance land purchases and the building of settlements for immigrant Jews at the same time political and security organiz izations were created to support the emerging Jewish homeland the Arab community in Palestine was incensed the Palestinians couldn't conceive their country being divided or given away to another Community uh which had nothing to do to the Middle East in the first place and was almost holy European at the time so to them it seemed absurd that 600 to 700,000 should give up their land their homes their Villages their towns and hand them over to a minority which was dispersed uh throughout Palestine and Palestine after all is named after its people who are the Palestinians in 1925 Arthur balur Tor the new Jewish settlements in Palestine although he was fated as a hero of the Zionist cause the immigration of European Jews was to have unforeseen consequences for British rule in Palestine I believe that the Balo Declaration was one of the most serious mistakes in British imperial history it uh committed Britain to uh support of Jewish nationalism in Palestine after the war and uh it did not uh produced any immediate benefits for Britain without the bord Declaration there could have been no genuine development of a Jewish National home and the follow through in 1948 where you get the creation of a state of Israel simply would not have happened it requires the umbrella of the British to be there in effect to support the emerging Jewish National home militarily at the bottom line the very fact that there are British troops British policemen there to protect the Jewish communities is ultimately Central to the situation it could not have been done in any other way [Music] throughout the 1930s and 40s the years of Nazi persecution and the Holocaust Jewish immigration to Palestine increased rapidly but what was seen by the Arabs as an alien incursion and the Jews as a fulfillment of historic rights led to polarization and violence in response to terrorist acts by Arabs Britain restricted the immigration but the policy only stimulated Jewish terrorism against this background Britain relinquished its mandate and the state of Israel was born in 1948 when the first of several Wars between the new state and its Arab neighbors began thousands of Palestinian Arabs fled their Homeland thus the Strategies employed by Britain to win the first world war inadvertently left a deep divide between Arab and Jew the most serious consequences of British policy during the war was the encouragement of Arab nationalism and Jewish nationalism and in the aftermath of the first world war Britain was left with this Legacy of of double dealing and of betrayal which was to haunt her for a long long time clearly it played a role in dividing the Arab world into different states in allowing the establishment of the state of Israel and in frustrating Arab desires but if what happened in syes Pico and everything else that happened in the first world war is used as an excuse for the problems of the Middle East now I think that would be a mistake but yes the roots of what we see to today certainly arose from the double dealing of the first world war and from the frustrated expectations of that [Music] time [Music] [Music]"," [Music] the bitter struggle between Arab and Jew for control of the holy land has caused Untold suffering in the Middle East for Generations it is often claimed that the crisis originated with Jewish immigration to Palestine and the found ation of the state of Israel yet the roots of the conflict are to be found much earlier in British double dealing during the first world war this is a story of intrigue among rival empires of misguided strategies and of how conflicting promises to Arab and Jew created a legacy of Bloodshed which has determined the fate of the Middle East [Music] during the first World War the British the French and the Russians had these secret plans to carve up the Ottoman Empire because they believed that would balance out their Imperial Ambitions but tough luck for the Turks the Arabs and anyone else who got in the way certainly all the seeds were planted there then in the sense that it was the British who promised the Arabs Independence on the one hand and a Jewish homeland on the other and you could not simply reconcile one with the other the British scattered promises to anyone who might be of some use to them without thinking about the consequences so British duplicity British double dealing went a long way to perpetuate the conflict in Palestine at the end of the day when you're fighting a war you are very liberal in what you're offering in terms of a post-war settlement when you get down to the conference table when the war has ended and you have to start honoring your agreements you then have to decide what's in your interest or not and which saw the Middle East as a western flank for their power in India and that power nation in [Music] general the story of Britain's involvement in the Middle East and the ensuing struggle between Arab and Jew begins with her Colonial past at the beginning of the 20th century King Edward iith ruled over a vast Empire with interests in every part of the world India became increasingly important because uh it was the second pillar of British power in the world moving the Indian army about was extremely important in extending British interests and British influence across the globe and the sewi canal was of course the quick way to do that it's very important for the British geopolitical position to ensure the SE Canal remains safe and secure with this aim in mind Britain had become the only European power to establish a major foothold in the Middle East in the principalities around the Persian Gulf in Aiden and in Egypt Britain had annexed Egypt from turkey's Ottoman Empire in 1882 and by the time it was made a protectorate in 1914 Cairo had become the center of British power in the Middle East the presence of Imperial troops in the region was a vital strategic importance for the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Muhammad I was an alliance with Britain's much-feared rival Germany together with the ostroh Hungarian Empire these countries made up the Central Powers and pitted against them with the three allies Britain France and Russia from the ottoman Capital Constantinople in Turkey the sultan ruled over the last of the great Islamic Empires it been an almost terminal decline for decades yet the fate of the Ottoman Empire was to be sealed by the outbreak of the first world war in August [Music] 1914 in Europe Germany's rapid Advance was halted by Britain and France along the western front in the East Russia's war against Germany and Austria Hungary also reached Deadlock the powerful weapons of the Industrial Age were killing thousands of men in the trenches of every Army all of the leing powers expected the war to be over within a matter of months so in that sense all of them are surprised at the end of 1914 when not merely is the war going on but it shows every sign of being likely to go on for a very long time at that point they began to think about new ways of winning the war Britain's prime minister aswith felt that with the stalemate in Europe it was essential to widen the conflict together with foreign secretary Lord gray Minister for war Lord Kitchener and the first Lord of the admiralty Winston Churchill they masterminded a complex strategy to undermine the Central Powers this was a global war and the British saw the Middle East very much in a global context the traditional British preference for sideshows as people um unfavorably call it the indirect strategy the way of attacking the soft underbelly as church will call it of the enemy and the soft underbelly was seen to be turkey Britain's secret plan involved on the one hand a military diversion and on the other a devious use of diplomacy through bribery subversion and double dealing all these devices focused on the 's weakest link turkey's Ottoman Empire diplomacy in general has always had a secret Dimension to it whether but where discretion ends and conspiracy begins is an open question but during the period up to and during the first world war there was a particularly intense set of negotiations and discussions between the major Imperial powers between the French the Russians and the British in particular cutting in the Italians as well about what would they do when the war was over and when the Ottoman Empire broke up the British government hoped that by striking a deal Over The Spoils of War it would strengthen the alliance against the Central Powers amongst the Allies Russia had long sought access to the Mediterranean in a secret treaty of March 1915 Britain and France offered what was to the Zar a prize of vital geopolitical importance Constantinople it is that key Outlet into the wider world and into the Mediterranean and it is the one thing of course the British and the French have been attempting to prevent the Russians from achieving so this is a complete vatche this is this is the British the French and the Russians coming to an agreement over something which was up to this point almost inconceivable Italy's King Victoria Emanuel was another Target for bribery Britain France and Russia tried to tempt Italy a pro- German state to join the Allies in April 1915 a secret treaty offered Italy a substantial bit of Ottoman real estate in Anatolia again it's another power coming into the equation and being offered territorial advancement which in normal circumstances would have been quite inconceivable the bribe worked Italy joined the allies and declared war on the Central Powers in August 1915 but Britain's strategy to undermine the enemy via the Ottoman Empire also required subversion by using domestic opposition to weaken maybe even destroy it Britain exploited a new movement sweeping through the Empire nationalism nationalism in the sense of believing that there are peoples with a clear cultural identity and that these people should live independent that idea spread to the Middle East as to other parts of the world in the latter part of the 19th century so you had the beginnings in the Ottoman Empire of a Turkish nationalism this came to a head when The Young Turks took power in aoup in 1908 and started to impose their language and culture on the Arabs of the Empire but this only reawakened an interest amongst Arabs in their own [Music] [Music] Heritage a thousand years before Arabs had brought the technology and literature of the East to the West and their religion Islam had encompassed much of Asia North Africa and Southwestern Europe the idea of recovering that historic grander had remained in the consciousness of Arab intellectuals by the start of the first world war the antagonism between Arab and Turk had increased the very fact that the Turks were saying we want to have a unified empire meant the Arabs said wait a minute we're not part of this so all of this literary and nationalistic Revival then took a much more political form and therefore you got the emergence of Arab nationalism they had arrived at the conclusion that remaining in the Ottoman Empire was becoming hopeless that they couldn't actually share power with the Turks and they began thinking of having their own state by the the summer of 1915 British intelligence confirmed that the Arab nationalist movement was the Breakthrough the government was looking for Britain and her French Ally dispatched officers to sound out Arab leaders both the French and the British started you could say seducing various local Arab leaders that if you side with us we'll give you your Independence so why don't you leave the Ottomans and very people were tempted as a result if they they thought they could actually gain independence why not side with the Europeans against the Ottomans the idea was to tempt the Arabs into a revolt against their ottoman overlords and create a diversion which would tie down the Central Powers in the Middle East ironically the impetus for such a diversion had come not from London but from the Arab world in the hijaz in Western Arabia Sheriff Hussein its ruler was set on extending his political and geographical domain he believed he might be able to do it with the help of the British in turn the British were impressed by Sheriff Hussein's family credentials as custodians of the holy places of Islam they call themselves hashimites they call the family hashimites because that's the family or the tribe of the Prophet Muhammad they were the bani Hashim the sons of Hashim so he was Sharif Hussein was the leader of the hashimites he was the person responsible for Mecca and Medina and although he had worked with the Ottomans before the first world war once the first world war happened he saw this was his chance a chance too for the British who saw support for Sheriff Hussein as a way to threaten the Sultan's hold on the caliphate the political leadership of the Islamic world the British because they were fighting the Ottomans and the Ottomans were claiming to be the real representative of Islam they wanted a counterforce and the counterforce was represented by Sharif Hussein being a descendant of the Prophet but Sharif Hussein was speaking of liberating Arab lands building a new national state he wanted to be king of the Arabs not simply of Arabians and July 1915 Sheriff Hussein smuggled a message to the British High Commissioner in Cairo say Henry mcmah offering to raise a substantial Arab Force against the Ottomans in return for British support for Arab Independence in the ensuing secret correspondence between the two men Sheriff Hussein was given to understand that he could expect British support in achieving some of his Ambitions in the event of an ottoman defeat this letter of October the 26th 1915 outlined the main points of the arrangement the actual document itself is absolutely Riven with ambiguity there's no doubt about that the question is whether Hussein recognizes that my sense of Hussein is that he does recognize it in other words there is no wool being poured over his eyes because he's perfectly aware that if he's going to create a modern Arab Empire he's going to need some logistical economic development and that can only come from the outside world taking Britain's assurances of support at face value Hussein together with his sons fisel and Abdullah amassed a sizable Force the new Army was commanded by the young and charismatic fisel who had captured the imagination of the Arab masses in the Quest for Arab Independence yet even as husin and fisel mobilized their troops the British were preparing to sell them short back in London in the spring of 1916 Britain was negotiating with France about the future shape of the Middle East behind closed doors some Mark Sykes of the British foreign office had been meeting his French opposite number Francois George Pico Britain knew it was vital to offer the French a stake in The Spoils of the Ottoman Empire should they win the war there was an awareness on the British side that they had made such huge sacrifices that one couldn't just ignore um French Ambitions and the French were determined to have their historical piece of the Levant pouring over a map of the Levant syes and Pico personally Drew in the areas they wish to see under their control their secret deal amounted to the virtual carve up of the Middle East in area a for the French and area B for the British the imperialists intended to exercise power indirectly they would appoint advisers and take charge of the finances in their respective spheres of influence then there was the area colored blue which was to be directly controlled by France this included what was then known as great Assyria where the French traditionally had commercial and religious interests as for the area colored pink known as Iraq with its strategic ports Railways and oil this was to be under British rule the area colored yellow represented Palestine and was envisaged as an international Zone except for Hyer what the British wanted was the oil of Iraq and they concentrated on getting Iraq and getting away from Iraq to the Mediterranean in order to transport this oil so they got haa on the Palestinian coast and they got most of Iraq the Sy P agreement was a pretty shameful document and I wouldn't attempt to Def defended but it was drawn up by people who were sort of operating under the old kind of balance of per considerations in an imperial frame of mind unaware of these secret dealings behind their backs Hussein and fisel proclaimed Independence and in June 1916 attacked the Turkish troops the Arab revolt against the Ottomans had begun the Turkish Garrison at Mecca was soon overrun and the sea port at jida seized by 1917 Hussein and fil's forces had pushed North and engaged the ottoman Turks along the hijaz railway the British saw the Arab Revolt as part of its strategy for creating a military diversion against the Central Powers in a pinsa movement Britain had launched a campaign from the southwest to ensure control of the sez canal and the Levant and from the southeast it was fighting to secure the oil wells of Iraq all this to attack the Central Powers at their weakest point the Ottoman Empire the Arabs hitched their fortunes to the British they considered themselves to be fighting with the allies but at the same time they were not merged into the British army that they continued to act as an independent Army called the northern Army while the Arab Army Advanced northwards Britain's General aleni had crossed the sez canal and by the spring of 1917 his forces had reached the frontier of Palestine the war in Europe however was still not going well for Britain the attempted push through the German lines at the Som had produced little territorial gain and the cost in lives was colossal in London there had been a change of leadership the new prime minister Lord George felt that the Allied war effort needed a fresh impetus although America had so far been neutral in the war Lloyd George was convinced that could be changed he believed there was one powerful Group which might influence the American government Lloyd George thought that the American decision um whether to join or not would defend critically on public opinion and the Jewish support could tilt the scales in One Direction or or the other you've got to remember that the British foreign office greatly overestimate the political power of international jewry particularly the wealthy financial and Commercial uh Jewish Elites what is extraordinary about this situation is that here you have particularly the British seeing the Jewish world as one Collective monolithic entity and in that sense they start looking at the role of the Jews in the war as being something which might be important and from the point of view of the Allies something else quite remarkable this monolithic Collective entity is pro-german many Jews in the upper echelons of German Society did indeed have close connections to the Kaiser's foreign office a new Jewish nationalist movement Zionism had also been able to establish its headquarters in Berlin Zionism had originated in the 1880s after Theodore Herzel published a book espousing the virtues of a Jewish State this caused a sensation amongst Jewish intellectuals in Germany Austria and Russia who shared herzl's outrage at the escalation of anti-jewish [Music] sentiments the end of the 19th century saw the rise of anti-Semitism all over Europe in Austria in Germany in France but particularly in Eastern Europe in Poland and in Russia and the program against the Jews in Russia gave rise to the establishment ofion the lovers of Zion societies uh in a number of Russian cities who started to promote and to finance and to sponsor colonization immigration to Palestine Herzel came to the conclusion that the Jews were not safe anywhere in Europe and the only solution was for the Jews to have a state of their own over which they could exercise sovereignty and where they would not be a [Music] minority what had also given Zionism its appeal was the way in which it fitted in to Historic Jewish aspirations scattered throughout the world since the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in the first century ad many Jews had cherished the idea of returning one day to what their scriptures had told them was the promised land in fact there had already been a small community of indigenous Jews in Palestine but even when some European Jews established settlements throughout the late 19th century the whole Jewish Community by 1914 constituted barely 8% of the [Music] population the Zionist leader in Britain Heim vitman had been lobbying the government for a guarantee that in the event of an ottoman defeat it would support Jewish immigration to Palestine by early 1917 Lord George's view of Jews as globally influential convinced him that Zionism was another nationalist movement which should be coopted to the Allied cause in March Mark Sykes began negotiations with vitman there is a a be in the Bonnet of people like Mark Sykes that actually the Jews do ultimately look to each other and look to their own interest and if that interest as they are being told by vit man is what we really want is Palestine they're prepared to believe it they're prepared to go along with it as negotiations with vitman continued over the following months the war deteriorated rapidly for the [Music] Allies the German submarine campaign was seriously weakening Britain's Merchant Fleet and although America had entered the war on the Allied side President woodro Wilson was not yet willing to supply a significant number of troops Britain's latest attempt to keep up the pressure on the Western Front soon became bogged down in the muddy trenches of passionale as thousands of young men's lives were wasted in another fruitless campaign morale amongst the soldiers plummeted [Music] but the most serious threat to the Allied War Machine came from the East Russia was on the verge of collapse after massive defeats at the hands of the Germans the war weary country was disintegrating with food shortages strikes and demonstrations when the Zar was deposed in a revolution Britain and France became greatly alarmed the point is is that once Russia and its war effort begins to collapse essentially the Germans have won the first World War unless they bring the Americans in there's no way that the British and the French on their own are ever going to defeat Germany in October the British government received an intelligence report suggesting that Jews were a significant influence in the leadership of the Bolshevik party the new revolutionary movement emerging as the dominant force in Russia L George feared that these Communists would take Russia out of the war with the Americans still refusing to commit sufficient forces he knew it was time to act he instructed his foreign secretary Arthur balour to issue a pledge to capture the hearts and minds of the Jewish people his Majesty's government view with favor The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best Endeavors to facilitate the achievements of this object the balour Declaration was issued on November the 2nd 1917 just as British forces were occupying Palestine I would say that the B declaration has to be understood not as an idealistic gesture but it it has to be understood within the framework of British Imperial policy and Lloyd George was the main instigator of that uh declaration because he believed that it would serve Britain's interests but this was also the first time that any major European power had given official backing for the Zionist goal of making Palestine into a Jewish homeland yet Sheriff Hussein had understood that Palestine had been promised as part of his deal for Arab Independence anticipating Arab outrage at the prospect of a Jewish homeland in a largely Arab Province the balur Declaration had also stated that nothing shall be done which may Prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine the Declaration nonetheless appeared to indicate British support for Jewish immigration there were only a m 80,000 out of some like 700,000 people in Palestine who were Jews the in uh indigenous inhabitants of Palestine were referred to as non-jewish inhabitants and that that Palestine was being identified even at that stage as a Jewish land and all the others had no defined ident they were simply non-jewish the B Declaration was what it says a declaration it wasn't a treaty it wasn't a signed agreement it was a declaration in support of the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine in fact the only treaty Brit had signed in regard to Palestine was with the French the secret Sykes Pico agreement on November the 7th within a few days of the balour Declaration the Bolsheviks took power in Russia ly George hoped that it would have the desired effect of appeasing the Jews in the Communist leadership what is it that they supposedly so want as Jews Palestine now the whole argument is is totally illogical it's a nonsense argument because these particular people if one were to think of people like trosky or zenov or yaff some of the key Jewish leaders in the Russian Revolution the November Revolution these these people of course are internationalists there were 15 to 20 Jews in the higher echelons of the bolic party most of them were anti-zionist and after they came to power they um soon after they came to power they issued a declaration to say that Zionism is a capitalist Ploy a capitalist idea the wildly inaccurate intelligence report on which Lord George based his strategy was to have major implications for Britain within weeks Russia's new leaders did exactly the opposite of what he had expected not only did they out of the war they opened up the archives of the zaris foreign office and published The Secret treaties the very treaties Britain had engineered with her allies to carve up the Ottoman Empire and to which Russia had been privy that of course is a very great embarrassment to the Western allies because the Allies have been doing all sorts of deals behind the scenes in which they have handed out to each other large sections of the world meanwhile openly preaching that they are fighting the war in defense of democracy and of course also telling among others the Arabs that they are supporters of self-determination for the peoples of the Ottoman Empire publication of the secret treaties by the Bolsheviks certainly created an enormous suspicion in the Arab world and this meant that the Sharif Hussein and the others said wait a minute what's going on what a why are you not giving us independence and secondly why are you dividing us up into Zone a and Zone B and at that point of course the Arabs realized that not only with the had the British got their own particular interests for example in the ports of Palestine or in Iraq but that they had promised other things to the [Music] French air Arab confusion and suspicion General aleny entered Jerusalem on foot together with Sykes Pico and a number of other Allied notables his British Le forces had captured the holy city in December 1917 the leaders of the Arab Revolt however were nowhere to be seen fearing that Hussein and fisel might lose heart the British government forwarded a message to them reiterating British commitment to Arab Independence the Arab race will be given full opportunity of once again forming a nation in the world this can only be achieved by the Arabs themselves uniting and Great Britain and her allies will pursue a policy with this ultimate unity in view hsein stayed loyal to the Allied cause still prepared to accept Britain's word on Arab Independence although he spoke of settling accounts after the war from alam's point of view he continued to rely on Arab support in the war against the Ottomans but now that Jerusalem had been occupied by the British one party seized the initiative in April 1918 Haim vitman and the international Zionist commission traveled to Palestine to lay the foundation for a Hebrew University their Hope was that it would become the intellectual Hub of Zionism vman's visit however caused widespread alarm and indignation among the Arab population and when he and the chief Rabbi of Jerusalem met General aleny it looked as if Britain Was preparing to honor the Bal for declaration 6 months later alam's forces entered Damascus with their Ally fil's Northern army they had pushed the ottoman troops North through Palestine into Syria the Arab Revolt did contribute to the victory of the Allies first of all it protected the British flank in Palestine second it kept a number of Turkish and German troops preoccupied and third the the British could have never legitimized what they were doing unless they had the blessing of a particular Arab Force on the 3rd of October the people of Damascus flocked to fil's Victory Parade if he was to seize power he knew it was a great importance to make his presence felt and to be seen by the Arab people as their liberator later the same day however fisel met with General aleny at the Victoria Hotel in Damascus alanb warned him that his rule in Syria would be limited the British by that time knew that they were going to hand over Syria to the French so they couldn't actually accept Fel as a legitimate Ruler all they could do is is to pay him uh his salary and the expenses of his army and his administration undaunted by alen's warnings fisel assumed the title of governor of Damascus with the support of his father Sheriff Hussein he set about creating a power base for their goal of an independent Arab State on the 31 first of October the Ottomans were finally [Music] defeated and at 11:00 on the 11th of November 1918 the guns fell silent in Europe as the war with the Central Powers came to an [Music] end the peace conference at versailes began in January 1919 representatives of the vict notorious allies such as the French prime minister clo and the American president woodro Wilson gathered to sort out what was to be done with the former territories of the defeated Empires now the liberal use of promises by the British government had to be prioritized they did indeed make pledges to the Arabs but they also made pledges to the Jews and they also made pledges to the French and the Russians and everybody else and these people saw the world as an imperial world not only did they want to carve out the Middle East they wanted to carve up Russia they thought this was the last great moment in which the Imperial Powers would be able to sit down and grab what was going particularly since there was no one to stop them but Britain and her old Ally France were up against the American President woodro Wilson's vision of a new world order which promoted National self-determination once Independence it seemed to be a possibility that this principle of self-determination uh supported by the Americans was going to be offered to all those who were to be liberated from former Empires like the hapsburgs and the Ottomans what the Palestinians wanted was an independent state in fact fisel had come from Damascus to plead the Arab cause but the future of pal in the Middle East formed part of Britain's pledge to France in the Sykes Pico carve up in the event woodro Wilson's principles about self-determination were forgotten when it came to the people of the Middle East Britain and France were free to go ahead with their agreement but what of the promises Britain had made to the Jews regarding Palestine foreign secretary Arthur Baler in a confidential memo during the Versa peace talks with America France and Italy wrote the four Great powers are committed to Zionism and Zionism be it right or wrong good or bad is rooted in agong Traditions in present needs in future hopes of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land that might sound like a warm endorsement of Zionism yet further in the post-war memorandum balur hints at a much more cynical agenda so far as Palestine is concerned the powers have made no Declaration of policy which at least in letter they have not always intended to violate the Versa peace conference was concluded on June the 28th 199 19 with the creation of the League of Nations the first Global Institution for peace and security its Covenant provided that the Arab and other territories seeded by the defeated Ottoman Empire should be administered by mandates which meant in effect that Britain and France were given the authority to impose their rule over the Arab territories on November the 21st 1919 franois George Pico the co-architect of the Sykes Pico agreement and the French General guro arrived in beut and so began the imposition of the French mandate for Syria and Lebanon the British forces who had occupied the region since ounting the ottoman Turks during the last months of the war were handing over power to the French thus fulfilling their wartime pledge fisel who had been the governor of Damascus now for 16 months had been consolidating his position when he was proclaimed King by the Syrian National Congress the French were incensed and general guro sent in his troops by August the 7th 1920 fisel had been deposed and had to flee to Palestine the promises to Sharif Hussein and fisel of a single independent state were now a distant memory for the Europeans the whole issue of spheres of influence meant that what appeared what was at first appeared to be willingness to accept a single Arab state was in fact seriously diluted and then on top of that of course the very fact of there being a French area and a British area meant that in effect this was the seed of partition so you had both Independence was denied but also the unity of this area was denied the boundaries and governments of the middle eastern states that emerged bore the unmistakable imprint of the Sykes Pico agreement the French half of the previously ottoman province of great Assyria became the Mandate for Lebanon and Syria the other half became the British mandate for Trans Jordan and Palestine in the East the ottoman area of Mesopotamia which included the oil fields of mul was given to Britain as the Mandate for Iraq so this was basically the importance of the sypo agreement to divide what is called the Fertile Crescent between Iraq and Syria and let Britain get access to to the oil of the area and be able to exploit it in the future but British rule was initially rejected by the Iraqi people until fisel was installed as King in July 1921 Britain hoped The Limited Pate devolved to him would serve to bate the frustrated demands for Arab Independence but Sheriff Hussein expected more from the British he never gave up the idea that the British had promised him Independence not only in Arabia but in Syria and Iraq as well and he wanted the British to fulfill their promises Sheriff Hussein's dream of an Arab Kingdom ruled by the hashemites was only partially fulfilled for although his other son Abdullah became king of trans Jordan their old rival ibin saoud swept the hashemites out of hijaz when he conquered the whole of the Arabian pen pinula in Jerusalem an Administration was established by the British in the spring of 1920 there were no plans for devolving power in Palestine Palestine was a land sacred to three religions Jews were a small minority who had lived harmoniously with Christians and the much larger community of Muslims for hundreds of [Music] years but the Bal for declaration promising Jews a homeland in Palestine had been incorporated into the British mandate at Versailles Palestine was thus to be open for new European Jewish immigration with celebrations and parades in support of Zionist activities it seemed as if the British were going to honor their pledges to the Jews and ignore Palestinian hopes of Independence the Arabs had a strong case but very poor Advocates um the zionists had a case it wasn't as strong as that of the local Arabs but they had brilliant Advocates Zionism is one of the greatest Public Relation success stories of the 20th century and K vitman exemplified these traditional Jewish skills of advocacy and uh persuasion some of these skills were clearly in evidence when vitmen and various Zionist groups helped finance land purchases and the building of settlements for immigrant Jews at the same time political and security organiz izations were created to support the emerging Jewish homeland the Arab community in Palestine was incensed the Palestinians couldn't conceive their country being divided or given away to another Community uh which had nothing to do to the Middle East in the first place and was almost holy European at the time so to them it seemed absurd that 600 to 700,000 should give up their land their homes their Villages their towns and hand them over to a minority which was dispersed uh throughout Palestine and Palestine after all is named after its people who are the Palestinians in 1925 Arthur balur Tor the new Jewish settlements in Palestine although he was fated as a hero of the Zionist cause the immigration of European Jews was to have unforeseen consequences for British rule in Palestine I believe that the Balo Declaration was one of the most serious mistakes in British imperial history it uh committed Britain to uh support of Jewish nationalism in Palestine after the war and uh it did not uh produced any immediate benefits for Britain without the bord Declaration there could have been no genuine development of a Jewish National home and the follow through in 1948 where you get the creation of a state of Israel simply would not have happened it requires the umbrella of the British to be there in effect to support the emerging Jewish National home militarily at the bottom line the very fact that there are British troops British policemen there to protect the Jewish communities is ultimately Central to the situation it could not have been done in any other way [Music] throughout the 1930s and 40s the years of Nazi persecution and the Holocaust Jewish immigration to Palestine increased rapidly but what was seen by the Arabs as an alien incursion and the Jews as a fulfillment of historic rights led to polarization and violence in response to terrorist acts by Arabs Britain restricted the immigration but the policy only stimulated Jewish terrorism against this background Britain relinquished its mandate and the state of Israel was born in 1948 when the first of several Wars between the new state and its Arab neighbors began thousands of Palestinian Arabs fled their Homeland thus the Strategies employed by Britain to win the first world war inadvertently left a deep divide between Arab and Jew the most serious consequences of British policy during the war was the encouragement of Arab nationalism and Jewish nationalism and in the aftermath of the first world war Britain was left with this Legacy of of double dealing and of betrayal which was to haunt her for a long long time clearly it played a role in dividing the Arab world into different states in allowing the establishment of the state of Israel and in frustrating Arab desires but if what happened in syes Pico and everything else that happened in the first world war is used as an excuse for the problems of the Middle East now I think that would be a mistake but yes the roots of what we see to today certainly arose from the double dealing of the first world war and from the frustrated expectations of that [Music] time [Music]

16,zE8GCX1w3ys," Palestine and Israel - it’s complicated. Well, at least that’s what some people would
like you to think. We’ve long been sold the narrative of a
tit for tat squirmish of rockets, a real-estate dispute or even a centuries old religious
feud. There’s so much more to the story of Palestine
- we all need to know. So, how did we get here? Let’s take it back to the beginning. It starts with the end of a World War, Muslims
fighting each other and a promise made by the West only a century ago. So here’s how the story begins… It’s 1916 and the first World War is raging
on. The Ottoman Empire is 617 years old at this
point and is on the brink of collapse. The British and the French had promised the
Arabs sovereignty and Arab leadership over the Arabian peninsula and the Levant if they
helped them defeat the Ottomans. And so the Arab’s said ‘Ok’… and so
they helped them defeat the Ottomans. Now I know what you’re thinking, ‘What’s
this got to do with Palestine and the creation of Israel?’Just trust me, we'll get there Okay, so when the British and the French won,
the Arabs wanted the land that was promised to them, but little did they know, the British
and the French had this little top secret meeting. And in this top secret meeting, it was planned
that the captured Ottoman province will be divided into areas of British and French control
and influence. The British would receive Palestine, Jordan
and Southern Iraq while the French would control southeastern Turkey, northern Iraq, Syria
and Lebanon. This was called the Sykes-picot agreement. But then the Arabs found out about this agreement
and they were shocked. They had been bamboozled and tricked. They thought that they were fighting a war
inorder to overthrow their non-Arab Muslim rulers, only to end up with, you guessed it,
European colonial rulers instead. Anyway, that’s a long story for another
video. Now that the British occupy Palestine, something
unusual is happening back in Europe. You see, The Zionist movement had grown increasingly
influential and lobbied hard to support the mass migration of Jews to Palestine and recognise
a Jewish claim to the Palestinian land. And in 1917, Britain, out of nowhere publicly
declared it’s intentions of establishing a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine. So the British just gifted Palestine, a country
which was made up of 90% Palestinians to European Zionists. They gave it just like you would give a box
of chocolates. Historians still debate till this day on how
or why the british gave Palestine to the Zionists. It's simply baffling. Now at this point, the Jewish population in
Palestine at the time was less than 10 percent. So when the British started to facilitate
the immigration of European Jews to Palestine from 1922 and 1935, the Jewish population
rose to 27 percent. With the British Mandate in full swing, mass
European Jewish immigration meant that more land would be seized and the native Palestinian
population grew increasingly worried. The Palestinians would demonstrate their concerns
to their British overlords but they wouldn’t have it. European Jewish settlement was on the rise. The British proposed a partition of Palestine
and even advised the forceful removal of the Arab population from their homes. And yes this was their plan to resolve the
issue. So the Palestinians naturally rejected and
revolted against the British. The revolts were crushed violently killing
thousands of Palestinians. But the Palestinians wouldn’t give up. They would continue their fight for independence
and the British were clearly fed up. So in 1947, the British decided to hand over
their responsibility for Palestine to the United Nations. So basically, they just said ‘Here, clean
our mess.’ And so the UN proposed this ridiculous proposal
where Palestine would be partitioned into a Jewish and Arab state. Remember, Jews in Palestine only constituted
one-third of the population - most of whom arrived from Europe a few years earlier yet
in the proposal they were allocated 55 percent of the land. Feeling like they got a bad deal, again, the
Arabs rejected the proposal and the Zionests accepted, however here’s the catch, the
Zionests didn’t agree to the proposed borders and even campaigned for more land. So they agreed to an Israeli state but didn’t
agree to the size of it so they can just choose it for themselves. By 1948, Zionest militia would storm and capture
Palestinian populated villages and cities leaving thousands of Palestinians homeless
and landless. The zionest wanted to seize and cleanse as
much land from Palestine before the British would officially withdraw their forces. And on the same day that they left, the Zionest
proclaimed the establishment of the new Israeli state. Overnight millions of Palestinians lost their
country. And what's even more bizarre, is that immediately
the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union recognised the new state
of Israel. And if it couldn't get any worse, May 15,
1948 was perhaps one the darkest days in Palestine’s history. They called it the Nakba, or the catastrophe. To lose your country, your identity and your
home just like that is something truly horrifying. But that wasn’t enough for those Palestinian
men, women and children. They had to be ethnically cleansed from their
lands and driven into near-total destruction. See, the creation of the state of Israel didn’t
just mean that 1.9 million Palestinians were forced out of their homes, didn’t just mean
that 78 percent of historic Palestine had been taken from it’s natives, didn’t just
mean that 530 villages and cities were destroyed and ethnically cleansed and didn’t just
mean the killing of 15,000 Palestinians in a series of mass atrocities. It means that it was the start of something
even more horrifying for the Palestinian people. It signalled over 70 years of occupation,
home demolitions, arbitrary arrests, displacements, Israeli expansion, military checkpoints, construction
of walls, discrimination, massacres and bombing of innocent men, women and children in their
own homes. So no, it's not complicated. The Palestinians are a people who have been
oppressed and have had their homes taken away from them and have been suffering ever since. This is how the events of the past shape the
conditions of today. This is why it is important to remember and
reflect on our history before it repeats itself again. Because Allah knows we don’t need it to
happen again in another part of the world. May Allah lift the pain and the struggles
from our Palestinian borthers and sisters. Ameen."," Palestine and Israel - it’s complicated. Well, at least that’s what some people would

thousands of Palestinians. But the Palestinians wouldn’t give up. They would continue their fight for independence
and the British were clearly fed up. So in 1947, the British decided to hand over
their responsibility for Palestine to the United Nations. So basically, they just said ‘Here, clean
our mess.’ And so the UN proposed this ridiculous proposal
where Palestine would be partitioned into a Jewish and Arab state. Remember, Jews in Palestine only constituted
one-third of the population - most of whom arrived from Europe a few years earlier yet
in the proposal they were allocated 55 percent of the land. Feeling like they got a bad deal, again, the
Arabs rejected the proposal and the Zionests accepted, however here’s the catch, the
Zionests didn’t agree to the proposed borders and even campaigned for more land. So they agreed to an Israeli state but didn’t
agree to the size of it so they can just choose it for themselves. By 1948, Zionest militia would storm and capture
Palestinian populated villages and cities leaving thousands of Palestinians homeless
and landless. The zionest wanted to seize and cleanse as
much land from Palestine before the British would officially withdraw their forces. And on the same day that they left, the Zionest
proclaimed the establishment of the new Israeli state. Overnight millions of Palestinians lost their
country. And what's even more bizarre, is that immediately
the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union recognised the new state
of Israel. And if it couldn't get any worse, May 15,
1948 was perhaps one the darkest days in Palestine’s history. They called it the Nakba, or the catastrophe. To lose your country, your identity and your
home just like that is something truly horrifying. But that wasn’t enough for those Palestinian
men, women and children. They had to be ethnically cleansed from their
lands and driven into near-total destruction. See, the creation of the state of Israel didn’t
just mean that 1.9 million Palestinians were forced out of their homes, didn’t just mean
that 78 percent of historic Palestine had been taken from it’s natives, didn’t just
mean that 530 villages and cities were destroyed and ethnically cleansed and didn’t just
mean the killing of 15,000 Palestinians in a series of mass atrocities. It means that it was the start of something
even more horrifying for the Palestinian people. It signalled over 70 years of occupation,
home demolitions, arbitrary arrests, displacements, Israeli expansion, military checkpoints, construction
of walls, discrimination, massacres and bombing of innocent men, women and children in their
own homes. So no, it's not complicated. The Palestinians are a people who have been
oppressed and have had their homes taken away from them and have been suffering ever since. This is how the events of the past shape the
conditions of today. This is why it is important to remember and
reflect on our history before it repeats itself again. Because Allah knows we don’t need it to
happen again in another part of the world. May Allah lift the pain and the struggles
from our Palestinian borthers and sisters. Ameen."

18,6MVz5MBNqsw," the promised land what would happen if you promis that land the very same land to two different peoples at the same time what if the land you promis isn't even yours to promise away in the first place wouldn't that create an irreversible mess that might take generations to resolve if it can be resolved at all for the answer we only have to look at what the British and French Colonial Powers did to the Jewish and Arab people who share a belief that bibl land around Jerusalem is their promised land this is how the Israeli Palestinian conflict began I'm Sparticus Olen I'm Sebastian Brader Sebastian one of our most recent additions to our time G team has done the research for and co-written with me this special extra long episode of time ghost into context today due to increasing demand from our community and events tragically unfolding in Israel and Palestine we will look into the historical beginnings of the Israeli Palestinian conflict we will try to uncover what motivations mechanisms and historical events led to today's situation to be clear we are historians and we do not take sides in this conflict our side is always Humanity all of humanity and always Humanity never just a part of humanity we expressly condemn all forms of hatred and Terror and expect all nations to uphold the principles of international law conflict and War to narrate the events unfolding in the world as we speak is not our purpose it is also not our purpose to assign blame or Justify the actions of one or the other party we simply give you the past events as they unfolded we hope that may help you all to better understand if not the causes then at least some of the historical aspects and perhaps in a perfect world become part of a future solution we also do not pretend to have covered every event or every aspect of this conflict not even in this long an episode but we do claim that what we will get is to as much of a concise fair and precise overview as possible okay most of the time when dealing with generational longlasting conflicts the roots of the problem reach back far into ages past in this case they reached back very far indeed several Millennia in fact the year year is 1098 Common Era and Pope Urban II called for the first of eight eventual Crusades the goal to capture the holy city of Jerusalem why you may ask at its core it's really quite simple basic geopolitical consideration about power and wealth the sjuk Empire had made significant territorial gains against the byzantines in the decade before this threatens to change the entire power structure in Asia Minor for the Christians in the Eastern Roman Empire and then the Holy Roman Empire control of the region offers strong economic incentives most notably through trade hence when alexio the first asks for help from his Western Christian Brethren the motivations are clear however this is not what the pope presents to the general public as his main reason he and the Catholic church spread the narrative that the pilgrimage to the holy city has become perilous and uncertain for most Travelers this message packaged in the form of propagandistic church sermons whips up a sort of religious fervor and fanaticism about protecting the Cradle of Christianity from Heathen influence and ensuring the safe pilgrimage of Believers to the holy SES and in the end the Pope's Ambitions and those of contemporary rulers are not fulfilled as you may have already guessed by the fact that there were eight Crusades to make a very very long story short all this paves the way for 10 centuries R of sectarian conflict that continues to ferment Strife to this day and has globally become an ingrained aspect of the perceived identity of the region in other words Jerusalem has been the hot spot of conflict between the three abrahamic religions since at least 1098 if you count Jewish Strife in the region by itself even all the way back to Antiquity that is why in our search for answers we need to tread carefully when examining the importance of Jerusalem and the Very ious conflicts that have been fought over it throughout the centuries as we mentioned one of the reasons for the First Crusade was the threat of Muslim influence in Asia Minor roughly 350 years later on the 19th of May 1453 the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire would not only Mark the definitive end of Christian influence in Asia Minor but also its eventual demise in Eastern Europe the Ottoman Empire would remain in control of the region for almost 500 years and would shape the region its people and its future the city of Jerusalem can perhaps serve as a proxy to understand the makeup of the Ottoman Empire as a whole it is a land of many cultures religions and peoples the census taken in Jerusalem from 1562 to 1563 underlines this it's roughly 10% of the population are then Jewish 12% Christian and 78% Muslim Within These distinctions based on religion many more could be made on culture overall however the population was rather small at 12,617 total contrary to the west where Jewish people continually face persecution and discrimination from the 16th to the 19th century they are rather safe and prosper under ottoman Rule now a quick sidebar here yes the Jews in Jerusalem were relatively safe compared to Western Europe at least but they were still not full citizens any non-muslims were considered diim or people of The Pact based on passages in the Quran Surah 9:29 fight against Those whom the scriptures were given and who believe not in God until they pay the tribute out of hand and are humbled members of other religions are expected to pay a special tax wear distinctive clothing and Obey other rules which set them apart from the first class citizenry of of the Empire while not perfect this two class system is still significantly less discriminatory than the status quo in Western Christendom even more so as the conflict within the Western Christian Nation intensifies throughout the 17th century Jewish people are seen as potential allies diplomats and spies as the persecution in Europe continues Jews from Spain Sicily France and Hungary settle all over the empire overall throughout the existence of the Ottoman Empire until its very end its Jews and Arabs generally got along fairly well and without much Strife because of different diasporas Jewish people coming to the Ottoman Empire were descendants of people who had migrated to Europe centuries prior two major groups are the sapharic and ashkanazi Jews the sapharic Jews settled in modern Spain while their precise origin in the region remains unclear Some sources suggest that members of the judian ruling class were moved there after the Roman Emperor Titus destroyed Jerusalem in 70 current ERA when in 1492 Isabella and Ferdinand of Spain succeed in bringing all of Spain under Christian rule the sapharic Jews are faced with the Edict of expulsion essentially giving them the choice between conversion summary execution or migration similarly it seems as though the ashkanazi Jews also hailed from Judea originally how exactly their distinct community formed so far remains unknown well what we do know is that by the Middle Ages they settled in middle and southern Europe but as their distant Spanish relatives they were faced with expulsions in England France and later Germany which gradually pushed them Eastward as such the Ottoman Empire was not the only place that Jewish people sought to escape persecution in Western Europe the other option was Eastern Europe the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth welcomed many disenfranchised Jews throughout the late Middle Ages and its sizable Jewish population would be absorbed by the Russian Empire later on sadly the situation of relative safety in the Russian Empire would not last and by the end of the 19th century Jewish people in Russia were experiencing that from which they had fled again and again discrimination and persecution in other words diasporas now this leads to two essential things one two waves of Jewish Mass Exodus from Russia the first and second Aliyah to the emergence of cism as a political movement from 1881 to 1882 Jewish Russians increasingly face pogroms it all begins with the assassination of Zar Alexander II on the 1st of March 1881 as so often in times of turmoil and uncertainty people look for scapegoats and as so often before in the history of Europe the scapegoats are agents of foreign influence or in other words Jews the two years of prosecution most notably the pgrs of Kiev Warsaw and Odessa lead to the first aliia the first Ascent in English further prosecution from 1903 to 1905 marks the beginning of the second Aliyah which lasts until 1914 as a result the Jewish population in the Levant the region that today stretches along the Mediterranean Coast from Southern turkey to the Israeli Egyptian border grows from around 24,000 in 1882 to almost 100,000 in 1914 however the vast majority of Jewish people fleeing Russia go somewhere else the United States between 1907 and 1914 alone almost 1.5 million Jews pass through Ellis Island while about 20,000 immigrate to Pal this despite the fact that over the centuries several self-proclaimed Messiahs had tried to persuade Jews to return to the torah's promised land with little success in Eastern Europe haway sonion lovers of Zion is formed to promote the settlement of Jewish farmers and artisans in Palestine the individual who will politicize this idea and coin the term Zionism is Theodore hatza an austr Hungarian journalist hatel regards assimilation as the most desirable option for Jewish people but contends that in the face of centuries of anti-Semitism and persecution it is simply not possible in vain we are loyal Patriots our loyalty in some places running to extremes we are still cried down as strangers the answer to this problem is in hertel's eyes the creation of a Jewish nation state he argues that if the Jewish people are forced by external pressure to form a state it would have to be by migration into one distinct territory the whole concept of a nation state as such is a novel concept at the time until the creation of Belgium and Greece in 1830 there had not been a single nation state on the whole planet how does one approach such a Monumental task founding a state without any land well Herzel seemingly has a Clear Vision of how to get there and it begins in bosil in 1897 with the first scientist Congress later he will write in his diary where I to sum up the Basel Congress in a word it would be this at basil I founded the Jewish state if I said this out loud today I would be answered by Universal laughter perhaps in 5 years certainly in 50 everyone will know it now thereby the idea of a Jewish return to the promised land has been combined with the modern notion of a nation state and this project will eventually give birth to today's state of Israel almost to the day 50 years later after the basil Congress to get there hatel arranges talks with various leaders of large countries such as Germany and France but only the British are receptive to the idea offering 15,500 square kilm of uninhabited Uganda for settlement however the prospect of a new country in the middle of Africa is not very appealing to the zionists and they continue to hope for the return to the promised land they are however aware that advocating for the establishment of a Jewish nation state in the Levant could meet Fierce opposition especially by the Arabs living there and by other International actors to avoid this problem their phrasing is carefully fine-tuned referring to a Homeland rather than a state the main slogan of the Zionist movement at the time is a land without people for a people without land there is only one problem there are in fact people in the land as many as 595,000 by 1914 to be exact thus some zionists know that in order for their Endeavor to succeed at least initially the Goodwill of the native arish population is of utmost importance a sentiment not always shared by Jewish settlers causing concerns within the Zionist movement as says say Zionist humanist a har yet what do our Brethren do in Palestine just the very opposite surfs they were in the lands of the diaspora and suddenly they find themselves in unrestricted freedom and this change has awakened in them an inclination to despotism they treat the Arabs with hostility and cruelty deprive them of their rights offend them without cause and even boast of these deeds and nobody Among Us opposes this despicable and dangerous inclination he also notes that generally many sists are not open to objections that people are already living in the region sadly his words are not heeded and this is where we can first observe the lines along which the eventual cracks and tensions will appear hatel dies in 1904 well before Zionism has fully matured as a political movement and before the problems outlined by harm become relevant in any case Hat's Vision will continue to grow and spread to Jewish people across the globe but then in 1914 the first world war threatens to completely alter the governance structure and the lives of people in the region of today's Palestine and Israel the British Empire will now play a major role in deciding the fate of the entire Middle East they will be joined by another continent spinning Colonial Empire of the time France naturally the British expect to win the war and as such make preparations and agreements in anticipation of their Victory this means negotiating with various Global players such as France but also with smaller Regional players and other interest groups at the heart of all of this diplomacy there is a clear goal the greatest possible benefit to Britain to make this a reality the British enter into almost simultaneous negotiations with the French and other unton power poers local tribes in the Southeastern part of the Ottoman Empire today's Middle East and the zionists while these negotiations do not all start on the same day they clearly overlap in their preparation and execution the only problem is that the British make promises they cannot keep that is to say they make contradictory promises to varying partners by 1917 their vindictiveness becomes apparent for all to see okay so three competing promises have been made the buff War Declaration of 1917 the letters between Sir Henry McMahon British High Commissioner of Egypt and Sharif Hussein the Amir of Mecca and a secret agreement with the French they all center around the same question how do you carve up the proverbial cake or more succinctly who gets what part of the Ottoman Empire's carcass the secret deal between France and Britain is facilitated by the diplomats Mark Sykes and franois Jor Pico hence the name Sykes Pico agreement and it will decide the future of the entire Middle East turkey itself will be allowed Independence but largely stay occupied by the Allies Syria and Mesopotamia will be carved away from turkey and fall under French and British control respectively now the Syria of 1920 is what we know today as Jordan Israel Lebanon Palestine and parts of Syria Mesopotamia is today's Iraq Kuwait parts of Syria and parts of Saudi Arabia now if you think that the ethnic map of Europe causes problems when the lands are divided into nation states this is even worse many of the tribes living here are still nomadic the stationary population is a mixture of various Arab tribes Shia Muslims Sunni Muslims a dozen or so Christian denominations Jews and many more the language ethnicities are just as diverse with speakers of a variety of Arab dialects Kurdish Hebrew Armenian Turkish Persian and many more smaller languages and these ethnicities are not clearly separated geographically the colonial power brokering ensures the continued influence of France and Britain in the region however it also directly contradicts the promises made to the Zionist and the shareif now throughout the Great War TE Lawrence AKA Lawrence of Arabia and imir fisel the eldest son of the sheriff of Mecca head of the hashimite family worked together to secure the cooperation of the Arab tribes against the Ottoman Empire the idea is that fisel and his father could be onon friendly rulers who will bring stability and prosperity to the region why the Sharif of Mecca you might ask well because as the steward or keeper of Islam's most important holy sites he is seen as a representative of all Arabs in the region a sentiment that some Arabs do not share in the letter exchange the Sharif clearly demands the independence of the Arab countries and provides exact Maps as to what territories he deems to constitute the Arab sphere of influence this area clearly includes today's Palestine and Israel in return the British expect the staging of an Arab revolt against the ottoman to which the shareif agrees as a resp McMahan notes Great Britain is prepared to recognize and support the independence of all Arabs in the regions within the limits demanded by the shareif of Mecca again the British goal is to advance Britain's interest the support from the local tribes against the Ottomans does just that further destabilizing ottoman control in the region while seaing a Britain friendly population which could come in handy after the end of the war however the Sykes piku agreement we mentioned earlier outlines a very different future path for the region France wants control over the whole of Syria and Palestine the British make some arguments towards fulfilling the promises to the shareif but as discussions proceed gradually compromise away the reality of any establishment of truly autonomous States putting key areas of it under their own or French control or as they put it influence the spirit of these negotiation is really quite exemplary of the colonial attitude of the time that in the blue area of France and in the red area Great Britain shall be allowed to establish such direct or indirect Administration or control as they desire and as they may think fit to arrange with the Arab state or Confederation of Arab states in effect a significant area of the map provided by the shareif in the letter exchange and agreed upon by the British has become subject to the whims of France and in Britain a vassel state so to speak naturally this would not sit well with the Arab tribe leaders so they are not invited to the discussions put it clearly the British knowingly and purposefully have now made competing Promises to the French and Arabs all in their best interest if Britain were a person one might describe them as an egotistic opportunist opportunism that Segways into vindictiveness when you see how the next conflicting agreement practically programs conflict in the region that would be the B four declaration well it's what zionists have been waiting for ever since they rejected the idea of erecting the Jewish state in Uganda support for a Jewish state in Palestine his Majesty's government view with favor The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best Endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object the Declaration is the direct result of sanist organizations approaching past future and current British government members interestingly Sykes the namesake of the Sykes PCO agreement will be of most use in this endeavor the scientists openly state that they prefer a British protectorate over an American or French one but as expected the reasons behind the British support of the idea are more complex than mere Sympathy for the Jew cause once again the central motivation is geopolitical power brokering leading to the biggest possible upside for Britain primarily in 1915 and 16 as the Great War still rages without us involvement the British want to Garner political support among Jewish people for the war effort especially in the US they also hope that Pro British Jewish settlers to the region could protect the approaches to the sus canal and and thus Safeguard a vital route of goods in communication with British colonies further east especially India last but not least they hope for all these settlers to Splinter any anti-british opposition and make it easier to secure natural resources like the as of yet largely untapped oil reserves just one problem the British are promising away land that they have neither Sovereign rights to nor any argument for having a proprietary interest in not to mention no authority to dispose of that alone especially enrages many Arab leaders while the balur Declaration also runs contrary to the syes P agreement which sees Palestine fall under French control the British are able to convince the French of the idea of Jewish colonization so the French agreed to put the area of Palestine under International supervision which shall eventually lead to the British mandate under the lead of Nations perhaps the words of later military governor of Palestine Colonel Ronald stores can best describe the situation Palestine up to now a Muslim country has fallen into the hands of a Christian power which on the eve of its Conquest announced that a considerable portion of its land is to be handed over for colonization purposes to a nowhere very popular people Mark how despite the mild self-deprecation he manages to insert an anti-semitic undertone in any case the inclusion of the Bal for declaration as a res of the British mandate in conflict with the Arab self-determination lays down a foundation built on irreconcilable differences on which the British will now erect a house of cards however as already intimated the British do not openly negotiate competing promises otherwise one or all of their Partners could have easily spotted the lack of commitment to any of them yep all these Agreements are made in secret however that secrecy will not be possible to maintain to see how it all begins to unravel we return to Russia right after the October revolution in 1917 in their quest for fuel to drive their transformation to the dictatorship of the proletariat the Bolsheviks leave no stone unturned this includes scouring the former State archives for any useful information to use politically amongst the treasures of political Dynamite they find is a copy of the Sykes Pico agreement Lenin reputedly disgusted by the imperialist Ambitions of the agreement publishes it along with a slew of Russian imperial treaties the Manchester Guardian then reprints the whole agreement on the 26th of November 1917 this causes quite some embarrassment for the French and British and the Arabs are scandalized to what degree these emotions eventually pav the way for the next chapter in this sorted drama can only be left to speculation nonetheless a new chapter it is once the Great War is Over the war has given wi to the sales of nationalist emotions around the world arguably this is the moment when the idea of nation states countries founded on some kind of discreete geography and shared identity ceases to be a largely academic idea to popular sentiment okay this is of course a long process that began more than a century earlier but now that millions of men from across the globe have fought side by side for their Nation identities that before 1914 focused on family tribe or region have become supplanted by the idea of a common interest and identity based on larger geopol political constructs previously mainly of interest to a small ruling class paradoxically at the same time a general distrust of the larger Imperial order of the world and the ruling classes has led to a majority support for the idea of self-determination It Is by no means a class struggle these emotions supersede class and ethnicity and if not before at the Paris peace conference they become universally accepted principles at least for the peoples of America and Europe breaking a lance for the Arab world to be included in this game of nation-making is FAL by now the true representative of the Arab interest and prospective king of a pan-arabic Nation just before the Paris conference he meets with several major sist leaders most significantly he befriends biochemist Dr Kim vitman one of the main driving forces behind the Bal for declaration and president of of the British sist Federation on paper viman is a liberal Zionist who claims that for a Jewish state in Palestine to have success it must be in concert with Arab interest privately however he has called Arabs treacherous arrogant uneducated and greedy and has complained to the British that the system in Palestine does not take into account the fact that there is a fundamental qualitative difference between Jew and Arab fizal and BisMan find common ground in similar opinions about the Palestinian Arabs Vice man writes to his wife that FAL was contemptuous of the Palestinian Arabs whom he doesn't even regard as Arabs the outcome of their meeting is the fisal bitman Declaration in it fisal echoes the balur Declaration the establishment of a Jewish Home in Palestine he hopes that the official acceptance of the bord declaration would give him the support of the Zionist which in turn could Lobby the British on behalf of an independent greater Syria remarkably although facing enormous opposition to any such idea Fon manages to get the majority of the Arab leaders on board for the idea of a Jewish semi-autonomous state in Palestine along with Arab Independence within a pan Arabic Federation hopes that look like they may come true as the British now reiterate their promis of Arab Independence to fizal who begins to prepare to truly unify the Arab tribes behind a common cause yes if it only would be that simple the French are not at all happy about this development and pressure the British to come back to the principle of the syes peor agreement with the addition of a British mandate in Palestine in a not too surprising turn of developments the British secretly aband on all their promises to fisal instead of a United Federation of the Arab tribes they and fisal end up in a brief war with the French when the Arabs have finally had enough and take up arms to get their demands a brief war it is but it's also a long story of how the Arab tribes fall apart again and the Arab factions that are still at conflict more than 100 years later are formed within that fizel will become the first king of but all of that is a tale for another day before that can happen fizal surrenders to the French in 1920 and is extradited to Britain the defeat of fizal and the Arab leaders in 1920 marks the moment when development was more or less become set in stone and a new chapter begins the Middle East under Western rather than ottoman influence already before the Arab Rebellion fails the British mandate in Palestine the region that will eventually become Palestine Israel and parts of Jordan and Lebanon come under British military rule in 1920 a civilian Administration under sir Herbert Manuel takes charge now strictly speaking Britain has no right to occupy the territory according to international law which by the way is a novel concept pretty much forged at the Paris peace conference with the creation of the League of Nations in any case legal or not the league agrees that Palestine will fall under British rule and on the 24th of July 1923 with the Treaty of loan what is already deao reality will be formalized meanwhile in 1920 the tensions inside the Middle East continued to mount anything that is seen as a threat to a path towards Arab Independence at some point is a hot potato while the leaders around fizal have heard of The balur Declaration the general population has not moreover leaders who were maybe swayed by fizal now oppose any idea of Jewish autonomy then when Manuel's Administration comes in they make the Declaration public taken as an indication that it will be fulfilled outrage grows on the 4th of April 1920 violent protests engulf the holy city of Jerusalem at the end of the riot there are scores of dead and injured on both sides on the first day alone 150 Jews are injured however the British are not as United behind the Zionist cause as they seem to be at least not yet in fact it may be that touting the declaration has more Sinister reasons cut to a year later 1921 and ha Amin El husseini he is now appointed Grand muy of Jerusalem and president of the newly created Supreme Muslim Council the most authoritative religious legislative body in the Palestinian Muslim Community useni now begins to organize larger scale operations to terrorize Jews at the same time Colonel Richard minat haogen former head of British Security in Cairo writes in his diary that British officials inclined towards the exclusion of sanism in Palestine now let's go back to Easter 1920 only days before the Jerusalem riots when Colonel Waters Taylor financial adviser to the military Administration in Palestine from 1919 to 1923 meets with husseini is it a coincidence that the riots start right after according to Miner Haagen it most certainly is not he states that in the talks Taylor encourages Arab violence against the Jews going as far as to suggest toini that he had a great opportunity at Easter to show the world that Zionism was unpopular not only with the Palestine Administration but in whiteall and if disturbances of sufficient violence occurred in Jerusalem at Easter both General bols Chief administrator in Palestine and general alanby commander of Egyptian force and High Commissioner of Egypt would Advocate the abandonment of the Jewish Home wat's Taylor explained that freedom could only be attained through violence it is unclear whether the British officers are motivated by anti-jewish sentiments on their part or simple political considerations yet the two-faced nature of the British does not end there after the riots husseini who has fled to Jordan is sentenced to 10 years in prison in absentia then again in 1921 British arabist are able to convince the High Commissioner to Pardon husi and appoint him as Muti again subsequently more riots follow in 1921 and 43 Jews die as a result the ha craft commission is set up to evaluate the cause of these rides and we'll find that the fundamental cause of the acts of violence was a feeling among the Arabs of discontent with and hostility to the Jews due to political and economic causes and connected with Jewish immigration and with their conception of Zionist policy as derived from Jewish exponents husseini will play a major role in the development of the conflict as he consolidates his power over the Arab population and Palestine he uses his religiously derived authority to gain control over mosques schools and the courts as a result no Arab can reach an influential position without being loyal to him and his inherently anti-jewish stances in his role as Palestinian spokesperson towards the end of 1921 he writes Winston Churchill at the time Colonial secretary he demands that restrictions be put on Jewish immigration and that Palestine as a territory be United with trans Jordan and Syria these demands are partially based on developments outside of the Mandate of Palestine well at least theoretically the area west of the Jordan Palestine and east of the Jordan trans Jordan fall under one mandate the British effectively treat them as two separate entities this means that in trans Jordan the British have no ambition to establish a Jewish Home and their sole focus is a path towards Arab self-determination going even further they prohibit any Jewish immigration to trans Jordan it must have been quite something for the Arabs living in Palestine just across the river the reasons for their riots and protests are nonexistent and the British actively seek to enable Arab self-determination already in 1923 trans Jordan will achieve quasi independence with a hashimite king at the helm nonetheless and that would be Amir Abdullah I fal's brother in any case to be clear these British divisions of the territory is in no way shape or form reflected by the reality on the ground as we said earlier it's one ethnic or cultural group and the other separated by pencil line drawn in some fancy back office in London that in no way respects the tribal and nomadic culture of the region but back to Churchill and Hussein's demands to end Zionism in Palestine how does Winston respond does husseini get what he wants well no the Church of white paper or Church of memorandum doubles down on the balfor Declaration several years later while addressing the House of Commons Churchill will explain the purpose of the white paper to make it clear that the establishment of self-governing institutions in Palestine was to be subordinated to the Paramount plue and obligation of establishing a Jewish National home in Palestine as you can imagine essentially subordinating the self-governance of Arabs in the region to the creation of a Jewish National home does nothing to lessen the tensions with their backs now fully supported by the British government the zionists start to continue their efforts to create a Jewish state in Palestine their main tools to facility's Grand Endeavor are twofold immigration and land purchases in 1922 the Jews number only about 84,000 while the Arabs in the region number roughly eight times that however this is about to change throughout the 20s about 100,000 Jewish immigrants will arrive in Palestine leading to a total Jewish population of roughly 165,000 by 1929 overall the Jewish population in Palestine has more than doubled since 1918 accordingly the ratio of Arabs to Jews has shifted from 10 to 1 to 5 to to one with such an influx of people the ownership of land in Palestine has also changed rather drastically in 1920 it was estimated that around 650 square kilm or roughly 250 square miles were under Jewish ownership which constituted just shy of 2.5% of the total land area fast forward to 1929 and Jewish land ownership has grown to 1,200 square km nearly doubling and now constituting about 5% of the total land area looking at the total land area is problematic however since unable land is not really worth much and there's quite a lot of it in the area in total out of 26,000 Square kilm about 6,500 are arable of these the Jewish Community possesses round about 1 16 in 1929 well you might say 1 Sixth of the land for 1/5 of the people that does not seem too unfair there is one more decisive factor that so far we have not looked at and which heavily influences Arab sentiments about Jewish immigration and land ownership it is not the land ownership per se that causes so much Arab opposition but how the land ownership is managed by the Jewish communities in today's terms you might describe the practice simply as racial discrimination only Jewish laborers are allowed to work on the Jewish land and in Jewish settlements the land does not simply change ownership from an Arab to a Jew but it ceases to be a land from which the Arab can gain any advantage either now or at any time in the future not only can he never hope to lease or to cultivate it but he is deprived forever from employment on that land nor can anyone help him by purchasing the land and restoring it to common use these labor policies also run contrary to the articles of the Mandate the Zionist organization attempts to not assume any blame by not openly advocating their stringent labor policies some Zionist leaders including vitman also opposed the practices for example at the Zionist Congress of 1931 a resolution is passed that solemnly declared the desire of the Jewish people to live with the Arab people to develop the Homeland common to both into a prosperous Community which would ensure the growth of the peoples resolutions or not the practices feed into more anger suspicion and hatred in the region the Arabs faced with the reality that Britain openly favors sanist efforts over Arab self-determination feel betrayed Jews fleeing persecution in Europe now face the same in the promised land in August 1929 the conflict once again escalates as a dispute over the Western Wall in Jerusalem causes riots by Palestinian Arabs since 1925 Jews have been blocked access to the Wailing Wall as a measure by the British to calm emotions by segregation it all begins with a march on the Wailing Wall by 6,000 far8 Jewish zionists demanding access to the wall the protesters are unarmed and later reports conclude that the demonstration proceeds peacefully nevertheless false rumors that the Jews are about to seize the AL axam MOS and that they are attacking even slaughtering Muslims spread inflammatory articles in the Press of both sides fan hatred incensed Arab mobs then begin destroying Jewish owned property and beating Jewish people they find in the streets even killing them the riot soon spread Beyond Jerusalem the British police respond with gunfire and a few Jewish activists answer with violence of their own a week of bloody fighting leaves 133 Jewish Palestinians and 116 Arab Palestinians Dead with hundreds more wounded now note that we deliberately noted that the dead on both sides are Palestinians you see these events bring a deepening Rift to light many of the dead and wounded Jews are not immigrants not even zionists the collective punishment of Jewish communities in Palestine who had come to be their irrespective of Zionist ambition in ages past motivates more Jews to closely align themselves with the Zionist project likewise the violent response by the British police and a minority of Zionist activists further radicalizes some people in the Arab Community a cycle of violence giving birth to more violence that will last into our days has begun these events force a shift in British policy for the Mandate in Palestine the Shaw and hope Simmons commissions appointed to assess the events amongst other things heightens the awareness of the dangerous situation in Palestine as a result two immediate measures are taken in 1930 the increase of British troops in the region and a new policy on Palestine called the passfield white paper in it Palestinians as well as Jewish leaders are reprimanded the Jews for exerting pressure on officials to comply with Zionist wishes and the Arabs for excessively demanding self-determination both of them according to the report would render it impossible to carry out in the fullest sense the double undertaking this marks an important shift from the church of memorandum as now at least on paper the British make an effort to give the same importance to the creation of a Jewish Home and an Arab self-determination more specifically this means that the British are working towards a United Arab Jewish State you could call it a one-state solution furthermore the paper communicates the clear intent of reasserting British authority over the areas of immigration and land transfers which ever since the church memorandum had practically been in the hands of the zionists last the paper also calls for the creation of a common legislature where in both Arabs and Jews could deliberate a and reach a deeper understanding of each other after more than a decade of Fanning descent this change of TAC by the British is a fall into a canyon of their own digging zionists are not happy with the change and make their displeasure known by 1931 their efforts reach fruition and Dr vitman receives a letter from the British prime minister Ramsey McDonald where in the PM once again puts the zionists goals above rather than alongside those of Arab self-determination in a nutshell the church memorandum has been reinstated and un un surprisingly Palestinian Arabs feel short changed once again as zionists with renewed unquestioning British support renew immigration and land purchase efforts but there is a more dire threat to Jewish Europeans than simply the desire for a country of their own driving them to Palestine remember that Hat's whole reason behind the Zionist movement had been the continued and merciless persecution of Jews throughout the Centuries by the end of the 19th century was clear Beyond any doubt that for Jewish Europeans assimilation was simply not a viable option ASA would be proven right again during the third Aaliyah which lasted from 1919 to 1923 the Russian Revolution of 1917 led to a whole new scale of pogroms in Eastern Europe and in Ukraine from 1918 to 1921 more than 100,000 Jews were killed with acts of killing reaching an almost genocidal scale whereas earlier the goal had been to drive the Jews out now it seemed as if the goal was their complete eradication these mass killings are often forgotten in light of the great showah the Holocaust but the sheer scale of the violence leads some like French writer and journalist anat France to publicly question the security of close to 10 million Jews living in Europe and how right he would turn out to be as many of you will know by now in the early 1930s anti-Semitism in the whole of Europe is on the rise as is Jewish immigration combined with renewed British support of cism over self-determination this drives immigration to Palestine to record levels between 1930 and 1939 more than 230,000 Jews arrive in Palestine making their total population swell to somewhere around 450,000 turning the 1:5 ratio of 1929 into one of 1:3 uh at the same time land ownership also grows although not that drastically by 300 Square km to 1,500 total reaching almost 6% of the total land mass since nothing about the British policy changed and immigration continues the same as it had in the 1920s the result would also be similar however this time it is not just a Arab Revolution but the Arab revolt and it no no longer primarily targets the Jews it was an open rebellion of the Palestinian Arabs assisted by fellow Arabs from other countries against British mandatory rule in April 1936 things kick off with grand muy of Jerusalem husseini and the Arab hire committee calling for a general strike as the strike continues violence increases and the first attacks on British troops police stations and Jew settlements take place on the the Palestinian side one organization that plays a central role is the black hand founded in 1930 after the last Uprising it is an anti-zionist anti-british jihadist organization led by is Adin alasam a Syrian shik under Al Kasam the black hand now commits Terror attacks against Jewish immigrants and British residents Al Kazam dies in 1935 but his movement continues In The Same Spirit and dials up the terror in all around 7,000 Arabs are actively fighting the British by 1938 the British respond brutally by raising Villages looting and even executions the destruction of food and water supplies becomes standard practice to make the Arabs pay for their Disobedience by the time the Revolt loses steam in 1939 5,000 Arab Fighters have been killed while the British may have succeeded at quenching the Arab violence the uprising has not been for not already in 1937 in light of determin Arab resistance the British realize that their current policy as well as their more General ambition of fulfilling the Dual obligations are not feasible however vigorously and consistently maintained it will not solve the problem it will not elay it will exacerbate the quarrel between the Arabs and Jews the establishment of a single self-governing pales sign will remain just as impractical as it is now the solution to the problem and solomonian fashion would be bifurcation or in other words the splitting of Palestine into two the two-state solution but partition as you might imagine is unacceptable to Arab Nationals they've not just fought for a year and a half to lose a third of their country to the sinist so there is yet another change of heart among the colonial thinkers in London further examination has shown that the political administrative and financial difficulties involved in the proposal to create independent Arab and Jewish States inside Palestine are so great that this solution of the problem is impracticable so there's a new brilliant so far unthought of solution right no okay a workable solution which at least improves the situation somewhat no do they go back to the way things were yes you got to be kidding me well to be fair there is some change and yet another white paper the British decide to terminate the Mandate in 1949 by which time both Palestinians and Jews would share in government so back to dual Ambitions however they also renounced any intention to create a Jewish state in Palestine effectively nullifying the Bal declaration at the same time they also reject all Arab demands for self-determination and Jewish immigration is limited to 10,000 a year for the next 5 years this is arguably the best example of bad timing in all of human history Nazi Germany has by now graduated from anti-semitic rhetoric and oppression in Germany itself to launch a war aimed to annihilate all Jewish people in Europe with that as backdrop the Jewish Community is incensed by the new white paper with some even proposing a Jewish revolt against the British however for most the defeat of Nazi Germany seems most important as such the leader of the Jews in Palestine David benuron States in 1939 support the British as if there is no white paper and oppose the white paper as if there is no war while in 1939 it is certainly known that the Nazis are more than hostile towards anyone perceived as or actually Jewish the lengths they will go to to fulfill their genocidal intent is not yet public knowledge as a matter of fact many believe that all the Nazis want is to get the Jews out of Europe and until 1941 they might have been sort of right within the higher Nazi echelons the method to purge Europe from Jews the final solution is still under debate among the proposed ideas presented as an alternative to immediate mass murder is to resettle the Jews in the furthest corners of the soon to be 1,000-year Reich somewhere in the Luben region between the BG and Vistula Rivers some other proposals are far more ambitious than this suggesting that the Jews be resettled in Madagascar to be clear though the extermination of Europe's Jews is always the gold it's the method and speed generational genocide by for sterilization of slaves inside the raich faster by succumbing to an unsustainable migration to to for instance Madagascar or immediate by mass murder by the summer of 1941 the faction advocating immediate mass murder prevails and the Holocaust begins with pges during operation Barbarosa to invade the Soviet Union the governments in Moscow Washington DC and Great Britain become aware of the ongoing Slaughter at latest by Autumn of 1941 but it Tes until May 42 for the public to find out when the BBC will first report on the Mass killings of Polish Jews by then Operation Reinhard and the 100 deadliest day of the Holocaust are about to begin these 100 days constitute the biggest Act of mass murder per day in known human history and building on the Holocaust by bullets in the preceding months the slaughter will continue until the last day of the war killing over 6 million 68% of all Jewish people still living in Europe in 1939 close to 90% of anyone deemed Jewish and unfortunate enough to end up in the hands of the Nazis before all of that happens not even the Jews themselves could imagine the true scale of horror about to unfold in their ignorance some even thought the Nazis could be instrumentalized against the British yeah until now in our story Jewish opposition to the British and Palestine has mostly been through diplomacy and political pressure yet there have also been a smaller movement of militant oppos decision and sanism in 1920 the hagana defense was formed as a paramilitary defensive body to protect settlers and other Jewish Palestinians frustrated by a lack of progress offshoots from hagana chose a more aggressive approach Chief among them perhaps the eron the few hundred strong underground militia labels herself as far right and has been fighting both Arab nationalists and the British colonial Administration among other things during the Arab revolts When The War breaks out it officially seizes all work against the British in light of the bigger German threat some members grow dissatisfied with this decision and in August 1940 a former iron member Abram Stern forms Lei a breakaway group their goal is to force the British out of Palestine immediately to form a Jewish State now in a rather counterintuitive development to facilitate their in 1941 Stern suggests collaboration with the Germans despite growing evidence of The Naz Sinister aims Stern is under the impression that the Nazis want to make their land uden R free of Jews through immigration so Stern believes that if the zioners in Palestine helped Nazi Germany in conquering the Middle East the Nazis in turn would help them establish a Jewish state in Palestine as a cherry on top the Jews expelled from Nazi controlled Europe could migrate there as well the Nazis never answer the proposal and it costs the organization aner himself much support he becomes a pariah and is killed by British police the same year on the other side of the conflict far less paradoxically the grand Muti of Jerusalem husseini also looks to German furer Adolf Hitler and the Nazis for support now we've made a video about him especially on our World War II channel it's quite interesting link is in the description to make a long story short the Nazis do take him in but his efforts in the end amount to little other than serving Nazi propaganda and recruiting a limited force of Arab Fighters for Germany who end up fighting in Europe for Germany not Palestine however except for minor exceptions like these overall World War II generally means a relaxation of tensions between Arabs and Jews in Palestine at least compared to before tensions between the British and the zionists on the other hand are worsening steadily the limit on Jewish migration of 10,000 per year is by now far more than a mere slap in the face of the Zionist leaders hundreds of thousands of Jews fleeing mass murder in Europe are turned back to die as a result the situation is made worse by most western democracies amongst them the US and Great Britain refusing to take in any significant number of Jewish refugees even as the Holocaust becomes public knowledge in 1942 even with mounting detailed and confirmed reports on the abhorent reality of the war against humanity the British refused to lift the limit on migration and resentment of the Jews towards the British grow while illegal immigration to Palestine does grow this is a trickle of people saved when compared to the growing stream of Nazi freight trains bringing Europeans deemed to be Jewish to the death factories and concentration camps by 1944 some Jewish paramilitary organizations have had enough and theun declares there is no longer any Armistice between the Jewish people and the British Administration inet Israel which hands our brothers over to Hitler armed action follows promptly on the 27th of February 1944 income tax offices in Jerusalem Tel Aviv and hia are are bombed yet at this time the majority of the Orthodox zionists in Palestine are still not in favor of an armed struggle against the British and condemn the attackers all the while the Arab Palestinians watch and are surprised by the Jewish attacks and the lackluster response of the British with the muties St doing radio broadcast in Berlin more or less they are however leaderless and seemingly wait until the end of the war to see Britain's further course before for making any concrete plans until 1945 when the scale and horror of the Nazi extermination becomes visible in images and testimony there will also be no unified Zionist Revolution against the British that year a new labor government in Britain promises to repeal the immigration ban even iron and lei briefly put down their weapons in anticipation however the promises are again not met strict limits on Jewish immigration to Palestine stay in place while 250,000 displaced Jews survivors of the Holocaust are spread across Europe this broken promise against the backdrop of the biggest genocide in known history is the straw that breaks the camels back launching a wave of active Jewish resistance against the British and a United Jewish Revolt emerges police stations are now attacked immigrant detainment facilities raided policemen shot bomb set often trains derailed in response the British used the freed Manpower from the end of World War II to increase its military presence in the Mandate by 1946 they will have around 880,000 troops stationed there curfews police searches arrests and detentions become the norm for the Arab and Jewish population alike living in the Mandate the genocide also brings a change in the international perception of Zionism to even a casual Observer the Dreadful fate of six million Jews has clearly and once and for all cemented The Tragic Truth behind hetzel's Insight in their uden that assimilation was never an option so while before the war International public support for a Jewish nation state had been waning it now receives growing solidarity on the other hand the forces behind the Arab Revolt of 1936 also start to regain some steam and tensions between the Jews and Arabs again rise to pre-war levels the ongoing and sizable illegal immigration during and after the war further feeds Arab Warriors by 1946 the Jewish population Grows by another 100,000 to around 630,000 the Arab population has also grown since 1922 and numbers 1.2 million so in only three decades the ratio of Jewish Palestinians to Arab Palestinians has gone from 1 to5 to 1 to2 to put it succinctly the the situation looks to be a completely hopeless mess the Arabs fight against the Jews and the British the Jews fight the Arabs and the British who have abandoned them and the British desperately try to retain some level of control over the region on November 30th 1947 it all descends into a full out Civil War the trigger is the adoption of resolution 1812 by the newly formed United Nations General Assembly on November 29th now in February the British had announced that they will relinquish their mandate in 1948 a resolution of the growing Fiasco is left to the young United Nations The Proposal is a plan of partition in other words a two-state solution while the Jews Rejoice at this proposal for an officially recognized Jewish State Arab protests erupt all throughout the Mandate and soon spread to the rest of the entire Middle East for the Arabs petition means above anything else war or as Secretary General of the Arab League Abdul Rahman Assam Pasha puts it the Arab world is not in the mood to compromise we shall fight you will gain Nothing by peaceful means and compromises it is too late to speak of peaceful Solutions an atmosphere of violence engulfs the entire region and the Powder Keg finally explodes buses are attacked markets are bombed and retali I atory attacks on villages on both sides are conducted by the end of December 1947 the 100,000 Jewish residents of Jerusalem are under blockade throughout the entirety of this chaos the British do little more than focus on the extraction of their personnel and material resources from the region with as few losses as possible finally on May 14th 1948 the British completely withdraw what follows the second phase of the Civil War or the 1948 war will become known in the Arab world as the first Palestine War by Palestinians as al-a the disaster and by Jews mil haat ho the war of independence at the beginning of the Civil War the Arab forces had the clear advantage in Manpower while the Jews had more Weaponry better organization and had extensively prepared for the war since 1945 nevertheless the hagana now on its way to become the IDF the Israeli Defense Force is largely under defensive during the first four months of hostilities until March of 1948 the conflict is characterized by gradually expanding continuously small scale small unit fighting with no clear front lines at the same time the call for a Jihad reverberates around the Arab world and while many volunteers are available any efforts are marred by lack of organization training facilities and funding the Arab High Council is not only struggling to support the war interiorly but is also beset by paralyzing internal differences the better organized and unified Israelis are laer focused on the procurement of small and heavy weapons and aeroplanes in post World War Europe there is an abundance of surplus arms the Israelis collect a pot parri of weapons from across the world war biger 10 s199 mmid Avia Fighters thousands of Mouser rifles NG 34s millions of rounds of ammunition from Czechoslovakia 50 65 mm guns 12 120 mm mortars 10 age 35 light tanks and a large number of halft tracks from France and while the US publicly backtracks on any active support even for the partition plan they are still willing to supply equipment some repainted and defined as agricultural on May 14th the day of the British departure and just after the British High commissioner had left Jerusalem for good chairman of the Jewish agency and soon to be first prime minister of Israel David benuron speaking to other Jewish leaders members of the National Council the people's Administration the Zionist General Council and party politician announces the land of Israel was the birthplace of the Jewish people here their spiritual religious and national identity was formed accordingly to the UN resolution we hereby proclaim the establishment of the the Jewish State the state of Israel technically and perhaps legally that transforms the war from a civil war to an international conflict the same day forces from Iraq Egypt trans Jordan Lebanon and Syria attacked the newly formed Jewish State the Arab Coalition immediately occupied the areas in Southern and Eastern Palestine not under Jewish control as per UN resolution next they capture East Jerusalem on paper this seems quite daunting six countries fighting against a country just a day old and in the beginning it certainly is the Jewish Community suffered heavy casualties it reeled from the shock of contact with regular Arab armies and it suffered an ordeal which left indelible marks on the national psyche for the people who lived through this ordeal the sense of being MIM the few against the many could not have been more real however already in the early days of the international conflict despite being numerically inferior the highly motivated and by now comparatively well equipped Israeli forces successfully repel repeated Arab attacks on their positions while the UN manages to broker ceasefires during the conflict both sides disregard the stipulations of the agreement and use the time to improve their positions more weapons export to Israel also arrived during the first truce between the 11th of June and the 9th of July 1948 greatly enhancing its military capabilities meanwhile INF fighting between various Arab states increases during this first truce for Amir Abdullah of trans Jordan the war is effectively over he wants to incorporate what is left of Eastern Palestine into a new Jordanian Kingdom and unsuccessfully lobbies other Arab states to agree to this solution recently some revisionist historians have suggested that this in fighting between the Arab states had a larger effect on the outcome of the war than previously assumed one could even go so far as to see the war as an inter Arab conflict which the Israeli forces aily exploited to conquer Palestine you see although the Arab armies do not openly fight each other their actions are mutually destructive instead of working together and fighting the zionists as one cohesive force they wait while the Israelis send home one Arab Army after the other the two major factions involved in this inner Arab dispute are the hashimite block represented by imir Abdullah and the Egyptian Saudi and Syrian block the plan of Amir Abdullah is the same dream his brother FAL had after World War I the kingdom of Greater Syria unsurprisingly the overarching goal of the syrians is to prevent this from happening the Egyptians and Saudis similarly do not want a kingdom of Greater Syria thus the Arab states are more concerned with their National interest than with defeating the sinist or helping the Palestinians painted in this light the war seems not to have been for Israel to win but rather for the Arabs to lose sadly the war continues for another year and in a cruel twist of fate the Palestinian Arabs now suffer the Fate from which the zionists argue a right to their state diaspora by early 1949 the Israelis have successfully occupied all of the Nev the area in the south of today's Israel except for the Gaza Strip between February and July 1949 Armistice Agreements are signed between Israel and each of the Arab states and temporary Frontiers are established but while the war officially ends the suffering does not the Arab Palestinians suffer the most in this conflict and one sobering number can perhaps best illustrate that point 167,168 are killed 4,000 soldiers and 2,000 civilians on the Arab side slightly over 10,000 soldiers and civilians lose their lives 167,168 is the number of Palestinians living in Palestine in 1950 remember in 1946 they numbered over 1.2 million so more than 750,000 Arab Palestinian civilians roughly 75% of the entire Arab population have fled or been forcefully expelled from their homes some regions in Palestine such as haa lose as much as 90% of their Arab population during their their 1948 counter offensive the IDF carry out several ethnic cleansing operations such as operation Dany or operation yuav during the latter alow no less than eight massacres against Arabs are committed by the IDF and 200,000 to 220,000 people driven into flight men women and children whose families have lived in that region since anyone could remember now are driven from their Homeland they will end up in refugee camps set up by the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestine refugees in the near East in 1949 53 refugee camps will be created on both sides of the River Jordan and the Gaza Strip in Lebanon and in Syria for the first 8 years these camps are nothing more than 10 cities lacking basic infrastructure and supply of goods to date in 2023 none of the refugees have been allowed to return to their homes through population growth the refugees have reached almost 6 million it Remains the longest unresolved Refugee crisis in the world so while the beginning of the war and the isolation of Israel decisively shape its National psyche for the native Arabs War defeat humiliation and panicked flight do the same the root of this conflict is often framed as purely religious and ethnic differences it's far more complicated than that and then again it's far simpler than that it's about one simple basic human need to have a home a place where we can feel safe be ourselves share food have protection from the elements and the love of our closest and dearest when you take that away from any of us we will run wild and act like feral animals flee or fight with teeth and Claws to protect our safe haven and our loved ones one side you have millions of people who have for Generations been denied that right time and time again to be driven from house to house Village to village town to town city to City Country to Country and then finally by train into the furnaces of Hell by the millions simply for being the Sons and Daughters of their parents no other reason the other side you have a people held in bondage by Imperial interests in Far Away cities for centuries whose development into the comfort and relative safety of the modern world was denied them to serve the colonial chauvinism of people they have never even met a people now driven into Exile by the other disenfranchised people simply because both sides were fooled lied to and pitted against each other that is the tragedy of the promised land its promises are always a robbery a lie and the Betrayal of a promise made to someone else Perhaps it is not so much a Promised Land as a cursed land as long as we cannot accept the absolute Covenant of universal and equal rights and work together to create prosperity and safety for all of us for that we need to accept that my suffering is not more terrible than yours and your

it can be resolved at all for the answer we only have to look at what the British and French Colonial Powers did to the Jewish and Arab people who share a belief that bibl land around Jerusalem is their promised land this is how the Israeli Palestinian conflict began I'm Sparticus Olen I'm Sebastian Brader Sebastian one of our most recent additions to our time G team has done the research for and co-written with me this special extra long episode of time ghost into context today due to increasing demand from our community and events tragically unfolding in Israel and Palestine we will look into the historical beginnings of the Israeli Palestinian conflict we will try to uncover what motivations mechanisms and historical events led to today's situation to be clear we are historians and we do not take sides in this conflict our side is always Humanity all of humanity and always Humanity never just a part of humanity we expressly condemn all forms of hatred and Terror and expect all nations to uphold the principles of international law conflict and War to narrate the events unfolding in the world as we speak is not our purpose it is also not our purpose to assign blame or Justify the actions of one or the other party we simply give you the past events as they unfolded we hope that may help you all to better understand if not the causes then at least some of the historical aspects and perhaps in a perfect world become part of a future solution we also do not pretend to have covered every event or every aspect of this conflict not even in this long an episode but we do claim that what we will get is to as much of a concise fair and precise overview as possible okay most of the time when dealing with generational longlasting conflicts the roots of the problem reach back far into ages past in this case they reached back very far indeed several Millennia in fact the year year is 1098 Common Era and Pope Urban II called for the first of eight eventual Crusades the goal to capture the holy city of Jerusalem why you may ask at its core it's really quite simple basic geopolitical consideration about power and wealth the sjuk Empire had made significant territorial gains against the byzantines in the decade before this threatens to change the entire power structure in Asia Minor for the Christians in the Eastern Roman Empire and then the Holy Roman Empire control of the region offers strong economic incentives most notably through trade hence when alexio the first asks for help from his Western Christian Brethren the motivations are clear however this is not what the pope presents to the general public as his main reason he and the Catholic church spread the narrative that the pilgrimage to the holy city has become perilous and uncertain for most Travelers this message packaged in the form of propagandistic church sermons whips up a sort of religious fervor and fanaticism about protecting the Cradle of Christianity from Heathen influence and ensuring the safe pilgrimage of Believers to the holy SES and in the end the Pope's Ambitions and those of contemporary rulers are not fulfilled as you may have already guessed by the fact that there were eight Crusades to make a very very long story short all this paves the way for 10 centuries R of sectarian conflict that continues to ferment Strife to this day and has globally become an ingrained aspect of the perceived identity of the region in other words Jerusalem has been the hot spot of conflict between the three abrahamic religions since at least 1098 if you count Jewish Strife in the region by itself even all the way back to Antiquity that is why in our search for answers we need to tread carefully when examining the importance of Jerusalem and the Very ious conflicts that have been fought over it throughout the centuries as we mentioned one of the reasons for the First Crusade was the threat of Muslim influence in Asia Minor roughly 350 years later on the 19th of May 1453 the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire would not only Mark the definitive end of Christian influence in Asia Minor but also its eventual demise in Eastern Europe the Ottoman Empire would remain in control of the region for almost 500 years and would shape the region its people and its future the city of Jerusalem can perhaps serve as a proxy to understand the makeup of the Ottoman Empire as a whole it is a land of many cultures religions and peoples the census taken in Jerusalem from 1562 to 1563 underlines this it's roughly 10% of the population are then Jewish 12% Christian and 78% Muslim Within These distinctions based on religion many more could be made on culture overall however the population was rather small at 12,617 total contrary to the west where Jewish people continually face persecution and discrimination from the 16th to the 19th century they are rather safe and prosper under ottoman Rule now a quick sidebar here yes the Jews in Jerusalem were relatively safe compared to Western Europe at least but they were still not full citizens any non-muslims were considered diim or people of The Pact based on passages in the Quran Surah 9:29 fight against Those whom the scriptures were given and who believe not in God until they pay the tribute out of hand and are humbled members of other religions are expected to pay a special tax wear distinctive clothing and Obey other rules which set them apart from the first class citizenry of of the Empire while not perfect this two class system is still significantly less discriminatory than the status quo in Western Christendom even more so as the conflict within the Western Christian Nation intensifies throughout the 17th century Jewish people are seen as potential allies diplomats and spies as the persecution in Europe continues Jews from Spain Sicily France and Hungary settle all over the empire overall throughout the existence of the Ottoman Empire until its very end its Jews and Arabs generally got along fairly well and without much Strife because of different diasporas Jewish people coming to the Ottoman Empire were descendants of people who had migrated to Europe centuries prior two major groups are the sapharic and ashkanazi Jews the sapharic Jews settled in modern Spain while their precise origin in the region remains unclear Some sources suggest that members of the judian ruling class were moved there after the Roman Emperor Titus destroyed Jerusalem in 70 current ERA when in 1492 Isabella and Ferdinand of Spain succeed in bringing all of Spain under Christian rule the sapharic Jews are faced with the Edict of expulsion essentially giving them the choice between conversion summary execution or migration similarly it seems as though the ashkanazi Jews also hailed from Judea originally how exactly their distinct community formed so far remains unknown well what we do know is that by the Middle Ages they settled in middle and southern Europe but as their distant Spanish relatives they were faced with expulsions in England France and later Germany which gradually pushed them Eastward as such the Ottoman Empire was not the only place that Jewish people sought to escape persecution in Western Europe the other option was Eastern Europe the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth welcomed many disenfranchised Jews throughout the late Middle Ages and its sizable Jewish population would be absorbed by the Russian Empire later on sadly the situation of relative safety in the Russian Empire would not last and by the end of the 19th century Jewish people in Russia were experiencing that from which they had fled again and again discrimination and persecution in other words diasporas now this leads to two essential things one two waves of Jewish Mass Exodus from Russia the first and second Aliyah to the emergence of cism as a political movement from 1881 to 1882 Jewish Russians increasingly face pogroms it all begins with the assassination of Zar Alexander II on the 1st of March 1881 as so often in times of turmoil and uncertainty people look for scapegoats and as so often before in the history of Europe the scapegoats are agents of foreign influence or in other words Jews the two years of prosecution most notably the pgrs of Kiev Warsaw and Odessa lead to the first aliia the first Ascent in English further prosecution from 1903 to 1905 marks the beginning of the second Aliyah which lasts until 1914 as a result the Jewish population in the Levant the region that today stretches along the Mediterranean Coast from Southern turkey to the Israeli Egyptian border grows from around 24,000 in 1882 to almost 100,000 in 1914 however the vast majority of Jewish people fleeing Russia go somewhere else the United States between 1907 and 1914 alone almost 1.5 million Jews pass through Ellis Island while about 20,000 immigrate to Pal this despite the fact that over the centuries several self-proclaimed Messiahs had tried to persuade Jews to return to the torah's promised land with little success in Eastern Europe haway sonion lovers of Zion is formed to promote the settlement of Jewish farmers and artisans in Palestine the individual who will politicize this idea and coin the term Zionism is Theodore hatza an austr Hungarian journalist hatel regards assimilation as the most desirable option for Jewish people but contends that in the face of centuries of anti-Semitism and persecution it is simply not possible in vain we are loyal Patriots our loyalty in some places running to extremes we are still cried down as strangers the answer to this problem is in hertel's eyes the creation of a Jewish nation state he argues that if the Jewish people are forced by external pressure to form a state it would have to be by migration into one distinct territory the whole concept of a nation state as such is a novel concept at the time until the creation of Belgium and Greece in 1830 there had not been a single nation state on the whole planet how does one approach such a Monumental task founding a state without any land well Herzel seemingly has a Clear Vision of how to get there and it begins in bosil in 1897 with the first scientist Congress later he will write in his diary where I to sum up the Basel Congress in a word it would be this at basil I founded the Jewish state if I said this out loud today I would be answered by Universal laughter perhaps in 5 years certainly in 50 everyone will know it now thereby the idea of a Jewish return to the promised land has been combined with the modern notion of a nation state and this project will eventually give birth to today's state of Israel almost to the day 50 years later after the basil Congress to get there hatel arranges talks with various leaders of large countries such as Germany and France but only the British are receptive to the idea offering 15,500 square kilm of uninhabited Uganda for settlement however the prospect of a new country in the middle of Africa is not very appealing to the zionists and they continue to hope for the return to the promised land they are however aware that advocating for the establishment of a Jewish nation state in the Levant could meet Fierce opposition especially by the Arabs living there and by other International actors to avoid this problem their phrasing is carefully fine-tuned referring to a Homeland rather than a state the main slogan of the Zionist movement at the time is a land without people for a people without land there is only one problem there are in fact people in the land as many as 595,000 by 1914 to be exact thus some zionists know that in order for their Endeavor to succeed at least initially the Goodwill of the native arish population is of utmost importance a sentiment not always shared by Jewish settlers causing concerns within the Zionist movement as says say Zionist humanist a har yet what do our Brethren do in Palestine just the very opposite surfs they were in the lands of the diaspora and suddenly they find themselves in unrestricted freedom and this change has awakened in them an inclination to despotism they treat the Arabs with hostility and cruelty deprive them of their rights offend them without cause and even boast of these deeds and nobody Among Us opposes this despicable and dangerous inclination he also notes that generally many sists are not open to objections that people are already living in the region sadly his words are not heeded and this is where we can first observe the lines along which the eventual cracks and tensions will appear hatel dies in 1904 well before Zionism has fully matured as a political movement and before the problems outlined by harm become relevant in any case Hat's Vision will continue to grow and spread to Jewish people across the globe but then in 1914 the first world war threatens to completely alter the governance structure and the lives of people in the region of today's Palestine and Israel the British Empire will now play a major role in deciding the fate of the entire Middle East they will be joined by another continent spinning Colonial Empire of the time France naturally the British expect to win the war and as such make preparations and agreements in anticipation of their Victory this means negotiating with various Global players such as France but also with smaller Regional players and other interest groups at the heart of all of this diplomacy there is a clear goal the greatest possible benefit to Britain to make this a reality the British enter into almost simultaneous negotiations with the French and other unton power poers local tribes in the Southeastern part of the Ottoman Empire today's Middle East and the zionists while these negotiations do not all start on the same day they clearly overlap in their preparation and execution the only problem is that the British make promises they cannot keep that is to say they make contradictory promises to varying partners by 1917 their vindictiveness becomes apparent for all to see okay so three competing promises have been made the buff War Declaration of 1917 the letters between Sir Henry McMahon British High Commissioner of Egypt and Sharif Hussein the Amir of Mecca and a secret agreement with the French they all center around the same question how do you carve up the proverbial cake or more succinctly who gets what part of the Ottoman Empire's carcass the secret deal between France and Britain is facilitated by the diplomats Mark Sykes and franois Jor Pico hence the name Sykes Pico agreement and it will decide the future of the entire Middle East turkey itself will be allowed Independence but largely stay occupied by the Allies Syria and Mesopotamia will be carved away from turkey and fall under French and British control respectively now the Syria of 1920 is what we know today as Jordan Israel Lebanon Palestine and parts of Syria Mesopotamia is today's Iraq Kuwait parts of Syria and parts of Saudi Arabia now if you think that the ethnic map of Europe causes problems when the lands are divided into nation states this is even worse many of the tribes living here are still nomadic the stationary population is a mixture of various Arab tribes Shia Muslims Sunni Muslims a dozen or so Christian denominations Jews and many more the language ethnicities are just as diverse with speakers of a variety of Arab dialects Kurdish Hebrew Armenian Turkish Persian and many more smaller languages and these ethnicities are not clearly separated geographically the colonial power brokering ensures the continued influence of France and Britain in the region however it also directly contradicts the promises made to the Zionist and the shareif now throughout the Great War TE Lawrence AKA Lawrence of Arabia and imir fisel the eldest son of the sheriff of Mecca head of the hashimite family worked together to secure the cooperation of the Arab tribes against the Ottoman Empire the idea is that fisel and his father could be onon friendly rulers who will bring stability and prosperity to the region why the Sharif of Mecca you might ask well because as the steward or keeper of Islam's most important holy sites he is seen as a representative of all Arabs in the region a sentiment that some Arabs do not share in the letter exchange the Sharif clearly demands the independence of the Arab countries and provides exact Maps as to what territories he deems to constitute the Arab sphere of influence this area clearly includes today's Palestine and Israel in return the British expect the staging of an Arab revolt against the ottoman to which the shareif agrees as a resp McMahan notes Great Britain is prepared to recognize and support the independence of all Arabs in the regions within the limits demanded by the shareif of Mecca again the British goal is to advance Britain's interest the support from the local tribes against the Ottomans does just that further destabilizing ottoman control in the region while seaing a Britain friendly population which could come in handy after the end of the war however the Sykes piku agreement we mentioned earlier outlines a very different future path for the region France wants control over the whole of Syria and Palestine the British make some arguments towards fulfilling the promises to the shareif but as discussions proceed gradually compromise away the reality of any establishment of truly autonomous States putting key areas of it under their own or French control or as they put it influence the spirit of these negotiation is really quite exemplary of the colonial attitude of the time that in the blue area of France and in the red area Great Britain shall be allowed to establish such direct or indirect Administration or control as they desire and as they may think fit to arrange with the Arab state or Confederation of Arab states in effect a significant area of the map provided by the shareif in the letter exchange and agreed upon by the British has become subject to the whims of France and in Britain a vassel state so to speak naturally this would not sit well with the Arab tribe leaders so they are not invited to the discussions put it clearly the British knowingly and purposefully have now made competing Promises to the French and Arabs all in their best interest if Britain were a person one might describe them as an egotistic opportunist opportunism that Segways into vindictiveness when you see how the next conflicting agreement practically programs conflict in the region that would be the B four declaration well it's what zionists have been waiting for ever since they rejected the idea of erecting the Jewish state in Uganda support for a Jewish state in Palestine his Majesty's government view with favor The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best Endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object the Declaration is the direct result of sanist organizations approaching past future and current British government members interestingly Sykes the namesake of the Sykes PCO agreement will be of most use in this endeavor the scientists openly state that they prefer a British protectorate over an American or French one but as expected the reasons behind the British support of the idea are more complex than mere Sympathy for the Jew cause once again the central motivation is geopolitical power brokering leading to the biggest possible upside for Britain primarily in 1915 and 16 as the Great War still rages without us involvement the British want to Garner political support among Jewish people for the war effort especially in the US they also hope that Pro British Jewish settlers to the region could protect the approaches to the sus canal and and thus Safeguard a vital route of goods in communication with British colonies further east especially India last but not least they hope for all these settlers to Splinter any anti-british opposition and make it easier to secure natural resources like the as of yet largely untapped oil reserves just one problem the British are promising away land that they have neither Sovereign rights to nor any argument for having a proprietary interest in not to mention no authority to dispose of that alone especially enrages many Arab leaders while the balur Declaration also runs contrary to the syes P agreement which sees Palestine fall under French control the British are able to convince the French of the idea of Jewish colonization so the French agreed to put the area of Palestine under International supervision which shall eventually lead to the British mandate under the lead of Nations perhaps the words of later military governor of Palestine Colonel Ronald stores can best describe the situation Palestine up to now a Muslim country has fallen into the hands of a Christian power which on the eve of its Conquest announced that a considerable portion of its land is to be handed over for colonization purposes to a nowhere very popular people Mark how despite the mild self-deprecation he manages to insert an anti-semitic undertone in any case the inclusion of the Bal for declaration as a res of the British mandate in conflict with the Arab self-determination lays down a foundation built on irreconcilable differences on which the British will now erect a house of cards however as already intimated the British do not openly negotiate competing promises otherwise one or all of their Partners could have easily spotted the lack of commitment to any of them yep all these Agreements are made in secret however that secrecy will not be possible to maintain to see how it all begins to unravel we return to Russia right after the October revolution in 1917 in their quest for fuel to drive their transformation to the dictatorship of the proletariat the Bolsheviks leave no stone unturned this includes scouring the former State archives for any useful information to use politically amongst the treasures of political Dynamite they find is a copy of the Sykes Pico agreement Lenin reputedly disgusted by the imperialist Ambitions of the agreement publishes it along with a slew of Russian imperial treaties the Manchester Guardian then reprints the whole agreement on the 26th of November 1917 this causes quite some embarrassment for the French and British and the Arabs are scandalized to what degree these emotions eventually pav the way for the next chapter in this sorted drama can only be left to speculation nonetheless a new chapter it is once the Great War is Over the war has given wi to the sales of nationalist emotions around the world arguably this is the moment when the idea of nation states countries founded on some kind of discreete geography and shared identity ceases to be a largely academic idea to popular sentiment okay this is of course a long process that began more than a century earlier but now that millions of men from across the globe have fought side by side for their Nation identities that before 1914 focused on family tribe or region have become supplanted by the idea of a common interest and identity based on larger geopol political constructs previously mainly of interest to a small ruling class paradoxically at the same time a general distrust of the larger Imperial order of the world and the ruling classes has led to a majority support for the idea of self-determination It Is by no means a class struggle these emotions supersede class and ethnicity and if not before at the Paris peace conference they become universally accepted principles at least for the peoples of America and Europe breaking a lance for the Arab world to be included in this game of nation-making is FAL by now the true representative of the Arab interest and prospective king of a pan-arabic Nation just before the Paris conference he meets with several major sist leaders most significantly he befriends biochemist Dr Kim vitman one of the main driving forces behind the Bal for declaration and president of of the British sist Federation on paper viman is a liberal Zionist who claims that for a Jewish state in Palestine to have success it must be in concert with Arab interest privately however he has called Arabs treacherous arrogant uneducated and greedy and has complained to the British that the system in Palestine does not take into account the fact that there is a fundamental qualitative difference between Jew and Arab fizal and BisMan find common ground in similar opinions about the Palestinian Arabs Vice man writes to his wife that FAL was contemptuous of the Palestinian Arabs whom he doesn't even regard as Arabs the outcome of their meeting is the fisal bitman Declaration in it fisal echoes the balur Declaration the establishment of a Jewish Home in Palestine he hopes that the official acceptance of the bord declaration would give him the support of the Zionist which in turn could Lobby the British on behalf of an independent greater Syria remarkably although facing enormous opposition to any such idea Fon manages to get the majority of the Arab leaders on board for the idea of a Jewish semi-autonomous state in Palestine along with Arab Independence within a pan Arabic Federation hopes that look like they may come true as the British now reiterate their promis of Arab Independence to fizal who begins to prepare to truly unify the Arab tribes behind a common cause yes if it only would be that simple the French are not at all happy about this development and pressure the British to come back to the principle of the syes peor agreement with the addition of a British mandate in Palestine in a not too surprising turn of developments the British secretly aband on all their promises to fisal instead of a United Federation of the Arab tribes they and fisal end up in a brief war with the French when the Arabs have finally had enough and take up arms to get their demands a brief war it is but it's also a long story of how the Arab tribes fall apart again and the Arab factions that are still at conflict more than 100 years later are formed within that fizel will become the first king of but all of that is a tale for another day before that can happen fizal surrenders to the French in 1920 and is extradited to Britain the defeat of fizal and the Arab leaders in 1920 marks the moment when development was more or less become set in stone and a new chapter begins the Middle East under Western rather than ottoman influence already before the Arab Rebellion fails the British mandate in Palestine the region that will eventually become Palestine Israel and parts of Jordan and Lebanon come under British military rule in 1920 a civilian Administration under sir Herbert Manuel takes charge now strictly speaking Britain has no right to occupy the territory according to international law which by the way is a novel concept pretty much forged at the Paris peace conference with the creation of the League of Nations in any case legal or not the league agrees that Palestine will fall under British rule and on the 24th of July 1923 with the Treaty of loan what is already deao reality will be formalized meanwhile in 1920 the tensions inside the Middle East continued to mount anything that is seen as a threat to a path towards Arab Independence at some point is a hot potato while the leaders around fizal have heard of The balur Declaration the general population has not moreover leaders who were maybe swayed by fizal now oppose any idea of Jewish autonomy then when Manuel's Administration comes in they make the Declaration public taken as an indication that it will be fulfilled outrage grows on the 4th of April 1920 violent protests engulf the holy city of Jerusalem at the end of the riot there are scores of dead and injured on both sides on the first day alone 150 Jews are injured however the British are not as United behind the Zionist cause as they seem to be at least not yet in fact it may be that touting the declaration has more Sinister reasons cut to a year later 1921 and ha Amin El husseini he is now appointed Grand muy of Jerusalem and president of the newly created Supreme Muslim Council the most authoritative religious legislative body in the Palestinian Muslim Community useni now begins to organize larger scale operations to terrorize Jews at the same time Colonel Richard minat haogen former head of British Security in Cairo writes in his diary that British officials inclined towards the exclusion of sanism in Palestine now let's go back to Easter 1920 only days before the Jerusalem riots when Colonel Waters Taylor financial adviser to the military Administration in Palestine from 1919 to 1923 meets with husseini is it a coincidence that the riots start right after according to Miner Haagen it most certainly is not he states that in the talks Taylor encourages Arab violence against the Jews going as far as to suggest toini that he had a great opportunity at Easter to show the world that Zionism was unpopular not only with the Palestine Administration but in whiteall and if disturbances of sufficient violence occurred in Jerusalem at Easter both General bols Chief administrator in Palestine and general alanby commander of Egyptian force and High Commissioner of Egypt would Advocate the abandonment of the Jewish Home wat's Taylor explained that freedom could only be attained through violence it is unclear whether the British officers are motivated by anti-jewish sentiments on their part or simple political considerations yet the two-faced nature of the British does not end there after the riots husseini who has fled to Jordan is sentenced to 10 years in prison in absentia then again in 1921 British arabist are able to convince the High Commissioner to Pardon husi and appoint him as Muti again subsequently more riots follow in 1921 and 43 Jews die as a result the ha craft commission is set up to evaluate the cause of these rides and we'll find that the fundamental cause of the acts of violence was a feeling among the Arabs of discontent with and hostility to the Jews due to political and economic causes and connected with Jewish immigration and with their conception of Zionist policy as derived from Jewish exponents husseini will play a major role in the development of the conflict as he consolidates his power over the Arab population and Palestine he uses his religiously derived authority to gain control over mosques schools and the courts as a result no Arab can reach an influential position without being loyal to him and his inherently anti-jewish stances in his role as Palestinian spokesperson towards the end of 1921 he writes Winston Churchill at the time Colonial secretary he demands that restrictions be put on Jewish immigration and that Palestine as a territory be United with trans Jordan and Syria these demands are partially based on developments outside of the Mandate of Palestine well at least theoretically the area west of the Jordan Palestine and east of the Jordan trans Jordan fall under one mandate the British effectively treat them as two separate entities this means that in trans Jordan the British have no ambition to establish a Jewish Home and their sole focus is a path towards Arab self-determination going even further they prohibit any Jewish immigration to trans Jordan it must have been quite something for the Arabs living in Palestine just across the river the reasons for their riots and protests are nonexistent and the British actively seek to enable Arab self-determination already in 1923 trans Jordan will achieve quasi independence with a hashimite king at the helm nonetheless and that would be Amir Abdullah I fal's brother in any case to be clear these British divisions of the territory is in no way shape or form reflected by the reality on the ground as we said earlier it's one ethnic or cultural group and the other separated by pencil line drawn in some fancy back office in London that in no way respects the tribal and nomadic culture of the region but back to Churchill and Hussein's demands to end Zionism in Palestine how does Winston respond does husseini get what he wants well no the Church of white paper or Church of memorandum doubles down on the balfor Declaration several years later while addressing the House of Commons Churchill will explain the purpose of the white paper to make it clear that the establishment of self-governing institutions in Palestine was to be subordinated to the Paramount plue and obligation of establishing a Jewish National home in Palestine as you can imagine essentially subordinating the self-governance of Arabs in the region to the creation of a Jewish National home does nothing to lessen the tensions with their backs now fully supported by the British government the zionists start to continue their efforts to create a Jewish state in Palestine their main tools to facility's Grand Endeavor are twofold immigration and land purchases in 1922 the Jews number only about 84,000 while the Arabs in the region number roughly eight times that however this is about to change throughout the 20s about 100,000 Jewish immigrants will arrive in Palestine leading to a total Jewish population of roughly 165,000 by 1929 overall the Jewish population in Palestine has more than doubled since 1918 accordingly the ratio of Arabs to Jews has shifted from 10 to 1 to 5 to to one with such an influx of people the ownership of land in Palestine has also changed rather drastically in 1920 it was estimated that around 650 square kilm or roughly 250 square miles were under Jewish ownership which constituted just shy of 2.5% of the total land area fast forward to 1929 and Jewish land ownership has grown to 1,200 square km nearly doubling and now constituting about 5% of the total land area looking at the total land area is problematic however since unable land is not really worth much and there's quite a lot of it in the area in total out of 26,000 Square kilm about 6,500 are arable of these the Jewish Community possesses round about 1 16 in 1929 well you might say 1 Sixth of the land for 1/5 of the people that does not seem too unfair there is one more decisive factor that so far we have not looked at and which heavily influences Arab sentiments about Jewish immigration and land ownership it is not the land ownership per se that causes so much Arab opposition but how the land ownership is managed by the Jewish communities in today's terms you might describe the practice simply as racial discrimination only Jewish laborers are allowed to work on the Jewish land and in Jewish settlements the land does not simply change ownership from an Arab to a Jew but it ceases to be a land from which the Arab can gain any advantage either now or at any time in the future not only can he never hope to lease or to cultivate it but he is deprived forever from employment on that land nor can anyone help him by purchasing the land and restoring it to common use these labor policies also run contrary to the articles of the Mandate the Zionist organization attempts to not assume any blame by not openly advocating their stringent labor policies some Zionist leaders including vitman also opposed the practices for example at the Zionist Congress of 1931 a resolution is passed that solemnly declared the desire of the Jewish people to live with the Arab people to develop the Homeland common to both into a prosperous Community which would ensure the growth of the peoples resolutions or not the practices feed into more anger suspicion and hatred in the region the Arabs faced with the reality that Britain openly favors sanist efforts over Arab self-determination feel betrayed Jews fleeing persecution in Europe now face the same in the promised land in August 1929 the conflict once again escalates as a dispute over the Western Wall in Jerusalem causes riots by Palestinian Arabs since 1925 Jews have been blocked access to the Wailing Wall as a measure by the British to calm emotions by segregation it all begins with a march on the Wailing Wall by 6,000 far8 Jewish zionists demanding access to the wall the protesters are unarmed and later reports conclude that the demonstration proceeds peacefully nevertheless false rumors that the Jews are about to seize the AL axam MOS and that they are attacking even slaughtering Muslims spread inflammatory articles in the Press of both sides fan hatred incensed Arab mobs then begin destroying Jewish owned property and beating Jewish people they find in the streets even killing them the riot soon spread Beyond Jerusalem the British police respond with gunfire and a few Jewish activists answer with violence of their own a week of bloody fighting leaves 133 Jewish Palestinians and 116 Arab Palestinians Dead with hundreds more wounded now note that we deliberately noted that the dead on both sides are Palestinians you see these events bring a deepening Rift to light many of the dead and wounded Jews are not immigrants not even zionists the collective punishment of Jewish communities in Palestine who had come to be their irrespective of Zionist ambition in ages past motivates more Jews to closely align themselves with the Zionist project likewise the violent response by the British police and a minority of Zionist activists further radicalizes some people in the Arab Community a cycle of violence giving birth to more violence that will last into our days has begun these events force a shift in British policy for the Mandate in Palestine the Shaw and hope Simmons commissions appointed to assess the events amongst other things heightens the awareness of the dangerous situation in Palestine as a result two immediate measures are taken in 1930 the increase of British troops in the region and a new policy on Palestine called the passfield white paper in it Palestinians as well as Jewish leaders are reprimanded the Jews for exerting pressure on officials to comply with Zionist wishes and the Arabs for excessively demanding self-determination both of them according to the report would render it impossible to carry out in the fullest sense the double undertaking this marks an important shift from the church of memorandum as now at least on paper the British make an effort to give the same importance to the creation of a Jewish Home and an Arab self-determination more specifically this means that the British are working towards a United Arab Jewish State you could call it a one-state solution furthermore the paper communicates the clear intent of reasserting British authority over the areas of immigration and land transfers which ever since the church memorandum had practically been in the hands of the zionists last the paper also calls for the creation of a common legislature where in both Arabs and Jews could deliberate a and reach a deeper understanding of each other after more than a decade of Fanning descent this change of TAC by the British is a fall into a canyon of their own digging zionists are not happy with the change and make their displeasure known by 1931 their efforts reach fruition and Dr vitman receives a letter from the British prime minister Ramsey McDonald where in the PM once again puts the zionists goals above rather than alongside those of Arab self-determination in a nutshell the church memorandum has been reinstated and un un surprisingly Palestinian Arabs feel short changed once again as zionists with renewed unquestioning British support renew immigration and land purchase efforts but there is a more dire threat to Jewish Europeans than simply the desire for a country of their own driving them to Palestine remember that Hat's whole reason behind the Zionist movement had been the continued and merciless persecution of Jews throughout the Centuries by the end of the 19th century was clear Beyond any doubt that for Jewish Europeans assimilation was simply not a viable option ASA would be proven right again during the third Aaliyah which lasted from 1919 to 1923 the Russian Revolution of 1917 led to a whole new scale of pogroms in Eastern Europe and in Ukraine from 1918 to 1921 more than 100,000 Jews were killed with acts of killing reaching an almost genocidal scale whereas earlier the goal had been to drive the Jews out now it seemed as if the goal was their complete eradication these mass killings are often forgotten in light of the great showah the Holocaust but the sheer scale of the violence leads some like French writer and journalist anat France to publicly question the security of close to 10 million Jews living in Europe and how right he would turn out to be as many of you will know by now in the early 1930s anti-Semitism in the whole of Europe is on the rise as is Jewish immigration combined with renewed British support of cism over self-determination this drives immigration to Palestine to record levels between 1930 and 1939 more than 230,000 Jews arrive in Palestine making their total population swell to somewhere around 450,000 turning the 1:5 ratio of 1929 into one of 1:3 uh at the same time land ownership also grows although not that drastically by 300 Square km to 1,500 total reaching almost 6% of the total land mass since nothing about the British policy changed and immigration continues the same as it had in the 1920s the result would also be similar however this time it is not just a Arab Revolution but the Arab revolt and it no no longer primarily targets the Jews it was an open rebellion of the Palestinian Arabs assisted by fellow Arabs from other countries against British mandatory rule in April 1936 things kick off with grand muy of Jerusalem husseini and the Arab hire committee calling for a general strike as the strike continues violence increases and the first attacks on British troops police stations and Jew settlements take place on the the Palestinian side one organization that plays a central role is the black hand founded in 1930 after the last Uprising it is an anti-zionist anti-british jihadist organization led by is Adin alasam a Syrian shik under Al Kasam the black hand now commits Terror attacks against Jewish immigrants and British residents Al Kazam dies in 1935 but his movement continues In The Same Spirit and dials up the terror in all around 7,000 Arabs are actively fighting the British by 1938 the British respond brutally by raising Villages looting and even executions the destruction of food and water supplies becomes standard practice to make the Arabs pay for their Disobedience by the time the Revolt loses steam in 1939 5,000 Arab Fighters have been killed while the British may have succeeded at quenching the Arab violence the uprising has not been for not already in 1937 in light of determin Arab resistance the British realize that their current policy as well as their more General ambition of fulfilling the Dual obligations are not feasible however vigorously and consistently maintained it will not solve the problem it will not elay it will exacerbate the quarrel between the Arabs and Jews the establishment of a single self-governing pales sign will remain just as impractical as it is now the solution to the problem and solomonian fashion would be bifurcation or in other words the splitting of Palestine into two the two-state solution but partition as you might imagine is unacceptable to Arab Nationals they've not just fought for a year and a half to lose a third of their country to the sinist so there is yet another change of heart among the colonial thinkers in London further examination has shown that the political administrative and financial difficulties involved in the proposal to create independent Arab and Jewish States inside Palestine are so great that this solution of the problem is impracticable so there's a new brilliant so far unthought of solution right no okay a workable solution which at least improves the situation somewhat no do they go back to the way things were yes you got to be kidding me well to be fair there is some change and yet another white paper the British decide to terminate the Mandate in 1949 by which time both Palestinians and Jews would share in government so back to dual Ambitions however they also renounced any intention to create a Jewish state in Palestine effectively nullifying the Bal declaration at the same time they also reject all Arab demands for self-determination and Jewish immigration is limited to 10,000 a year for the next 5 years this is arguably the best example of bad timing in all of human history Nazi Germany has by now graduated from anti-semitic rhetoric and oppression in Germany itself to launch a war aimed to annihilate all Jewish people in Europe with that as backdrop the Jewish Community is incensed by the new white paper with some even proposing a Jewish revolt against the British however for most the defeat of Nazi Germany seems most important as such the leader of the Jews in Palestine David benuron States in 1939 support the British as if there is no white paper and oppose the white paper as if there is no war while in 1939 it is certainly known that the Nazis are more than hostile towards anyone perceived as or actually Jewish the lengths they will go to to fulfill their genocidal intent is not yet public knowledge as a matter of fact many believe that all the Nazis want is to get the Jews out of Europe and until 1941 they might have been sort of right within the higher Nazi echelons the method to purge Europe from Jews the final solution is still under debate among the proposed ideas presented as an alternative to immediate mass murder is to resettle the Jews in the furthest corners of the soon to be 1,000-year Reich somewhere in the Luben region between the BG and Vistula Rivers some other proposals are far more ambitious than this suggesting that the Jews be resettled in Madagascar to be clear though the extermination of Europe's Jews is always the gold it's the method and speed generational genocide by for sterilization of slaves inside the raich faster by succumbing to an unsustainable migration to to for instance Madagascar or immediate by mass murder by the summer of 1941 the faction advocating immediate mass murder prevails and the Holocaust begins with pges during operation Barbarosa to invade the Soviet Union the governments in Moscow Washington DC and Great Britain become aware of the ongoing Slaughter at latest by Autumn of 1941 but it Tes until May 42 for the public to find out when the BBC will first report on the Mass killings of Polish Jews by then Operation Reinhard and the 100 deadliest day of the Holocaust are about to begin these 100 days constitute the biggest Act of mass murder per day in known human history and building on the Holocaust by bullets in the preceding months the slaughter will continue until the last day of the war killing over 6 million 68% of all Jewish people still living in Europe in 1939 close to 90% of anyone deemed Jewish and unfortunate enough to end up in the hands of the Nazis before all of that happens not even the Jews themselves could imagine the true scale of horror about to unfold in their ignorance some even thought the Nazis could be instrumentalized against the British yeah until now in our story Jewish opposition to the British and Palestine has mostly been through diplomacy and political pressure yet there have also been a smaller movement of militant oppos decision and sanism in 1920 the hagana defense was formed as a paramilitary defensive body to protect settlers and other Jewish Palestinians frustrated by a lack of progress offshoots from hagana chose a more aggressive approach Chief among them perhaps the eron the few hundred strong underground militia labels herself as far right and has been fighting both Arab nationalists and the British colonial Administration among other things during the Arab revolts When The War breaks out it officially seizes all work against the British in light of the bigger German threat some members grow dissatisfied with this decision and in August 1940 a former iron member Abram Stern forms Lei a breakaway group their goal is to force the British out of Palestine immediately to form a Jewish State now in a rather counterintuitive development to facilitate their in 1941 Stern suggests collaboration with the Germans despite growing evidence of The Naz Sinister aims Stern is under the impression that the Nazis want to make their land uden R free of Jews through immigration so Stern believes that if the zioners in Palestine helped Nazi Germany in conquering the Middle East the Nazis in turn would help them establish a Jewish state in Palestine as a cherry on top the Jews expelled from Nazi controlled Europe could migrate there as well the Nazis never answer the proposal and it costs the organization aner himself much support he becomes a pariah and is killed by British police the same year on the other side of the conflict far less paradoxically the grand Muti of Jerusalem husseini also looks to German furer Adolf Hitler and the Nazis for support now we've made a video about him especially on our World War II channel it's quite interesting link is in the description to make a long story short the Nazis do take him in but his efforts in the end amount to little other than serving Nazi propaganda and recruiting a limited force of Arab Fighters for Germany who end up fighting in Europe for Germany not Palestine however except for minor exceptions like these overall World War II generally means a relaxation of tensions between Arabs and Jews in Palestine at least compared to before tensions between the British and the zionists on the other hand are worsening steadily the limit on Jewish migration of 10,000 per year is by now far more than a mere slap in the face of the Zionist leaders hundreds of thousands of Jews fleeing mass murder in Europe are turned back to die as a result the situation is made worse by most western democracies amongst them the US and Great Britain refusing to take in any significant number of Jewish refugees even as the Holocaust becomes public knowledge in 1942 even with mounting detailed and confirmed reports on the abhorent reality of the war against humanity the British refused to lift the limit on migration and resentment of the Jews towards the British grow while illegal immigration to Palestine does grow this is a trickle of people saved when compared to the growing stream of Nazi freight trains bringing Europeans deemed to be Jewish to the death factories and concentration camps by 1944 some Jewish paramilitary organizations have had enough and theun declares there is no longer any Armistice between the Jewish people and the British Administration inet Israel which hands our brothers over to Hitler armed action follows promptly on the 27th of February 1944 income tax offices in Jerusalem Tel Aviv and hia are are bombed yet at this time the majority of the Orthodox zionists in Palestine are still not in favor of an armed struggle against the British and condemn the attackers all the while the Arab Palestinians watch and are surprised by the Jewish attacks and the lackluster response of the British with the muties St doing radio broadcast in Berlin more or less they are however leaderless and seemingly wait until the end of the war to see Britain's further course before for making any concrete plans until 1945 when the scale and horror of the Nazi extermination becomes visible in images and testimony there will also be no unified Zionist Revolution against the British that year a new labor government in Britain promises to repeal the immigration ban even iron and lei briefly put down their weapons in anticipation however the promises are again not met strict limits on Jewish immigration to Palestine stay in place while 250,000 displaced Jews survivors of the Holocaust are spread across Europe this broken promise against the backdrop of the biggest genocide in known history is the straw that breaks the camels back launching a wave of active Jewish resistance against the British and a United Jewish Revolt emerges police stations are now attacked immigrant detainment facilities raided policemen shot bomb set often trains derailed in response the British used the freed Manpower from the end of World War II to increase its military presence in the Mandate by 1946 they will have around 880,000 troops stationed there curfews police searches arrests and detentions become the norm for the Arab and Jewish population alike living in the Mandate the genocide also brings a change in the international perception of Zionism to even a casual Observer the Dreadful fate of six million Jews has clearly and once and for all cemented The Tragic Truth behind hetzel's Insight in their uden that assimilation was never an option so while before the war International public support for a Jewish nation state had been waning it now receives growing solidarity on the other hand the forces behind the Arab Revolt of 1936 also start to regain some steam and tensions between the Jews and Arabs again rise to pre-war levels the ongoing and sizable illegal immigration during and after the war further feeds Arab Warriors by 1946 the Jewish population Grows by another 100,000 to around 630,000 the Arab population has also grown since 1922 and numbers 1.2 million so in only three decades the ratio of Jewish Palestinians to Arab Palestinians has gone from 1 to5 to 1 to2 to put it succinctly the the situation looks to be a completely hopeless mess the Arabs fight against the Jews and the British the Jews fight the Arabs and the British who have abandoned them and the British desperately try to retain some level of control over the region on November 30th 1947 it all descends into a full out Civil War the trigger is the adoption of resolution 1812 by the newly formed United Nations General Assembly on November 29th now in February the British had announced that they will relinquish their mandate in 1948 a resolution of the growing Fiasco is left to the young United Nations The Proposal is a plan of partition in other words a two-state solution while the Jews Rejoice at this proposal for an officially recognized Jewish State Arab protests erupt all throughout the Mandate and soon spread to the rest of the entire Middle East for the Arabs petition means above anything else war or as Secretary General of the Arab League Abdul Rahman Assam Pasha puts it the Arab world is not in the mood to compromise we shall fight you will gain Nothing by peaceful means and compromises it is too late to speak of peaceful Solutions an atmosphere of violence engulfs the entire region and the Powder Keg finally explodes buses are attacked markets are bombed and retali I atory attacks on villages on both sides are conducted by the end of December 1947 the 100,000 Jewish residents of Jerusalem are under blockade throughout the entirety of this chaos the British do little more than focus on the extraction of their personnel and material resources from the region with as few losses as possible finally on May 14th 1948 the British completely withdraw what follows the second phase of the Civil War or the 1948 war will become known in the Arab world as the first Palestine War by Palestinians as al-a the disaster and by Jews mil haat ho the war of independence at the beginning of the Civil War the Arab forces had the clear advantage in Manpower while the Jews had more Weaponry better organization and had extensively prepared for the war since 1945 nevertheless the hagana now on its way to become the IDF the Israeli Defense Force is largely under defensive during the first four months of hostilities until March of 1948 the conflict is characterized by gradually expanding continuously small scale small unit fighting with no clear front lines at the same time the call for a Jihad reverberates around the Arab world and while many volunteers are available any efforts are marred by lack of organization training facilities and funding the Arab High Council is not only struggling to support the war interiorly but is also beset by paralyzing internal differences the better organized and unified Israelis are laer focused on the procurement of small and heavy weapons and aeroplanes in post World War Europe there is an abundance of surplus arms the Israelis collect a pot parri of weapons from across the world war biger 10 s199 mmid Avia Fighters thousands of Mouser rifles NG 34s millions of rounds of ammunition from Czechoslovakia 50 65 mm guns 12 120 mm mortars 10 age 35 light tanks and a large number of halft tracks from France and while the US publicly backtracks on any active support even for the partition plan they are still willing to supply equipment some repainted and defined as agricultural on May 14th the day of the British departure and just after the British High commissioner had left Jerusalem for good chairman of the Jewish agency and soon to be first prime minister of Israel David benuron speaking to other Jewish leaders members of the National Council the people's Administration the Zionist General Council and party politician announces the land of Israel was the birthplace of the Jewish people here their spiritual religious and national identity was formed accordingly to the UN resolution we hereby proclaim the establishment of the the Jewish State the state of Israel technically and perhaps legally that transforms the war from a civil war to an international conflict the same day forces from Iraq Egypt trans Jordan Lebanon and Syria attacked the newly formed Jewish State the Arab Coalition immediately occupied the areas in Southern and Eastern Palestine not under Jewish control as per UN resolution next they capture East Jerusalem on paper this seems quite daunting six countries fighting against a country just a day old and in the beginning it certainly is the Jewish Community suffered heavy casualties it reeled from the shock of contact with regular Arab armies and it suffered an ordeal which left indelible marks on the national psyche for the people who lived through this ordeal the sense of being MIM the few against the many could not have been more real however already in the early days of the international conflict despite being numerically inferior the highly motivated and by now comparatively well equipped Israeli forces successfully repel repeated Arab attacks on their positions while the UN manages to broker ceasefires during the conflict both sides disregard the stipulations of the agreement and use the time to improve their positions more weapons export to Israel also arrived during the first truce between the 11th of June and the 9th of July 1948 greatly enhancing its military capabilities meanwhile INF fighting between various Arab states increases during this first truce for Amir Abdullah of trans Jordan the war is effectively over he wants to incorporate what is left of Eastern Palestine into a new Jordanian Kingdom and unsuccessfully lobbies other Arab states to agree to this solution recently some revisionist historians have suggested that this in fighting between the Arab states had a larger effect on the outcome of the war than previously assumed one could even go so far as to see the war as an inter Arab conflict which the Israeli forces aily exploited to conquer Palestine you see although the Arab armies do not openly fight each other their actions are mutually destructive instead of working together and fighting the zionists as one cohesive force they wait while the Israelis send home one Arab Army after the other the two major factions involved in this inner Arab dispute are the hashimite block represented by imir Abdullah and the Egyptian Saudi and Syrian block the plan of Amir Abdullah is the same dream his brother FAL had after World War I the kingdom of Greater Syria unsurprisingly the overarching goal of the syrians is to prevent this from happening the Egyptians and Saudis similarly do not want a kingdom of Greater Syria thus the Arab states are more concerned with their National interest than with defeating the sinist or helping the Palestinians painted in this light the war seems not to have been for Israel to win but rather for the Arabs to lose sadly the war continues for another year and in a cruel twist of fate the Palestinian Arabs now suffer the Fate from which the zionists argue a right to their state diaspora by early 1949 the Israelis have successfully occupied all of the Nev the area in the south of today's Israel except for the Gaza Strip between February and July 1949 Armistice Agreements are signed between Israel and each of the Arab states and temporary Frontiers are established but while the war officially ends the suffering does not the Arab Palestinians suffer the most in this conflict and one sobering number can perhaps best illustrate that point 167,168 are killed 4,000 soldiers and 2,000 civilians on the Arab side slightly over 10,000 soldiers and civilians lose their lives 167,168 is the number of Palestinians living in Palestine in 1950 remember in 1946 they numbered over 1.2 million so more than 750,000 Arab Palestinian civilians roughly 75% of the entire Arab population have fled or been forcefully expelled from their homes some regions in Palestine such as haa lose as much as 90% of their Arab population during their their 1948 counter offensive the IDF carry out several ethnic cleansing operations such as operation Dany or operation yuav during the latter alow no less than eight massacres against Arabs are committed by the IDF and 200,000 to 220,000 people driven into flight men women and children whose families have lived in that region since anyone could remember now are driven from their Homeland they will end up in refugee camps set up by the United Nations relief and works Agency for Palestine refugees in the near East in 1949 53 refugee camps will be created on both sides of the River Jordan and the Gaza Strip in Lebanon and in Syria for the first 8 years these camps are nothing more than 10 cities lacking basic infrastructure and supply of goods to date in 2023 none of the refugees have been allowed to return to their homes through population growth the refugees have reached almost 6 million it Remains the longest unresolved Refugee crisis in the world so while the beginning of the war and the isolation of Israel decisively shape its National psyche for the native Arabs War defeat humiliation and panicked flight do the same the root of this conflict is often framed as purely religious and ethnic differences it's far more complicated than that and then again it's far simpler than that it's about one simple basic human need to have a home a place where we can feel safe be ourselves share food have protection from the elements and the love of our closest and dearest when you take that away from any of us we will run wild and act like feral animals flee or fight with teeth and Claws to protect our safe haven and our loved ones one side you have millions of people who have for Generations been denied that right time and time again to be driven from house to house Village to village town to town city to City Country to Country and then finally by train into the furnaces of Hell by the millions simply for being the Sons and Daughters of their parents no other reason the other side you have a people held in bondage by Imperial interests in Far Away cities for centuries whose development into the comfort and relative safety of the modern world was denied them to serve the colonial chauvinism of people they have never even met a people now driven into Exile by the other disenfranchised people simply because both sides were fooled lied to and pitted against each other that is the tragedy of the promised land its promises are always a robbery a lie and the Betrayal of a promise made to someone else Perhaps it is not so much a Promised Land as a cursed land as long as we cannot accept the absolute Covenant of universal and equal rights and work together to create prosperity and safety for all of us for that we need to accept that my suffering is not more terrible than yours and your

20,OdENyo4HvX4," [Music] the difficulty with the conflict between Israel and Palestine is that it has so many components immigration national identity Empires and colonialism democracy religion and modernization terrorism victimization persecution and War the question of Palestine must still remain on the world's agenda even when focusing on the simplest building blocks of its very Beginnings we can see how more more than anything subtle emphases differences between well-intentioned observers matters because of this I've carefully selected three main sources and drawn on many others the first and one I recommend the most is a very readable textbook called Arabs and Israelis conflict and peacemaking in the Middle East it's by three Scholars Abdul monum sedali Shai fieldman and khil shikaki and it pays careful attention attention to different historical narratives before analyzing them as even-handedly as possible then Palestinian American historian Rashid khalid's the Hundred Years War on Palestine is from a Palestinian perspective while Israeli writer Arisha vit my promised land is from an Israeli one their politics their strategies and tactics different they were together only in their vow to eradicate Israel and to return to of course even referring to a perspective as Israeli or Palestinian is an enormous oversimplification ignoring the vast differences there will always be within and between groups I've also drawn on a few historians who've been labeled Israeli new historians this loose group have challenged a traditional historical narrative in Israel that has been dominant this is something will come to in a bit the literature on this is vast intellectual humility is required so I'll only focus here on the origins only saying what I've read in these books I'll also return to a note briefly on how and why I've approached this in the way that I have at the end towards the end of the 19th century outbreaks of violence against Jews called pogroms increased across Eastern Europe in most countries Jews were second class citizens they couldn't own land vote had different and varying legal rights and were marginalized lived in ghettos and often randomly blamed for disruptions and targeted and murdered this was coming to a head in the last two decades of the 19th century in 1881 in Russia Jewish communities were attacked after Zar Alexander II was assassinated and one of the conspirators incidentally had Jewish ancestry a wave of pograms resulted but this was just one of many many instances in what we now call mova in 1903 49 Jews were killed and many more injured raped and their homes attacked the New York Times reported that the local police made no attempt to check the reign of terror at Sunset the streets were piled with corpses and wounded those who could make their escape fled in Terror and the city is now practically deserted of Jews in 1894 France's only Jewish Army C Alfred draus was accused of spying for Germany and wrongly prosecuted for treason in a widely publicized trial there were anti-semitic riots across the country eugenic theories about Superior races and blood and soil were also on the rise even in countries where Jews had rights like the US and Britain anti-Semitism was increasing both will have fascist parties and both will have outbreaks of violence so in 1897 seeing the writing on the wall the austr Hungarian Jewish journalist Theodore Herzel wrote a pamphlet the Jewish State arguing that the Jewish people needed a national home to avoid continual persecution he encouraged Jewish Europeans to buy land in Palestine but also considered Argentina the book resulted in the first Zionist Congress that same year Herzel was more than preent writing half a century before the Holocaust many Jews fearing for their lives left their homes in Eastern Europe most went to America some elsewhere and a few started moving to Palestine it's important to remember that this is a relatively borderless period traveling was very different and Palestine had been administered by the decaying Ottoman Empire for centuries it was home to a small number of Jews who lived peacefully with the vast majority of Arabs mainly Muslims with a few Christians this was a very different period from today Empires were the norm but often in Decline borders always changing and ideologies becoming powerful and the idea of nation states that a the people had the right to self-determine to govern themselves was on the rise in 1800 the population of the area was 2% Jewish some 6,700 by 1890 42,000 Jews had moved there while the Arab population was around half a million and by 1922 the Jewish population had doubled to 83,000 towards the end of the 19th century Jewish settlers began buying land from absent Urban Arab landlords leading to the displacement of the Arab peasants who had worked the land until then as a result 500 Arabs signed a letter of complaint to the Ottomans about this in 1891 in his book my Promised Land Arisha vit describes the complex and sometimes contradictory motivations of the young Zionist movement at the end of the 19th century for some fleeing violence it's a matter of life and death for others like his own British Jewish great-grandfather it's a comp Le Lex Choice One comprised of solidarity with those fleeing persecution yes but also a romantic idea of the holy land and a modern idea too of a new thriving modern technological future that could be built in a land that was widely and falsely seen to be empty as judaic studies Professor David Novak has written the modern Zionism that emerged in the late 19th century was clearly a secular nationalist movement however it also had deep religious and historical roots to draw on as well that it was the Jewish ancestral Homeland The Exodus from Egypt to the promised land and later Exiles and returns to it was hotly debated but Zionism was never unified many many disagreed religious and secular alike and those who did agree or became sists did so for many reasons shave points out that travelers from places like Britain didn't see Palestine for what it was they saw empty desert they saw a few bwin tribes they saw possibility they didn't see the Palestinian Villages and towns or maybe he says they chose to ignore them the zionists and The Travelers also saw poverty dirt huts and Tiny villages they believed or said they believed as many colonists also claim it's important to note that the indigenous population would benefit from prosperous Jewish capital education technology and ideas and it's true that many did drawing on his grandfather's Diaries chevit asks why his grandfather did not see after all he was served by Arab stors Arab staff at hotels Arab villagers carried his luggage he was led by Arab guides and Horsemen and was shown Arab cities shave uses a word blindness they were too focused on a romantic ideal of the area and a tragic oppression they were fleeing from shereit writes between memory and dream there is no here and now not everyone was blind though at the beginning of the the 20th century one Zionist author Israel's anguil gave a speech in New York that reported that Palestine wasn't empty that they would have to quote drive out by sword the tribes in possession as our forefathers did this was heresy no one wanted to hear it he was ignored by the Zionist movement and so between 1890 and 1913 around 880,000 immigrated in the short period between World War I and World War II the same number again and this snowall with the rise of Nazism in the 1930s between 1933 and 1940 a quarter of a million fled Germany in 1935 alone 60,000 moved to Palestine more than the entire Jewish population in 1917 with this came millions in capital and investment the building up of settlements Villages and towns it continued to grow this huge demographic movement coincided with the most important shift of power in the region the defeat of the Ottoman Empire during World War I and subsequent British control during the first world war zionists in Palestine provided valuable information to Britain formed spy networks and volunteered to fight at the same time a coalition of Arabs supported Ed Britain by rising up against the Ottomans in the great Arab Revolt in return they were promised an independent Arab state by the British but Britain made several contradictory promises in quick succession in 197 the balfor Declaration a memo between foreign secretary Lord balur and Lord Rothchild committed the British government to a home for the Jewish people in Palestine the Bal for declaration neglected to mention the word Arab once who comprised 94% of the population it read his Majesty's government view with favor The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best Endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may Prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine all the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country here lies the roots of the conflict the contradictory promise when the promised land became twice promised in the words of historian aish reporting this news in Palestine was banned by the British but another contradictory promise came instead after the defeat of the Ottomans the British and French divided the area into spheres of influence under the Sykes Pico agreement in 19 1916 leaving Palestine as a British mandate under British control this was the famous line in the sand drawn by people who had little knowledge of the area in a private 1919 memo only published 30 years later Lord balur admitted that in Palestine we do not propose even to go through the form of Consulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the country the four Great powers are committed to Zionism Zionism be it right or wrong good or bad is rooted in agong Traditions in present needs in future hopes of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land the British mandate gave the Jewish agency in Palestine status as a public body to help run the country and Jewish communities and leaders started forming institutions for self-defense and governance which the British slowly recognized essentially becoming a government in Waiting as a result outbreaks of violence began to increase in the 1920s getting progressively worse in 1929 hundreds of Jews and Arabs were killed and hundreds more wounded at the Western Wall in Jerusalem tensions Rose resulting in a series of massacres of Jews by Arabs one of which in Hebron led to the the death of almost 70 Jews and the injuring of many more in response to the violence the British declared a state of emergency they proposed a legislative Council that would be comprised of six nominated British and four nominated Jewish members and 12 elected members including two Christians two Jews and eight Muslims but seeing themselves as outnumbered on a council in a country in which they were the clear majority Palestinian an rejected the proposal another was proposed that was slightly fairer to the Palestinians but this time it was rejected by the zionists and by British Parliament during the largest wave of immigration as the Nazis came to power Palestinians called for a general strike demanding an end to Jewish migration and the sale of land to zionists by absentee Urban landlords which continued to dispossess peasants in 19 1936 an Arab Revolt started when Arab gunmen shot three Jews setting off a series of attacks and counterattacks leading to the deaths of around 450 Jews and 101 British the British response was Swift and brutal 5,000 Arabs were killed by the British violence continued into 1937 and many were imprisoned and exiled 10% of the Arab population were killed injured imprisoned or exiled khedi puts the figure higher he wrote that it was a bloody war waged against the country's majority which left 14 to 177% of the adult male Arab population killed wounded imprisoned or exiled zahed Ali fieldman and shikaki write that it was disastrous for the Palestinians in one instance an 81-year-old Rebel leader was executed after being fined with a single bullet the British tied Palestinian prisoners to the front of their cars to prevent ambushes and homes were destroyed many were tortured and beaten including at least one woman however as a result of the unrest in 1937 a British government report recommended two states for the first time but the Arab State wouldn't be Palestinian it was to be mer merged with trans Jordan in 1939 British government policy put forward in a white paper decided to cool for a single jointly administered Palestine and limited Jewish immigration and land sales the Holocaust changed all of this and even more disastrous for the Palestinians was their leadership's decision to side with Hitler in 1941 as he had told them that the Nazis had no plans to occupy Arab land as the true extent of the Holocaust became clearer the plight of European Jews became more urgent in the eyes of European and US policy makers it's crucial to remember the extent of the horror 6 million Jews industrially murdered after the war there were a quarter of a million Jews living in refugee camps in Germany alone Britain was bankrupt and pulling out of many of its former colonies Syria Lebanon Jordan and Egypt all of the countries surrounding Palestine gained their independence and an Arab League was formed by them more plans were proposed including the Morris andrady Plan in 1946 calling for two separate autonomous Arab and Israel regions under British defense which was again rejected by both zionists and Palestinians a un plan in 1947 proposed 43% of the area going to Palestinians despite them comprising 2/3 of the population this was rejected by the Arab higher committee who called for a 3-day general strike the newly independent or quasi independent at least surrounding Arab states were becoming increasingly hostile to Zionist ISM and sensitive to the plight of the Palestinians but they also saw potential potential to either increase their own territory or to gain power for themselves in the region they were self-interested Egypt saw itself as a new Ottoman Empire King Abdullah of trans Jordan saw Palestine as part of trans Jordan he thought that Victory would be secured in quote no more than 10 days and the USSR seeing the potential of a state of Israel as a socialist Ally provided weapons to the zionists seeing themselves as decisively outnumbered and outgunned with no tanks Navy or aircraft as the Arab countries to varying degrees did benguan secured a deal with Czechoslovakia for $28 Million worth of weapons and ammunition increasing their supply of weapons by 25% and ammunition by 1,000% in 1968 benan remembered that the Czech weapons truly saved the state of Israel without these weapons we would have not remained Alive by now it was essentially a state of civil war with continued attacks and counterattacks and in early 1948 knowing the British would leave Arab countries were preparing to invade and Je je State institutions in Waiting were preparing a plan of Defense there were of course already many Jewish settlements outside of the proposed un partition boundaries and of course many Palestinian ones within Zionist leadership prepared for what was called Plan D which included quote self-defense against Invasion by regular or semi-regular forces and freedom of military and economic activity within the Border orders of the Hebrew State and in Jewish settlements outside its borders and all of this was exasperated by British bankruptcy and a Hardline Zionist militant group called anuran who bombed the British mandate headquarters killing 92 people and were involved in many murders and skirmishes and brutalities with the Palestinians in the worst in April of 1948 urgen killed between 100 250 men women and children in a village near Jerusalem despite a non-aggression pact being agreed between them so on the 15th of May 1948 the British left the day before David benguan declared the establishment of a new state of Israel the day after a coalition of Arab forces from Egypt Jordan Syria Lebanon and Iraq invaded for the most part Israel captured or defended the areas allotted to them by the 1947 un plan as well as many areas outside of it hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced to flee their homes Palestinians Now call it the nabar the catastrophe and the result of the war was the Gaza Strip under Egypt's control the West Bank contested but under the control of trans Jordan's forces to be annexed in 1950 and anywhere between 400,000 and a million Palestinians displaced there is complexity and this is only a small fraction of this story but it's impossible to ignore that the knar was a catastrophe power differentials foreign influence Empire failures to compromise perpetration of atrocities the loss of homes and land that would never be returned to the Palestinians were left divided outnumbered and kept Weak by Britain zionists America the USSR and its surrounding Arab neighbors journalist Arthur kler famously said that one nation solemnly promised to a second Nation the country of a third and while British prime minister Neville Chamberlain had tried to limit immigration to Palestine he was replaced by Winston Churchill one of the biggest supporters of Zionism in British public life in 1937 Churchill said of Palestine that I do not agree that the dog in a Manger has the final right to the manger even though he may have Lain there for a very long time I do not admit that right I do not admit for instance that a great wrong has been done to the red Indians of America or the black people of Australia I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race a higher grade race a more worldly wise race to put it that way has come in and taken their place in response to the UN planning to partition Palestine in 1947 several Arab countries warned or even threatened violence against Jews in their own countries and expulsion in 1950 51 Iraq withdrew Jews Iraqi nationality and property rights anti-Semitism in Yemen led to the migration of 50,000 Jews between 1949 and 1950 and there were attacks on Jews in Tripoli before the war in 1945 whether the threats from spokespeople of Arab countries and the punitive policies and the attitudes began before the war or as a result of it is a matter of debate what becomes clear though or unclear is that moral and ethical answers depend on the minui of often unanswerable questions ones that historians are still often acrimoniously debating anyone who tells you that answers are easy to come by are wrong anti-Semitism was at its height the Holocaust had just happened Jewish migrants had purchased land and settled in Palestine peacefully for decades but among these difficulties there are some indisputable figures the UN partition plan offered Palestinians 43% of the land despite them comprising 68% of the population and around 700,000 Palestinians became refugees shave cites an interesting letter written from an Israeli he knew who for F in the 4748 war in it he wrote at the time that when I think of the thefts the Looting the robberies and recklessness I realize that these are not merely separate incidents together they add up to a period of corruption the question is earnest and deep really of historic Dimensions we will all be held accountable for this era we shall face judgment and I fear that Justice will not be on our side and this is another report from an Israeli military Governor reporting the conversation when Palestinians were forced from the small city of liia in 1948 during the war after the Israelis triumphed the Palestinian dignitaries said what will become of the prisoners detained in the mosque the governor responded we shall do to the prisoners what you would do had you imprisoned us dignitaries no no please don't don't do that Governor why what did I say all I said is that we will do to you what you would do to us dignitaries please no master we beg you not to do such a thing the governor no we shall not do that 10 minutes from now the prisoners will be free to leave the mosque and leave their homes and leave lier along with all of you and the entire population of lier dignitaries thank you master God bless you and with that they were gone and in many cases people left before the war broke out in one case the Israeli mayor even begged the Palestinians to stay in their Town although this was only one recorded case for many years the Israeli narrative although to call it that is far too simplistic ignoring the disagreements differences and dissent within the Israeli narrative was was that surrounding Arab states called upon the Arabs in Palestine to leave so that they could invade school books in Israel taugh that Israelis wanted peace but they were surrounded by enemies who wanted

looked at the period differently Benny Morris one of those new historians has argued that there was no master plan of expulsion however it was understood that it was in the leadership's interests to establish a Jewish state with as small of a minority of Palestinian Arabs as possible many say that the order came from benguan directly including later prime minister zzak Rabin who reported in his autobiography that bangua had given him the order to expel the Palestinian Arabs of lyia when Rabin published this in 1979 it was censored and the Battle of narratives rages in Israel to this day what

the conflict between Israel and Palestine is that it has so many components immigration national identity Empires and colonialism democracy religion and modernization terrorism victimization persecution and War the question of Palestine must still remain on the world's agenda even when focusing on the simplest building blocks of its very Beginnings we can see how more more than anything subtle emphases differences between well-intentioned observers matters because of this I've carefully selected three main sources and drawn on many others the first and one I recommend the most is a very readable textbook called Arabs and Israelis conflict and peacemaking in the Middle East it's by three Scholars Abdul monum sedali Shai fieldman and khil shikaki and it pays careful attention attention to different historical narratives before analyzing them as even-handedly as possible then Palestinian American historian Rashid khalid's the Hundred Years War on Palestine is from a Palestinian perspective while Israeli writer Arisha vit my promised land is from an Israeli one their politics their strategies and tactics different they were together only in their vow to eradicate Israel and to return to of course even referring to a perspective as Israeli or Palestinian is an enormous oversimplification ignoring the vast differences there will always be within and between groups I've also drawn on a few historians who've been labeled Israeli new historians this loose group have challenged a traditional historical narrative in Israel that has been dominant this is something will come to in a bit the literature on this is vast intellectual humility is required so I'll only focus here on the origins only saying what I've read in these books I'll also return to a note briefly on how and why I've approached this in the way that I have at the end towards the end of the 19th century outbreaks of violence against Jews called pogroms increased across Eastern Europe in most countries Jews were second class citizens they couldn't own land vote had different and varying legal rights and were marginalized lived in ghettos and often randomly blamed for disruptions and targeted and murdered this was coming to a head in the last two decades of the 19th century in 1881 in Russia Jewish communities were attacked after Zar Alexander II was assassinated and one of the conspirators incidentally had Jewish ancestry a wave of pograms resulted but this was just one of many many instances in what we now call mova in 1903 49 Jews were killed and many more injured raped and their homes attacked the New York Times reported that the local police made no attempt to check the reign of terror at Sunset the streets were piled with corpses and wounded those who could make their escape fled in Terror and the city is now practically deserted of Jews in 1894 France's only Jewish Army C Alfred draus was accused of spying for Germany and wrongly prosecuted for treason in a widely publicized trial there were anti-semitic riots across the country eugenic theories about Superior races and blood and soil were also on the rise even in countries where Jews had rights like the US and Britain anti-Semitism was increasing both will have fascist parties and both will have outbreaks of violence so in 1897 seeing the writing on the wall the austr Hungarian Jewish journalist Theodore Herzel wrote a pamphlet the Jewish State arguing that the Jewish people needed a national home to avoid continual persecution he encouraged Jewish Europeans to buy land in Palestine but also considered Argentina the book resulted in the first Zionist Congress that same year Herzel was more than preent writing half a century before the Holocaust many Jews fearing for their lives left their homes in Eastern Europe most went to America some elsewhere and a few started moving to Palestine it's important to remember that this is a relatively borderless period traveling was very different and Palestine had been administered by the decaying Ottoman Empire for centuries it was home to a small number of Jews who lived peacefully with the vast majority of Arabs mainly Muslims with a few Christians this was a very different period from today Empires were the norm but often in Decline borders always changing and ideologies becoming powerful and the idea of nation states that a the people had the right to self-determine to govern themselves was on the rise in 1800 the population of the area was 2% Jewish some 6,700 by 1890 42,000 Jews had moved there while the Arab population was around half a million and by 1922 the Jewish population had doubled to 83,000 towards the end of the 19th century Jewish settlers began buying land from absent Urban Arab landlords leading to the displacement of the Arab peasants who had worked the land until then as a result 500 Arabs signed a letter of complaint to the Ottomans about this in 1891 in his book my Promised Land Arisha vit describes the complex and sometimes contradictory motivations of the young Zionist movement at the end of the 19th century for some fleeing violence it's a matter of life and death for others like his own British Jewish great-grandfather it's a comp Le Lex Choice One comprised of solidarity with those fleeing persecution yes but also a romantic idea of the holy land and a modern idea too of a new thriving modern technological future that could be built in a land that was widely and falsely seen to be empty as judaic studies Professor David Novak has written the modern Zionism that emerged in the late 19th century was clearly a secular nationalist movement however it also had deep religious and historical roots to draw on as well that it was the Jewish ancestral Homeland The Exodus from Egypt to the promised land and later Exiles and returns to it was hotly debated but Zionism was never unified many many disagreed religious and secular alike and those who did agree or became sists did so for many reasons shave points out that travelers from places like Britain didn't see Palestine for what it was they saw empty desert they saw a few bwin tribes they saw possibility they didn't see the Palestinian Villages and towns or maybe he says they chose to ignore them the zionists and The Travelers also saw poverty dirt huts and Tiny villages they believed or said they believed as many colonists also claim it's important to note that the indigenous population would benefit from prosperous Jewish capital education technology and ideas and it's true that many did drawing on his grandfather's Diaries chevit asks why his grandfather did not see after all he was served by Arab stors Arab staff at hotels Arab villagers carried his luggage he was led by Arab guides and Horsemen and was shown Arab cities shave uses a word blindness they were too focused on a romantic ideal of the area and a tragic oppression they were fleeing from shereit writes between memory and dream there is no here and now not everyone was blind though at the beginning of the the 20th century one Zionist author Israel's anguil gave a speech in New York that reported that Palestine wasn't empty that they would have to quote drive out by sword the tribes in possession as our forefathers did this was heresy no one wanted to hear it he was ignored by the Zionist movement and so between 1890 and 1913 around 880,000 immigrated in the short period between World War I and World War II the same number again and this snowall with the rise of Nazism in the 1930s between 1933 and 1940 a quarter of a million fled Germany in 1935 alone 60,000 moved to Palestine more than the entire Jewish population in 1917 with this came millions in capital and investment the building up of settlements Villages and towns it continued to grow this huge demographic movement coincided with the most important shift of power in the region the defeat of the Ottoman Empire during World War I and subsequent British control during the first world war zionists in Palestine provided valuable information to Britain formed spy networks and volunteered to fight at the same time a coalition of Arabs supported Ed Britain by rising up against the Ottomans in the great Arab Revolt in return they were promised an independent Arab state by the British but Britain made several contradictory promises in quick succession in 197 the balfor Declaration a memo between foreign secretary Lord balur and Lord Rothchild committed the British government to a home for the Jewish people in Palestine the Bal for declaration neglected to mention the word Arab once who comprised 94% of the population it read his Majesty's government view with favor The Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best Endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may Prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine all the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country here lies the roots of the conflict the contradictory promise when the promised land became twice promised in the words of historian aish reporting this news in Palestine was banned by the British but another contradictory promise came instead after the defeat of the Ottomans the British and French divided the area into spheres of influence under the Sykes Pico agreement in 19 1916 leaving Palestine as a British mandate under British control this was the famous line in the sand drawn by people who had little knowledge of the area in a private 1919 memo only published 30 years later Lord balur admitted that in Palestine we do not propose even to go through the form of Consulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the country the four Great powers are committed to Zionism Zionism be it right or wrong good or bad is rooted in agong Traditions in present needs in future hopes of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land the British mandate gave the Jewish agency in Palestine status as a public body to help run the country and Jewish communities and leaders started forming institutions for self-defense and governance which the British slowly recognized essentially becoming a government in Waiting as a result outbreaks of violence began to increase in the 1920s getting progressively worse in 1929 hundreds of Jews and Arabs were killed and hundreds more wounded at the Western Wall in Jerusalem tensions Rose resulting in a series of massacres of Jews by Arabs one of which in Hebron led to the the death of almost 70 Jews and the injuring of many more in response to the violence the British declared a state of emergency they proposed a legislative Council that would be comprised of six nominated British and four nominated Jewish members and 12 elected members including two Christians two Jews and eight Muslims but seeing themselves as outnumbered on a council in a country in which they were the clear majority Palestinian an rejected the proposal another was proposed that was slightly fairer to the Palestinians but this time it was rejected by the zionists and by British Parliament during the largest wave of immigration as the Nazis came to power Palestinians called for a general strike demanding an end to Jewish migration and the sale of land to zionists by absentee Urban landlords which continued to dispossess peasants in 19 1936 an Arab Revolt started when Arab gunmen shot three Jews setting off a series of attacks and counterattacks leading to the deaths of around 450 Jews and 101 British the British response was Swift and brutal 5,000 Arabs were killed by the British violence continued into 1937 and many were imprisoned and exiled 10% of the Arab population were killed injured imprisoned or exiled khedi puts the figure higher he wrote that it was a bloody war waged against the country's majority which left 14 to 177% of the adult male Arab population killed wounded imprisoned or exiled zahed Ali fieldman and shikaki write that it was disastrous for the Palestinians in one instance an 81-year-old Rebel leader was executed after being fined with a single bullet the British tied Palestinian prisoners to the front of their cars to prevent ambushes and homes were destroyed many were tortured and beaten including at least one woman however as a result of the unrest in 1937 a British government report recommended two states for the first time but the Arab State wouldn't be Palestinian it was to be mer merged with trans Jordan in 1939 British government policy put forward in a white paper decided to cool for a single jointly administered Palestine and limited Jewish immigration and land sales the Holocaust changed all of this and even more disastrous for the Palestinians was their leadership's decision to side with Hitler in 1941 as he had told them that the Nazis had no plans to occupy Arab land as the true extent of the Holocaust became clearer the plight of European Jews became more urgent in the eyes of European and US policy makers it's crucial to remember the extent of the horror 6 million Jews industrially murdered after the war there were a quarter of a million Jews living in refugee camps in Germany alone Britain was bankrupt and pulling out of many of its former colonies Syria Lebanon Jordan and Egypt all of the countries surrounding Palestine gained their independence and an Arab League was formed by them more plans were proposed including the Morris andrady Plan in 1946 calling for two separate autonomous Arab and Israel regions under British defense which was again rejected by both zionists and Palestinians a un plan in 1947 proposed 43% of the area going to Palestinians despite them comprising 2/3 of the population this was rejected by the Arab higher committee who called for a 3-day general strike the newly independent or quasi independent at least surrounding Arab states were becoming increasingly hostile to Zionist ISM and sensitive to the plight of the Palestinians but they also saw potential potential to either increase their own territory or to gain power for themselves in the region they were self-interested Egypt saw itself as a new Ottoman Empire King Abdullah of trans Jordan saw Palestine as part of trans Jordan he thought that Victory would be secured in quote no more than 10 days and the USSR seeing the potential of a state of Israel as a socialist Ally provided weapons to the zionists seeing themselves as decisively outnumbered and outgunned with no tanks Navy or aircraft as the Arab countries to varying degrees did benguan secured a deal with Czechoslovakia for $28 Million worth of weapons and ammunition increasing their supply of weapons by 25% and ammunition by 1,000% in 1968 benan remembered that the Czech weapons truly saved the state of Israel without these weapons we would have not remained Alive by now it was essentially a state of civil war with continued attacks and counterattacks and in early 1948 knowing the British would leave Arab countries were preparing to invade and Je je State institutions in Waiting were preparing a plan of Defense there were of course already many Jewish settlements outside of the proposed un partition boundaries and of course many Palestinian ones within Zionist leadership prepared for what was called Plan D which included quote self-defense against Invasion by regular or semi-regular forces and freedom of military and economic activity within the Border orders of the Hebrew State and in Jewish settlements outside its borders and all of this was exasperated by British bankruptcy and a Hardline Zionist militant group called anuran who bombed the British mandate headquarters killing 92 people and were involved in many murders and skirmishes and brutalities with the Palestinians in the worst in April of 1948 urgen killed between 100 250 men women and children in a village near Jerusalem despite a non-aggression pact being agreed between them so on the 15th of May 1948 the British left the day before David benguan declared the establishment of a new state of Israel the day after a coalition of Arab forces from Egypt Jordan Syria Lebanon and Iraq invaded for the most part Israel captured or defended the areas allotted to them by the 1947 un plan as well as many areas outside of it hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced to flee their homes Palestinians Now call it the nabar the catastrophe and the result of the war was the Gaza Strip under Egypt's control the West Bank contested but under the control of trans Jordan's forces to be annexed in 1950 and anywhere between 400,000 and a million Palestinians displaced there is complexity and this is only a small fraction of this story but it's impossible to ignore that the knar was a catastrophe power differentials foreign influence Empire failures to compromise perpetration of atrocities the loss of homes and land that would never be returned to the Palestinians were left divided outnumbered and kept Weak by Britain zionists America the USSR and its surrounding Arab neighbors journalist Arthur kler famously said that one nation solemnly promised to a second Nation the country of a third and while British prime minister Neville Chamberlain had tried to limit immigration to Palestine he was replaced by Winston Churchill one of the biggest supporters of Zionism in British public life in 1937 Churchill said of Palestine that I do not agree that the dog in a Manger has the final right to the manger even though he may have Lain there for a very long time I do not admit that right I do not admit for instance that a great wrong has been done to the red Indians of America or the black people of Australia I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race a higher grade race a more worldly wise race to put it that way has come in and taken their place in response to the UN planning to partition Palestine in 1947 several Arab countries warned or even threatened violence against Jews in their own countries and expulsion in 1950 51 Iraq withdrew Jews Iraqi nationality and property rights anti-Semitism in Yemen led to the migration of 50,000 Jews between 1949 and 1950 and there were attacks on Jews in Tripoli before the war in 1945 whether the threats from spokespeople of Arab countries and the punitive policies and the attitudes began before the war or as a result of it is a matter of debate what becomes clear though or unclear is that moral and ethical answers depend on the minui of often unanswerable questions ones that historians are still often acrimoniously debating anyone who tells you that answers are easy to come by are wrong anti-Semitism was at its height the Holocaust had just happened Jewish migrants had purchased land and settled in Palestine peacefully for decades but among these difficulties there are some indisputable figures the UN partition plan offered Palestinians 43% of the land despite them comprising 68% of the population and around 700,000 Palestinians became refugees shave cites an interesting letter written from an Israeli he knew who for F in the 4748 war in it he wrote at the time that when I think of the thefts the Looting the robberies and recklessness I realize that these are not merely separate incidents together they add up to a period of corruption the question is earnest and deep really of historic Dimensions we will all be held accountable for this era we shall face judgment and I fear that Justice will not be on our side and this is another report from an Israeli military Governor reporting the conversation when Palestinians were forced from the small city of liia in 1948 during the war after the Israelis triumphed the Palestinian dignitaries said what will become of the prisoners detained in the mosque the governor responded we shall do to the prisoners what you would do had you imprisoned us dignitaries no no please don't don't do that Governor why what did I say all I said is that we will do to you what you would do to us dignitaries please no master we beg you not to do such a thing the governor no we shall not do that 10 minutes from now the prisoners will be free to leave the mosque and leave their homes and leave lier along with all of you and the entire population of lier dignitaries thank you master God bless you and with that they were gone and in many cases people left before the war broke out in one case the Israeli mayor even begged the Palestinians to stay in their Town although this was only one recorded case for many years the Israeli narrative although to call it that is far too simplistic ignoring the disagreements differences and dissent within the Israeli narrative was was that surrounding Arab states called upon the Arabs in Palestine to leave so that they could invade school books in Israel taugh that Israelis wanted peace but they were surrounded by enemies who wanted

21,4r1EmEni2Rw," This is the history of Israel & Palestine. Through the centuries, the land we now call
Israel and Palestine changed hands many times as different groups of people battled for
control of the area. Over time, the establishment of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religions
made the land - especially the city of Jerusalem - a uniquely holy place. For about 1,000 years
in the middle ages, the Arabs almost always held control of the area, and actually lived
relatively peacefully with the Jews. In fact it was the Christians during their brief rule,
who massacred and persecuted both the Jews and Muslims. At the turn of the 20th century, around 1900,
the idea of statehood had firmly taken root around the world and so, naturally, many Jews
wanted a country of their own, but in the 2,000 years since the founding of Judaism,
most Jews had left the promised land and spread throughout the world. But with the goal of
creating their own country now achievable, large numbers of Jews started to come back
and settle in Palestine. World War 1 brought the defeat of the Ottoman Empire at the hands
of the British, French, and Russians, giving them control of the Middle East. They divided
it up, and the British were given a mandate over Palestine. With the more sympathetic
British now in control, these Jewish Zionists, as they were called, seized the opportunity
to accelerate their plan for statehood. But, creating a state for the Jews wasn’t really
the goal of the British, who just wanted to create a government in Palestine where power
could be shared peacefully by the different groups living there. And there were the Arabs
who didn’t trust the British or the Jews, because many of the Arab leaders thought the
British would favor the Jews. So the Arabs refused to form any government that included
Jewish participation, but before long this stubbornness grew into frustration at not
being represented, so some within the Arab community turned to violence and carried out
bombing attacks against Jewish settlers and started to destroy the crops the settlers
were growing on their farms. About a decade later, World War II broke out,
and millions of Jews were killed by the Nazis in the Holocaust. After the American, British,
and allied forces defeated the Germans, hundreds of thousands of Jews came to Palestine, and
the UN General Assembly passed a fateful plan to divide up Palestine into independent Arab
and Jewish states, with the all-important city of Jerusalem placed under International
control, but the five members of the Arab league didn’t want the Jews to control any
part of the land, so they all voted against the plan. In May, 1948, after much planning and covert
arms acquisition, the Jewish leadership went ahead and declared the establishment of the
State of Israel, and quickly convinced the US Government, the Soviet Union and many other
countries to officially recognize it. As expected by the Israelis, the Arab countries invaded
Palestine immediately, but the Israelis were ready and were more disciplined, better trained
and well-armed, and were too strong for their Arab enemies. When the dust settled, after
10 months of fighting and peace agreements were signed, Israel not only kept the whole
area under the original UN plan, it controlled almost 60% of the land that had been planned
for the Arab state. More than 700,000 Palestinian Arabs had also fled the fighting or were kicked
out of their homes, and about the same amount of Jews migrated into Israel from Arab lands.
So, you had about 1.5 million people basically switching places, making the population of
Israel much more Jewish. A generation later, in 1967, tensions were again reaching a boiling
point. There had been some deadly, cross border attacks from both the Israelis and the Arabs,
so Israel decided to launch a surprise invasion, and in six days, won control of the Gaza Srip
and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, took the West Bank and East Jerusalem away from Jordan,
and kicked Syria out of the Golan Heights. Fewer than 1,000 Israeli troops were killed
in the short war, but over 20,000 Arab soldiers died, went missing, or were captured. And
- just like in the 1948 war - hundreds of thousands more Palestinian Arabs left. Since then, Israel’s really built up its
security capabilities and constructed many settlements in these newly occupied territories,
even though the UN and the International Court of Justice declared the settlements illegal
under International Law. Ten years after the war, Israel returned the Sinai peninsula to
Egypt, and in 2005 pulled its troops and the settlers out of the Gaza Strip, but there
are around 750,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. In 1993, Israel struck a deal with the leader
of the Palestinian Liberation Organization - Yasser Arafat - and agreed to allow the
Palestinians to set up a government and rule themselves in the Gaza Strip and the city
of Jericho in the West Bank, in exchange the PLO recognized the right of Israel to exist.
This new Palestinian government, headed by Arafat, became known as the Palestinian Authority
and was controlled by its majority party, Fatah. But not all Palestinians - especially
people in the Gaza Strip - liked Arafat’s more moderate approach and so a split took
place, leading to the rise of the more extremist Islamic party, Hamas, whose leaders refused
to negotiate with Israel or recognize its right to exist. In 2006, Hamas won the Palestinian
parliamentary election, but Fatah refused to be a minority party and a violent power
struggle between Hamas and Fatah played out in the streets of Gaza. After more than 100 people died in the fighting,
Hamas controlled the area, so Arafat’s successor, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas,
essentially cut the Gaza Strip loose from the Palestinian Authority and set up an emergency
Fatah-controlled government in the West Bank. So today, there are two fairly different Palestines:
One is the West Bank, led by Abbas and his Fatah party, who more or less coexist peacefully
with their many Jewish neighbors, although Israel is in the process of building a 400
mile-long barrier along the border. It is Abbas who is engaged in ongoing negotiations
with Israel and the international community about reaching a solution to the conflict
that would allow Palestine to become an independent country. The other Palestine is the Gaza Strip, which
is essentially poor and mostly cut off from the rest of the world by Israel’s sea embargo
and a wall that divides it from Israel and Egypt, leaving its people without many basic
necessities including clean drinking water. Gaza is very dependent on the UN and the rest
of the International community for aid and is controlled by Hamas. Khaled Mashal is the
chairman of Hamas, and has led the party since the 2004 assassination of the Hamas leader
al-Rantisi. Mashal though lives in Qatar. In 1997 Israel tried, but failed, to assassinate
him in retaliation for the bombing of a market in Jerusalem that Hamas claimed responsibility
for. It’s Hamas who has been the target of repeated
Israeli military actions recently - including this year’s Operation Protective Edge, which
was a response to a number of attacks by Hamas against Israelis, including kidnappings and
rocket attacks, both of which have been aided by the digging of many tunnels under both
the Gaza-Israeli border and Gaza’s southern border with Egypt. Hamas uses these tunnels
to smuggle in weapons and money that it gets from others in the region who have an interest
in destabilizing Israel’s security, like Iran. In its response to Hamas, Israel has
taken heavy criticism for its destructive and vengeful air strikes that kill a high
number of civilians. There are generally two ideas for how to end
the conflict and give Palestinians statehood. The first, is a two state solution, where
Israel and Palestine would be two sovereign countries living side-by-side. This is the strategy embraced by many in the
International community including US President Obama and is embraced by people like Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud party. But time after time, negotiations around
this solution fail because of the many issues it has to confront and resolve like what to
do about the three-quarters of a million Jewish settlers in Palestinian areas, the instability
of the Gaza Strip, the fact that the Gaza strip and the West bank aren’t even connected,
and of course, who would control Jerusalem? These obstacles have given rise to a second,
alternative solution that’s embraced by many Arab Israelis and even Jewish politicians
like the newly elected President of Israel, Reuven Rivlin. They think the only practical way to go is
a one-state solution compromise where neither the Palestinians nor the Jewish people get
exactly what they want, but would instead be unified in one single state that would
ensure equal rights for all of its citizens. Proponents of this plan think it would solve
one of the world’s toughest problems and remove the entire area from the criticism
of the modern world. The main argument from Israelis against the one-state solution is
that it would instantly end the idea of a Jewish state and would make Jews a minority
again, but looking at the numbers, in a combined Arab-Israeli state, Jews would number 6.6m
and Arabs around 5.6m. Of course that’s before the issue of people migrating back
to this unified country is settled. Another issue that would require a creative
solution is the wealth gap between the technologically-driven and very prosperous economy of Israel, and
the much more challenged economic situation of the Palestinian territories. Thanks for watching. Hopefully this video
helps you see the situation with clearer eyes the next time it’s in the news. But I want to know what you think, how should
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict be solved?"," This is the history of Israel & Palestine. Through the centuries, the land we now call

control, but the five members of the Arab league didn’t want the Jews to control any
part of the land, so they all voted against the plan. In May, 1948, after much planning and covert
arms acquisition, the Jewish leadership went ahead and declared the establishment of the
State of Israel, and quickly convinced the US Government, the Soviet Union and many other
countries to officially recognize it. As expected by the Israelis, the Arab countries invaded
Palestine immediately, but the Israelis were ready and were more disciplined, better trained
and well-armed, and were too strong for their Arab enemies. When the dust settled, after
10 months of fighting and peace agreements were signed, Israel not only kept the whole
area under the original UN plan, it controlled almost 60% of the land that had been planned
for the Arab state. More than 700,000 Palestinian Arabs had also fled the fighting or were kicked
out of their homes, and about the same amount of Jews migrated into Israel from Arab lands.
So, you had about 1.5 million people basically switching places, making the population of
Israel much more Jewish. A generation later, in 1967, tensions were again reaching a boiling
point. There had been some deadly, cross border attacks from both the Israelis and the Arabs,
so Israel decided to launch a surprise invasion, and in six days, won control of the Gaza Srip
and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, took the West Bank and East Jerusalem away from Jordan,
and kicked Syria out of the Golan Heights. Fewer than 1,000 Israeli troops were killed
in the short war, but over 20,000 Arab soldiers died, went missing, or were captured. And
- just like in the 1948 war - hundreds of thousands more Palestinian Arabs left. Since then, Israel’s really built up its
security capabilities and constructed many settlements in these newly occupied territories,
even though the UN and the International Court of Justice declared the settlements illegal
under International Law. Ten years after the war, Israel returned the Sinai peninsula to
Egypt, and in 2005 pulled its troops and the settlers out of the Gaza Strip, but there
are around 750,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. In 1993, Israel struck a deal with the leader
of the Palestinian Liberation Organization - Yasser Arafat - and agreed to allow the
Palestinians to set up a government and rule themselves in the Gaza Strip and the city
of Jericho in the West Bank, in exchange the PLO recognized the right of Israel to exist.
This new Palestinian government, headed by Arafat, became known as the Palestinian Authority
and was controlled by its majority party, Fatah. But not all Palestinians - especially
people in the Gaza Strip - liked Arafat’s more moderate approach and so a split took
place, leading to the rise of the more extremist Islamic party, Hamas, whose leaders refused
to negotiate with Israel or recognize its right to exist. In 2006, Hamas won the Palestinian
parliamentary election, but Fatah refused to be a minority party and a violent power
struggle between Hamas and Fatah played out in the streets of Gaza. After more than 100 people died in the fighting,
Hamas controlled the area, so Arafat’s successor, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas,
essentially cut the Gaza Strip loose from the Palestinian Authority and set up an emergency
Fatah-controlled government in the West Bank. So today, there are two fairly different Palestines:
One is the West Bank, led by Abbas and his Fatah party, who more or less coexist peacefully
with their many Jewish neighbors, although Israel is in the process of building a 400
mile-long barrier along the border. It is Abbas who is engaged in ongoing negotiations
with Israel and the international community about reaching a solution to the conflict
that would allow Palestine to become an independent country. The other Palestine is the Gaza Strip, which
is essentially poor and mostly cut off from the rest of the world by Israel’s sea embargo
and a wall that divides it from Israel and Egypt, leaving its people without many basic
necessities including clean drinking water. Gaza is very dependent on the UN and the rest
of the International community for aid and is controlled by Hamas. Khaled Mashal is the
chairman of Hamas, and has led the party since the 2004 assassination of the Hamas leader
al-Rantisi. Mashal though lives in Qatar. In 1997 Israel tried, but failed, to assassinate
him in retaliation for the bombing of a market in Jerusalem that Hamas claimed responsibility
for. It’s Hamas who has been the target of repeated
Israeli military actions recently - including this year’s Operation Protective Edge, which
was a response to a number of attacks by Hamas against Israelis, including kidnappings and
rocket attacks, both of which have been aided by the digging of many tunnels under both
the Gaza-Israeli border and Gaza’s southern border with Egypt. Hamas uses these tunnels
to smuggle in weapons and money that it gets from others in the region who have an interest
in destabilizing Israel’s security, like Iran. In its response to Hamas, Israel has
taken heavy criticism for its destructive and vengeful air strikes that kill a high
number of civilians. There are generally two ideas for how to end
the conflict and give Palestinians statehood. The first, is a two state solution, where
Israel and Palestine would be two sovereign countries living side-by-side. This is the strategy embraced by many in the
International community including US President Obama and is embraced by people like Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud party. But time after time, negotiations around
this solution fail because of the many issues it has to confront and resolve like what to
do about the three-quarters of a million Jewish settlers in Palestinian areas, the instability
of the Gaza Strip, the fact that the Gaza strip and the West bank aren’t even connected,
and of course, who would control Jerusalem? These obstacles have given rise to a second,
alternative solution that’s embraced by many Arab Israelis and even Jewish politicians
like the newly elected President of Israel, Reuven Rivlin. They think the only practical way to go is
a one-state solution compromise where neither the Palestinians nor the Jewish people get
exactly what they want, but would instead be unified in one single state that would
ensure equal rights for all of its citizens. Proponents of this plan think it would solve
one of the world’s toughest problems and remove the entire area from the criticism
of the modern world. The main argument from Israelis against the one-state solution is
that it would instantly end the idea of a Jewish state and would make Jews a minority
again, but looking at the numbers, in a combined Arab-Israeli state, Jews would number 6.6m
and Arabs around 5.6m. Of course that’s before the issue of people migrating back
to this unified country is settled. Another issue that would require a creative
solution is the wealth gap between the technologically-driven and very prosperous economy of Israel, and
the much more challenged economic situation of the Palestinian territories. Thanks for watching. Hopefully this video
helps you see the situation with clearer eyes the next time it’s in the news. But I want to know what you think, how should
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict be solved?"

23,MknerYjob0w," Many people think of Israel and Palestine as two countries at war, with this one — a state for Jewish people — occupying this one here, where Palestinians live. The truth is, both Israeli Jews and Palestinians live all over this territory, ruled by one government and one army, based on the idea of: advancing the supremacy and domination of one group of people, Jews. And that is what guides its policies and its practices towards Palestinians. In other words, apartheid. Apartheid is a loaded word, tied to the racist South African regime of white minority rule. But, although the word comes from there, apartheid isn't just a description of
what happened in South Africa. It's actually a crime against humanity under international law. In 2021, Human Rights Watch accused Israel of carrying out apartheid. It based this accusation on the 1973 apartheid convention and the 1998 Rome Statute, which say that three elements have to occur for
the crime of apartheid to apply. They are: like denying people the right to leave
and to return to their country, expropriation of land and property, and the creation of separate reserves and ghettos. So let's see if any of these apply to
 Israel's rule over Palestinians. About half of the people that live here under Israel's rule are Palestinian, and the other half are Jews, like myself. For those 7 million Israeli Jews, almost the entire land is one space.  Whether they're here, here, here or here, they have the same rights, 
privileges and legal status. They can move freely, vote in the same elections and live under the same laws. The boundaries are invisible to them. But for the 7 million Palestinians, the boundaries are very visible. Whereas this is essentially one space for Israelis, Palestinians have been divided into four areas. Each area gets a different colored ID card issued by Israel, and your life and rights are determined by that ID card. In Gaza, Palestinians have no freedom of movement and are under a
complete Israeli blockade. Israel no longer has soldiers inside Gaza, but it controls every aspect of life from the outside. People in Gaza have no civil or political rights. They've got no say in the Israeli
government that controls them. Palestinians in the West Bank also have very limited freedom of movement, with their population divided
into 165 disconnected cantons cut off by Israeli military checkpoints, walls, settlements and other infrastructure.  They also have no civil or political rights in Israel. In East Jerusalem, Palestinians generally have more freedom to move, but Israel can take away
their right to live in the city. They can't vote in Israeli elections, and Israel also bars them from taking part in Palestinian politics. Palestinians who are citizens of
Israel can travel relatively freely, but they face restrictions on where they can live. They can vote in Israeli elections,
but face legalized discrimination. Yara Hawari is a Palestinian with Israeli citizenship. This ID system, it penetrates all areas of life where you live, where you study, what you work, etc. Even the more intimate areas of life, such as who you marry. That's because, for the most part, a Palestinian can't pass on their ID status to their spouse. And this has huge implications on  where they can live. Many indeed actually end up leaving and choosing to live abroad because it is that difficult. On rare occasions, Palestinians are able to change their ID, but only in one direction. So, for instance, if a Palestinian from East Jerusalem moves somewhere else inside the West Bank,  they could lose their residency
in East Jerusalem and Israel. Since it's considered that a downgrade, then that's a direction that would be feasible. And further down the line, again from Israel's perspective, if West Bankers move to the Gaza Strip,
then that's a direction that Israel will accept, but not in the opposite direction. So while Palestinians are granted different rights based on their IDs, nowhere do those rights
match those of Israeli Jews. Looks like we can check off at least one of the elements required for apartheid to apply. When Israel was founded in 1948, 700,000 Palestinians had fled or been forced out. The result was that the new state
had a Jewish majority. To maintain that majority, Israel has never allowed the refugees to return. The Palestinians who remained were
given Israeli citizenship, although they were kept under strict
military rule for 19 years. But, in 1967, when Israel occupied more lands, including Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, it faced a problem. It wanted the land, but didn't want
the Palestinians on that land. So it's refused to extend citizenship to the rest of the Palestinians under its control, while keeping them under military rule ever since. To further control the ratio of Palestinians to Israeli Jews, Israel still bans Palestinian refugees and their descendants from moving into any of the territories it controls, while encouraging any Jewish person anywhere in the world to immigrate to Israel, even if they've
never set foot there before.  In Jerusalem, the Israeli authorities actually have a population target:
60% Jews to 40% Palestinians. Palestinians in Jerusalem are only granted a ""permanent"" residency permit, even if they've been living in the city since before Israel was founded. About 350,000 Palestinians are in that status, which is Orwellian the way it's defined, because the only thing permanent in permanent residency is that it can actually always be taken away. These permits can be revoked if a Palestinian moves out of the city. But Jewish Israelis living in
Jerusalem never lose residency, even if they move to the other side of the world. This discrimination has
been enshrined in Israeli law. The 2018 Nation-State Law says that Israel
""is the nation-state of the Jewish people."" That means that even Palestinians 
with Israeli citizenship aren't considered equal to Jews 
with Israeli citizenship. As Israel's prime minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu put it, but rather, So let's go back to to that list from before. The Nation-State Law is only one of many
Israeli laws that explicitly discriminate against Palestinians. For example, there's the
1950 Absentees' Property Law. Deeming Palestinian refugees ""absentees,"" Israel seized hundreds of thousands
of acres of their land, even though they were only absent because Israel wouldn't let them return. Remember, denying people the right to return to their country is on the list of inhumane acts that legally make up the third element of apartheid. There are more Israeli policies that could fall under the category of inhumane acts, especially when it comes to land. So Israel desires the land, even more so desires empty land or land that it makes empty, and doesn't desire the Palestinians living on that land. And that has resulted in policies in which land is constantly moving in one direction. Land that used to be Palestinian becomes state land, and then that land is allocated for the development of towns and communities for Jewish citizens. And yes, expropriation of land
is also an inhumane act. So let's see what that looks like on the ground. Across the entire territory, Palestinian communities are overcrowded and surrounded by Jewish-only communities. It's the same type of practice of encircling Palestinian communities so that they can't expand, cutting them off from one another. It's a continuous practice that began in 1948 and was expanded to the West Bank in 1967. The Israeli state prioritizes Jewish development in places where it wants to restrict the growth of Palestinian communities, with the government keen to Judaize areas like the Galilee and the Negev. Israeli politicians frequently use that term: to ""Judaize"" an area. In other words, to ensure Israeli Jewish dominance in a particular area where the government has a concern over the Palestinian demography. And in any other context, this would be condemned as, you know, gross ethnic engineering. It's in its basic laws,
which is essentially the Israeli Constitution. The land is deemed for the Jewish people, not the Israeli people, but the Jewish people. In fact, only 3% of the land inside Israel's 1948 borders is allocated for its Palestinian citizens. Meanwhile, hundreds of new communities have been built for its Jewish citizens, many on the ruins of
destroyed Palestinian villages. Plus, there's the 200 illegal Jewish settlements that have been built across the West Bank as well. At the same time, 
thousands of Palestinian homes have been demolished or are under threat of demolition, having been built without permits because Israel rejects most Palestinian building applications. Meanwhile, in the Negev Desert, the Israeli government wants to maximize the land available for Jewish development. So it has tried to force Palestinian Bedouin citizens into small townships by demolishing their homes and not allowing them to connect to the water and power grids. One village, Al-Araqib, has been demolished
more than 180 times. Now just across the Green Line, a similar struggle is taking place in the village of Susiya, which is in the West Bank, just south of Hebron. And it too has faced a series of mass demolitions by authorities in attempt to establish Israeli Jewish control over the area. Looks like we can check off another one of the criteria for apartheid. Israel has total control of this entire territory. Even in Gaza and the West Bank, 
which have some limited autonomous Palestinian administration in place, Israel controls the borders, trade, resources, water, electricity, the airspace, the electromagnetic spectrum, the population registry and more. Accusing a government of carrying out a crime against humanity like apartheid is no simple matter. But we've seen how Israel's control over and discrimination against Palestinians fits the legal threshold for apartheid. Israel's own leaders knew this was happening, although they didn't do much to stop it. Still, how could apartheid apply to Israel when, say, Palestinian citizens can vote? So as a Palestinians citizen of Israel, I cannot question the fundamental Constitution of Israel, which says that the state is for the Jewish people and the Jewish people alone.  My citizenship doesn't allow for inclusion in that state. And so therefore,  participation in Israeli elections or in the Knesset is really nominal and has no potential to change policy. Another argument against the accusation of apartheid is that the occupation is only temporary, and when it ends,
Palestinians will rule themselves. Normal people don't think that 54 years is temporary. We've passed that line already a very long time ago. And yeah, there's a lot of Israeli propaganda insisting on that worldview of democracy plus temporary occupation. No, it's not a democracy and it's not a temporary occupation. It's one regime between the river and the sea. And that regime is apartheid."," Many people think of Israel and Palestine as two countries at war, with this one — a state for Jewish people — occupying this one here, where Palestinians live. The truth is, both Israeli Jews and Palestinians live all over this territory, ruled by one government and one army, based on the idea of: advancing the supremacy and domination of one group of people, Jews. And that is what guides its policies and its practices towards Palestinians. In other words, apartheid. Apartheid is a loaded word, tied to the racist South African regime of white minority rule.

Israel has total control of this entire territory. Even in Gaza and the West Bank, 
which have some limited autonomous Palestinian administration in place, Israel controls the borders, trade, resources, water, electricity, the airspace, the electromagnetic spectrum, the population registry and more. Accusing a government of carrying out a crime against humanity like apartheid is no simple matter. But we've seen how Israel's control over and discrimination against Palestinians fits the legal threshold for apartheid. Israel's own leaders knew this was happening, although they didn't do much to stop it. Still, how could apartheid apply to Israel when, say, Palestinian citizens can vote? So as a Palestinians citizen of Israel, I cannot question the fundamental Constitution of Israel, which says that the state is for the Jewish people and the Jewish people alone.  My citizenship doesn't allow for inclusion in that state. And so therefore,  participation in Israeli elections or in the Knesset is really nominal and has no potential to change policy. Another argument against the accusation of apartheid is that the occupation is only temporary, and when it ends,
Palestinians will rule themselves. Normal people don't think that 54 years is temporary. We've passed that line already a very long time ago. And yeah, there's a lot of Israeli propaganda insisting on that worldview of democracy plus temporary occupation. No, it's not a democracy and it's not a temporary occupation. It's one regime between the river and the sea. And that regime is apartheid."

population of Christians Muslims and Jews alike the power vacuum was quickly filled by France and Great Britain who secretly drafted the Sykes Pico agreement of 1916 which proposed to divide the ottoman territories between the two powers this contradicted the earlier McMahon Hussein correspondence between 1915 to 1916 which stated that the area of Palestine along with all of the Arabian Peninsula would become part of a new pan Arab Nation should the Arabs agree to help Britain defeat the Ottomans while this occurred the influential Zionist organization had their own designs in the area at the Paris peace Conference of 1919 the zionists led by ham wisman proposed that a Jewish homeland be established in the Palestinian territory their proposed borders included what would become present day Israel Western Jordan Southwestern Syria and Southern Lebanon no representation was afforded to the Arabs or Palestinians residing in the territory during these discussions for the zionists the settlement of Palestine was not a colonial Venture but instead a return from exile to the land of Israel their ancient Homeland for the Palestinians however this distinction seemed to matter little as Jewish immigrants began to arrive and steadily dispossess many Palestinians from their homes despite these concerns these zionists appeared to have the upper hand thanks to the implicit approval of the British government the most telling example of this support for Jewish settlement in Palestine occurred in 1917 when British foreign secretary Arthur Baler sent a declaration of support to Lord Walter Rothschild a banker politician and prominent Zionist leader the nature of the Baler declaration would become public on November 9th of that year when it was published in the British press ultimately the final decision regarding Palestine was a blend of Zionist aspirations and British geopolitical interests Britain's strategic AIMS in neighboring Egypt especially around

neighboring Arab States invaded to crush what they saw saw as a Zionist occupation despite the odds stacked against the Israeli Defenders the war ended in 1949 with an Israeli Victory establishing the green line as the deao border for the new Jewish State the green line expanded Israel's territory beyond the un's proposed boundaries incorporating Western Galilee and a broad Corridor through the Negev Desert by the end of the war over 700,000 Palestinians had been permanently displaced from their Homeland with many reduced to the status of refugees this event would be known as the nakba or catastrophe by surviving Palestinians and the rest of the Arab world although hostilities ceased the agreements didn't resolve the core conflict merely pausing territorial disputes from 1949 to 1967 the Gaza Strip was under Egyptian occupation and the West Bank under Jordanian occupation the end of the war also saw Israel's alleged violation of the UN General Assembly resolution 181 as it expanded beyond the un's proposed boundaries further souring relations with neighboring Arab states concurrently border skirmishes issues Over The Straits of Tran and the 1956 Suez Crisis further exacerbated problems with the Arabs Israel's probing into surrounding territories and retaliatory actions against crossb attacks further strained relations in the region setting the stage for June 5th 1967 when preemptive Israeli air strikes against Egyptian airfields caused a coalition of Arab states to simultaneously declare war and attack Israel across multiple fronts despite being grossly outnumbered Israel quickly launched an immediate offensive capturing the Sinai Peninsula Gaza Strip West Bank East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights at a lightning pace the war concluded on June 10th marking what we now know as the 6-day war these newly acquired territories significantly expanded Israel's borders with the green line being superseded by the ceasefire lines established at the end of the conflict from 1967 onwards new Israeli settlements would be established across the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank often encroaching on Palestinian land to do so the aftermath of of the Six-Day War left a lingering tension in the region with the Arab states seeking to recover their territories lost to Israel these tensions eventually sparked the yam kapor war in 1973 where Egypt and Syria launched coordinated surprise attacks against Israel to regain the Sinai Peninsula and the Goen Heights however by the end of the war Israeli forces had repelled the invasions and even advanced into Egyptian and Syrian territories beyond the pre-war lines despite these territorial changes during the conflict the borders essentially returned to their pre-war status following disengagement agreements in 1974 and 1975 even with the memories of yam kapor still fresh an unprecedented moment occurred in 1978 at Camp David in the United States here agreements were signed between Egyptian president and War Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister manakum beIN which led to a peace treaty and normalized relations the following year part of this treaty involved Israel returning the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt which was finalized in 1982 meanwhile Israeli military rule over the West Bank transitioned to a semi civil Authority Under the Israeli Ministry of Defense since its establishment in 1964 the Palestine Liberation Organization gained significant influence in the region its Pursuit for Palestinian self-determination led to the Arab League officially deeming them the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people in 1974 this recognition marked a pivotal moment in the Palestinian struggle as the pl's influence began to extend into neighboring countries

of Southern Lebanon Israel established a security Zone to thwart attacks leading to intricate conflicts with Lebanese factions and the emergence of Hezbollah as a key political player in the region this occupation marked by its flagrant territorial violations significantly impacted Israeli Lebanese relations and the broader Middle Eastern geopolitical landscape the Israeli presence in southern Lebanon continued for nearly two decades marked by persistent military engagements political backlash as well as International scrutiny and criticism the occupation would only end with Israel's

Warfare LED countries like the United States and Israel to label it a terrorist organization during that period though their reputation began to change over The Late 1980s the pl's chairman Yasser Arafat alongside other Palestinian parties became instrumental in setting the stage for the Oslo Accords which aimed to transition toward more structured Palestinian self-governance and a potential two-state solution signed in 1993 the Oslo Accords established the Palestinian Authority granting it limited self-rule over parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip for a transitional period with the aim of achieving a final peace settlement within 5 years the Accords divided the West Bank into three areas area a Under full Authority control area B under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control and area C Under full Israeli control the palestin inian Authority was given control over most population centers in the West Bank ant Gaza while Israel retained control over Jewish settlements military areas and most of the natural resources this Arrangement was meant to be a stepping stone toward a two-state solution although the subsequent Camp David negotiations in 2000

as the capital of Israel.” The US has officially moved its embassy in
Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and in doing so, President Trump has reversed decades of consensus about
the city’s status. While Israeli leaders celebrated, Palestinians denounced the move, deepening divides between two sides of a conflict
that is 70 years old. “We’re hearing live fire…” “Rising death toll…” “Quite a juxtaposition…” Here are 5 things to know about Jerusalem
and why it’s so contentious. Israel has controlled West Jerusalem since
1949. During the Six Day War, Israel captured East
Jerusalem and annexed that half of the city. But the international community considers
East Jerusalem occupied territory, whose fate needs to be part of a negotiated deal between
Israel and the Palestinians. In 1980, after Israel passed a law declaring
a united Jerusalem the capital, the United Nations
condemned the annexation. Palestinians want to divide the city and make
East Jerusalem the capital of a future Palestinian state, while Israelis want a unified Jerusalem to
be their capital. During peace process negotiations for the
Oslo Accords, the issue of Jerusalem was initially set aside to avoid derailing the talks. Any successful peace initiative in the future
would likely need to resolve the conflicting claims to the land. Control of Jerusalem has been a trigger for
violence many times in the past. The contested area of East Jerusalem is home
to some of the holiest sites in the world for Jews and Muslims. It is the site where Judaism’s two sacred
temples once stood. And the site where the prophet Mohammed ascended
to heaven. The trouble is that the sites for Muslims
and Jews exist on the same land. There’s a precarious power share in place. Israeli officials control who has access to
the complex. But Muslims have religious control inside. Jews can enter but aren’t allowed to pray. Instead, they use the Western Wall. The second intifada began in 2000, when then-opposition
leader Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount to assert Israel’s right to the complex. Palestinians protested and were met with tear
gas and rubber bullets. The violence lasted five years and killed
more than 3,000 Palestinians and nearly 1,000 Israelis, with thousands more wounded. In the early 70's, 16 countries had embassies
in Jerusalem, including the Netherlands and Colombia. But after the UN Security Council condemned
the annexation of East Jerusalem in 1980. member states left. Then, Trump signaled a change in policy, and Guatemala and Paraguay also announced they are moving their embassies to Jerusalem And it's possible that more countries will
follow America’s lead. Though Congress passed a law to relocate the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem more than 20 years ago, the law includes a loophole that allows the
president to delay the relocation for the sake of national security. Every sitting president -- Clinton, Bush,
Obama -- has used this power and signed the waiver every 6 months. President Trump signed the waiver in June
2017, and again in December 2017, but also signaled he would begin the process of moving
the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And in May of 2018, he carried out his pledge. The embassy move came at an already a tense
time. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have spent
the past few weeks holding protests on the border between Gaza and Israel, that weren’t
tied to the embassy move. Dozens of Palestinians had been killed even
before the embassy opened. While President Trump was careful not to call
Jerusalem an “undivided” capital. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said just that at the US embassy opening. “God Bless Jerusalem, the eternal undivided
capital of Israel.” But opposition to Trump’s declarations and
the embassy move has been growing. And as lines are drawn and the fight for Jerusalem
intensifies, the future of Israeli-Palestinian stability is once again at risk."," “It is time to officially recognize Jerusalem

Moonlight is [Music] impressive it's a marvelous country describes of course herel describes the country he imagined a very liberal country very European very sophisticated with excellent relations between the different communities and the different parts of society when Herzel presented his Zionist project all the conservative reformist Orthodox rabbis were against Zionism this was the end of the 19th century beginning of the 20th all of them they perceived it as a sin arguing that the diaspora was a Divine punishment and only God could allow Jewish people to return to Sacred land with the coming of the Messiah Hetzel said you must separate religion from the state we shouldn't let the rabbis lead us they should stay in the synagogues but they shouldn't tell us what to do Zionism represented the desire to be freed from the shackles of religion and create a new human and a new Society in the country of Israel during the 7th International Zionist Congress in 1905 Palestine was chosen to establish a Jewish homeland after considering Uganda and Argentina it was the first Congress after herz's death a year earlier one of the members yitzak Epstein addressed the Tribune we forgot one small detail on that land we love there is an entire nation that has been living on it for centuries and has never considered leaving it we are making a serious psychological mistake the president of the Union of British synagogues had written to Herzel I tremble at the idea of founding a tiny tiny Jewish state that would become a [Music] ghetto at the start of the century the population consisted of tens of thousands of Jews and about 500,000 Arabs the Jews did not work the land most of them were Ultra Orthodox Jews who lived on foreign donations or were shopkeepers they had small shops that's it it was a small community very religious strong Believers many in Jerusalem or other places like Hebron and suffered there was no difference between the Jews and the Arabs in Jerusalem for example land and houses were sold all the time and were not an issue my parents who were living in Jaffa had many friends in in amongst the Jewish population of manded Palestine these things at that time were natural they were not anything unusual I don't think there's any reason to deny it it's obvious that Jews had lived on this land and that they had a culture here that they had their Roots here the pgms in Russia increased the massive migration of Jewish people especially to the United States a handful of young Zionist students from Ukraine decided to settle in Palestine [Music] one group arrived bought land in and stayed there one of the strangest things is that the Jews have said from the start that this is their land and the Arabs hear that in fact the moment the first Jew came here the Arab Jewish conflict began from that Viewpoint the seeds of conflict were there right from the start young idealists came to farm the land they told themselves they would create an ideal settlement in Israel we have texts from 1907 1908 that state this situation is an enormous project to OU us from our own land the working conditions in this land in places where they were far from everything LED them to create a way of living where everything was shared and that way of living then led to the kibuts concept the first kibutz a collectivist village was established in Palestine in 1909 the founders Were Young idealists from Europe who wanted to create a new state by finding a new way of [Music] life my grandfather worked in the mud to help dry up the marshes my grandmother broke rocks with a hammer they lived under a tent for 5 years the rest of the world considered Palestine to be an abandoned entirely uninhabited territory it was a desolate country filled with deserts and marshes [Music] you know that famous saying the bride was beautiful but was already married but they just couldn't bring themselves to admit that so they invented a slogan to justify and legitimize the project of their foreign Community arriving to settle in the local population's Homeland and they told the whole world the famous slogan of a land without people for a people without a land it was the worst line they claimed they transformed this land into a paradise oh you know it was totally desert it's a good thing we showed up that story of a desert land dates from the 19th century it dates from the time the European powers started to describe the sacred land as a devastated land that had to be brought back to life at any cost the Muslims weren't mistrustful before the zionists arrive they never imagined that one day this relationship between Jews and Arabs would change into something that the Palestinians would pay so dearly Jewish settlement is partly responsible for deteriorating relations between Arabs and Jews given that the settlement had decided it wouldn't use local Arab labor under the Imp of the Zionist movement more and more Jewish people bought land in Palestine between 1908 and 1913 11 new Jewish colonies were created during this period the first signs of Arab opposition to the Zionist movement appeared some Arabs protested against the sale of lands to Jewish people all the Palestinian Arabs sold property to the Jewish arrivals there are Deeds of sale our relationship changed people started to sense that there was a problem here How could an Arab live in peace with someone who comes and first of all buys land but wants to create a Jewish country not Arab and Jewish but a Jewish country tensions Rose bit by bit with the waves of [Music] immigration when the Arabs sense that the country was slipping from their hands World War I would upset geography in the Middle East on the losers side the Ottoman Empire was dismantled by peace treaties with the exception of turkey Asia Minor was now managed by Western Powers the syes Pico secret agreement signed between France and Great Britain assigned Palestine to the British the British were were responsible for making it possible for the Israeli for the Jewish people people to have estate in in Palestine not to speak of the Bel for declaration in in which also promised the land for to to to the Jews to guarantee a western presence in the area in November 1917 British Minister for foreign affairs Arthur James Balor wrote an open letter to Lord Lionel Walter Rothchild one of the Zionist movement's leaders he wrote his Majesty's government view with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best Endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may Prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine the belfa Declaration of 1917 was the Declaration of a colonialist offering someone else a gift that did not belong to them in 1917 when the British government adopted the Zionist project in order to create a national country for the Jews in Palestine Palestinians represented 98% of the population the most reliable figure was from 1919 when the English took possession of this area for the first time they conducted a very serious population census in 1919 there were 700,000 Arabs and 70,000 Jews right from the start the British were sharply aware that in order to stay a long time they had to divide this up the First Act of the division was absolutely perverse in the first census they created categories that didn't even exist cre category they created a Jewish category category and they created an Arab category and it was always that in other words let's make them fight each other and we will always be the referee with the rise of Arab nationalism the first anti-jewish protest started in March April 1920 in Jerusalem then may 1921 in Jaffa and Tel Aviv over 50 people were killed minister of colonies Winston Churchill investigated the events early in 1922 he published a white paper to clarify the British stance on Palestine in July 1922 the League of Nations gave Britain a mandate to prepare the creation of a national Jewish home between 1924 and 1928 more than 60,000 Jewish people arrived in Palestine on August the 20th 1929 protests broke out between Jews and Muslims over access to the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem 2 Days Later rumors circulated about an imminent Jewish attack on the alaxa mosque Arab attacks against Jews started in the old city of Jerusalem before spreading throughout Palestine 67 Jews including women and children were killed in Hebron other massacres took place in safid where 18 Jews were killed during a week of protests 133 Jews were killed by Arabs a British report claimed these protests are local expressions of animosity and hostility by Arabs against Jews because of the Arabs frustrated political and National [Music] hopes the Nazi party Rose to power in 1933 and started with the persecution of Jews in Germany then in [Applause] Austria in 1933 Adolf Hitler and his minister of propaganda ysf gobl organized the boycott of all businesses own by Jews the Jewish agency signed an agreement with the third re minister of economy which allowed German Jews to immigrate to Palestine provided they abandon most of their possessions before leaving the arrival of over 30,000 immigrants gave the economy a fresh boost the immigrants were intellectuals scientists Architects and artists many companies were started the population of of Tel Aviv founded in 1909 tripled and now counted 150,000 inhabitants the beaches and fashionable places were crowded yesterday a new elegant Cafe opened on the corner of alanby and bik streets worthy of the great European capitals wrote the magazine haritz in 1935 David benorian was elected president of the Jewish agency he had arrived in Palestine in 1906 when he was 20 from a small town close to Warsaw to participate in creating the new state he wanted a country for Jews immediately his friends understood that it was going to take time in the same year he was named head of the hagana the armed group for the defense of Palestinian Jews forbidden by the [Music] British in April 1936 the Arabs called for a general strike throughout the country and demanded an end to immigration and the sail of land to Jews the Palestinian Arab opposition culminated in the great Revolt of 1936 protesting against both Zionism and the British presence in Palestine casualties from the riots were very high several hundred Arabs were killed by the British and over 300 Jews also died the Arab High Committee convened in October under the general leadership of Amin al-hussein Grand Muti of Jerusalem [Music] the Muti was the leader of the Palestinian people he was a horrible man whose nationalism was pro-nazi not just because the Nazis were the enemies of the British and the Jews but also because he sympathized with the Nazi ideology it was total blindness the mu's Mad idea of throwing himself into Hitler's arms in Berlin the Muti went to Berlin and attempted to create SS divisions Muslim SS soldiers he wanted to create a unit with the German Army to come to Palestine and fight the Jews there the Muti didn't really have any Authority in Germany Hitler didn't care about the muy but he linked up with ikman ikman early on in 1936 directed The Jewish Department of the gapo in the SS and he was sent here to learn about the enemy in other words to learn Hebrew the traditions and then return to Germany and know what he was confronting so as to take care of it they were obsessed with learning exactly what a Jew really wasman and the Muti met together several times akman spoke of it and the Muti wrote it in his Memoirs they had a common goal get rid of the Jews for a long time afterwards paid the price for the Muti of Jerusalem's crazy sidetracking Jem the historian hagay horovitz would write when the grand Muti of Jerusalem met with Hitler it was a sign that the national Arab movement subjectives had changed for the first time everyone was aware of the danger that threatened our existence it was no longer imaginary it was the blow that changed the nature of the conflict and our combat strategy while Nazis proclaimed the nurenberg laws and the lives of millions of Jews were threatened in Europe the British blocked immigration roots to Palestine for those who wanted to flee the Reich there weren't many alternative choices because other nations were also closing their doors to Jewish people this was notably the case with the United States where immigration quotas set by Congress radically reduced the number of refugees from Germany and Austria in July 1938 the Evon conference convened to to discuss how to help the German Jews but closed without reaching its objective none of the 32 countries present would agree to open their borders to persecuted Jews as war with Germany loomed the British organized the St James conference in February 1939 hoping to avoid an Arab AIS Alliance the conference brought Jews and Arabs together for the first time but the Arab delegates refused to sit with the Jewish agency Representatives the British considered pal Palestine more than ever a ticking Time Bomb they published the white paper with policies considerably limiting the number of new immigrants and resolutely confirming that they had no intention of creating a Jewish state in [Music] Palestine Adolf Hitler had just invaded Poland World War II had just begun Palestine lived in constant threat of an invasion by Ral German forces who were on the African continent benorian declared we will help the British in the war as if there had not been a white paper and we will fight against the white paper as if there is no war the general staffs of the hagana and the British army agreed to create a force made up of Jews in the British army whose mission would be to fight the Nazi forces as a child my father spoke four languages had a very well-developed political conscience his mother died just after the 1939 Nazi invasion he then convinced his father that there was no other place for Jews except Israel for four months they traveled in a boat filled with illegal Travelers on board a boat that no country would allow it to dock at its ports neither the English nor Churchill nor Roosevelt's America nor any country in the world a small 12-year-old Jewish child with nothing but the sea beneath his feet finally they arrived here and the English arrested them people continued to arrive here several thousand people and everyone told stories we thought the ghettos had been the worst possible thing but we started to receive alarming information out of Poland hard tragic news started to come in serial murders in many places they didn't believe it people at first could not even conceive of it they thought of the programs and of anti-Semitism it seemed to be so horrible that it could not possibly be true and bit by bit at Year's End we started to get a harsh image of the events with appalling methods people buried alive parents forced to bury their children and of course gunshot executions in front of the ditches in 1942 a telegram arrived here saying that himler had decided to kill by the end of the year between 3.5 and 4 million people in suitable locations with a gas called hydrogen cyanide that telegram seemed so improbable that it remained in a drawer a first group arrived and traveled around saying that's what's happening it's all true it's terrible they're doing it methodically how could you hear such a thing when your entire family was living in Europe it meant they had no more family no more Community World War II ended but the Allied victory over Nazi Germany would not affect British policy London still refused to allow skps to immigrate to Palestine F at the same time 100,000 European Jewish survivors had nowhere to go a third of the worldwide Jewish population had been assassinated in the guest Chambers and in Nazi camps it proved that the zionists were right a people without a country is a people that is Led like beasts to the slaughter house but also because the Holocaust Survivors had nowhere else to go there were so many Jews looking for a place to settle doors to the United States were closed and locked so even if the Holocaust hadn't happened Jews would have come here and in increasing numbers palmach sent me to Europe after the Holocaust and I met those who had survived the remaining European Jews it was an enormous shock for me when I arrived over there one day I joined some young adolescent who wanted to immigrate covertly going through Italy and France it was snowing it was cold I lived with them for an entire week every night one of them would start screaming they all had nightmares it was such a chalk a terrible joke it will stay with me for the rest of my life after the war many survivors were distraught disoriented in fact most of them were because of how they had suffered terribly and the feeling they were now alone in the world people were experiencing such terrible trauma that no one was able to speak no one could say what happened most of these people had lost their entire family when we met a family with two sets of grandparents we asked ourselves how is this possible it sounded like the tales you would read in books it could not possibly be true I was born in September 46 in a Jewish refugee camp in Austria near the city of Lin the first two years of my life I spent them in those camps I grew up there from 1945 Jews who had escaped from concentration camps were herded into DP camps displaced persons camps in Germany and Austria surrounded by barbed wire fences treated insensitively by Allied soldiers they did not want to return to the countries where their families had been assassinated an American high official reported to President Truman the situation now is that we're treating the Jews like the Nazis did except that we are not Exterminating them the war was over but the Holocaust was not because when the Jews started to return to Poland Lithuania Slovakia Hungary Romania to go back to their homes they found they had been occupied by other people and they were killed in Poland alone about 2,000 Jews were killed between 1945 and 1946 people always refer to the Kel prgram but it was only one prgram among many we left Poland in the summer of 1946 after the K pram we could have gone to the United States but my mother said after the Holocaust we should go where Jews were living we arrived on a Greek boat without authorization from the British government we had been given fake papers and the day we arrived there was a curfew my mother said help where have we landed what kind of a place is this with operation Igloo the British transported all the Jews trying to reach Palestine to Cyprus in their personal notes they referred to this deportation more sensitively as transferring and moving to avoid alluding to previous concentration camp [Music] deportations as soon as the boats filled with refugees arrived in the port of hia the waiting British forces evacuated ated them and transferred them to Cyprus in cage [Music] boats more than 50,000 Jews would go through these barbed wire enclosed camps guarded by armed military men most were Holocaust Survivors philosopher Hannah arent wrote the internment camps in Cyprus were only possible because the entire world thought it more Humane than aitz if we look closely at all the decisions Great Britain made when they started blocking Jewish immigration it wasn't because of fundamental political changes it was because they knew they were being ousted in June 1946 the English began operation Agatha during a search they found documents proving that the Jewish agency supported acts of sabotage they decided to hit hard 2,700 people were arrested it was a heavy blow for the zionists one month later the men of lii a Jewish paramilitary group blew up the King David Hotel British headquarters killing 91 people paradoxically this universally condemned act would move events along and play in the zionists favor the British understood they would soon no longer be able to control Jewish organizations which were increasingly better structured Great Britain finally chose to retreat bit by bit the confrontations increased up to 1947 when the situation completely degenerated upon British request the UN named an international investigation Commission in April 1947 the final report recommended creating a Jewish and an Arab State surprised by this decision Great Britain refused this suggestion of sharing declared it would abandon its rule in six months time there was no doubt the Holocaust had influenced a large part of United Nations [Music] members and that the UN mission that came here and saw the Jewish refugee camps in Europe decided after all that had happened the Jews should be given a country what the Palestinian leadership didn't see in 1948 was that the Holocaust had taken place and that the whole world was convinced that the victims deserved reparation and that fundamental reparation for the victims was the emergence of a Jewish State and that this was the only adequate solution to the Nazi barbarism while the commission was working mosad would attempt to force the British to open Palestine ports to Jews it chartered an old boat named Exodus 1947 for the operation the boat arrived outside of hia with 4,500 Jewish immigrants from Central Europe most of the passengers were Nazi death camp survivors rather than stagnate in displaced persons camps they had opted to join the network of clandestin trips to Palestine they thought they could finally set foot on the Promised Land but the Royal Navy boarded and searched the vessel in the confusion three passengers were killed and 100 others wounded there were terrible clashes during the entire Journey we were expelled from Hyer and then sent back to France then hambur this act shook World opinion the British had to compromise with International opinion that favored resolving the Jewish problem as peacefully as possible at the UN delegations got ready to vote for palestine's future David benorian listened to the first results on the radio with Elena Roosevelt the former president's Widow beside him REM whether they have she had been influential in engaging the United States in World War II and played a decisive role in creating the United Nations France remained quiet about its intentions but Leon Bloom moved by Haim vman's telegram promised to use all his influence President Truman pressured reluctant state representatives to vote in favor of partition in return the Philippines and heti would receive loans the majority were to vote against the partition plan but the Americans used Thanksgiving as a pretext to postpone the vote they then came back with the support of two small countries we couldn't even pinpoint on the world map which the Americans had swayed during their national holiday and the majority vote changed the Soviet Minister for foreign affairs Andre gomo surprised the Western World with an unexpected Pro Zionist speech during the last war the Jewish people underwent incredible suffering this explains why the Jews want to establish their own State and it would be unjust to to refuse them that right and gromo made a speech in which he presented himself as a Zionist for years they pursued zionists and locked them up in gags gomo's speech had nothing to do with what was happening Soviet diplomacy has never had a reputation for being sentimental everything boils down to interests the Soviet Union wanted to replace the British in the Middle East it knew that the English would be forced out and wanted to be the first before the United States could steal their place Soviet Union Yes United Kingdom stain France yes the resolution of the duck committee for Palestine was adopted by 33 votes 13 against 10 abens the majority vote we got during the decision on partition in November 1947 we never could have got it and even then it wasn't simple it is said that the United Nations decision ensued because the westerners had a guilty conscience about the Holocaust excuse me but where was your conscience before that all of a sudden they had a guilty conscience it's of the country's great paradoxes it was founded after the worst tragedy in the history of the Jewish people the UN resolution proposed dividing Palestine into two states one Jewish and the other Arab with Jerusalem under International control but most Palestinian Arabs and all the Arab states rejected this plan and any division of Palestine did the Palestinians make a mistake by not accepting partition does that suggest how fanatic they were practically from birth opposing the UN vote on partitioning Palestine was a mistake for the Arabs without a doubt in retrospect we can say today that it was a mistake and not just what had happened in 1947 but from their Viewpoint it wasn't a mistake they weren't it already to accept a Jewish country to live next to a Jewish country certainly not all of Israel's attempts to split into two countries failed because of the Palestinians they simply didn't see why they should give up half of their Homeland they couldn't comprehend it why if the Arabs had said yes at that moment would things really have been headed towards a better situation or not would the Israelis or the Jews have really accepted those things [Music] the day of the UN declaration I was very young and already asleep I remember my mother came in to wake me up so I would remember the day the state of Israel was created she said they gave a state to the Jews David benorian didn't hide his concerns from Shimon Perez in charge of purchasing weapons today the people are dancing but tomorrow blood will flow I thought he was exaggerating but the party ended and indeed blood did begin to flow my father used to say to me that the day the vote would be recognized and announced a war was sure to follow Israel was born in war people danced all night on November the 29th and the last dances the next morning saw the first ones killed we were told return quickly to Tel Aviv there are already some dead in Ram the first war started with Partition a war between the hag and the Palestinians which was in fact the first in the Israeli Palestinian conflict what happened was the Palestinians did not accept the decision and they started a war the Arabs launched terrorist attacks bombs exploded in cities and roads were mined in Jerusalem a triple pronged carbomb attack targeted the offices of the Palestinian post the Ben Yehuda Road market and the Jewish agency offices 100 Jews were killed in hia members of Yun the paramilitary organization that broke away from the hagana threw two bombs into a group of Arab workers killing six of them in retaliation The Angry Crowd killed 39 Jews before British soldiers could reestablish order the delet plan was developed in March 1948 it gave hagana the responsibility for keeping order and authorized it to start expelling Palestinians benorian plannned to implement the plan around May the 15th when the British would leave but due to the military reality on the ground the haena went on the offensive and put the plan into action almost straight away in April the hag did all they could to pressure them to scare them so that would leave with gunshots in the night and Jeep saw Vehicles passing they got scared the question of evacuating places and settling in Replacements constantly came up so there was already a very clear policy in action we also have all the operational plans carried out by the military units and the Jewish Army which was the Hagar back then and they were all aimed at evacuating land when my parents got here they were offered some housing a house in Jerusalem that belonged to Palestinians who had fled and both of them turned it down they found it bizarre they said we ourselves are refugees too how could we take someone else's house several killings took place to make people understand that if they didn't leave they faced death however if they left their lives would be spared remember that day a Yasin happened in March 48 and would cause a panic de Yasin was a small Arab Village of 600 people located 5 km from Jerusalem it had no strategic importance and was not one of the villages targeted for takeover yet in spite of hagana leader reticence the ilun and lei two paramilitary groups attacked the village on the morning of April the 9th but the operation was Ill prepared and the Palestinians surprised them with their resistance killing five including several officers the Yun and lei men then took houses one by one blowing up several of them there were nearly 200 victims in the [Music] massacre they created conditions and planned operations calculated to scare people and make them flee as well as the murders and the massacres they did like in the village of De in other Villages and cities like in L people had fled looking for protection to stay alive Dar everybody heard about darasin and everybody's mind began to be that if we stay and and we have these uh Jewish forces come they will also Massacre us as they did in their so we better not stay stay and and get massacred people were terrorized at the rumors of De people were convinced zionists would come to kill us all we know very well zionists had never had that intention but to make the largest number of people flee that yes scene was early on and it was used as a psychological warfare in in in in convincing many more Arabs and frightening many more Arabs into fleeing their homes in the Memoirs of the first American ambassador to Israel information about de Yasin was still fresh in a conversation he had with wisan the pacifist he said the killings were unnecessary weissan pronounced this spine chilling phrase this massacre has been a miraculous simplification of Israel's tasks it has convinced the most stubborn among them to leave they taught our children that well it's sad that they died but it's not that important what's important is that we have a country on May the 14th 1948 a jubilant crowd marched through Tel Aviv bearing Flags adorned with the Star of David in Tel Aviv because Jerusalem was surrounded and inaccessible benorian stood under a portrait of Theodor and announced in a firm voice we proclaim the founding of the Jewish state which will be called Israel we extend our hand to all neighboring states and their peoples in an offer of peace and good neighborliness there is enough room in this country for us and the Arabs the state of Israel was born the dream had become [Music] reality but the high Arab Council immediately declared Arabs solemnly declare before God and history that they will never submit to such a power coming to Palestine to impose [Music] partition Great Britain's tenure officially came to an end and their troops went [Music] home the British commander gave back command of Palestinian lands to Zionist leaders [Music] I was so excited that I couldn't sleep for several nights T Aviv minus the English they had left the country but they left the Arabs many weapons the English were anti-zionists from the start they didn't believe that Israel which was born in blood could stand up to all the Arab armies most diplomats and world leaders and even some of the Zionist leaders here had serious doubts that the new state could hold up against attacks from Arab armies armies from neighboring Arab States invaded the areas of the old Palestinian mandate the first Arab Israeli War had started Egyptian planes bombed Tel Aviv Less Than 3 years after Liberation from concentration camps the great majority of Jews felt they were continuing their fight to survive it's true that declaring war when you're not even ready is indeed a mistake it should be remembered that it was the Arab side who started the war and lost should Israel have behaved in a better way yes there were constant announcements if you leave by the hia coastal route which is what we did you won't risk your life you can escape easily they were put into trucks between haa and Tel Aviv nearly all the inhabitants of the villages were expelled people felt endangered and and didn't feel safe to stay and they all thought as it was the case with my parents in in Jaffa that they would leave and and be safe as people do in wars and then after the war is over they will be able to return but they were never able to return my father made sure my mother and I were evacuated a few weeks earlier in a truck full of women and children who they literally dumped at the South Lebanese border when the town fell my father and sister went to the port and got on one of the last boats sailing out which they were lucky to get on and that's how they arrived in Exile in Lebanon crossing the sea Someone who lived through the nakba told me when leaving we found boats that were waiting for us to leave on the beaches of Jaffa did those boats come by themselves no it wasn't just chance those boats were made ready to force people to flee or immigrate people didn't leave by themselves no one leaves their house their fields their land voluntarily in times of War people are afraid and they flee they hope that when the war is over they will come back especially Farmers back to their land in their houses the Arab leaders said to them leave we will win and you can come back later we'll get our property and our land back because we we will win someone who flees their home has no right to come back to it the crime was not letting them come back during war time people flee they move all kinds of things happen but why did we shoot at them when they tried to come back in July long after a few months after the establishment of the Israeli state which was in May uh in July at gunpoint people were forced out of of their home nearly 750,000 Palestinians had been expelled before during and after 1948 following a series of operations interspersed by trues the Israeli military forces were winning on all fronts except for Jerusalem which was split in half by the Armistice line leaving the old town to the Arabs the Jewish population was chased out by the Jordanian forces the West Bank was annexed by the kingdom of Jordan and the Gaza Strip was occupied by Egypt Palestine disappeared from a official maps by winning the war Israel conquered 26% more territory than the partition plan provided for taking control of 81% of Palestine in 1947 after the war Israel would settle on the lands it had conquered part of these lands were state land but another part were lands from Arab Villages which were nationalized I can't ignore it it's a fact of history 10% of the Palestinians lands were purchased up to 19 only 10% barely 10% the rest of the land was annexed seized after 1948 after the war out of the 900,000 Palestinian Arabs living in territories now controlled by Israel nearly 750,000 left during the war of 1948 only 150,000 Palestinians were left subject to Israeli military Administration the International Community carefully ignored the refugees as they drifted with no place to go as add to that that in 1948 there were millions of displaced people all over Europe so 800,000 Palestinians or natives as we were called back then where's the [Music] problem [Music] [Music] say [Music] can to Phil s Phil [Music] philas"," [Music] on November 29th 1947 the 128th general assembly of the United Nations opened in New York the partition plan for Palestine into two states one Jewish one Arab was on the day's agenda for the resolution to pass 2/3 of the 56 represented countries had to vote for it most of the Jewish agency delegates had returned to Palestine as no one believed the resolution would pass the vote ABA IBA and the leaz officer to the United Nations committee on Palestine was the only one who decided to stay he believed the situation could change we took a map of the world we cut it up and we went for the delegations who were there but in spite of all our efforts we still needed three to four votes we only had a few hours to change the situation telegrams went all over the world influential people were woken up at midnight for what seemed to be impossible missions everyone used their influence great or small in a desperate attempt to tip the scales in our favor said ABA iban we knew that France wanted to abstain I convinced Haim Weisman the head of our delegation to contact Leon Bloom prime minister of the popular front and Deputy head of the French government in 1937 and 38 they had known each other for a while he sent a telegram to bloom which ended with these words can France abstain be absent at a moment that no one will forget and will be forever engraved in human memory we will proceed the whole call you all know how to vote those who are in favor will say yes those who are against will say no and the abstainers always they they know what to say we will start it now alarmed by the rise of anti-Semitism throughout Europe and profoundly affected by the draus affair the young austr Hungarian journalist Theodor Herzel published the Jewish state in 1896 in it he wrote if you want it it doesn't have to be a dream just give us full autonomy over a sufficient piece of land that would meet the needs of our people and we'll take care of the [Music] rest herel hoped that the moment the Jewish people had a country they would be a people like any other that everyone would treat them the same they treated any other people and anti-Semitism would decrease bit by bit but he also wrote that anti-Semitism was so deep so entrenched for so long that it was possible this hope would never come true and he could see no other solution to anti-Semitism and Exile but to create a state and live there a year later the first Congress of the Zionist movement was held in Basel with the goal of creating a home for the Jewish people one of the participants remembers the meeting's conclusion Theodor helzel was the second ular black bearded Messiah who would lead us to the promised land the excitement Rose to engulf the public in the balcony throughout the room you could hear people shouting next year in Jerusalem a year later hetel went to Egypt for the first and last time then to Palestine in his diary he wrote Jerusalem is Magnificent the city of David in the Moonlight is [Music] impressive it's a marvelous country describes of course herel describes the country he imagined a very liberal country very European very sophisticated with excellent relations between the different communities and the different parts of society when Herzel presented his Zionist project all the conservative reformist Orthodox rabbis were against Zionism this was the end of the 19th century beginning of the 20th all of them they perceived it as a sin arguing that the diaspora was a Divine punishment and only God could allow Jewish people to return to Sacred land with the coming of the Messiah Hetzel said you must separate religion from the state we shouldn't let the rabbis lead us they should stay in the synagogues but they shouldn't tell us what to do Zionism represented the desire to be freed from the shackles of religion and create a new human and a new Society in the country of Israel during the 7th International Zionist Congress in 1905 Palestine was chosen to establish a Jewish homeland after considering Uganda and Argentina it was the first Congress after herz's death a year earlier one of the members yitzak Epstein addressed the Tribune we forgot one small detail on that land we love there is an entire nation that has been living on it for centuries and has never considered leaving it we are making a serious psychological mistake the president of the Union of British synagogues had written to Herzel I tremble at the idea of founding a tiny tiny Jewish state that would become a [Music] ghetto at the start of the century the population consisted of tens of thousands of Jews and about 500,000 Arabs the Jews did not work the land most of them were Ultra Orthodox Jews who lived on foreign donations or were shopkeepers they had small shops that's it it was a small community very religious strong Believers many in Jerusalem or other places like Hebron and suffered there was no difference between the Jews and the Arabs in Jerusalem for example land and houses were sold all the time and were not an issue my parents who were living in Jaffa had many friends in in amongst the Jewish population of manded Palestine these things at that time were natural they were not anything unusual I don't think there's any reason to deny it it's obvious that Jews had lived on this land and that they had a culture here that they had their Roots here the pgms in Russia increased the massive migration of Jewish people especially to the United States a handful of young Zionist students from Ukraine decided to settle in Palestine [Music] one group arrived bought land in and stayed there one of the strangest things is that the Jews have said from the start that this is their land and the Arabs hear that in fact the moment the first Jew came here the Arab Jewish conflict began from that Viewpoint the seeds of conflict were there right from the start young idealists came to farm the land they told themselves they would create an ideal settlement in Israel we have texts from 1907 1908 that state this situation is an enormous project to OU us from our own land the working conditions in this land in places where they were far from everything LED them to create a way of living where everything was shared and that way of living then led to the kibuts concept the first kibutz a collectivist village was established in Palestine in 1909 the founders Were Young idealists from Europe who wanted to create a new state by finding a new way of [Music] life my grandfather worked in the mud to help dry up the marshes my grandmother broke rocks with a hammer they lived under a tent for 5 years the rest of the world considered Palestine to be an abandoned entirely uninhabited territory it was a desolate country filled with deserts and marshes [Music] you know that famous saying the bride was beautiful but was already married but they just couldn't bring themselves to admit that so they invented a slogan to justify and legitimize the project of their foreign Community arriving to settle in the local population's Homeland and they told the whole world the famous slogan of a land without people for a people without a land it was the worst line they claimed they transformed this land into a paradise oh you know it was totally desert it's a good thing we showed up that story of a desert land dates from the 19th century it dates from the time the European powers started to describe the sacred land as a devastated land that had to be brought back to life at any cost the Muslims weren't mistrustful before the zionists arrive they never imagined that one day this relationship between Jews and Arabs would change into something that the Palestinians would pay so dearly Jewish settlement is partly responsible for deteriorating relations between Arabs and Jews given that the settlement had decided it wouldn't use local Arab labor under the Imp of the Zionist movement more and more Jewish people bought land in Palestine between 1908 and 1913 11 new Jewish colonies were created during this period the first signs of Arab opposition to the Zionist movement appeared some Arabs protested against the sale of lands to Jewish people all the Palestinian Arabs sold property to the Jewish arrivals there are Deeds of sale our relationship changed people started to sense that there was a problem here How could an Arab live in peace with someone who comes and first of all buys land but wants to create a Jewish country not Arab and Jewish but a Jewish country tensions Rose bit by bit with the waves of [Music] immigration when the Arabs sense that the country was slipping from their hands World War I would upset geography in the Middle East on the losers side the Ottoman Empire was dismantled by peace treaties with the exception of turkey Asia Minor was now managed by Western Powers the syes Pico secret agreement signed between France and Great Britain assigned Palestine to the British the British were were responsible for making it possible for the Israeli for the Jewish people people to have estate in in Palestine not to speak of the Bel for declaration in in which also promised the land for to to to the Jews to guarantee a western presence in the area in November 1917 British Minister for foreign affairs Arthur James Balor wrote an open letter to Lord Lionel Walter Rothchild one of the Zionist movement's leaders he wrote his Majesty's government view with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and will use their best Endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may Prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine the belfa Declaration of 1917 was the Declaration of a colonialist offering someone else a gift that did not belong to them in 1917 when the British government adopted the Zionist project in order to create a national country for the Jews in Palestine Palestinians represented 98% of the population the most reliable figure was from 1919 when the English took possession of this area for the first time they conducted a very serious population census in 1919 there were 700,000 Arabs and 70,000 Jews right from the start the British were sharply aware that in order to stay a long time they had to divide this up the First Act of the division was absolutely perverse in the first census they created categories that didn't even exist cre category they created a Jewish category category and they created an Arab category and it was always that in other words let's make them fight each other and we will always be the referee with the rise of Arab nationalism the first anti-jewish protest started in March April 1920 in Jerusalem then may 1921 in Jaffa and Tel Aviv over 50 people were killed minister of colonies Winston Churchill investigated the events early in 1922 he published a white paper to clarify the British stance on Palestine in July 1922 the League of Nations gave Britain a mandate to prepare the creation of a national Jewish home between 1924 and 1928 more than 60,000 Jewish people arrived in Palestine on August the 20th 1929 protests broke out between Jews and Muslims over access to the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem 2 Days Later rumors circulated about an imminent Jewish attack on the alaxa mosque Arab attacks against Jews started in the old city of Jerusalem before spreading throughout Palestine 67 Jews including women and children were killed in Hebron other massacres took place in safid where 18 Jews were killed during a week of protests 133 Jews were killed by Arabs a British report claimed these protests are local expressions of animosity and hostility by Arabs against Jews because of the Arabs frustrated political and National [Music] hopes the Nazi party Rose to power in 1933 and started with the persecution of Jews in Germany then in [Applause] Austria in 1933 Adolf Hitler and his minister of propaganda ysf gobl organized the boycott of all businesses own by Jews the Jewish agency signed an agreement with the third re minister of economy which allowed German Jews to immigrate to Palestine provided they abandon most of their possessions before leaving the arrival of over 30,000 immigrants gave the economy a fresh boost the immigrants were intellectuals scientists Architects and artists many companies were started the population of of Tel Aviv founded in 1909 tripled and now counted 150,000 inhabitants the beaches and fashionable places were crowded yesterday a new elegant Cafe opened on the corner of alanby and bik streets worthy of the great European capitals wrote the magazine haritz in 1935 David benorian was elected president of the Jewish agency he had arrived in Palestine in 1906 when he was 20 from a small town close to Warsaw to participate in creating the new state he wanted a country for Jews immediately his friends understood that it was going to take time in the same year he was named head of the hagana the armed group for the defense of Palestinian Jews forbidden by the [Music] British in April 1936 the Arabs called for a general strike throughout the country and demanded an end to immigration and the sail of land to Jews the Palestinian Arab opposition culminated in the great Revolt of 1936 protesting against both Zionism and the British presence in Palestine casualties from the riots were very high several hundred Arabs were killed by the British and over 300 Jews also died the Arab High Committee convened in October under the general leadership of Amin al-hussein Grand Muti of Jerusalem [Music] the Muti was the leader of the Palestinian people he was a horrible man whose nationalism was pro-nazi not just because the Nazis were the enemies of the British and the Jews but also because he sympathized with the Nazi ideology it was total blindness the mu's Mad idea of throwing himself into Hitler's arms in Berlin the Muti went to Berlin and attempted to create SS divisions Muslim SS soldiers he wanted to create a unit with the German Army to come to Palestine and fight the Jews there the Muti didn't really have any Authority in Germany Hitler didn't care about the muy but he linked up with ikman ikman early on in 1936 directed The Jewish Department of the gapo in the SS and he was sent here to learn about the enemy in other words to learn Hebrew the traditions and then return to Germany and know what he was confronting so as to take care of it they were obsessed with learning exactly what a Jew really wasman and the Muti met together several times akman spoke of it and the Muti wrote it in his Memoirs they had a common goal get rid of the Jews for a long time afterwards paid the price for the Muti of Jerusalem's crazy sidetracking Jem the historian hagay horovitz would write when the grand Muti of Jerusalem met with Hitler it was a sign that the national Arab movement subjectives had changed for the first time everyone was aware of the danger that threatened our existence it was no longer imaginary it was the blow that changed the nature of the conflict and our combat strategy while Nazis proclaimed the nurenberg laws and the lives of millions of Jews were threatened in Europe the British blocked immigration roots to Palestine for those who wanted to flee the Reich there weren't many alternative choices because other nations were also closing their doors to Jewish people this was notably the case with the United States where immigration quotas set by Congress radically reduced the number of refugees from Germany and Austria in July 1938 the Evon conference convened to to discuss how to help the German Jews but closed without reaching its objective none of the 32 countries present would agree to open their borders to persecuted Jews as war with Germany loomed the British organized the St James conference in February 1939 hoping to avoid an Arab AIS Alliance the conference brought Jews and Arabs together for the first time but the Arab delegates refused to sit with the Jewish agency Representatives the British considered pal Palestine more than ever a ticking Time Bomb they published the white paper with policies considerably limiting the number of new immigrants and resolutely confirming that they had no intention of creating a Jewish state in [Music] Palestine Adolf Hitler had just invaded Poland World War II had just begun Palestine lived in constant threat of an invasion by Ral German forces who were on the African continent benorian declared we will help the British in the war as if there had not been a white paper and we will fight against the white paper as if there is no war the general staffs of the hagana and the British army agreed to create a force made up of Jews in the British army whose mission would be to fight the Nazi forces as a child my father spoke four languages had a very well-developed political conscience his mother died just after the 1939 Nazi invasion he then convinced his father that there was no other place for Jews except Israel for four months they traveled in a boat filled with illegal Travelers on board a boat that no country would allow it to dock at its ports neither the English nor Churchill nor Roosevelt's America nor any country in the world a small 12-year-old Jewish child with nothing but the sea beneath his feet finally they arrived here and the English arrested them people continued to arrive here several thousand people and everyone told stories we thought the ghettos had been the worst possible thing but we started to receive alarming information out of Poland hard tragic news started to come in serial murders in many places they didn't believe it people at first could not even conceive of it they thought of the programs and of anti-Semitism it seemed to be so horrible that it could not possibly be true and bit by bit at Year's End we started to get a harsh image of the events with appalling methods people buried alive parents forced to bury their children and of course gunshot executions in front of the ditches in 1942 a telegram arrived here saying that himler had decided to kill by the end of the year between 3.5 and 4 million people in suitable locations with a gas called hydrogen cyanide that telegram seemed so improbable that it remained in a drawer a first group arrived and traveled around saying that's what's happening it's all true it's terrible they're doing it methodically how could you hear such a thing when your entire family was living in Europe it meant they had no more family no more Community World War II ended but the Allied victory over Nazi Germany would not affect British policy London still refused to allow skps to immigrate to Palestine F at the same time 100,000 European Jewish survivors had nowhere to go a third of the worldwide Jewish population had been assassinated in the guest Chambers and in Nazi camps it proved that the zionists were right a people without a country is a people that is Led like beasts to the slaughter house but also because the Holocaust Survivors had nowhere else to go there were so many Jews looking for a place to settle doors to the United States were closed and locked so even if the Holocaust hadn't happened Jews would have come here and in increasing numbers palmach sent me to Europe after the Holocaust and I met those who had survived the remaining European Jews it was an enormous shock for me when I arrived over there one day I joined some young adolescent who wanted to immigrate covertly going through Italy and France it was snowing it was cold I lived with them for an entire week every night one of them would start screaming they all had nightmares it was such a chalk a terrible joke it will stay with me for the rest of my life after the war many survivors were distraught disoriented in fact most of them were because of how they had suffered terribly and the feeling they were now alone in the world people were experiencing such terrible trauma that no one was able to speak no one could say what happened most of these people had lost their entire family when we met a family with two sets of grandparents we asked ourselves how is this possible it sounded like the tales you would read in books it could not possibly be true I was born in September 46 in a Jewish refugee camp in Austria near the city of Lin the first two years of my life I spent them in those camps I grew up there from 1945 Jews who had escaped from concentration camps were herded into DP camps displaced persons camps in Germany and Austria surrounded by barbed wire fences treated insensitively by Allied soldiers they did not want to return to the countries where their families had been assassinated an American high official reported to President Truman the situation now is that we're treating the Jews like the Nazis did except that we are not Exterminating them the war was over but the Holocaust was not because when the Jews started to return to Poland Lithuania Slovakia Hungary Romania to go back to their homes they found they had been occupied by other people and they were killed in Poland alone about 2,000 Jews were killed between 1945 and 1946 people always refer to the Kel prgram but it was only one prgram among many we left Poland in the summer of 1946 after the K pram we could have gone to the United States but my mother said after the Holocaust we should go where Jews were living we arrived on a Greek boat without authorization from the British government we had been given fake papers and the day we arrived there was a curfew my mother said help where have we landed what kind of a place is this with operation Igloo the British transported all the Jews trying to reach Palestine to Cyprus in their personal notes they referred to this deportation more sensitively as transferring and moving to avoid alluding to previous concentration camp [Music] deportations as soon as the boats filled with refugees arrived in the port of hia the waiting British forces evacuated ated them and transferred them to Cyprus in cage [Music] boats more than 50,000 Jews would go through these barbed wire enclosed camps guarded by armed military men most were Holocaust Survivors philosopher Hannah arent wrote the internment camps in Cyprus were only possible because the entire world thought it more Humane than aitz if we look closely at all the decisions Great Britain made when they started blocking Jewish immigration it wasn't because of fundamental political changes it was because they knew they were being ousted in June 1946 the English began operation Agatha during a search they found documents proving that the Jewish agency supported acts of sabotage they decided to hit hard 2,700 people were arrested it was a heavy blow for the zionists one month later the men of lii a Jewish paramilitary group blew up the King David Hotel British headquarters killing 91 people paradoxically this universally condemned act would move events along and play in the zionists favor the British understood they would soon no longer be able to control Jewish organizations which were increasingly better structured Great Britain finally chose to retreat bit by bit the confrontations increased up to 1947 when the situation completely degenerated upon British request the UN named an international investigation Commission in April 1947 the final report recommended creating a Jewish and an Arab State surprised by this decision Great Britain refused this suggestion of sharing declared it would abandon its rule in six months time there was no doubt the Holocaust had influenced a large part of United Nations [Music] members and that the UN mission that came here and saw the Jewish refugee camps in Europe decided after all that had happened the Jews should be given a country what the Palestinian leadership didn't see in 1948 was that the Holocaust had taken place and that the whole world was convinced that the victims deserved reparation and that fundamental reparation for the victims was the emergence of a Jewish State and that this was the only adequate solution to the Nazi barbarism while the commission was working mosad would attempt to force the British to open Palestine ports to Jews it chartered an old boat named Exodus 1947 for the operation the boat arrived outside of hia with 4,500 Jewish immigrants from Central Europe most of the passengers were Nazi death camp survivors rather than stagnate in displaced persons camps they had opted to join the network of clandestin trips to Palestine they thought they could finally set foot on the Promised Land but the Royal Navy boarded and searched the vessel in the confusion three passengers were killed and 100 others wounded there were terrible clashes during the entire Journey we were expelled from Hyer and then sent back to France then hambur this act shook World opinion the British had to compromise with International opinion that favored resolving the Jewish problem as peacefully as possible at the UN delegations got ready to vote for palestine's future David benorian listened to the first results on the radio with Elena Roosevelt the former president's Widow beside him REM whether they have she had been influential in engaging the United States in World War II and played a decisive role in creating the United Nations France remained quiet about its intentions but Leon Bloom moved by Haim vman's telegram promised to use all his influence President Truman pressured reluctant state representatives to vote in favor of partition in return the Philippines and heti would receive loans the majority were to vote against the partition plan but the Americans used Thanksgiving as a pretext to postpone the vote they then came back with the support of two small countries we couldn't even pinpoint on the world map which the Americans had swayed during their national holiday and the majority vote changed the Soviet Minister for foreign affairs Andre gomo surprised the Western World with an unexpected Pro Zionist speech during the last war the Jewish people underwent incredible suffering this explains why the Jews want to establish their own State and it would be unjust to to refuse them that right and gromo made a speech in which he presented himself as a Zionist for years they pursued zionists and locked them up in gags gomo's speech had nothing to do with what was happening Soviet diplomacy has never had a reputation for being sentimental everything boils down to interests the Soviet Union wanted to replace the British in the Middle East it knew that the English would be forced out and wanted to be the first before the United States could steal their place Soviet Union Yes United Kingdom stain France yes the resolution of the duck committee for Palestine was adopted by 33 votes 13 against 10 abens the majority vote we got during the decision on partition in November 1947 we never could have got it and even then it wasn't simple it is said that the United Nations decision ensued because the westerners had a guilty conscience about the Holocaust excuse me but where was your conscience before that all of a sudden they had a guilty conscience it's of the country's great paradoxes it was founded after the worst tragedy in the history of the Jewish people the UN resolution proposed dividing Palestine into two states one Jewish and the other Arab with Jerusalem under International control but most Palestinian Arabs and all the Arab states rejected this plan and any division of Palestine did the Palestinians make a mistake by not accepting partition does that suggest how fanatic they were practically from birth opposing the UN vote on partitioning Palestine was a mistake for the Arabs without a doubt in retrospect we can say today that it was a mistake and not just what had happened in 1947 but from their Viewpoint it wasn't a mistake they weren't it already to accept a Jewish country to live next to a Jewish country certainly not all of Israel's attempts to split into two countries failed because of the Palestinians they simply didn't see why they should give up half of their Homeland they couldn't comprehend it why if the Arabs had said yes at that moment would things really have been headed towards a better situation or not would the Israelis or the Jews have really accepted those things [Music] the day of the UN declaration I was very young and already asleep I remember my mother came in to wake me up so I would remember the day the state of Israel was created she said they gave a state to the Jews David benorian didn't hide his concerns from Shimon Perez in charge of purchasing weapons today the people are dancing but tomorrow blood will flow I thought he was exaggerating but the party ended and indeed blood did begin to flow my father used to say to me that the day the vote would be recognized and announced a war was sure to follow Israel was born in war people danced all night on November the 29th and the last dances the next morning saw the first ones killed we were told return quickly to Tel Aviv there are already some dead in Ram the first war started with Partition a war between the hag and the Palestinians which was in fact the first in the Israeli Palestinian conflict what happened was the Palestinians did not accept the decision and they started a war the Arabs launched terrorist attacks bombs exploded in cities and roads were mined in Jerusalem a triple pronged carbomb attack targeted the offices of the Palestinian post the Ben Yehuda Road market and the Jewish agency offices 100 Jews were killed in hia members of Yun the paramilitary organization that broke away from the hagana threw two bombs into a group of Arab workers killing six of them in retaliation The Angry Crowd killed 39 Jews before British soldiers could reestablish order the delet plan was developed in March 1948 it gave hagana the responsibility for keeping order and authorized it to start expelling Palestinians benorian plannned to implement the plan around May the 15th when the British would leave but due to the military reality on the ground the haena went on the offensive and put the plan into action almost straight away in April the hag did all they could to pressure them to scare them so that would leave with gunshots in the night and Jeep saw Vehicles passing they got scared the question of evacuating places and settling in Replacements constantly came up so there was already a very clear policy in action we also have all the operational plans carried out by the military units and the Jewish Army which was the Hagar back then and they were all aimed at evacuating land when my parents got here they were offered some housing a house in Jerusalem that belonged to Palestinians who had fled and both of them turned it down they found it bizarre they said we ourselves are refugees too how could we take someone else's house several killings took place to make people understand that if they didn't leave they faced death however if they left their lives would be spared remember that day a Yasin happened in March 48 and would cause a panic de Yasin was a small Arab Village of 600 people located 5 km from Jerusalem it had no strategic importance and was not one of the villages targeted for takeover yet in spite of hagana leader reticence the ilun and lei two paramilitary groups attacked the village on the morning of April the 9th but the operation was Ill prepared and the Palestinians surprised them with their resistance killing five including several officers the Yun and lei men then took houses one by one blowing up several of them there were nearly 200 victims in the [Music] massacre they created conditions and planned operations calculated to scare people and make them flee as well as the murders and the massacres they did like in the village of De in other Villages and cities like in L people had fled looking for protection to stay alive Dar everybody heard about darasin and everybody's mind began to be that if we stay and and we have these uh Jewish forces come they will also Massacre us as they did in their so we better not stay stay and and get massacred people were terrorized at the rumors of De people were convinced zionists would come to kill us all we know very well zionists had never had that intention but to make the largest number of people flee that yes scene was early on and it was used as a psychological warfare in in in in convincing many more Arabs and frightening many more Arabs into fleeing their homes in the Memoirs of the first American ambassador to Israel information about de Yasin was still fresh in a conversation he had with wisan the pacifist he said the killings were unnecessary weissan pronounced this spine chilling phrase this massacre has been a miraculous simplification of Israel's tasks it has convinced the most stubborn among them to leave they taught our children that well it's sad that they died but it's not that important what's important is that we have a country on May the 14th 1948 a jubilant crowd marched through Tel Aviv bearing Flags adorned with the Star of David in Tel Aviv because Jerusalem was surrounded and inaccessible benorian stood under a portrait of Theodor and announced in a firm voice we proclaim the founding of the Jewish state which will be called Israel we extend our hand to all neighboring states and their peoples in an offer of peace and good neighborliness there is enough room in this country for us and the Arabs the state of Israel was born the dream had become [Music] reality but the high Arab Council immediately declared Arabs solemnly declare before God and history that they will never submit to such a power coming to Palestine to impose [Music] partition Great Britain's tenure officially came to an end and their troops went [Music] home the British commander gave back command of Palestinian lands to Zionist leaders [Music] I was so excited that I couldn't sleep for several nights T Aviv minus the English they had left the country but they left the Arabs many weapons the English were anti-zionists from the start they didn't believe that Israel which was born in blood could stand up to all the Arab armies most diplomats and world leaders and even some of the Zionist leaders here had serious doubts that the new state could hold up against attacks from Arab armies armies from neighboring Arab States invaded the areas of the old Palestinian mandate the first Arab Israeli War had started Egyptian planes bombed Tel Aviv Less Than 3 years after Liberation from concentration camps the great majority of Jews felt they were continuing their fight to survive it's true that declaring war when you're not even ready is indeed a mistake it should be remembered that it was the Arab side who started the war and lost should Israel have behaved in a better way yes there were constant announcements if you leave by the hia coastal route which is what we did you won't risk your life you can escape easily they were put into trucks between haa and Tel Aviv nearly all the inhabitants of the villages were expelled people felt endangered and and didn't feel safe to stay and they all thought as it was the case with my parents in in Jaffa that they would leave and and be safe as people do in wars and then after the war is over they will be able to return but they were never able to return my father made sure my mother and I were evacuated a few weeks earlier in a truck full of women and children who they literally dumped at the South Lebanese border when the town fell my father and sister went to the port and got on one of the last boats sailing out which they were lucky to get on and that's how they arrived in Exile in Lebanon crossing the sea Someone who lived through the nakba told me when leaving we found boats that were waiting for us to leave on the beaches of Jaffa did those boats come by themselves no it wasn't just chance those boats were made ready to force people to flee or immigrate people didn't leave by themselves no one leaves their house their fields their land voluntarily in times of War people are afraid and they flee they hope that when the war is over they will come back especially Farmers back to their land in their houses the Arab leaders said to them leave we will win and you can come back later we'll get our property and our land back because we we will win someone who flees their home has no right to come back to it the crime was not letting them come back during war time people flee they move all kinds of things happen but why did we shoot at them when they tried to come back in July long after a few months after the establishment of the Israeli state which was in May uh in July at gunpoint people were forced out of of their home nearly 750,000 Palestinians had been expelled before during and after 1948 following a series of operations interspersed by trues the Israeli military forces were winning on all fronts except for Jerusalem which was split in half by the Armistice line leaving the old town to the Arabs the Jewish population was chased out by the Jordanian forces the West Bank was annexed by the kingdom of Jordan and the Gaza Strip was occupied by Egypt Palestine disappeared from a official maps by winning the war Israel conquered 26% more territory than the partition plan provided for taking control of 81% of Palestine in 1947 after the war Israel would settle on the lands it had conquered part of these lands were state land but another part were lands from Arab Villages which were nationalized I can't ignore it it's a fact of history 10% of the Palestinians lands were purchased up to 19 only 10% barely 10% the rest of the land was annexed seized after 1948 after the war out of the 900,000 Palestinian Arabs living in territories now controlled by Israel nearly 750,000 left during the war of 1948 only 150,000 Palestinians were left subject to Israeli military Administration the International Community carefully ignored the refugees as they drifted with no place to go as add to that that in 1948 there were millions of displaced people all over Europe so 800,000 Palestinians or natives as we were called back then where's the [Music] problem [Music] [Music] say [Music] can to Phil s Phil [Music] philas"
28,GR-embMmMQc," [Music] the year was 1891 an Austrian journalist arrived in Paris he worked for a newspaper in Vienna and Paris was his new assignment his name was Theodore Herzel France back then was the land of the Revolution Herzel expected equality and free thought well he was in for a surprise because as it turned out anti-Semitism was everywhere in France as a Jew Herzel knew all about it in fact it was a way of life in his homeland but in post-revolution France Herzel expected better and then came a famous military Scandal the draus affair a French Captain was accused of selling military secrets to Germany he too was a Jew the conviction later turned out to be false but her Herzel had seen enough there was a massive outpouring of anti-Semitism Jews were being targeted and abused this episode made Herzel realized his life's Mission he needed to find a country for Jews a place they could call home a place where they could live without discrimination the only question was where Herzel settled on the ancient homeland of Jews Palestine thus he founded a new movement for Jewish statehood what is often called Zionism Herzel himself is called the founder of political Zionism but he died before Israel was created let me tell you the story of what happened in between also why Jews left their ancient Homeland in the first place and how they came in conflict with the Arabs time for a flashback we'll start with a simple question who are Jews today we know them as followers of a religion the religion of Judaism but Jews never called themselves that in ancient times they called themselves Israelites not Israelis Israelites these people originated around 1,000 BC and where did they live in West Asia roughly the same place as modern day Israel Jews Trace their ancestry to three people Abraham his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob they belied God made a promise to Abraham the promise of a Homeland in present day Israel you may have heard Israeli leaders talk about the promised land well this is what they mean a land promised to them by God and Jews did live here many call it the Golden Age of ancient Israel two kings ruled over the Jews King David who founded Jerusalem and King Solomon who built the first great Temple now the obvious question is this why did the Jews leave because of multiple invasions first came the Assyrian Empire then the Babylonians then the Persian Empire then the Roman Empire and finally the Ottomans each round of invasion led to Jews leaving their Homeland the peak was probably during the Roman times Jews had tried to revolt against Rome the response was a brutal Crackdown Roman generals bed Jerusalem they massacred the population and destroyed the Jewish temple those who survived fled now our story makes a Time jump to the 19th and 20th centuries the Jews have fled their Homeland only a few thousand remain in West Asia the rest are now spread across countries and continents we're talking about a large diaspora Poland had around 3 million Jews Russia 2 and a half million Britain 300,000 and Germany half a million as anti-Semitism increased there Zionism emerged the call for a separate Jewish country the likes of Theodore Herzel led the call he decided to organize a World Congress of zionists herdel wanted Munich to host it but when Jews there rejected it he settled on basil in Switzerland around 200 zionists attended this Congress plus hundreds of onlookers and they decided on creating a Jewish homeland in Palestine just one problem though Palestine was not just vacant land it was home to tens of thousands of Arab people so how would Jews make it their Homeland hudel and Company had a plan back then Palestine was controlled by the Ottoman Empire so in 1896 Herzel went to Constantinople

challenge of building friendship between the two [Music] states"," [Music] the year was 1891 an Austrian journalist arrived in Paris he worked for a newspaper in Vienna and Paris was his new assignment his name was Theodore Herzel France back then was the land of the Revolution Herzel expected equality and free thought well he was in for a surprise because as it turned out anti-Semitism was everywhere in France as a Jew Herzel knew all about it in fact it was a way of life in his homeland but in post-revolution France Herzel expected better and then came a famous military Scandal the draus affair a French Captain was accused of selling military secrets to Germany he too was a Jew the conviction later turned out to be false but her Herzel had seen enough there was a massive outpouring of anti-Semitism Jews were being targeted and abused this episode made Herzel realized his life's Mission he needed to find a country for Jews a place they could call home a place where they could live without discrimination the only question was where Herzel settled on the ancient homeland of Jews Palestine thus he founded a new movement for Jewish statehood what is often called Zionism Herzel himself is called the founder of political Zionism but he died before Israel was created let me tell you the story of what happened in between also why Jews left their ancient Homeland in the first place and how they came in conflict with the Arabs time for a flashback we'll start with a simple question who are Jews today we know them as followers of a religion the religion of Judaism but Jews never called themselves that in ancient times they called themselves Israelites not Israelis Israelites these people originated around 1,000 BC and where did they live in West Asia roughly the same place as modern day Israel Jews Trace their ancestry to three people Abraham his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob they belied God made a promise to Abraham the promise of a Homeland in present day Israel you may have heard Israeli leaders talk about the promised land well this is what they mean a land promised to them by God and Jews did live here many call it the Golden Age of ancient Israel two kings ruled over the Jews King David who founded Jerusalem and King Solomon who built the first great Temple now the obvious question is this why did the Jews leave because of multiple invasions first came the Assyrian Empire then the Babylonians then the Persian Empire then the Roman Empire and finally the Ottomans each round of invasion led to Jews leaving their Homeland the peak was probably during the Roman times Jews had tried to revolt against Rome the response was a brutal Crackdown Roman generals bed Jerusalem they massacred the population and destroyed the Jewish temple those who survived fled now our story makes a Time jump to the 19th and 20th centuries the Jews have fled their Homeland only a few thousand remain in West Asia the rest are now spread across countries and continents we're talking about a large diaspora Poland had around 3 million Jews Russia 2 and a half million Britain 300,000 and Germany half a million as anti-Semitism increased there Zionism emerged the call for a separate Jewish country the likes of Theodore Herzel led the call he decided to organize a World Congress of zionists herdel wanted Munich to host it but when Jews there rejected it he settled on basil in Switzerland around 200 zionists attended this Congress plus hundreds of onlookers and they decided on creating a Jewish homeland in Palestine just one problem though Palestine was not just vacant land it was home to tens of thousands of Arab people so how would Jews make it their Homeland hudel and Company had a plan back then Palestine was controlled by the Ottoman Empire so in 1896 Herzel went to Constantinople that's modern day stanbul and he stayed there for 11 days but he could not meet the sultan nonetheless he pushed on Herzel relayed an offer to the ottoman Sultan we will pay our foreign debt in return let us colonize Palestine it was basically an attempt to buy the land Herzel thought it was a Godfather sort of offer one the sultan could

30,pjtQ4Jmxh_8," In 1936, British Mandatory Palestine was in 
flames. In response to rising Jewish immigration   and economic dominance, Arab Palestinians 
revolted against the British, attacking   military installations and Jewish settlements. The 
British authorities were scrambling for an answer.  The British sent a commission led by Lord Peel 
to investigate the causes of the violence. And   in 1937, that commission concluded that problems 
in Palestine were ‘so deep-rooted that the only   hope of a cure lies in a surgical operation’. Some 
Jewish leaders were enthusiastic about the idea,   although did not publicly admit 
this. Most Arab leaders, however,   rejected the proposals outright. Instead of ending 
the violence, the Peel Report made things worse.  In our last episode, we explored the conflicting 
promises made by the British during the First   World War and how they tried to resolve 
them. In this episode we’ll examine how   the Second World War transformed the conflict 
once again. Why did Britain change its mind   about a Jewish homeland, how did a Zionist 
underground insurgency defeat the British,   and how were the borders of Israel, 
Gaza and the West Bank created?  Britain controlled Palestine under a League 
of Nations Mandate. Its job was to prepare   the territory for independence. As part of the 
Mandate, Britain had committed to setting up   what was described as ‘a homeland for the Jewish 
people’ in Palestine, but it had also promised to   respect the rights of the existing populations. 
Doing both was proving extremely challenging.  After the failure of the Peel Report, Britain 
declared Martial Law and used a surge of troops   to supress the revolt. They brought in Jewish 
Auxiliaries to add to their numbers and killed,   imprisoned or exiled Arab Palestinian leaders. 
But with a Second World War on the horizon,   the British government felt they had to 
go one step further to end the dissent.  Britain was trying to balance a number of 
different objectives. It wanted to maintain   stability in the region in order to protect 
its territorial interests – most notably the   Suez Canal, which was not only a vital link 
to Britain’s overseas Empire, but was also the   channel through which Persian oil was transported 
to Britain. The looming threat of war caused   Britain to reason that placating Palestinian 
Arabs was more politically and strategically   advantageous than siding unambiguously with 
Palestinian Jews. While support from Jewish groups   in any future conflict could be assured in the 
near term because of Hitler’s ideology, support   from Arabs was far less certain and Britain wanted 
to do whatever it could to keep bring them onside.  The result was a complete reversal of the British 
government position. In the White Paper of 1939,   Britain claimed that, with 450,000 Jewish 
people now living in Mandatory Palestine   this was already the National Home for the Jewish 
people and the Balfour Declaration had already   been delivered. Now, instead of partitioning 
the country, the British planned to create an   independent Palestinian State within the next 
10 years, in which Arabs and Jews would share   government. However, the White Paper also 
included strict limitations on Jewish land   purchases and restricted Jewish immigration 
to just 75,000 over the next five years. This   all but ensured that Palestinian Arabs would be 
the dominant group in the new Palestinian state.  Most Zionists were appalled by the proposals 
outlined in the 1939 White Paper, not only because   it suggested an entirely different overall 
objective but because the restrictions on   immigration would condemn hundreds of thousands 
of Jews in Europe to ongoing persecution and   suffering under the Nazis and their collaborators. 
This is given particularly potent expression in   the fact that the report was initially issued 
a mere 30 minutes before the death of Nazi   official Ernst vom Rath. His murder would be 
cynically exploited as the pretext in events   that became known as the November pogrom and 
were described by the Nazis as Kristallnacht.  But the Arab response to the White Paper was 
not as the British expected either. The revolt   of 1936 had hardened positions on all sides 
and while moderate Palestinian Arabs accepted   the White Paper, hard-line nationalists like Amin 
al-Husseini rejected it for not going far enough.   In response to the restrictions on migration, 
the Zionist militias that Britain had trained,   began facilitating illegal Jewish immigration. But 
before their resistance could turn to open revolt,   the Second World War began. Now, Palestinian 
Jews rallied to the Allied cause as did many   Palestinian Arabs. Al Husseini on the other hand, 
tried to get support from the Axis Powers. The   war and in particular the Holocaust, in which 6 
million of Europe’s Jews were murdered, would turn   the conflict in Mandatory Palestine on its head.
The outbreak of the Second World War had a   profound impact on events in Mandatory Palestine. 
Most Zionist underground members stopped any   direct action, wary of doing anything that could 
jeopardise the Allied war effort against Germany.   As David Ben Gurion, future Israeli Prime 
Minister suggested, ""They would fight the   White Paper as if there was no war and the war 
as if there was no White Paper."" Internationally,   increasing understanding about the Holocaust 
generated considerable sympathy for the Zionist   cause. Many surviving Jews believed that their 
ongoing existence in Europe was untenable after   everything that had happened. Having lost 
everything, and often everyone, they had   no desire to return to the places in which their 
lives had been so completely devastated. Britain,   for its part, remained very reluctant, despite the 
pressure of world opinion, to lift restrictions   on immigration to Mandatory Palestine.
By 1944, as Allied victory seemed more assured,   two hard-line Zionist militias, the Irgun and 
Lehi, began an insurgency against British rule,   assassinating diplomat Lord Moyne in November. 
But resistance was not widespread. In 1945,   Britain’s newly elected Labour Government under 
Clement Atlee campaigned on a promise to end   restrictions on Jewish immigration. But fearful 
of exacerbating tensions among Palestinian Arabs   and damaging relations with neighbouring Arab 
states, upon arriving in office, Atlee changed   his mind. Instead, some 50,000 Jewish refugees 
inbound to Palestine were redirected to camps   on Cyprus. The conditions and the sight of Jewish 
Holocaust survivors being held behind barbed wire   generated widespread criticism. With Britain’s 
position now clear, the largest Zionist militia,   the Haganah, joined the Irgun and Lehi to form 
the Jewish Resistance Movement. They aimed to   drive the British out. Together, they targeted 
immigration control, transport infrastructure   and British military installations. In response, 
the British curbed civil liberties in 1945 and   launched a series of raids and searches 
in 1946, codenamed 'Operation Agatha'.  Their intention was to combat what's described 
as a 'Jewish illegal armed organisations in   Palestine'. It says here 'these organisations 
have been conducting a campaign of violence,   terror, sabotage, and murder'. A vast amount 
of documents were seized during the course of   the operations 'that will prove of the greatest 
value and interest'. Now these documents were all   moved to the King David Hotel in Jerusalem 
where the British administration were being   housed alongside a number of military personnel. 
In July 1946 that hotel was bombed by the Irgun.  Palestine and the world was shocked by the blowing 
up of the King David Hotel Jerusalem. In broad   daylight dozens of Jews, Arabs and Britishers 
were murdered in cold blood by the notorious   Jewish terrorist organisation Irgun Zvai Leumi.
The attack killed 91 people and attracted   widespread criticism from both international 
governments and other Zionist organisations.   The Irgun, for their part, claimed that it 
was never their intention to kill anyone and   that warnings sent in advance of the attack 
had been ignored. Their main target was the   documents that had been captured during Operation 
Agatha. Now amongst the public condemnation,   many people in Britain started to wonder 
if the mandate was worth the trouble it was   causing. There was dwindling public appetite 
to expend more British lives protecting it.  The violence now intensified. Though the 
Jewish Resistance Movement dissolved after   the King David Hotel attack, the Irgun and Lehi 
continued to attack British targets. Meanwhile,   Britain continued to send ever-larger numbers 
of troops to Palestine, hoping to suppress the   insurgency in the same way that they had 
supressed the Arab Revolt of 1936. But it   wasn’t working. In July 1947, the Irgun kidnapped, 
hung and boobytrapped the bodies of two British   Sergeants in a eucalyptus grove near Netanya. 
The attacks were widely condemned and lead to   anti-Jewish rioting back in Britain. To many 
the Sergeant's Affair, as it came to be known,   was the 'straw that broke the Mandate's back'.
The Second World War had virtually bankrupted the   UK and public sentiment both within Britain and 
across the countries concerned was changing. In   the three years after 1945, India, Pakistan, 
Burma and Ceylon all achieved independence.   Whilst in Europe, the dividing lines of a new 
global conflict were being drawn, preparing   for and responding to this Cold War dominated 
military planning and strategy. Ultimately,   the Mandate in Palestine was only ever supposed 
to be temporary, and Britain didn’t want it   anymore. It was too complicated and too costly.
With all other Class A League of Nations mandates   now having received their independence, Britain 
turned over Mandatory Palestine to the newly   formed United Nations in 1947. Taking inspiration 
from the Peel Report of 1936, they recommended   a partition into two independent states with an 
economic union and an international zone around   Jerusalem. Most Arab groups rejected the plan. 
They were opposed both to partition in principle,   and to the way the lines were drawn. They pointed 
to the fact that while Jews represented just over   30% of the population, they were apportioned 54% 
of the land, although arguments persist about the   quality of that land. Most Zionists, on the other 
hand, willingly accepted the proposal, seeing   it as a stepping stone towards their ultimate 
ambition for a Jewish state that extended further.  In November 1947, the plan passed a vote 
in the UN with backing from both the United   States and Soviet Union. The United 
Kingdom abstained and declared that   it would leave on May 15th 1948. Now, violence 
took hold between Palestinian Arabs and Jews,   and a Civil War broke out between militias from 
each side. But even as the death toll mounted,   Britain largely did not get involved.
These documents come from Major General   William Scott Cole who was tasked with the 
responsibility of overseeing the British   withdrawal from Mandate Palestine. Whilst Jewish 
and Arab groups were fighting it out to determine   the future shape of Palestine, Britain's focus 
became about how to remove itself from the place   entirely. For example, here it says in January 
1948, 'difficulties arose at this time due to   absence of staff owing to internal troubles. Jews 
will not go to or through Arab areas and vice   versa.' As well there's a note talking about the 
disposal of Sherman tanks that had to be destroyed   by Royal signals and blown up until they were 
quote 'unrecognisable scrap'. As Rees Williams,   undersecretary of state for the colonies, told 
the House of Commons 'the manner in which the   withdrawal took place is unprecedented 
in the history of our Empire'. It was,   in many ways, emblematic of the entire episode.
Meanwhile, the Civil War in Palestine continued.   At first, Arab forces seemed to have the upper 
hand. The Jewish communities in Palestine were   spread out and Arab forces were able to blockade 
them, most notably in Jerusalem where 100,000   Jewish people were trapped. But in late March 
1948, Zionist militias launched Plan Dalet. This   offensive aimed to create territorial continuity 
and secure their borders in anticipation of an   invasion by neighbouring Arab states. As the 
Zionist forces attacked, hundreds of thousands   of Palestinian Arab refugees fled their homes. 
The causes of this flight are still considered   controversial. Some left by choice, others in fear 
and some by force. Many refugees took their keys   with them, planning to return home someday soon.
On the 14th of May, Zionists declared the new   state of Israel. The following day, 
neighbouring Arab states invaded. But   the Arab forces were unprepared for war, 
and the Israeli forces were able to hold   onto their territory. Over the next nine months, 
they built enough forces to push well beyond the   land allotted to them in the 1947 UN Plan.
The 1936 Revolt had left Arabs in Palestine   leaderless and significantly weakened. Though they 
were supported by other Arab states, these states   had different interests and agendas and were often 
at crossed purposes. In contrast, while there may   have been differences between the convictions 
of different Jewish groups, they were completely   unified in the common cause of creating and 
protecting the Jewish State. They also benefited   from having received military training and arms 
from the British administration in earlier years.  By the war's end in 1949, Palestine had been wiped 
off the the map. Israel controlled 60% of the   proposed Arab state, with the remainder controlled 
by Jordan and Egypt. 700,000 Palestinian Arabs   either fled or were expelled from their homes, an 
event remembered as 'the Nakba' or 'catastrophe'.   In the following years, 260,000 Jewish people 
emigrated from neighbouring Arab states,   some by choice and others by force. Around 150,000 
Palestinian Arabs remained in Israel. Today their   descendants number over 2 million people, making 
up the largest minority group in the country. The   legacy of the Arab-Israeli War is still at the 
heart of today's conflict in Israel-Palestine.  Ultimately, Britain’s administration of the 
Mandate never proved to be much more than a   firefighting exercise, lurching for one policy 
to another in an attempt to hold the mandate   together and protect its own strategic 
interests. On the last day of the mandate,   the chief secretary of the British administration 
called a press conference in his Jerusalem   office. One of the journalists there 
asked: ""And to whom do you intend to   give the keys to your office?"". ""I shall 
leave them under the mat,"" was the reply."," In 1936, British Mandatory Palestine was in 
flames. In response to rising Jewish immigration   and economic dominance, Arab Palestinians 
revolted against the British, attacking   military installations and Jewish settlements. The 
British authorities were scrambling for an answer.  The British sent a commission led by Lord Peel 
to investigate the causes of the violence. And   in 1937, that commission concluded that problems 
in Palestine were ‘so deep-rooted that the only   hope of a cure lies in a surgical operation’. Some 
Jewish leaders were enthusiastic about the idea,   although did not publicly admit 
this. Most Arab leaders, however,   rejected the proposals outright. Instead of ending 
the violence, the Peel Report made things worse.  In our last episode, we explored the conflicting 
promises made by the British during the First   World War and how they tried to resolve 
them. In this episode we’ll examine how   the Second World War transformed the conflict 
once again. Why did Britain change its mind   about a Jewish homeland, how did a Zionist 
underground insurgency defeat the British,   and how were the borders of Israel, 
Gaza and the West Bank created?  Britain controlled Palestine under a League 
of Nations Mandate. Its job was to prepare   the territory for independence. As part of the 
Mandate, Britain had committed to setting up   what was described as ‘a homeland for the Jewish 
people’ in Palestine, but it had also promised to   respect the rights of the existing populations. 
Doing both was proving extremely challenging.  After the failure of the Peel Report, Britain 
declared Martial Law and used a surge of troops   to supress the revolt. They brought in Jewish 
Auxiliaries to add to their numbers and killed,   imprisoned or exiled Arab Palestinian leaders. 
But with a Second World War on the horizon,   the British government felt they had to 
go one step further to end the dissent.  Britain was trying to balance a number of 
different objectives. It wanted to maintain   stability in the region in order to protect 
its territorial interests – most notably the   Suez Canal, which was not only a vital link 
to Britain’s overseas Empire, but was also the   channel through which Persian oil was transported 
to Britain. The looming threat of war caused   Britain to reason that placating Palestinian 
Arabs was more politically and strategically   advantageous than siding unambiguously with 
Palestinian Jews. While support from Jewish groups   in any future conflict could be assured in the 
near term because of Hitler’s ideology, support   from Arabs was far less certain and Britain wanted 
to do whatever it could to keep bring them onside.  The result was a complete reversal of the British 
government position. In the White Paper of 1939,   Britain claimed that, with 450,000 Jewish 
people now living in Mandatory Palestine   this was already the National Home for the Jewish 
people and the Balfour Declaration had already   been delivered. Now, instead of partitioning 
the country, the British planned to create an   independent Palestinian State within the next 
10 years, in which Arabs and Jews would share   government. However, the White Paper also 
included strict limitations on Jewish land   purchases and restricted Jewish immigration 
to just 75,000 over the next five years. This   all but ensured that Palestinian Arabs would be 
the dominant group in the new Palestinian state.  Most Zionists were appalled by the proposals 
outlined in the 1939 White Paper, not only because   it suggested an entirely different overall 
objective but because the restrictions on   immigration would condemn hundreds of thousands 
of Jews in Europe to ongoing persecution and   suffering under the Nazis and their collaborators. 
This is given particularly potent expression in   the fact that the report was initially issued 
a mere 30 minutes before the death of Nazi   official Ernst vom Rath. His murder would be 
cynically exploited as the pretext in events   that became known as the November pogrom and 
were described by the Nazis as Kristallnacht.  But the Arab response to the White Paper was 
not as the British expected either. The revolt   of 1936 had hardened positions on all sides 
and while moderate Palestinian Arabs accepted   the White Paper, hard-line nationalists like Amin 
al-Husseini rejected it for not going far enough.   In response to the restrictions on migration, 
the Zionist militias that Britain had trained,   began facilitating illegal Jewish immigration. But 
before their resistance could turn to open revolt,   the Second World War began. Now, Palestinian 
Jews rallied to the Allied cause as did many   Palestinian Arabs. Al Husseini on the other hand, 
tried to get support from the Axis Powers. The   war and in particular the Holocaust, in which 6 
million of Europe’s Jews were murdered, would turn   the conflict in Mandatory Palestine on its head.
The outbreak of the Second World War had a   profound impact on events in Mandatory Palestine. 
Most Zionist underground members stopped any   direct action, wary of doing anything that could 
jeopardise the Allied war effort against Germany.   As David Ben Gurion, future Israeli Prime 
Minister suggested, ""They would fight the   White Paper as if there was no war and the war 
as if there was no White Paper."" Internationally,   increasing understanding about the Holocaust 
generated considerable sympathy for the Zionist   cause. Many surviving Jews believed that their 
ongoing existence in Europe was untenable after   everything that had happened. Having lost 
everything, and often everyone, they had   no desire to return to the places in which their 
lives had been so completely devastated. Britain,   for its part, remained very reluctant, despite the 
pressure of world opinion, to lift restrictions   on immigration to Mandatory Palestine.
By 1944, as Allied victory seemed more assured,   two hard-line Zionist militias, the Irgun and 
Lehi, began an insurgency against British rule,   assassinating diplomat Lord Moyne in November. 
But resistance was not widespread. In 1945,   Britain’s newly elected Labour Government under 
Clement Atlee campaigned on a promise to end   restrictions on Jewish immigration. But fearful 
of exacerbating tensions among Palestinian Arabs   and damaging relations with neighbouring Arab 
states, upon arriving in office, Atlee changed   his mind. Instead, some 50,000 Jewish refugees 
inbound to Palestine were redirected to camps   on Cyprus. The conditions and the sight of Jewish 
Holocaust survivors being held behind barbed wire   generated widespread criticism. With Britain’s 
position now clear, the largest Zionist militia,   the Haganah, joined the Irgun and Lehi to form 
the Jewish Resistance Movement. They aimed to   drive the British out. Together, they targeted 
immigration control, transport infrastructure   and British military installations. In response, 
the British curbed civil liberties in 1945 and   launched a series of raids and searches 
in 1946, codenamed 'Operation Agatha'.  Their intention was to combat what's described 
as a 'Jewish illegal armed organisations in   Palestine'. It says here 'these organisations 
have been conducting a campaign of violence,   terror, sabotage, and murder'. A vast amount 
of documents were seized during the course of   the operations 'that will prove of the greatest 
value and interest'. Now these documents were all   moved to the King David Hotel in Jerusalem 
where the British administration were being   housed alongside a number of military personnel. 
In July 1946 that hotel was bombed by the Irgun.  Palestine and the world was shocked by the blowing 
up of the King David Hotel Jerusalem. In broad   daylight dozens of Jews, Arabs and Britishers 
were murdered in cold blood by the notorious   Jewish terrorist organisation Irgun Zvai Leumi.
The attack killed 91 people and attracted   widespread criticism from both international 
governments and other Zionist organisations.   The Irgun, for their part, claimed that it 
was never their intention to kill anyone and   that warnings sent in advance of the attack 
had been ignored. Their main target was the   documents that had been captured during Operation 
Agatha. Now amongst the public condemnation,   many people in Britain started to wonder 
if the mandate was worth the trouble it was   causing. There was dwindling public appetite 
to expend more British lives protecting it.  The violence now intensified. Though the 
Jewish Resistance Movement dissolved after   the King David Hotel attack, the Irgun and Lehi 
continued to attack British targets. Meanwhile,   Britain continued to send ever-larger numbers 
of troops to Palestine, hoping to suppress the   insurgency in the same way that they had 
supressed the Arab Revolt of 1936. But it   wasn’t working. In July 1947, the Irgun kidnapped, 
hung and boobytrapped the bodies of two British   Sergeants in a eucalyptus grove near Netanya. 
The attacks were widely condemned and lead to   anti-Jewish rioting back in Britain. To many 
the Sergeant's Affair, as it came to be known,   was the 'straw that broke the Mandate's back'.
The Second World War had virtually bankrupted the   UK and public sentiment both within Britain and 
across the countries concerned was changing. In   the three years after 1945, India, Pakistan, 
Burma and Ceylon all achieved independence.   Whilst in Europe, the dividing lines of a new 
global conflict were being drawn, preparing   for and responding to this Cold War dominated 
military planning and strategy. Ultimately,   the Mandate in Palestine was only ever supposed 
to be temporary, and Britain didn’t want it   anymore. It was too complicated and too costly.
With all other Class A League of Nations mandates   now having received their independence, Britain 
turned over Mandatory Palestine to the newly   formed United Nations in 1947. Taking inspiration 
from the Peel Report of 1936, they recommended   a partition into two independent states with an 
economic union and an international zone around   Jerusalem. Most Arab groups rejected the plan. 
They were opposed both to partition in principle,   and to the way the lines were drawn. They pointed 
to the fact that while Jews represented just over   30% of the population, they were apportioned 54% 
of the land, although arguments persist about the   quality of that land. Most Zionists, on the other 
hand, willingly accepted the proposal, seeing   it as a stepping stone towards their ultimate 
ambition for a Jewish state that extended further.  In November 1947, the plan passed a vote 
in the UN with backing from both the United   States and Soviet Union. The United 
Kingdom abstained and declared that   it would leave on May 15th 1948. Now, violence 
took hold between Palestinian Arabs and Jews,   and a Civil War broke out between militias from 
each side. But even as the death toll mounted,   Britain largely did not get involved.
These documents come from Major General   William Scott Cole who was tasked with the 
responsibility of overseeing the British   withdrawal from Mandate Palestine. Whilst Jewish 
and Arab groups were fighting it out to determine   the future shape of Palestine, Britain's focus 
became about how to remove itself from the place   entirely. For example, here it says in January 
1948, 'difficulties arose at this time due to   absence of staff owing to internal troubles. Jews 
will not go to or through Arab areas and vice   versa.' As well there's a note talking about the 
disposal of Sherman tanks that had to be destroyed   by Royal signals and blown up until they were 
quote 'unrecognisable scrap'. As Rees Williams,   undersecretary of state for the colonies, told 
the House of Commons 'the manner in which the   withdrawal took place is unprecedented 
in the history of our Empire'. It was,   in many ways, emblematic of the entire episode.
Meanwhile, the Civil War in Palestine continued.   At first, Arab forces seemed to have the upper 
hand. The Jewish communities in Palestine were   spread out and Arab forces were able to blockade 
them, most notably in Jerusalem where 100,000   Jewish people were trapped. But in late March 
1948, Zionist militias launched Plan Dalet. This   offensive aimed to create territorial continuity 
and secure their borders in anticipation of an   invasion by neighbouring Arab states. As the 
Zionist forces attacked, hundreds of thousands   of Palestinian Arab refugees fled their homes. 
The causes of this flight are still considered   controversial. Some left by choice, others in fear 
and some by force. Many refugees took their keys   with them, planning to return home someday soon.
On the 14th of May, Zionists declared the new   state of Israel. The following day, 
neighbouring Arab states invaded. But   the Arab forces were unprepared for war, 
and the Israeli forces were able to hold   onto their territory. Over the next nine months, 
they built enough forces to push well beyond the   land allotted to them in the 1947 UN Plan.
The 1936 Revolt had left Arabs in Palestine   leaderless and significantly weakened. Though they 
were supported by other Arab states, these states   had different interests and agendas and were often 
at crossed purposes. In contrast, while there may   have been differences between the convictions 
of different Jewish groups, they were completely   unified in the common cause of creating and 
protecting the Jewish State. They also benefited   from having received military training and arms 
from the British administration in earlier years.  By the war's end in 1949, Palestine had been wiped 
off the the map. Israel controlled 60% of the   proposed Arab state, with the remainder controlled 
by Jordan and Egypt. 700,000 Palestinian Arabs   either fled or were expelled from their homes, an 
event remembered as 'the Nakba' or 'catastrophe'.   In the following years, 260,000 Jewish people 
emigrated from neighbouring Arab states,   some by choice and others by force. Around 150,000 
Palestinian Arabs remained in Israel. Today their   descendants number over 2 million people, making 
up the largest minority group in the country. The   legacy of the Arab-Israeli War is still at the 
heart of today's conflict in Israel-Palestine.  Ultimately, Britain’s administration of the 
Mandate never proved to be much more than a   firefighting exercise, lurching for one policy 
to another in an attempt to hold the mandate   together and protect its own strategic 
interests. On the last day of the mandate,   the chief secretary of the British administration 
called a press conference in his Jerusalem   office. One of the journalists there 
asked: ""And to whom do you intend to   give the keys to your office?"". ""I shall 
leave them under the mat,"" was the reply."
31,oIWqTIFRlYU,,"The massacre of Israeli civilians by Hamas, a Palestinian group, and Israel's subsequent retaliation is the latest bloody eruption of a long-running conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. This conflict has its origins in a letter written more than 100 years ago and just 67 words long. In 1917, Arthur Balfour, the British Foreign Secretary, typed a note that would change the face of the Middle East. The letter was a declaration of support for Zionists who wanted to create a Jewish state in the carve-up of the Ottoman Empire. After the First World War, the League of Nations gave Britain a mandate to rule Palestine. The Arabs, who had been living there for centuries, turned increasingly to resistance and violence, culminating in a revolt in 1936. The British crushed the uprising, but tried to win over the Arabs by restricting Jewish ambitions. After Jewish anger also turned violent, the British gave up. They handed the problem over to the United Nations. In 1947, the UN voted to partition Palestine, but the Arabs rejected this and fighting broke out once again. The last British soldiers left Palestine in May 1948. Within hours, Jewish leaders declared the establishment of the State of Israel. Neighboring Arab countries invaded immediately. In the armistice of 1949, the land was divided between Israel and Arab states, but there was no new state for the Palestinians. There were just two regions controlled by Egypt and Jordan, now known as Gaza and the West Bank. An estimated 700,000 Palestinians fled or were pushed out of their homes. They called this the Nakba, the catastrophe. Since then, there have been wars, uprisings, terrorist attacks and diplomatic deals. Nothing has brought lasting peace or a state for the Palestinians. Since the war of 1967, many Palestinians have lived in the West Bank under Israeli occupation. Today they're cut off by the Israeli security barrier. They have autonomy in big cities and towns, but are surrounded by Jewish settlements. Others are locked away in Gaza. This densely populated strip of land has been the scene of repeated battles, a grim pattern that seems destined to continue."

35,Lb3v8M8dzic, let's talk about one of the holiest sites in the world [Music] that's always in the news we have another session of violence here right in front of such a sensitive religious site isn't it one of the flash points that led to the 11-day conflict Israel's far-right national security minister itamar bengvir has visited the AXA mosque compound and it's a place that you need to get your head around if you want to understand what's going on between the Israelis and Palestinians foreign here's the old city and occupied East Jerusalem the place where Islam Judaism and Christianity all intersect there are several sites here that are holy to all three including this big compound that rises above everything else Jews call it the Temple mount Muslims call it al-haram al-sharif which means the noble Sanctuary or the Al-Aqsa mosque compound or sometimes just Al-Aqsa now right in the middle of everything is the Dome of the Rock it's an Islamic Shrine where Muslims believe the prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven here is the Al-Aqsa mosque itself it's got a huge prayer Hall with space for 5 000 worshipers the Alexa mosque got its name from a reference uh in the Quran that refers to a mystical night Journey that the prophet Muhammad made Rebecca to El Mezza which means the furthest mosque and that was generally understood to be in Jerusalem Jerusalem was the location of the first direction of prayer for Muslims and was later changed to Mecca because of that the Al-Aqsa mosque compound is the third holiest site in Islam after Mecca and Medina in Christianity the site matters because of its significance in the Old Testament and because Jesus would have spent time there and it's also the most holy site in Judaism it's where two ancient Jewish temples once stood the first was destroyed by the Babylonians the second stood for almost 600 years until it was destroyed by the Romans in the first century and according to Jewish teachings the mount is where a third Temple should be built when the Messiah a savior figure is sent by God now for most of the last 800 years the compound was controlled by Muslim rulers and wasn't accessible to non-muslims traditionally Jewish law actually forbids Jews from entering or praying inside the Temple Mount because it's considered so holy a place of divine presence so Jews pray outside the compound at the Western Wall which is thought to have been part of the second temple even to this day the overwhelming majority of Orthodox rabbis will say you are not allowed to visit what this means is that throughout the Millennia the Temple mount for Jews was a focus of devotion but there were no particular demands pending the coming of the Messiah all of that changed in 1967. [Music] that's when Israel seized control of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank including East Jerusalem in the Six-Day War Between the Arabs and Israelis but when it came to Al-Aqsa the Israelis stuck with an arrangement that kept something called the walk-off in charge it's an Islamic trust that's run by Jordan Jordan would retain control over the actual compound itself the Alexa mosque its custodian ship of its Administration its upkeep who could access the site who couldn't access the site uh you know pram worship and that whole Arrangement is wrapped up in this idea known as the status quo it's a Latin phrase which means the situation as it is now but in this context the status quo refers to how things are done at Al-Aqsa very simple Muslims pray non-muslims to visit or stop if I were to try and translate this into the description of a dynamic um the holy Esplanade Haram Temple mount is exclusively a place of worship for Muslims that is open to the dignified and respectful visits of non-muslims and in coordination with the autonomous authorities of the work that's the theory anyway what actually happens in practice is another thing because remember Israel occupies East Jerusalem and has a heavy security presence in the old city including at the gates of the Al-Aqsa compound so effectively it's the Israeli police not the walk-off officials who ultimately control who goes in and out although it wasn't always so explicit there was a shift in the early 2000s after the Palestinian Uprising against the Israeli occupation known as the second intifada we saw Israel then controlling not only the vicinity around the Alaska but also the unlocks the most compound itself taking control over security access and allowing increasing numbers of Jews to access the site the change in the Israeli perspective is we're not your guests we're here a landlord and we're going to show you that we're your landlord and what we're seeing is Israel increasingly exercising that control and more and more accusations that they're breaking the agreed conventions of the status quo so there are lots of ways that the status quo has been violated restrictions uh on Muslim warship which is something that the Israeli occupation imposes quite frequently sometimes age restrictions usually limiting men of a certain age from entering the site if they feel that there may be protests or or something happening we're all set seeing more Jewish prayer whether it's silent but slowly it's becoming much more of that now [Music] there is Jewish prayer I've seen it daily uh but beyond that there is a triumphalism an ultra-national triangleism which is perceived as a violation of the sanctity of the site by Muslim worshipers and people in the Muslim world the backdrop to all of this is the growing power of far-right groups and religious hardliners in Israel for example there is the Temple Mount movement that's been around for decades it brings together a range of groups who want to overturn the status quo throughout the years that Fringe uh became less of a fringe and during the 1980s and the 1990s began to go mainstream and today it is not only not a fringe it is in power so you've got people like the new national security minister it's Amar bengaver who entered the Al-Aqsa compound after only a few days on the job he says the arrangements that limit Jewish access are racist it's one thing to have a non-governmental entity or groups of individuals go but when you have ministers going up to the site it's it's very different he was effectively asserting what he had promised during his campaign uh during the Electoral run-up which was Jewish Supremacy and sovereignty over all of Israel that's why what Ben Geer did was so provocative lots of countries condemned it the U.N security Council called a special session about it because there's always the fear of how quickly things can escalate when it comes to Alexa [Music] like in the early 2000s when a visit by the then opposition leader Ariel Sharon triggered the second into fada [Applause] [Music] [Applause] anyone when Israeli forces stormed Al-Aqsa Moss during Ramadan it all spiraled and led to an 11-day Israeli War on Gaza thank you our mission is both an explosive but it is even more a Detonator and with the climatic conditions are correct what happens on the mount can make the region uh erupt in Flames I'll access such a powerful symbol so what happens there takes on an even bigger Dimension and for Palestinians it's become emblematic of their wider struggle the constant chipping away of their rights their land and their identity didn't get to 700 000 Israeli settlers in the occupied territories overnight it happened house by house Brick by Brick Road by Road settlement by settlement and so that's what's happening with the status quo it's being eroded bit by bit it is a slow piecemeal process that the International Community generally tolerates the Israeli governments haven't faced any real costs or repercussions for those actions and so it's that impune D that allows them to kind of keep pushing the envelope further each time

one of the holiest sites in the world [Music] that's always in the news we have another session of violence here right in front of such a sensitive religious site isn't it one of the flash points that led to the 11-day conflict Israel's far-right national security minister itamar bengvir has visited the AXA mosque compound and it's a place that you need to get your head around if you want to understand what's going on between the Israelis and Palestinians foreign here's the old city and occupied East Jerusalem the place where Islam Judaism and Christianity all intersect there are several sites here that are holy to all three including this big compound that rises above everything else Jews call it the Temple mount Muslims call it al-haram al-sharif which means the noble Sanctuary or the Al-Aqsa mosque compound or sometimes just Al-Aqsa now right in the middle of everything is the Dome of the Rock it's an Islamic Shrine where Muslims believe the prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven here is the Al-Aqsa mosque itself it's got a huge prayer Hall with space for 5 000 worshipers the Alexa mosque got its name from a reference uh in the Quran that refers to a mystical night Journey that the prophet Muhammad made Rebecca to El Mezza which means the furthest mosque and that was generally understood to be in Jerusalem Jerusalem was the location of the first direction of prayer for Muslims and was later changed to Mecca because of that the Al-Aqsa mosque compound is the third holiest site in Islam after Mecca and Medina in Christianity the site matters because of its significance in the Old Testament and because Jesus would have spent time there and it's also the most holy site in Judaism it's where two ancient Jewish temples once stood the first was destroyed by the Babylonians the second stood for almost 600 years until it was destroyed by the Romans in the first century and according to Jewish teachings the mount is where a third Temple should be built when the Messiah a savior figure is sent by God now for most of the last 800 years the compound was controlled by Muslim rulers and wasn't accessible to non-muslims traditionally Jewish law actually forbids Jews from entering or praying inside the Temple Mount because it's considered so holy a place of divine presence so Jews pray outside the compound at the Western Wall which is thought to have been part of the second temple even to this day the overwhelming majority of Orthodox rabbis will say you are not allowed to visit what this means is that throughout the Millennia the Temple mount for Jews was a focus of devotion but there were no particular demands pending the coming of the Messiah all of that changed in 1967.

36,JZIIOp38KYU, in this video we are going to learn why india supports palestine i will also briefly tell you what happened post 1948 that is after the creation of israeli state then we will also learn what were the main reasons that triggered the recent israeli-palestinian conflict and in the end i'll end this video on few comments about middle eastern ethno-religion politics alright then without any further ado let's begin let me begin with a small realistic life philosophy which says what you see on the surface is not what you will find under though india israel recently you must have heard the statement of tien tirumurti who is the indian representative at the united nation he said india strongly supports the palestinian cause if you notice there's a word called reaffirmed it means confirming the validity of something previously established that means india's support to palestine is part of india's old foreign policy that began during the neruvian era as you all know that jawaharlal nehru was the first prime minister of india after 1947 the indian economy was in a very poor state india's development strategy began on a socialistic approach under the leadership of first prime minister jawaharlal nehru in fact the concept of 5-year plan was first implemented in the soviet union in 1928 by joseph stalin jawaharlal nehru was inspired by stalin's plan if you know the full form of ussr it is the union of soviet socialist republics officially the ussr was a federal socialist state nehru was inspired from it and that is how after independence india's development strategy began on a socialistic approach so after 1947 the indian national congress made india follow largely whatever the soviet union did and soviet union used to support palestine likewise india also started supporting palestine in simple words whatever soviet union did india also very much followed that if i have to summarize the last hundred years in terms of distribution of power then it is something like this before the first world war the entire world was a unipolar world if you remember before 1914 when the first world war started different empires were fighting with each other the western european countries like the dutch britain french were ruling different parts of the world by forming colonies which were also referred to as colonial rule similarly there was the russian empire then prussian empire in germany most part of the middle east was under the ottoman empire so all these empires had their own territory where they exercised military cultural and economic power they also used to expand their territory to gain more and more influence and this continued till second world war this is what we refer to as a unipolar world the second world war ended in 1945 after 1947 the cold war started it was a period of ideological and geopolitical tension between the united states and the soviet union in other words the entire world became a bipolar world you could only support the ussr or the united states these two were the only major powers so this continued till 1991 when the soviet union collapsed and since then the world became a multipolar world after 1991 india also opened its market to the outside world through the lpg reforms and today as we know there are multiple superpowers you have the 5v2 countries united states uk france china russia then you have germany saudi arabia japan south korea australia and then there are emerging superpowers like argentina india you will notice all these countries exercise their influence in some form or the other that is how we come to this conclusion that there has been a dramatic change in world politics and the balance of power it has moved from the bipolar world to a multipolar world when it comes to india on the surface or at face value it has always adopted the policy of non-alignment in other words india adopted the middle part because we knew that the moment we supported one country we would automatically become the enemy of the opposite country so to avoid such kind of political disadvantages at international level india thought of maintaining the middle path as i've said this policy was just to show to the world in reality you have to take a side when it comes to buying weapons ammunition and other military equipment you will have to take a side as to whom to buy from the moment you decide your client the world is going to tag you irrespective of what you say so like that india the surface or at the face value followed the policy of non-alignment but it very much maintained its close relations with the soviet union which later became russia the big aircrafts sukhoi s 400 missiles joint cooperation of brahmos missiles many submarines etc came from joint cooperation with russia since 1950 india is the world's biggest arms importer till the late 90s russia was india's first choice now as we know india imports from many countries including the united states so that is how today when you hear india supporting palestine at the united nations it is purely because of historical reasons that is the right context of understanding india's statement now let's try to understand the israeli-palestinian conflict i will try to explain everything in a simple way so that you have a clear picture and i hope i will be able to give you a great amount of clarity first let me show you the map of israel and palestine this is the west bank territory you must be wondering in israel it is on the eastern side then why is it named as west bank well west bank used to be part of jordan's territory and if you see it from jordan's side it lies on the western side that is why it is named as west bank and by the way majority of the population of jordan is palestinians jordan conquered the west bank territory in 1948 during the 1948 arab israeli war but after that israeli took it back if you want to understand the jewish history i have made a separate video on it i'll put the link of that video in description if you are interested please watch it if you look at the history it goes around 2000 years back but if you just want to understand the israeli-palestinian conflict it began only after 1900. the first world war started in 1914 during that time palestine was under the control of the ottoman empire the first world war was fought between the allied powers and the central powers during the first world war the british openly promised the jewish community through balfour declaration of 1917 to give them a homeland in palestine in return the british wanted jewish support against the central power and ottoman empire see you have to understand one thing jews lived in palestine since ages their numbers were small but they lived in palestine and jerusalem since ages so don't think that it is because of british jews ended up in palestine palestine and jerusalem were the place of residence within the jewish people's hearts since ages the british only made a deal with the jews to give them recognition in return of their support during the war as we all know the central powers lost in the first world war in europe the prussian empire lost and in the middle east the ottoman empire disintegrated and was partitioned after its defeat after the end of the world war one the map of the middle east was redrawn and divided up between the european powers mainly between france and britain palestine and jordan territory came under the british control after the end of the first world war all ottoman control territories eventually became fully independent states except palestine britain was still controlling palestine and on the other hand british also had to give a separate homeland to the jewish people which they had promised as for the balfour declaration of 1917. from 1922 till 1947 britain allowed large-scale jewish migration in palestine mainly from eastern europe and other parts of mediterranean and western europe millions of jewish people migrated to palestine in a span of 10 to 15 years obviously the arabs living in palestine did not like this large-scale immigration of jews palestinian arabs started protesting against the british and were demanding independence in 1937. situation turned violent in late 1920s palestine was infested with terrorism and violence jews and muslims developed strong hatred towards each other then world war ii started in 1939. hitler killed many jews in nazi germany concentration camps after coming to power in 1933 which is also referred to as the period of holocaust as a result of that many jews from eastern europe migrated to british palestine so obviously jewish population increased tremendously till 1945. even then it wasn't more than the arab palestinians british tried different formulas to resolve jews and arab conflict but nothing worked then in 1947 the british handed over the palestinian problem to the united nations after looking at alternatives the united nations proposed the partitioning of british palestine into two independent states one was for the palestinian arabs and the other was the jewish state since jerusalem was the holy site of three religion united nations decided to bring jerusalem under its own control and made it a special international zone the jews accepted this plan and declared independence of israel on 14th may 1948 however the arabs were against it they saw the united nations partitioning of palestine as an attempt to spread western countries influence in the middle east that means till 1948 when the united nation partitioned palestine and gave a separate state to the israelis the map of israel looked like this and by the way the point to be noted is that israel declared itself as a full-fledged country by accepting the united nations plan and they did not create a palestinian state neither they accepted israel as a country that is why you will see names like west bank gaza strip you will not see it as palestine that means in 1948 the jews were happy with whatever land they had got as their homeland plus if you look at the map you will realize that the partitioning of british palestine was done in such a way that in 1948 if a palestine had to travel from west bank to gaza strip or from west bank to acre they had to obtain an israeli permit and that made the arabs angry so overall the united nations partitioned palestine into an area of jewish land three arab areas and jerusalem under international control now what the arabs did was immediately next day that is on 15th may 1948 the day after israeli independence arab forces from egypt jordan iraq syria saudi arabia north yemen and lebanon formed the arab league and had put together the arab liberation army full of volunteers to fight against the jews they surrounded israel from all three sides and started attacking if you look at the emblem of the arab liberation army you can judge for yourself how much hatred the arab world had against the jews in return israel started giving military training to its population and even sent their agents to europe to retrieve world war ii stocks and signed armed contracts anyhow this gave rise to the first arab-israeli war so this war went for almost one year and ended on 10th march 1949 by the end of this war israel dominated the war and won more territory this was the new map of israel after the 1949 war as you can see western part of jerusalem came under israel's control eastern part of gaza came under israel's control and the whole city of aker in north israel came under israel's control on the other hand jordan annexed and gained control of the west bank and egypt gained control of the gaza strip after the end of the war hundreds of thousands of palestinian arabs left and fled the israeli territory and moved into jordan lebanon syria and egypt on the other hand jewish communities who lived in many arab countries since ages were also forced to leave and they all took shelter in the israeli territory many jewish people especially the european jews were extremely happy to come back to their homeland and choose to settle there this kind of movement on the both side continued till 1967. in between in the year 1956 there was a second arab israeli war which is also referred to as the suez crisis or tripartite aggression britain france and israeli military attacked egypt on 29 october 1956 with the intention to acquire the senai peninsula and take over the swiss canal because the egyptian government had nationalized the swiss canal in july 1956 these countries realized the importance of swiss canal in maritime trade as you know swiss canal is the lifeline for all trade between the west and the east and they had concerns having it under the control of an arab country however there was a political pressure from the united states the soviet union and the united nations which led to the withdrawal of britain france and israel on 2nd june 1964 plo that is palestinian liberation organization was founded however it did not come into limelight until the end of third arab israeli war then in june 1967 the third arab israeli war took place it is also known as june war or six day war it was fought between the combined group of egypt jordan and syria against israel the nations of iraq saudi arabia kuwait algeria and others also contributed troops and arms to the arab forces in six days israel dominated the war and acquires whole of west bank territory from jordan golan heights from syria sinai peninsula and gaza strip from egypt when israeli forces occupied the sinai peninsula in 1967 in return egypt closed the swiss canal it was closed in 1975 that is for almost eight years in 1975 egypt and israel signed a disengagement accord the suez canal was reopened in june 1975 then a peace treaty was signed between egypt and israel in 1979 after which the senate peninsula was returned to egypt after acquiring west bank gaza strip and golan height israeli settlers begin to move into palestinian territories even the united nations condemned the israeli occupation but i would request you not to judge too early let's put a marker here and we will get back to this israeli occupation issue whether it is right or wrong in a while anyhow six years later in october 1973 egypt and syria launches a surprise attack on israel for recapturing their lost territories they attacked on the holiest day of jewish faith yom kippur this day is also referred to as jewish new year in fact there is a small tradition that the jews follow almost 2000 years ago when the jewish people were expelled and forced to leave from jerusalem after all king david conquered jerusalem and made it the capital of jewish kingdom his son solomon built the first holy temple about 40 years later so when the jewish were expelled from jerusalem 2000 years ago all the jewish communities who migrated to various parts of the world they used to take wine on this day and raise a toast while saying this phrase yerushalayim which means next year we will be together in jerusalem the jews have been following this tradition since 2000 years so you can imagine their love and integrity for their homeland anyhow that is why this war is also named as yom kippur war since it was a surprise attack egypt and syria crossed the cease-fire lines in the sinai and golan heights respectively since it was also the era of cold war soviet union supported the arab countries against israel looking at this the united states sends emergency supplies of 22 000 tons of weaponry to israel with the american help israeli army further continues to push its borders after ceasefire all the oil exporting arab countries decided to punish the united states and israel's allies by increasing the price of oil by 70 and decreasing production by 5 this caused the first oil crisis of 1973. as i've told you in the previous point in 1975 egypt and israel signed a disengagement accord and after that israel returned the sinai peninsula to egypt and some part of the golan heights to syria after the end of 1973 war israel still had control of the whole of west bank gaza strip and the remaining part of golan heights by 1980 israeli settlers occupied many streets in east jerusalem in 1987 the palestinian population rebels against israeli government situation got violent and the palestinians started belting stones at the israeli forces this was the beginning of the first intifada which is an arab term meaning uprising from here you will notice the rise of hamas it is the palestinian sunni islamic fundamentalist organization whose aim is to liberate palestine from the israeli occupation in 2007 hamas was designated as a terrorist organization by the united states canada european union israel and japan then from early 90s peace efforts between palestine and israel begins 1993 peace agreement was signed between israel and palestine which is also called the oslo accord as per this agreement there was a mutual recognition between the israeli government and plo israel actually acknowledged plo as a palestinian authority who will be running limited self-governance in the city of jericho in west bank and few parts of gaza strip but keep in mind the oslo accord however did not create a palestinian state this tells us that the israeli government were open to peace talks otherwise they wouldn't have acknowledged to plo as a palestinian authority with limited self-governance then in 1995 israeli-palestinian interim agreement on the west bank and gaza strip was signed on 28 september in washington dc as per the agreement the israeli civil administration will hand over the administration to the new palestinian interim government and the israeli military will withdraw by transferring powers and responsibility to plo yasir rafal leader of the plo arrived in gaza to take charge of the new palestinian authority in january 1996 the newly installed palestinian authority held its first democratic elections to choose an 88-member palestinian legislative council was elected president of the palestinian authority while all of this was going on israel was open to peace talks even acknowledged plo as a palestinian authority however there were disagreements on many issues such as the status of jerusalem and the return of palestinian refugees because you have to understand this israeli government were open to peaceful negotiation with the palestinians but at the same time the israelis were also suspicious of the palestinian future plans then in the year 2000 second uprising that is intifada occurs followed by many suicide bombings in 2002 israel begins the construction of wall in the west bank territory to protect its own people and country in the next four years the israeli government built a long wall and if you look at it from the israeli point of view it was necessary for their security as i have said suicide bombing was on the rise since 2000 and by the way while building the wall in few places the israeli government even encroached the palestinian territory which actually triggered anger within the palestinians this was even condemned by the international court of justice but then as you know israeli doesn't really care about anyone's point of view especially when it is about their own security that is why israel is at top among the most safest and secured country in the world by 2005 israeli government removed all the israeli settlers from the gaza strip in 2006 election hamas gained a large majority of seats in the palestinian parliament after coming into power hamas used to regularly fire rockets into israeli territories that is when in 2007 hamas was designated as a terrorist organization by the united states canada european union israel and japan by 2014 there were many clashes between gaza and israel in response israeli planes also caused destruction in gaza and that caused a humanitarian disaster in gaza on december 6 2017 president trump formally recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel and stated that the american embassy would be moved from tel aviv to jerusalem and that triggered more rebels among the palestinians today the situation is very complicated to understand this conflict you will have to use your brains to the highest degree you cannot get carried away by emotions and what you see on the media especially by cnn al jazeera and many other such outlets you have to know things in its actual context so let's see what exactly happened here are the three major issues that led to the 2021 israeli-palestinian conflict on 6th may palestinians protested in east jerusalem over an anticipated decision of the supreme court of israel on the eviction of six palestinian families in sheikh jarrah it is a neighborhood of east jerusalem the protest then escalated into violent confrontations between jewish and palestinian protesters then on 7th may israeli police raided the compound of the al-aqsa mosque which is the third holiest site in islam located on the temple mount the holy site in judaism the israeli police used tear gas rubber bullets and stun grenades in response to stone-throwing palestinians on 10th may hamas gave israel an ultimatum to withdraw security forces from the temple mount complex and sheikh jarrah on the same day hamas and palestinian islamic jihad began firing rockets into israel from the gaza strip so these are the three primary reasons that triggered the 2021 israeli-palestinian conflict the first one is property dispute in sheikh jara the second one is israeli police raid in al-aqsa mosque and the third one is hamas fighting rockets on israel now let's analyze these three situations one by one because if you watch some emotional video where they will show you palestinians getting hit by the israeli police that will not give you the whole picture that will just tell you one side of the story and to be very frank we all have to agree with this fact that the israelis don't give a [ __ ] about what anyone thinks of them they are not going to sit in front of the world and justify their actions to you and i they know what they are doing and even if nobody stands with them they are fine they haven't asked anyone's help and they have been facing violence since ages if you look at the history so this incident is nothing new for them apart from united states they really don't care about anyone because a lot of their military and technological market depends on the american market apart from united states i don't think is really scared about anyone's opinion anyhow let's analyze the first problem we all know that in 1948 israel was created united nation gave three areas to palestinians then a jewish state and jerusalem came under international zone then as we all know immediately next day on 15th may 1948 the arab forces attacked israel from all three sides after the end of the war israel gained control of the western side of jerusalem eastern part of gaza and the whole city of acre in north israel came under israel's control in 1956 28 palestinian families settled in sheikh jarrah neighborhood in east jerusalem these 28 families had an agreement with the jordanian ministry of construction and development and the un refugee agency unrwa to provide housing for them in sheikh jarrah neighborhood at that time west bank came under jordanian rule so basically the jordanian government gave the land and the united nations refugee agency paid the cost of constructing 28 homes for these 28 families now this process got interrupted in 1967 when the third arab israeli war took place which is also known as the june war or six day war and as we all know in six days israel dominated the war and acquires whole of west bank territory from jordan golan heights from syria sinai peninsula and gaza strip from egypt now you should understand this it was the arab countries who again started the war first with israel in 1967. the palestinian fidein attack meaning suicide attacks were carried out against israel that's what led to the 1967 june war but anyhow by the end of this war israel conquered the west bank territory that means the sheikh jarrah neighborhood in east jerusalem in 1967 came under israeli control today this 28 family has grown into 38 families and by the way you should not forget that these 28 families are refugees the israelis who are now settled in these homes their association has property papers which shows that they have purchased this land from the arabs in 1875 during the ottoman rule the ottoman land registry records showed the property was registered in the names of avraham ashkenazi and mair or back in response the palestinian refugee lawyers have questioned the authenticity of the document which was verified by an israeli court and they have stated that the document of jewish ownership was authentic on the other hand the palestinian refugees don't have any legal paper the jordanian government couldn't give them proper documents when the jordanian government was asked about this incident they simply said that the process was interrupted due to 1967 war so in simple terms the jewish people have papers and the palestinian refugee don't have any property papers and even in the 1860s and 1870s this neighborhood was a jewish neighborhood then of course as we all know the british occupied the palestine province being an indian we all know how good the british are in demarcating land borders even in india during the partition the british did not consciously do the partition of india that is why so many people died in india while migrating so what we can learn is that the british did not care about giving justice to the people whom they had ruled in fact they drew happiness from human and societal suffering so we all can collectively agree that the british did a lot of blunders but then oppressed people at that time didn't have that far-settedness they were simply happy for the fact that the britishers are going you get what i'm trying to say right so what you need to understand is that this neighborhood was initially a jewish neighborhood but after 1948 the west bank went to jordan as per the u.n partition on the other hand it was the arabs who were not satisfied that's how they collectively attacked one single country they underestimated israel in response israel conquered their land in 1967. after 1967 when israel controlled the west bank so obviously the original jewish owners will claim their land right after all they have their property papers and israel as a country did not steal west bank it acquired it by winning a war the jewish owners are also telling to the israeli supreme court that we have the papers and we have paid money and bought it even the israeli supreme court spoke a little in favor of the palestinian refugees the court said to the jewish owners look we get you have the papers but these palestinian refugees have been living here for a long time now so if you see israeli supreme court speaking a little in favor of the palestinians shows that there is some neutrality in the israeli justice system in fact the supreme court even said to the palestinians that look you can stay here but give the jewish owner some rent then you will get a protected tenant status that means nobody can move you out the palestinians said no to that also in other words the palestinians are saying that we will continue to stay here and we will not even pay you rent and even if we don't have documents it is our house this is a clear case of property law this is how you have to look at this problem and that's when you can come to a fair conclusion the western media has hidden all this information and have only showed what suits their narrative and they gave it a new cover story by calling it racial eviction whereas if you analyze it carefully there's nothing racist about it it is a simple case of land grabbing which comes under property law now to all my indian viewers by looking at this property dispute of sheikh jarrah does it remind you of any similar situation in india on 19 january 1990 lakhs of kashmiri pundits and sikh people were forced to leave kashmir many were killed massacred raped looted forcedly converted by islamic settlers hateful slogans were announced from the loudspeakers of mosques and issue fatwa saying kashmiri pundits were kafirs so many hindus and sikh left their own houses lands and properties what do you think happened to their properties they were grabbed and occupied by muslims who lived there for 30 years these kashmiri pundits have been living in refugee camps of jammu you will see many of these kashmiri pundits as roadside vendors near delhi heart south extension malvia nagar patel nagar and other parts of the city do you think kashmiri pandits will go back and claim their land and properties do you even think when they were running away from their houses they were carrying their property papers they very well know where their properties are they can very well locate it but do you think will they get their properties back so naturally today it will be difficult for these people to go back to kashmir and claim their land and property it can only happen with government support and i must also point out one thing after going through so much not even a single kashmiri pundit turned hostile or turned into an armed rebel so if you see palestine case is nothing in front of this the land dispute of sheikh jarrah is a simple property dispute of land grabbing the israeli owners have property documents they were kicked out after 1948 when west bank went to jordan and the palestinians who are currently reciting are refugees they don't have any document and they also don't want to pay any rent the jordanian government had placed them illegally in 1956 and i also feel if these palestinian people had cooperated with the israeli government or justice system then i'm sure they would have got something in return there are so many arrangements that the government can do provide low cost housing or reallocation etc you have to cooperate with this system if you consider yourself as israeli palestinians then you cannot always protest and throw stones at the authority our kashmiri pundits did not become hostile in fact if you see indian kashmiri muslims in kashmir throw stones at the indian army the kashmiri muslims get all the protection and benefits from indian taxpayers in return they throw stones at the indian armed forces so can you see the pattern you can get away doing that in india but that is israel that is not india you are not going to gain anything from the israeli system if you throw stones and fire bombs at them in return the system will be harsh on you so today the palestinians are accusing jewish original landowners of grabbing their properties in sheikh jarrah then those palestinians are no different even their ancestors have kicked the jewish out in 1948 and took over their land without papers and then neighboring arab countries collectively attacked on israel is that fair and if israel conquered the land after defeating its enemies in 1967 war then what's the matter israel is a democracy arabs are living in israel so why don't these palestinians support israeli nationhood if they can't do that then they can move to jordan which has majority of palestinians if you look at the total population of arabs living in west bank and gaza strip it is roughly around 20 lakhs the population of the state of israel is 90 lakhs so today if the arabs are in minority in israel if they don't fight with the israelis they can live happily but instead they are going against them and when israeli government retaliates they play victim card if suppose the palestinian arabs were in majority and jews were in minority do you think they would have left these jews they would have either killed them or converted them hamas who rules the gaza strip they're openly saying that we will throw israelis into the sea and will do ethnic cleansing so the day the palestinian population increases they will wipe out the jews israelis are aware of this they're not going to sit and wait for that day their policies are very straightforward if they see any threat they will deal with it in advance that is why i said to understand this conflict you need to use your brain to the highest degree you cannot get carried away by looking at few videos which are emotional and one-sided i'm not against the palestinians in fact the israeli supreme court has also spoken a little in favor of them and said just pay the rent and live peacefully but there is no gain in being hostile you have to look for a peaceful way land's properties it is an ancestral position grabbing it and illegally settling there is not the right thing to do we have good examples in india i am talking about kashmiri pundits they never complain of being unfair of course they feel sad but they have moved on and more importantly they never became hostile but in the case of israel the israeli government is not like the indian government so they have their own way of dealing things one should not even expect softness from israel when the entire arab nation have said we will push the jews into the sea kill all the jews so israelis have their own threat perception and they will deal with it accordingly as far as the first problem goes the property dispute in sheikh jarrah i hope now this problem is much clearer to you and i hope you have gained some perspective now let's look at the second problem israeli police raid in al-aqsa mosque there is a clear footage that shows the palestinian crowds first started throwing stones and other objects at the israeli police officers that is when in response the israeli police started clearing the crowd by throwing tear gas and stunt grenades not directly at the people on empty grounds obviously the israeli police is going to clear the crowd nobody expects any police in any country to be sweet and polite when there is a potential threat and those are rubber bullets they're not real bullets now this part of the footage was taken by one of the palestinian protester so this angle might be a little confusing as to who initiated this clash now have a look at this video which was released by the israeli police because israeli police were smart nowadays even the indian government is doing that which is a good thing government should have their own filming crew in this footage you will see that the palestinian protesters were throwing a patrol bomb at the israeli police and look at this scene the israeli police is pushing them away that is the standard procedure for any country's police here in india during covet lockdown days you take your bike out the police makes you dance like anything so clearing the cloud is a standard procedure here the palestinians attacked first just remember one thing the whole west bank and jerusalem is under israel's control but the administration is shared by both the israeli government and fatah which is a palestinian authority if you remember in the 90s the peace process began between israel and palestine in 1993 a peace agreement was signed between israel and palestine which is also called oslo accord as per that agreement there was a mutual recognition between the israeli government and plo so in a nutshell the creation of palestinian authority was actually agreed through mutual understanding by the israeli government so presently the west bank is partially governed by the palestinian authority called fatah however law and order remains in the hand of israeli government that is why you will see only israeli police on the other hand the gaza strip is currently under the control of hamas and i've already mentioned hamas is a designated terrorist organization however the palestinians staying in israel supports hamas and plo the palestinians consider these two organizations as their saviors so anyhow the palestinian protesters attack the israeli police and jews first with a fire bomb stone and other objects in response the israeli police evacuated the compound by lotti charge for restoring law and order you will also find another footage where the jewish people are dancing and jumping and raising their israeli flag while there is a fire going on at a distance so this kind of video makes you feel that how can the jewish people be happy when something is burning and many on the internet might even assume that maybe they are happy because the palestinians are being beaten by the police again that is not true if you look at this incident from the other side of the wall it is the palestinian protesters who have set the tree on fire they were protesting in response to the israeli supreme court's hearing on the sheikh jarrah property dispute case the supreme court hearing was only for six palestinian families just imagine for six palestinian families this much of violence was orchestrated so you see what is happening these things are being done just to gain attention of the international media and the third reason that led to the 2021 palestinian-israeli conflict was when hamas launched rockets into israel from gaza in response to the al-aqsa and sheikh jarrah incident they fired more than 4000 rockets at israel some hitting deeper inside israeli territory and with greater accuracy than ever before so you see how everything is being orchestrated six palestinian families property dispute then supreme court hearing al-aqsa mosque incident then palestinian protesters throw firebomb first and then burn the tree in response israeli police used water cannon rubber bullets stunned grenade to restore loin order even some police have got hurt just like the palestinians and finally hamas launched more than four thousand rockets from gaza onto israel in response when israel fired the palestinians in gaza started playing victim card up till now everything was in internal conflict the moment hamas fired rockets followed by hezbollah from south lebanon it all became an external enemy threat in simple words we call it war so you see how a small property dispute transformed into a large-scale war and you will be surprised when you hear people's logic such as so what hamas fired rockets israel has iron dome hamas knows its rockets are not going to cause any harm to any israeli it was just to teach israelis a lesson when you are firing more than 4000 rockets on a country the intention is to wipe out the entire human race of that country people need to understand this that the arabs are not able to digest the jewish israelis the israelis are giving the arabs doses of their own medicines if the arab muslims are aggressive israelis are showing firmness in return then you also must have heard in the news that the israelis have taken down al-jazeera and associated press building in gaza if you all don't know al-jazeera is qatar's satellite tv network that was launched in 1996 it is fully funded by the kathari royal family this tv network has collaborated with many terrorist organizations in the past like hezbollah taliban isis al-qaeda even in kashmir if you read their articles al-jazeera portrays the militants like jaish muhammad lashkar-e-taiba as freedom fighters even muslim countries like egypt saudi arabia uae and bahrain have kicked al-jazeera bureaus out of their countries and have accused qatar for sponsoring and harboring terrorist groups such as al-qaeda and isis the gulf cooperation council group has also officially published a list of 59 individuals and 12 institutions linked to terrorist organizations that received support from qatar and this has also been one of the reasons behind the qatar diplomatic crisis that started in 2017 and ended in 2021 anyhow so it is quite an open fact that qatar harbors as well as supports many terrorist organizations so naturally even the israelis are aware of it that is why they have shot down its building in gaza israel also attacked the home of hamas leader and i must also point out that before hitting any target the israeli military personnels have been giving advanced warnings to the civilian population that is the character of a moral army on the other hand you will see that hamas always hides behind civilians especially women and children always play a victim card when it gets counter hit from the israelis now if you pay attention hamas controls gaza and it is a palestinian sunni radical islamic group on the other hand hezbollah is a lebanese shia radical islamic group even hezbollah has fired rockets from southern lebanon towards israel the hezbollah terror group has also dug a network of tunnels hundreds of kilometers long from beiru to southern lebanon for infiltrating hezbollah terrorist in northern israel anyways so hamas is a palestinian sunni radical islamic group and hezbollah is a lebanese shia radical islamic group that means hezbollah is supported by iran because iran is the only muslim country which has large population of shias and we also know iran is a nuclear state now what is surprising to see is that since childhood we have heard that the sunnis and shias don't get along well with each other they have sectarian divides from the last 1400 years then within sunnis they have mukhalidan gaya mukhilit under mukhalid they have four categories in that one category is hanafi even under hanafi they have devi under dev bandi they have two more hayati and mamathi so if you see these are deep fault lines within islam if one sits down and explores what is surprising for me in this israeli-palestinian conflict is that both sunni and shia radical groups are united against israel i also don't understand what is the relation between indian muslims and palestine what is the relation between pakistan muslim and palestine what is the relation between iran shia muslims and sunni palestinians nobody is asking these questions these are very important questions just go and look up who is the leader of hezbollah it is hasan nasrallah he is a lebanese shia muslim he is not even iranian however since he is the leader of hezbollah then his allegiance has to be towards iranian supreme leader ali khamenei now if you look at which are those islamic radical organizations that are fighting against israel they are hamas which is sunni plo that is sunni hezbollah it is shia and other islamic jihadi organizations that means there is no sectarian divide among these radical terror outfits everyone is united and cooperating in this conflict against israel you must have even heard that the taliban is cooperating with iran these days so it is quite interesting to see this cooperation so what you have to realize is that at the back end these organizations have met sat together and have done a great deal of negotiations to achieve the ultimate goal of re-establishing a super-islamic state once that is achieved then they will fight among themselves and sort it out there's an old arab saying i against my brother i and my brother against my cousin i my brother and my cousin against the world so this kind of sunnisha reunion is always carried out by poor people in the case of kashmir we have seen all the militants are young people who belong to poor socio-economic backgrounds similarly these poor israeli-palestinians are also being used by these radical islamic organizations for continuing their agenda and it is working you will find that an average israeli palestinian hates jews and they are also teaching the same to their children and those innocent children when they grow up they will grow up with this mindset again i will point out the kashmiri pundits it's been 30 years not even a single kashmiri pundit or their children have picked up any arms and there are many more such examples in the world so one has to be aware of all these things israelis are aware of these temporary agreements between various radical islamic organizations and how they are brainwashing innocent people israelis are vocal about it as well as fighting against it that is why most of the arab nations don't like israel so that's it then this was everything that you had to know about the israeli-palestinian conflict i hope you found this video informative thank you for watching it, in this video we are going to learn why india supports palestine i will also briefly tell you what happened post 1948 that is after the creation of israeli state then we will also learn what were the main reasons that triggered the recent israeli-palestinian conflict and in the end i'll end this video on few comments about middle eastern ethno-religion politics alright then without any further ado let's begin let me begin with a small realistic life philosophy which says what you see on the surface is not what you will find under though india israel recently you must have heard the statement of tien tirumurti who is the indian representative at the united nation he said india strongly supports the palestinian cause if you notice there's a word called reaffirmed it means confirming the validity of something previously established that means india's support to palestine is part of india's old foreign policy that began during the neruvian era as you all know that jawaharlal nehru was the first prime minister of india after 1947 the indian economy was in a very poor state india's development strategy began on a socialistic approach under the leadership of first prime minister jawaharlal nehru in fact the concept of 5-year plan was first implemented in the soviet union in 1928 by joseph stalin jawaharlal nehru was inspired by stalin's plan if you know the full form of ussr it is the union of soviet socialist republics officially the ussr was a federal socialist state nehru was inspired from it and that is how after independence india's development strategy began on a socialistic approach so after 1947 the indian national congress made india follow largely whatever the soviet union did and soviet union used to support palestine likewise india also started supporting palestine in simple words whatever soviet union did india also very much followed that if i have to summarize the last hundred years in terms of distribution of power then it is something like this before the first world war the entire world was a unipolar world if you remember before 1914 when the first world war started different empires were fighting with each other the western european countries like the dutch britain french were ruling different parts of the world by forming colonies which were also referred to as colonial rule similarly there was the russian empire then prussian empire in germany most part of the middle east was under the ottoman empire so all these empires had their own territory where they exercised military cultural and economic power they also used to expand their territory to gain more and more influence and this continued till second world war this is what we refer to as a unipolar world the second world war ended in 1945 after 1947 the cold war started it was a period of ideological and geopolitical tension between the united states and the soviet union in other words the entire world became a bipolar world you could only support the ussr or the united states these two were the only major powers so this continued till 1991 when the soviet union collapsed and since then the world became a multipolar world after 1991 india also opened its market to the outside world through the lpg reforms and today as we know there are multiple superpowers you have the 5v2 countries united states uk france china russia then you have germany saudi arabia japan south korea australia and then there are emerging superpowers like argentina india you will notice all these countries exercise their influence in some form or the other that is how we come to this conclusion that there has been a dramatic change in world politics and the balance of power it has moved from the bipolar world to a multipolar world when it comes to india on the surface or at face value it has always adopted the policy of non-alignment in other words india adopted the middle part because we knew that the moment we supported one country we would automatically become the enemy of the opposite country so to avoid such kind of political disadvantages at international level india thought of maintaining the middle path as i've said this policy was just to show to the world in reality you have to take a side when it comes to buying weapons ammunition and other military equipment you will have to take a side as to whom to buy from the moment you decide your client the world is going to tag you irrespective of what you say so like that india the surface or at the face value followed the policy of non-alignment but it very much maintained its close relations with the soviet union which later became russia the big aircrafts sukhoi s 400 missiles joint cooperation of brahmos missiles many submarines etc came from joint cooperation with russia since 1950 india is the world's biggest arms importer till the late 90s russia was india's first choice now as we know india imports from many countries including the united states so that is how today when you hear india supporting palestine at the united nations it is purely because of historical reasons that is the right context of understanding india's statement now let's try to understand the israeli-palestinian conflict i will try to explain everything in a simple way so that you have a clear picture and i hope i will be able to give you a great amount of clarity first let me show you the map of israel and palestine this is the west bank territory you must be wondering in israel it is on the eastern side then why is it named as west bank well west bank used to be part of jordan's territory and if you see it from jordan's side it lies on the western side that is why it is named as west bank and by the way majority of the population of jordan is palestinians jordan conquered the west bank territory in 1948 during the 1948 arab israeli war but after that israeli took it back if you want to understand the jewish history i have made a separate video on it i'll put the link of that video in description if you are interested please watch it if you look at the history it goes around 2000 years back but if you just want to understand the israeli-palestinian conflict it began only after 1900. the first world war started in 1914 during that time palestine was under the control of the ottoman empire the first world war was fought between the allied powers and the central powers during the first world war the british openly promised the jewish community through balfour declaration of 1917 to give them a homeland in palestine in return the british wanted jewish support against the central power and ottoman empire see you have to understand one thing jews lived in palestine since ages their numbers were small but they lived in palestine and jerusalem since ages so don't think that it is because of british jews ended up in palestine palestine and jerusalem were the place of residence within the jewish people's hearts since ages the british only made a deal with the jews to give them recognition in return of their support during the war as we all know the central powers lost in the first world war in europe the prussian empire lost and in the middle east the ottoman empire disintegrated and was partitioned after its defeat after the end of the world war one the map of the middle east was redrawn and divided up between the european powers mainly between france and britain palestine and jordan territory came under the british control after the end of the first world war all ottoman control territories eventually became fully independent states except palestine britain was still controlling palestine and on the other hand british also had to give a separate homeland to the jewish people which they had promised as for the balfour declaration of 1917. from 1922 till 1947 britain allowed large-scale jewish migration in palestine mainly from eastern europe and other parts of mediterranean and western europe millions of jewish people migrated to palestine in a span of 10 to 15 years obviously the arabs living in palestine did not like this large-scale immigration of jews palestinian arabs started protesting against the british and were demanding independence in 1937. situation turned violent in late 1920s palestine was infested with terrorism and violence jews and muslims developed strong hatred towards each other then world war ii started in 1939. hitler killed many jews in nazi germany concentration camps after coming to power in 1933 which is also referred to as the period of holocaust as a result of that many jews from eastern europe migrated to british palestine so obviously jewish population increased tremendously till 1945. even then it wasn't more than the arab palestinians british tried different formulas to resolve jews and arab conflict but nothing worked then in 1947 the british handed over the palestinian problem to the united nations after looking at alternatives the united nations proposed the partitioning of british palestine into two independent states one was for the palestinian arabs and the other was the jewish state since jerusalem was the holy site of three religion united nations decided to bring jerusalem under its own control and made it a special international zone the jews accepted this plan and declared independence of israel on 14th may 1948 however the arabs were against it they saw the united nations partitioning of palestine as an attempt to spread western countries influence in the middle east that means till 1948 when the united nation partitioned palestine and gave a separate state to the israelis the map of israel looked like this and by the way the point to be noted is that israel declared itself as a full-fledged country by accepting the united nations plan and they did not create a palestinian state neither they accepted israel as a country that is why you will see names like west bank gaza strip you will not see it as palestine that means in 1948 the jews were happy with whatever land they had got as their homeland plus if you look at the map you will realize that the partitioning of british palestine was done in such a way that in 1948 if a palestine had to travel from west bank to gaza strip or from west bank to acre they had to obtain an israeli permit and that made the arabs angry so overall the united nations partitioned palestine into an area of jewish land three arab areas and jerusalem under international control now what the arabs did was immediately next day that is on 15th may 1948 the day after israeli independence arab forces from egypt jordan iraq syria saudi arabia north yemen and lebanon formed the arab league and had put together the arab liberation army full of volunteers to fight against the jews they surrounded israel from all three sides and started attacking if you look at the emblem of the arab liberation army you can judge for yourself how much hatred the arab world had against the jews in return israel started giving military training to its population and even sent their agents to europe to retrieve world war ii stocks and signed armed contracts anyhow this gave rise to the first arab-israeli war so this war went for almost one year and ended on 10th march 1949 by the end of this war israel dominated the war and won more territory this was the new map of israel after the 1949 war as you can see western part of jerusalem came under israel's control eastern part of gaza came under israel's control and the whole city of aker in north israel came under israel's control on the other hand jordan annexed and gained control of the west bank and egypt gained control of the gaza strip after the end of the war hundreds of thousands of palestinian arabs left and fled the israeli territory and moved into jordan lebanon syria and egypt on the other hand jewish communities who lived in many arab countries since ages were also forced to leave and they all took shelter in the israeli territory many jewish people especially the european jews were extremely happy to come back to their homeland and choose to settle there this kind of movement on the both side continued till 1967. in between in the year 1956 there was a second arab israeli war which is also referred to as the suez crisis or tripartite aggression britain france and israeli military attacked egypt on 29 october 1956 with the intention to acquire the senai peninsula and take over the swiss canal because the egyptian government had nationalized the swiss canal in july 1956 these countries realized the importance of swiss canal in maritime trade as you know swiss canal is the lifeline for all trade between the west and the east and they had concerns having it under the control of an arab country however there was a political pressure from the united states the soviet union and the united nations which led to the withdrawal of britain france and israel on 2nd june 1964 plo that is palestinian liberation organization was founded however it did not come into limelight until the end of third arab israeli war then in june 1967 the third arab israeli war took place it is also known as june war or six day war it was fought between the combined group of egypt jordan and syria against israel the nations of iraq saudi arabia kuwait algeria and others also contributed troops and arms to the arab forces in six days israel dominated the war and acquires whole of west bank territory from jordan golan heights from syria sinai peninsula and gaza strip from egypt when israeli forces occupied the sinai peninsula in 1967 in return egypt closed the swiss canal it was closed in 1975 that is for almost eight years in 1975 egypt and israel signed a disengagement accord the suez canal was reopened in june 1975 then a peace treaty was signed between egypt and israel in 1979 after which the senate peninsula was returned to egypt after acquiring west bank gaza strip and golan height israeli settlers begin to move into palestinian territories even the united nations condemned the israeli occupation but i would request you not to judge too early let's put a marker here and we will get back to this israeli occupation issue whether it is right or wrong in a while anyhow six years later in october 1973 egypt and syria launches a surprise attack on israel for recapturing their lost territories they attacked on the holiest day of jewish faith yom kippur this day is also referred to as jewish new year in fact there is a small tradition that the jews follow almost 2000 years ago when the jewish people were expelled and forced to leave from jerusalem after all king david conquered jerusalem and made it the capital of jewish kingdom his son solomon built the first holy temple about 40 years later so when the jewish were expelled from jerusalem 2000 years ago all the jewish communities who migrated to various parts of the world they used to take wine on this day and raise a toast while saying this phrase yerushalayim which means next year we will be together in jerusalem the jews have been following this tradition since 2000 years so you can imagine their love and integrity for their homeland anyhow that is why this war is also named as yom kippur war since it was a surprise attack egypt and syria crossed the cease-fire lines in the sinai and golan heights respectively since it was also the era of cold war soviet union supported the arab countries against israel looking at this the united states sends emergency supplies of 22 000 tons of weaponry to israel with the american help israeli army further continues to push its borders after ceasefire all the oil exporting arab countries decided to punish the united states and israel's allies by increasing the price of oil by 70 and decreasing production by 5 this caused the first oil crisis of 1973. as i've told you in the previous point in 1975 egypt and israel signed a disengagement accord and after that israel returned the sinai peninsula to egypt and some part of the golan heights to syria after the end of 1973 war israel still had control of the whole of west bank gaza strip and the remaining part of golan heights by 1980 israeli settlers occupied many streets in east jerusalem in 1987 the palestinian population rebels against israeli government situation got violent and the palestinians started belting stones at the israeli forces this was the beginning of the first intifada which is an arab term meaning uprising from here you will notice the rise of hamas it is the palestinian sunni islamic fundamentalist organization whose aim is to liberate palestine from the israeli occupation in 2007 hamas was designated as a terrorist organization by the united states canada european union israel and japan then from early 90s peace efforts between palestine and israel begins 1993 peace agreement was signed between israel and palestine which is also called the oslo accord as per this agreement there was a mutual recognition between the israeli government and plo israel actually acknowledged plo as a palestinian authority who will be running limited self-governance in the city of jericho in west bank and few parts of gaza strip but keep in mind the oslo accord however did not create a palestinian state this tells us that the israeli government were open to peace talks otherwise they wouldn't have acknowledged to plo as a palestinian authority with limited self-governance then in 1995 israeli-palestinian interim agreement on the west bank and gaza strip was signed on 28 september in washington dc as per the agreement the israeli civil administration will hand over the administration to the new palestinian interim government and the israeli military will withdraw by transferring powers and responsibility to plo yasir rafal leader of the plo arrived in gaza to take charge of the new palestinian authority in january 1996 the newly installed palestinian authority held its first democratic elections to choose an 88-member palestinian legislative council was elected president of the palestinian authority while all of this was going on israel was open to peace talks even acknowledged plo as a palestinian authority however there were disagreements on many issues such as the status of jerusalem and the return of palestinian refugees because you have to understand this israeli government were open to peaceful negotiation with the palestinians but at the same time the israelis were also suspicious of the palestinian future plans then in the year 2000 second uprising that is intifada occurs followed by many suicide bombings in 2002 israel begins the construction of wall in the west bank territory to protect its own people and country in the next four years the israeli government built a long wall and if you look at it from the israeli point of view it was necessary for their security as i have said suicide bombing was on the rise since 2000 and by the way while building the wall in few places the israeli government even encroached the palestinian territory which actually triggered anger within the palestinians this was even condemned by the international court of justice but then as you know israeli doesn't really care about anyone's point of view especially when it is about their own security that is why israel is at top among the most safest and secured country in the world by 2005 israeli government removed all the israeli settlers from the gaza strip in 2006 election hamas gained a large majority of seats in the palestinian parliament after coming into power hamas used to regularly fire rockets into israeli territories that is when in 2007 hamas was designated as a terrorist organization by the united states canada european union israel and japan by 2014 there were many clashes between gaza and israel in response israeli planes also caused destruction in gaza and that caused a humanitarian disaster in gaza on december 6 2017 president trump formally recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel and stated that the american embassy would be moved from tel aviv to jerusalem and that triggered more rebels among the palestinians today the situation is very complicated to understand this conflict you will have to use your brains to the highest degree you cannot get carried away by emotions and what you see on the media especially by cnn al jazeera and many other such outlets you have to know things in its actual context so let's see what exactly happened here are the three major issues that led to the 2021 israeli-palestinian conflict on 6th may palestinians protested in east jerusalem over an anticipated decision of the supreme court of israel on the eviction of six palestinian families in sheikh jarrah it is a neighborhood of east jerusalem the protest then escalated into violent confrontations between jewish and palestinian protesters then on 7th may israeli police raided the compound of the al-aqsa mosque which is the third holiest site in islam located on the temple mount the holy site in judaism the israeli police used tear gas rubber bullets and stun grenades in response to stone-throwing palestinians on 10th may hamas gave israel an ultimatum to withdraw security forces from the temple mount complex and sheikh jarrah on the same day hamas and palestinian islamic jihad began firing rockets into israel from the gaza strip so these are the three primary reasons that triggered the 2021 israeli-palestinian conflict the first one is property dispute in sheikh jara the second one is israeli police raid in al-aqsa mosque and the third one is hamas fighting rockets on israel now let's analyze these three situations one by one because if you watch some emotional video where they will show you palestinians getting hit by the israeli police that will not give you the whole picture that will just tell you one side of the story and to be very frank we all have to agree with this fact that the israelis don't give a [ __ ] about what anyone thinks of them they are not going to sit in front of the world and justify their actions to you and i they know what they are doing and even if nobody stands with them they are fine they haven't asked anyone's help and they have been facing violence since ages if you look at the history so this incident is nothing new for them apart from united states they really don't care about anyone because a lot of their military and technological market depends on the american market apart from united states i don't think is really scared about anyone's opinion anyhow let's analyze the first problem we all know that in 1948 israel was created united nation gave three areas to palestinians then a jewish state and jerusalem came under international zone then as we all know immediately next day on 15th may 1948 the arab forces attacked israel from all three sides after the end of the war israel gained control of the western side of jerusalem eastern part of gaza and the whole city of acre in north israel came under israel's control in 1956 28 palestinian families settled in sheikh jarrah neighborhood in east jerusalem these 28 families had an agreement with the jordanian ministry of construction and development and the un refugee agency unrwa to provide housing for them in sheikh jarrah neighborhood at that time west bank came under jordanian rule so basically the jordanian government gave the land and the united nations refugee agency paid the cost of constructing 28 homes for these 28 families now this process got interrupted in 1967 when the third arab israeli war took place which is also known as the june war or six day war and as we all know in six days israel dominated the war and acquires whole of west bank territory from jordan golan heights from syria sinai peninsula and gaza strip from egypt now you should understand this it was the arab countries who again started the war first with israel in 1967. the palestinian fidein attack meaning suicide attacks were carried out against israel that's what led to the 1967 june war but anyhow by the end of this war israel conquered the west bank territory that means the sheikh jarrah neighborhood in east jerusalem in 1967 came under israeli control today this 28 family has grown into 38 families and by the way you should not forget that these 28 families are refugees the israelis who are now settled in these homes their association has property papers which shows that they have purchased this land from the arabs in 1875 during the ottoman rule the ottoman land registry records showed the property was registered in the names of avraham ashkenazi and mair or back in response the palestinian refugee lawyers have questioned the authenticity of the document which was verified by an israeli court and they have stated that the document of jewish ownership was authentic on the other hand the palestinian refugees don't have any legal paper the jordanian government couldn't give them proper documents when the jordanian government was asked about this incident they simply said that the process was interrupted due to 1967 war so in simple terms the jewish people have papers and the palestinian refugee don't have any property papers and even in the 1860s and 1870s this neighborhood was a jewish neighborhood then of course as we all know the british occupied the palestine province being an indian we all know how good the british are in demarcating land borders even in india during the partition the british did not consciously do the partition of india that is why so many people died in india while migrating so what we can learn is that the british did not care about giving justice to the people whom they had ruled in fact they drew happiness from human and societal suffering so we all can collectively agree that the british did a lot of blunders but then oppressed people at that time didn't have that far-settedness they were simply happy for the fact that the britishers are going you get what i'm trying to say right so what you need to understand is that this neighborhood was initially a jewish neighborhood but after 1948 the west bank went to jordan as per the u.n partition on the other hand it was the arabs who were not satisfied that's how they collectively attacked one single country they underestimated israel in response israel conquered their land in 1967. after 1967 when israel controlled the west bank so obviously the original jewish owners will claim their land right after all they have their property papers and israel as a country did not steal west bank it acquired it by winning a war the jewish owners are also telling to the israeli supreme court that we have the papers and we have paid money and bought it even the israeli supreme court spoke a little in favor of the palestinian refugees the court said to the jewish owners look we get you have the papers but these palestinian refugees have been living here for a long time now so if you see israeli supreme court speaking a little in favor of the palestinians shows that there is some neutrality in the israeli justice system in fact the supreme court even said to the palestinians that look you can stay here but give the jewish owner some rent then you will get a protected tenant status that means nobody can move you out the palestinians said no to that also in other words the palestinians are saying that we will continue to stay here and we will not even pay you rent and even if we don't have documents it is our house this is a clear case of property law this is how you have to look at this problem and that's when you can come to a fair conclusion the western media has hidden all this information and have only showed what suits their narrative and they gave it a new cover story by calling it racial eviction whereas if you analyze it carefully there's nothing racist about it it is a simple case of land grabbing which comes under property law now to all my indian viewers by looking at this property dispute of sheikh jarrah does it remind you of any similar situation in india on 19 january 1990 lakhs of kashmiri pundits and sikh people were forced to leave kashmir many were killed massacred raped looted forcedly converted by islamic settlers hateful slogans were announced from the loudspeakers of mosques and issue fatwa saying kashmiri pundits were kafirs so many hindus and sikh left their own houses lands and properties what do you think happened to their properties they were grabbed and occupied by muslims who lived there for 30 years these kashmiri pundits have been living in refugee camps of jammu you will see many of these kashmiri pundits as roadside vendors near delhi heart south extension malvia nagar patel nagar and other parts of the city do you think kashmiri pandits will go back and claim their land and properties do you even think when they were running away from their houses they were carrying their property papers they very well know where their properties are they can very well locate it but do you think will they get their properties back so naturally today it will be difficult for these people to go back to kashmir and claim their land and property it can only happen with government support and i must also point out one thing after going through so much not even a single kashmiri pundit turned hostile or turned into an armed rebel so if you see palestine case is nothing in front of this the land dispute of sheikh jarrah is a simple property dispute of land grabbing the israeli owners have property documents they were kicked out after 1948 when west bank went to jordan and the palestinians who are currently reciting are refugees they don't have any document and they also don't want to pay any rent the jordanian government had placed them illegally in 1956 and i also feel if these palestinian people had cooperated with the israeli government or justice system then i'm sure they would have got something in return there are so many arrangements that the government can do provide low cost housing or reallocation etc you have to cooperate with this system if you consider yourself as israeli palestinians then you cannot always protest and throw stones at the authority our kashmiri pundits did not become hostile in fact if you see indian kashmiri muslims in kashmir throw stones at the indian army the kashmiri muslims get all the protection and benefits from indian taxpayers in return they throw stones at the indian armed forces so can you see the pattern you can get away doing that in india but that is israel that is not india you are not going to gain anything from the israeli system if you throw stones and fire bombs at them in return the system will be harsh on you so today the palestinians are accusing jewish original landowners of grabbing their properties in sheikh jarrah then those palestinians are no different even their ancestors have kicked the jewish out in 1948 and took over their land without papers and then neighboring arab countries collectively attacked on israel is that fair and if israel conquered the land after defeating its enemies in 1967 war then what's the matter israel is a democracy arabs are living in israel so why don't these palestinians support israeli nationhood if they can't do that then they can move to jordan which has majority of palestinians if you look at the total population of arabs living in west bank and gaza strip it is roughly around 20 lakhs the population of the state of israel is 90 lakhs so today if the arabs are in minority in israel if they don't fight with the israelis they can live happily but instead they are going against them and when israeli government retaliates they play victim card if suppose the palestinian arabs were in majority and jews were in minority do you think they would have left these jews they would have either killed them or converted them hamas who rules the gaza strip they're openly saying that we will throw israelis into the sea and will do ethnic cleansing so the day the palestinian population increases they will wipe out the jews israelis are aware of this they're not going to sit and wait for that day their policies are very straightforward if they see any threat they will deal with it in advance that is why i said to understand this conflict you need to use your brain to the highest degree you cannot get carried away by looking at few videos which are emotional and one-sided i'm not against the palestinians in fact the israeli supreme court has also spoken a little in favor of them and said just pay the rent and live peacefully but there is no gain in being hostile you have to look for a peaceful way land's properties it is an ancestral position grabbing it and illegally settling there is not the right thing to do we have good examples in india i am talking about kashmiri pundits they never complain of being unfair of course they feel sad but they have moved on and more importantly they never became hostile but in the case of israel the israeli government is not like the indian government so they have their own way of dealing things one should not even expect softness from israel when the entire arab nation have said we will push the jews into the sea kill all the jews so israelis have their own threat perception and they will deal with it accordingly as far as the first problem goes the property dispute in sheikh jarrah i hope now this problem is much clearer to you and i hope you have gained some perspective now let's look at the second problem israeli police raid in al-aqsa mosque there is a clear footage that shows the palestinian crowds first started throwing stones and other objects at the israeli police officers that is when in response the israeli police started clearing the crowd by throwing tear gas and stunt grenades not directly at the people on empty grounds obviously the israeli police is going to clear the crowd nobody expects any police in any country to be sweet and polite when there is a potential threat and those are rubber bullets they're not real bullets now this part of the footage was taken by one of the palestinian protester so this angle might be a little confusing as to who initiated this clash now have a look at this video which was released by the israeli police because israeli police were smart nowadays even the indian government is doing that which is a good thing government should have their own filming crew in this footage you will see that the palestinian protesters were throwing a patrol bomb at the israeli police and look at this scene the israeli police is pushing them away that is the standard procedure for any country's police here in india during covet lockdown days you take your bike out the police makes you dance like anything so clearing the cloud is a standard procedure here the palestinians attacked first just remember one thing the whole west bank and jerusalem is under israel's control but the administration is shared by both the israeli government and fatah which is a palestinian authority if you remember in the 90s the peace process began between israel and palestine in 1993 a peace agreement was signed between israel and palestine which is also called oslo accord as per that agreement there was a mutual recognition between the israeli government and plo so in a nutshell the creation of palestinian authority was actually agreed through mutual understanding by the israeli government so presently the west bank is partially governed by the palestinian authority called fatah however law and order remains in the hand of israeli government that is why you will see only israeli police on the other hand the gaza strip is currently under the control of hamas and i've already mentioned hamas is a designated terrorist organization however the palestinians staying in israel supports hamas and plo the palestinians consider these two organizations as their saviors so anyhow the palestinian protesters attack the israeli police and jews first with a fire bomb stone and other objects in response the israeli police evacuated the compound by lotti charge for restoring law and order you will also find another footage where the jewish people are dancing and jumping and raising their israeli flag while there is a fire going on at a distance so this kind of video makes you feel that how can the jewish people be happy when something is burning and many on the internet might even assume that maybe they are happy because the palestinians are being beaten by the police again that is not true if you look at this incident from the other side of the wall it is the palestinian protesters who have set the tree on fire they were protesting in response to the israeli supreme court's hearing on the sheikh jarrah property dispute case the supreme court hearing was only for six palestinian families just imagine for six palestinian families this much of violence was orchestrated so you see what is happening these things are being done just to gain attention of the international media and the third reason that led to the 2021 palestinian-israeli conflict was when hamas launched rockets into israel from gaza in response to the al-aqsa and sheikh jarrah incident they fired more than 4000 rockets at israel some hitting deeper inside israeli territory and with greater accuracy than ever before so you see how everything is being orchestrated six palestinian families property dispute then supreme court hearing al-aqsa mosque incident then palestinian protesters throw firebomb first and then burn the tree in response israeli police used water cannon rubber bullets stunned grenade to restore loin order even some police have got hurt just like the palestinians and finally hamas launched more than four thousand rockets from gaza onto israel in response when israel fired the palestinians in gaza started playing victim card up till now everything was in internal conflict the moment hamas fired rockets followed by hezbollah from south lebanon it all became an external enemy threat in simple words we call it war so you see how a small property dispute transformed into a large-scale war and you will be surprised when you hear people's logic such as so what hamas fired rockets israel has iron dome hamas knows its rockets are not going to cause any harm to any israeli it was just to teach israelis a lesson when you are firing more than 4000 rockets on a country the intention is to wipe out the entire human race of that country people need to understand this that the arabs are not able to digest the jewish israelis the israelis are giving the arabs doses of their own medicines if the arab muslims are aggressive israelis are showing firmness in return then you also must have heard in the news that the israelis have taken down al-jazeera and associated press building in gaza if you all don't know al-jazeera is qatar's satellite tv network that was launched in 1996 it is fully funded by the kathari royal family this tv network has collaborated with many terrorist organizations in the past like hezbollah taliban isis al-qaeda even in kashmir if you read their articles al-jazeera portrays the militants like jaish muhammad lashkar-e-taiba as freedom fighters even muslim countries like egypt saudi arabia uae and bahrain have kicked al-jazeera bureaus out of their countries and have accused qatar for sponsoring and harboring terrorist groups such as al-qaeda and isis the gulf cooperation council group has also officially published a list of 59 individuals and 12 institutions linked to terrorist organizations that received support from qatar and this has also been one of the reasons behind the qatar diplomatic crisis that started in 2017 and ended in 2021 anyhow so it is quite an open fact that qatar harbors as well as supports many terrorist organizations so naturally even the israelis are aware of it that is why they have shot down its building in gaza israel also attacked the home of hamas leader and i must also point out that before hitting any target the israeli military personnels have been giving advanced warnings to the civilian population that is the character of a moral army on the other hand you will see that hamas always hides behind civilians especially women and children always play a victim card when it gets counter hit from the israelis now if you pay attention hamas controls gaza and it is a palestinian sunni radical islamic group on the other hand hezbollah is a lebanese shia radical islamic group even hezbollah has fired rockets from southern lebanon towards israel the hezbollah terror group has also dug a network of tunnels hundreds of kilometers long from beiru to southern lebanon for infiltrating hezbollah terrorist in northern israel anyways so hamas is a palestinian sunni radical islamic group and hezbollah is a lebanese shia radical islamic group that means hezbollah is supported by iran because iran is the only muslim country which has large population of shias and we also know iran is a nuclear state now what is surprising to see is that since childhood we have heard that the sunnis and shias don't get along well with each other they have sectarian divides from the last 1400 years then within sunnis they have mukhalidan gaya mukhilit under mukhalid they have four categories in that one category is hanafi even under hanafi they have devi under dev bandi they have two more hayati and mamathi so if you see these are deep fault lines within islam if one sits down and explores what is surprising for me in this israeli-palestinian conflict is that both sunni and shia radical groups are united against israel i also don't understand what is the relation between indian muslims and palestine what is the relation between pakistan muslim and palestine what is the relation between iran shia muslims and sunni palestinians nobody is asking these questions these are very important questions just go and look up who is the leader of hezbollah it is hasan nasrallah he is a lebanese shia muslim he is not even iranian however since he is the leader of hezbollah then his allegiance has to be towards iranian supreme leader ali khamenei now if you look at which are those islamic radical organizations that are fighting against israel they are hamas which is sunni plo that is sunni hezbollah it is shia and other islamic jihadi organizations that means there is no sectarian divide among these radical terror outfits everyone is united and cooperating in this conflict against israel you must have even heard that the taliban is cooperating with iran these days so it is quite interesting to see this cooperation so what you have to realize is that at the back end these organizations have met sat together and have done a great deal of negotiations to achieve the ultimate goal of re-establishing a super-islamic state once that is achieved then they will fight among themselves and sort it out there's an old arab saying i against my brother i and my brother against my cousin i my brother and my cousin against the world so this kind of sunnisha reunion is always carried out by poor people in the case of kashmir we have seen all the militants are young people who belong to poor socio-economic backgrounds similarly these poor israeli-palestinians are also being used by these radical islamic organizations for continuing their agenda and it is working you will find that an average israeli palestinian hates jews and they are also teaching the same to their children and those innocent children when they grow up they will grow up with this mindset again i will point out the kashmiri pundits it's been 30 years not even a single kashmiri pundit or their children have picked up any arms and there are many more such examples in the world so one has to be aware of all these things israelis are aware of these temporary agreements between various radical islamic organizations and how they are brainwashing innocent people israelis are vocal about it as well as fighting against it that is why most of the arab nations don't like israel so that's it then this was everything that you had to know about the israeli-palestinian conflict i hope you found this video informative thank you for watching it
37,zdq3NVtT6Nc," Gaza is only about 25 miles long and seven miles wide. But this small strip of land is one of the most fought over in history. It was an Egyptian base, a royal city for the Philistines and the place where the Hebrew hero, Samson, betrayed by Delilah, met his death. Since then, much blood has been spilled. The most recent contest for Gaza began at the end of World War Two, when persecuted Jews traveled to Israel from Europe looking for a new start After the horrors of the Holocaust. In 1947, the United Nations created a plan to split Palestine into two lands one for Jews and one for the Arab people. Backed by the U.S. President, Harry Truman. David Ben-Gurion, Israel's founder, proclaims the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. Egypt then attacked Israel through the Gaza Strip. Israel was victorious, but Gaza remained under the control of Egypt, and an influx of Palestinian refugees began. In 1967, war broke out between Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Syria in what became known as the Six-Day War. Israel seized the Gaza Strip and held it for 40 years. Israel pulled its forces out of Gaza in 2005. In 2006, Hamas, a group sworn to destroy Israel and listed by the United States, the European Union and others as a terrorist group, won a landslide victory in Palestinian legislative elections. Hamas was now in control of the territory. However, Israel's deal controls much of the areas access to and from the Gaza Strip. Since then, Israel and Hamas have been exchanging blows. Israel maintains that Hamas is a violent terror organization. Of Hamas says that they represent an oppressed people being victimized by the Jewish state. The international community continues to press for a cease in violence.

40,FH9uVw-d35c," you mat just to follow up on time referencing of the hospitals I mean of gaza's 33 hospital before that were you know fully oper operational before October 7th there are now three that are semi functional and so on it's creating a really horrific situation now we talk about the food and the starvation and so on but is there any way I don't have any idea but is there any way to actually make these hospitals more functional and able to care for more people especially children so the best way to achieve that goal which is very much a goal that we have would be to reach a deal for an immediate ceasefire that would last for at least 6 weeks and would allow foration in hostilities would allow for the delivery of humanitarian assistance would allow for people inside Gaza to move around both doctors and patients and those who just need to to to seek medical care um that would be the best route to reach that objective and it's one that we uh are are continuing to pursue so you know 6 weeks would probably be a nice riset for the people and for everybody involved but it's also uh presumes that the fighting will continue thereafter for whatever reason after the end of the six weeks especially you know in light of what you alluded to yesterday that you support Israel and its pursuit of the you know the defeat of Hamas and so on and what we see uh 150 150 days after this War Began we see that the fighting is still going Hamas is not defeated by the best analysis it has been degraded somewhat maybe 30% 20% whatever it is so conceivably this war can go on for another year so we have always said that we want to see this conflict end as soon as possible uh we want to get a uh temporary ceasefire to um alleviate the humanitarian situation and get the hostages home but it is our goal to to end the conflict completely and to end it as soon as possible and as you have heard me say before Hamas Bears a lot of responsibility for the conflict continuing to continuing to to U be waged Hamas could come forward and surrender they could come forward and swear off violence they could put their arms down and one of the things that we would very much try to pursue in the event of a humanitarian ceasefire would be the the demilitarization of Gaza and the demilitarization of of Hamas and we are something that we will consult with uh that we have been Consulting and will continue to consult Partners in the region about because um for all that for for all that Israel has done in this conflict and the and all it has done to um bring Hamas terrorist to Justice uh Hamas does bear a lot of responsibility for the conflict on ongoing so if we are able to get a ceasefire it is very much something that we will pursue I understand but you know you you're saying that you want Hamas to surrender that is I mean that that there really serious thinking that this is actually going to happen I mean considering that the Palestinians have been waging uh some sort of you know an armed struggle against Israel for the past 75 years I mean they take they go from beut to lanite to Jordan to places like this but it goes on in the West Bank and so on is there really expectation that the Palestinians will give up the notion of getting their rights or getting their rights in in you know in the absence of the world doing anything about granting them their rights you know that they have to do it on their own so we do not want the Palestinians to give up their rights in fact you have seen the secretary and the president uh pushing very hard for a two-state solution that would uh create an independent Palestinian State and would answer the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people but to this question about Hamas when you've seen 30,000 Palestinians killed why wouldn't they lay down their arms and stop that Bloodshed why wouldn't they lay down their arms and and stop the war if they truly care about the thousands and thousands of civilians who have been killed in a war that Hamas started so remember who started this war if that was in their real interest the well-being of the Palestinian people I'm hardpressed to answer why they wouldn't lay down their arms and pursue a demilitarization option when you have the United States and other countries in the region saying we are prepared to step forward and work on an legitimate political path forward for the Palestinian people not one that's brought about by terrorism not one that's brought about by violence but a legitimate political path that leads to an independent Palestinian State lastly I'm I'm sorry but just to to push this point a bit further the Palestinians basically said okay we lay down our arms we've done it at time and time again they recognized Israel they signed treaties and with them you know Hamas said they will abide by the I mean l not you knowas sign to the principl of the PLO but I'm saying that what we're saying is there has been a an effort that has failed I mean people look whether it's Hamas or somebody else they look at 30 years of efforts to to arrive at the resolution that the United States has signed to and in fact sponsored in 1993 H and it has gone nowhere we see the settlements expand we see that the occupation become more violent against the Palestinians people are more imprisoned and so on so if people continue to look at the past and only the past that has happened for decades and decades without uh being willing to sign on to a positive vision of the future we will never have a peaceful way out of this conflict not just the the current conflict in Gaza uh but an actual resolution to the long-standing uh conflict between Israel and Palestinian the problem with that Matt is that you have called for in every single conflict around the world there to be accountability for things that have happened in the past and now you're saying oh well just forget about it no that's not my point is there has to be at some point a Rec political reconciliation and so I think s's point was why would Hamas agree to lay down arms when we have seen grievance after grievance go on for decades and the point that we have made and you've heard this the the the secretary speak to this a number of times ultimately there are two paths there is you can continue down this path where we talk about what happened decades and decades ago and and uh try to address that with through violent activities or we can have a peaceful res peaceful resolution to this and of course you and I say of course there's a process for addressing legitimate grievances through that process but what I'm saying and the point that we have made is continuing to uh uh carry out violence as the solution to decades old grievances is a path is a path to continued conflict and a never ending cycle that does not Advance the interests of the pales talking about addressing legitimate grievances from the past right uh yes and my point is through violence will Just Lead You In This Never Ending cycle that we that the the region has been in for decades I mean because you said that why wouldn't Hamas look at the numbers of dead 30,000 and effectively surrender but that almost suggests or implies that the numbers killed um creates a political or military pressure on Hamas to do so but you've always said that you know any civilian death is unacceptable that's not my implication that's not my implication at all any civilian death is unacceptable you connected those two issues but a Hamas surrender um you know looking at the number it is not is is not the implication I don't think that's a fair reading of what I'm saying my every civilian death is unacceptable the point is that Hamas surrendering would end the conflict and would end the civilian casualties that have unfortunately happened since October 7th goad I'm sorry Jen so I just want to clarify the Israeli government has told you that if sinard was to purely surrender that would be sufficient to end the war um I I so I'm not going to get into our the conversations that we've had but obviously if Hamas surrendered and laid down its arms that would be an end to the conflict including Sinar that that he is the leader of of Hamas it's sufficient for them so I am not I I'm not going to talk speak on behalf of the Israeli government but obviously when you have one side of a conflict stop fighting and lay down its arms that brings about an end to the conflict"," you mat just to follow up on time referencing of the hospitals I mean of gaza's 33 hospital before that were

41,K5tcwIicICg," - You can't have this
conversation on CNN or Fox. You can't do it, right? Because if you are only talking about how the Israeli Defense
Forces are responsible for these brutal killings, or if you're only talking about what Hamas did on October 7th, and you don't talk about the
broader context, right, you are absolutely not understanding
what's happening in this war right now. - Today on Big Think, we're
gonna be talking to Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Eurasia Group and GZERO Media about
the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel. Ian, thank you so much
for joining us today. - It's great to be back with Big Think. - This region has been embroiled
in turmoil for thousands of years, so there's many historical factors we could discuss. But I would like to know
from your standpoint, is it more helpful to
focus on recent history to better understand this conflict? - Both the Jews and the
Palestinians have long, long running and legitimate claims to live on this territory. Palestinians, some 700,000 plus were kicked off these territories after 1948 post-Holocaust. The Jews had lived on these
territories for millennia, and a number of empires
have kicked them off. We can talk about that. There are people that are far
more expert on those histories than I am, but the reality
is that for the Jews and the Palestinians that are
fighting over this land today, they've been living there
for their lifetimes and, and so it's really not
about who has a right to live on the territory. It's rather that they need to find a way to live together in peace. And what has happened over
the past years is that everyone in the world
has basically given up on finding a peaceful solution because they've tried for
decades, it's too hard or because they're not interested; they have other things that
they would rather do. That's where we are today. The last time that the Americans who are not an honest broker
for peace in the region, the United States, a principle
ally in the entire Middle East is Israel. So you can't say, ""Oh, well,
you know, they're the ones that can broker peace between
Israel and the Palestinians, because they're equally trusted."" That's not true. But they do
have the dominant military presence in the region, and
they also have the dominant diplomatic capability on the region. So they've been the ones that have played the
most significant role. And the last time an
American senior diplomat was really invested on trying to
figure out a way to bring peace to this region was when
John Kerry was Secretary of State in the first couple of years of the Obama administration. And he did shuttle diplomacy
between the Israelis, the Palestinians, the Jordanians,
the Egyptians, I mean, all the time, for 18 months this was his top priority. He wanted a Nobel Peace
Prize for it. He failed. And after that, basically
the Americans gave up. It was the pivot to Asia. It was no longer focusing
as much on the Middle East. And then when the Russians
invade Ukraine, it's focusing on Europe too. But no one's spending real
time on the Palestinians, the Gulf States, who had
been providing so much money for humanitarian support for Palestinians living in the West Bank, and particularly Gaza, as well
as refugees in other places that they were saying
there could be no peace in the Middle East unless
the Palestinian-Israel issue is resolved. Well, it turned out they were willing to make peace with Israel. They're, they're willing to engage open diplomatic
relations, allow Jewish tourists to come to their country, trade and investment, technology
cooperation, security cooperation. But what about the Palestinians? Well, too hard to resolve, and Israel, and particularly this far-right, Netanyahu-led government has been
willing to not only expand illegally, the settlements
in the West Bank, reducing the territory that the
Palestinians can live on, and making it harder for them
to get to work, go to school, you know, have a possibility
for a viable future. But also, Netanyahu's
government was engaging more with Hamas in Gaza at the expense of the Palestinian authority, because they never wanted to
pursue a two-state solution. So they forgot about the Palestinians too. So when you look at
everyone around the world that was committed to the
Palestinians, finding a way to live viably on their territories, the answer is this has not
been a priority for anyone for a long, long time. And their own government
in the West Bank that recognizes Israel's right to
exist, as opposed to Hamas, which does not, they were corrupt. They were divided. They couldn't speak for
Palestinians in Gaza, and they were being weakened
by the Israeli government. So, I mean, this was a long introduction to talk about the history, but the point is that if
you are looking for people that are responsible, historically, for why we are in the
mess that we are in today, and it is an unholy mess, and I use that term very
literally, you know, you can look everywhere and you have people to blame that that is where we are today. - Thank you for that. I'm,
I'm curious, you know, to talk about some of the
domestic politics within Israel, because that's something that
I think has not been paid enough attention to and specifically the actions
of the Netanyahu government and the people who they are
partnering with as it relates to this conflict, but also just
internally inside of Israel. What does it look like in
terms of the partnerships and the dynamics that are happening there? What has been the lead up
to this conflict in terms of the internal politics with Israel, and how has that had an
effect on just the general relationship between Israel and the Palestinians
in the various places? - You know, Israel is a
very political society. The average Israeli citizen reads a lot about news and politics. If you go to a cafe in
Tel Aviv or in Jerusalem or Herzliya, you're gonna hear a lot of people talking about politics. It's also a very fragmented society. There are a lot of
different political parties. And, and in order to get a government
together in the Knesset, you can't govern by yourself because you'd never get a majority. You have to find a coalition
with other partners. And Netanyahu, who has,
you know, faced all sorts of internal corruption scandals and, and who's Likud party
has also been painted with a lot of those challenges. The only way he could form
a government this last time around was with a hard-right group. A party that specifically
has, you know, said some of the most horrible things about wanting Palestinians removed from
the West Bank, about wanting to take over their territories. In some ways, the hard-right partners of Netanyahu have been as unyielding and aggressive about the
Palestinians not having rights in the occupied territories as Hamas has been about the Jews not having the right to have an Israeli state. Now, that does not reflect the opinions of the Israeli people as a
whole, but it has meant that before the events of October 7th, the terrorist events against
the people of Israel, you had enormous domestic instability. That domestic instability
was the people of Israel revolting against Netanyahu, attempting to change a very strong,
independent judiciary of that country to basically
report to the executive and report to whoever was
in charge in the Knesset. And the reason for that,
more control for Netanyahu and his coalition, and the
ability to avoid getting charged and jailed for these corruption scandals and investigations that are ongoing. And, and for months, the news
in Israel had nothing to do with Hamas, had nothing to do with the Palestinians in Gaza. It instead was about a
potential constitutional crisis that was pending in Israel,
that Israel's legitimacy as a democracy in the Middle
East was under threat, not because of what they were
doing to the Palestinians, but because of what Netanyahu
was doing to the country, to the balance of power in Israel. So that was, they were taking
their eye off the ball. The other thing that happened
is the hard-right part of the Israeli government
was doing everything possible to expand their territorial
influence in the West Bank. And the Palestinians
living there were angry and there were a lot of clashes. There were violent reprisals. And the Israeli Defense Forces some of the best in the world, incredibly well-trained high
morale, while a lot of them had been sent to the West Bank and to the border zone inside
Israel proper in an effort to contain and respond to that violence. Where were they in Gaza?
Not worried about Gaza. Netanyahu was providing Hamas in Gaza with more resources, with
more money, with more ability to have work visas to
come on over into Israel. Why? Because they were
just focused on governance. According to Netanyahu, they
just wanted to rebuild Gaza 'cause he wanted a stronger Hamas to weaken the Palestinian authority. So what happened is you
took one of the world's best-trained, most
effective defense forces, intelligence forces, security
forces, border forces, and, and you had them focusing on everything but a terrorist organization
that was running Gaza with a people that had abysmal economic conditions, life
conditions, half of them without enough food to eat, 90% of them without access to clean water. And everyone is now talking about how Israel has a right to self-defense. They have a right to be able
to defend their borders. And that is absolutely true. But that right did not
begin after October 7th. That right existed before October 7th. And the Prime Minister of Israel and his hard-right government
failed the Israeli people. They did not defend their country, they didn't defend their borders. They weren't concerned with or focused on the real
threats that were right there just on the south of Israel,
that wanted to destroy everything that the Israeli
people have been building since 1948. So the Israeli people want Netanyahu out. They overwhelmingly blame him and his government for
the events of October 7th, consistently in polls taken inside Israel. In fact, one of the only things that the Middle Eastern
peoples can agree on in, in this conflict is that
the Israeli Prime Minister and his government need to go,
that they, that they are not fit for office either to govern Israel and defend Israel, or to engage and create peace with the Palestinians. - You know, it's interesting
to bring up the government of Israel and how people are perceiving their
actions in the lead up to, and even just in the response
of the October 7th attack, I'm curious, you know, to bring it to the surrounding nations and their relationship with Israel. And, you know, you
mentioned how the treatment of Palestinians has taking a back seat to sort of recent concerns. I'm, I'm curious if you
can paint a broader picture of just like what types of
relationships has been happening with, between Israel and other nations, other Arab
nations that surround them, and how the concerns of the Palestinians have just
not been the forefront of the discussions between those parties. - No, they, they have not. And to be fair, I mean, the fact that the Palestinians have not been diplomatically important to,
for example, the Gulf States or, or even to countries like Jordan and Egypt that have been more
willing to engage with Israel as the Palestinian plight has
become worse, there has been a lot of effort to bring
aid, humanitarian support in for the Palestinians and the Gulf states who are very wealthy, have been providing a lot of that. But when the Israeli government, after the events
of October 7th started engaging in widespread
bombardment across Gaza, which has led to thousands and thousands of casualties:
civilian casualties, children, almost 50% of the Gaza
population are children, right? I mean, this is now being
seen across the region, and it is impossible for any
government of the region, any Arab government of the
region to just sit and stand by and say, ""Okay, we don't care. We're still gonna work with Israel. The way we were working with
them."" Israel had benefited from being seen as an economic juggernaut, a security juggernaut, a technological juggernaut. And a lot of the countries
in the region wanted to work more closely with
Israel as a consequence of that. That's why you had the UAE and Bahrain and Morocco signing the
Abraham Accords, not just to normalize diplomatic relations, but also to dramatically expand trade and investment with Israel. That's why the Saudis were
improving their informal relations and were moving
towards normalization. Even though the Saudi population is going to be quite cautious and conservative on the
Palestinian issue, they say, ""No, the priority is we gotta find a way to work with Israel."" But once you have Israel in
response to these terrorist acts going after Hamas, and as they're doing so killing all of these Palestinian civilians, well then there's a freeze on
everything; then if you are, you know, Jordan, you
say, ""We can't work with, we can't engage with
Israel going forward."" If you're Turkey, Turkish
President Erdogan, who has said that Hamas is not a terrorist
organization, he has said that Hamas is a liberation movement, and he hasn't condemned the Hamas from the hostages that've taken from the 1,400 civilians that they killed. Not at all. So they've thrown out the Israeli diplomats
on the ground as well. And when that's happening
across the region and the Arab Street is
demonstrating in solidarity with the Palestinians, then
even if you have a number of wealthier Arab countries
that want to continue to work with Israel, they can't because
of the domestic pressure. And, and so the, the efforts that had made Israel the
strongest, geopolitically, that had had ever been,
since independence, suddenly are moving in a very different
direction, it's, it's hard for those countries to even
maintain present levels of engagement with Israel. And indeed, a lot of the progress that had been made could be lost. So it's very interesting. You have an environment where before the acts of October 7th, Israel was the most divided domestically because of the response to Netanyahu, but the strongest in the region. Then the events of October 7th happen, and suddenly Israel is enormously unified. Everyone is responding. You get a, a unity war cabinet because everyone says,
we must defeat Hamas. We must destroy these terrorists that have just threatened our homeland and have killed our children. Right? And, but the international
environment from Israel has suddenly become one of massive criticism and condemnation. And that is clearly true
in its immediate region. It is clearly true for
Iran, which continues along with Hamas to believe that, that the Jewish people in the state of Israel should be
replaced with Palestine. But that's also true
for all of the proxies of Iran across the region,
the Shia proxies in Yemen and in Iraq, in Syria. It's true across the global
South where we have governments that are outraged and coming after Israel, and even for the United States, which is by far the strongest ally
of Israel in the world. You have significant pressure, especially among young people, and especially among Democrats in Congress saying, ""We can no longer provide
the kind of support that we have historically
given what's happening presently on the ground."" So domestically in Israel,
much more cohesive and stronger and resilient; internationally,
much more fragmented and, and much more challenging for the Israelis going forward. - I'm curious, you know, to think about this situation in regards to what Hamas' motivation was for the attack. And so do you think that
there was a strategic goal of the Hamas attack on October 7th? And was this in a way,
setting a trap for Israel? And if so, was it successful? Was this outcome of
people turning the tide of opinion against Israel
internationally, part of a strategic goal for
Hamas when doing this attack? - It's very hard to
say that Hamas actually expected the kind of success that they experienced on October 7th. There were some 2,000 Hamas fighters, terrorists
that managed to get across one of the most well-defended
borders with some of the best intelligence out there. Human intelligence, signals
intelligence managed to get across the border, kill Israelis with reckless abandon, and capture some 250 hostages and bring them back into Gaza. I have a hard time
believing that Hamas expected that they would have that kind of success, that they would be able to kill more Jews in one day
than had happened anywhere in the world since the Holocaust. I have a hard time with that. I think it, it turned
out that Netanyahu and the Israeli government
was dramatically weaker and less focused on defense than Hamas could have anticipated, because the level of
success that Hamas has had is a death sentence for those leaders and for those fighters, I mean,
there is really no choice. There is no one in the
Israeli political leadership, the entire spectrum from left
to right that would say, ""Oh, we can now leave Hamas intact. We've hit him for a few
weeks. And that's enough."" I mean, the idea that Israel, after what they experienced on
October 7th would, would have a few weeks of attacks, but then could still
live neighboring to Gaza, which is being run and
controlled by Hamas- no country in the world
would live with that. And let's also remember that
the people that were killed by Hamas, the people
that are hostages, those that are Israeli, by
the way, these are not, this isn't a settler population. This isn't a hard-right population. This was a progressive population. These were the people in Israel that were most interested in making peace with the Palestinians. And so you now have a
situation where people that I know, friends of mine in
Israel that I would consider to be very thoughtful,
moderate politically, that are saying,
""I wanna level this place. I wanna make it a parking lot."" Not not differentiating
between Hamas fighters and Palestinian civilians and Palestinian women and children. That, that, I mean, to you
and I that sounds insane, but, but on the back of what the Israelis have just
experienced, that is the emotion that is coming out. And so I don't think that Hamas expected that they were going to
have that kind of success, but I absolutely believe
that Hamas' efforts to defend themselves, and when I say themselves,
I don't mean the Palestinian people, I mean just the
fighters and the leadership; they do that by attempting to get the Israeli Defense Forces to kill Palestinian innocents, to kill civilians. And what we have now seen for a month has been extraordinary
brutality and violence. And we have seen refugee
camps and hospitals and schools and United
Nations aid workers blown to pieces by Israeli Defense Forces. And the Israeli Defense
Forces are the ones that are pulling the trigger. They are the ones that
are bombing these people. And now there's a ground war. They're the ones that are
on the ground as well. But it is Hamas that is
operating on the ground with tunnels underneath those targets. It is Hamas that has their missiles and their commanders in
residential buildings and right next to playgrounds
and right next to hospitals and even shooting out of mosques. Now they know exactly what they're doing. They're not just holding 200 plus Israelis and other civilians hostage illegally, but they're also holding large numbers of Palestinian civilians hostage. And so the Israelis, yes,
the Israeli Defense Forces are responsible when they are killing lots and lots of Palestinian
civilians to get at one, two, or three militants. But Hamas is also deeply responsible for making the only way that
Israel can kill terrorists to ensure that large numbers of Palestinian civilians also die. That they are not just
fighting Israel militarily because they will lose badly if they fight Israel militarily. They are fighting in the
court of public opinion. They are fighting an information war, and they are using disinformation. We have seen this play
out over four weeks, and there aren't that many
Jews around the world. There are a lot more Muslims. And so if, if Hamas is able to get out all of this information
that says, ""Look at all of these Palestinian kids
that the Israelis are killing,"" and they don't say anything about how Hamas is also putting them at risk, well then they're going
to look a lot stronger. And is that a trap for Israel? Absolutely. That's a trap for Israel. Absolutely. That makes Israel weaker and more vulnerable than the
geopolitical position they were in on October 6th. I mean, that strong position
of Israel with the countries of the region working with
them, that's a direct threat to the future of Hamas. That's a direct threat to their being able to drive their agenda to undermine Israel, to remove Israel from the region. So, and, and the, the problem is that you can't have this
conversation on CNN or Fox. You can't do it because
it's the headlines. And, and so, you know, know
you can do a minute of it, you can do two minutes of it, then you move on to the next thing. It, if you are only talking about how the Israeli Defense
Forces are responsible for these brutal killings, or if you're only talking about what Hamas did on October 7th, and you don't talk about the
broader context, right, you are absolutely not understanding
what's happening in this war right now. - I'm interested in talking about disinformation and misinformation. You mentioned that as part of your answer to the previous question. I'm, I'm curious what you think
the role digital media plays in this conflict, both being
a vehicle for disinformation, but also being a vehicle
for accurate, on-the-ground information about what's happening. - It has become increasingly
difficult for anyone to get good, valuable information on social media, on Israel-Palestine, the number of accounts
that if you look not at one post, but if then
you go back into the account and say, ""Okay, what are they presenting? Are they actually presenting the news because it's being put out as if they're presenting the news? There's a headline that
you need to focus on,"" then you realize, wait a second, this entire account is only
focusing on the suffering of Jews, or this entire
account is only focusing on the suffering of Palestinians. I, I would wager that
that is the vast majority of the social media
verified, algorithmically promoted accounts that
people are presently digesting on this conflict. And by definition, that is disinformation because it is not interested
in understanding the entirety of what's going on. The one thing that we know
for certain is that the level of suffering that has occurred
on the ground for Jews and for Palestinians over
the last four weeks is unlike almost anything that's been experienced by anyone watching this video right now. And yet you would never feel
that way if you were digesting the accounts that are
driving most of the media in social platforms. So fundamentally, this
is a disinformation-rich and dominant environment. Some of that is assertively fake news. Some of that is assertively filtered and promote programmed news
that only gets you one piece, one side of the story. And God forbid you say
something that is more nuanced, that doesn't align fully with what either or both of those sides are promoting. They come after you and
they say it's fake news. They come after you and
they call for violence. They call to dox you, they'll call for, there'll be death threats. And I've seen this with almost
everyone I know that's trying to have a more civil,
a more focused, decent, grounded human conversation. This is nothing like what people are like in the
real world, in the real world- everyone understands
that they're both people. In fact, they come from the same part of the world, they're family. But you couldn't, you wouldn't get that- and if you were on social media. Now, I wanna, I wanna be
clear that when you say that something is not black or white, that doesn't
mean everything is the same shade of gray. I mean, we, we can all
admit that, you know, Hamas targeting civilians is not the same thing as Israel targeting the military, but also killing a lot of civilians. We can also both agree that both of those are deeply problematic compared to not having any civilians die. We know that we, we also know
that the economic conditions that Palestinians are living
under in Gaza are radically worse than those of
Palestinians in the West Bank, which are radically worse than those of Jews living in Israel. That's context. Those are
not equal shades of gray, but it's not black or white. There is no space for that on
social media. There's none. Social media is dehumanizing.
It is hate-inducing. And it is actively preventing people from getting good information and from talking to each other. What we need is less social media. We need more long-form content. We need more person-to-person engagement. We need more community,
more schools, more family. We, we need more humanity.
Algorithms are not humanity. Algorithms are programmed
by business models that are productizing people for profit. And it just so happens that
the process of doing that is more, is facilitated more directly through very, very strong emotions that, that
that is what we have today. But that is the opposite
from what we need if we want to understand and if we want to resolve
this Israel-Gaza war. - I would love to just do
a quick follow up on that 'cause you know, one of the
things that I found interesting as a dynamic was certainly
when there was the, the hospital bombing
that happened in Gaza, and there was a rush of
reports that said Israel was to blame for that attack. And then following up, there was a lot of what seemed like open source
intelligence reporting that said that that might
not have been the case. How do you take an example like that where a legacy institution
like the New York Times and some other institutions
reported something that ended up being walked back in terms of the truthfulness of the statement. How do you weigh that with what
you were just talking about in terms of social media? - Information warfare. This was the New York Times,
it was the Wall Street Journal, so it wasn't just left
or right, it was both, they both have a lot of journalists that are very professional
and they do very solid work, but they were getting their
real-time information from social media from the region, and it was a
disinformation-rich environment. And so you see these blaring headlines, and it's the middle of the
night when this hospital is hit and no one has good information. You don't have journalists that
are on the ground that are, that are real-time reporting to you. So they're getting that
information secondhand from journalists on the ground. And most of those journalists are getting that information from Hamas sources. And so they said: ""A hospital
is hit. 500 people are dead. And it was an Israeli
missile that hit them."" And it turned out that
all three of those pieces of information were false. It was a hospital parking lot was hit, far fewer people were killed, though a lot of people were killed. And it was not an Israeli Defense Forces missile that hit them. But by that point, the
story had already went out to everyone who wanted to believe that, and they ran with it. And not just the journalists
that are more supportive of the Palestinian than the Israeli cause, but also the governments in the
region who condemned Israel, the governments of the region who decided they weren't
gonna meet with Biden, the Palestinian authority,
the Jordanian, the Egyptians as Biden was meeting with Netanyahu. Now this was absolutely
essential at a time that the United States was
sending its President to try to find a way to, to
stabilize this environment. And they, they probably would've failed, but they're much more likely
to fail if they can only talk to Israel and they can't
talk to the other side. And, and they failed because
of Hamas misinformation. The, this was happening to a lesser degree in the early stages of
the Russia-Ukraine war, but it was happening
much more successfully by the Ukrainians who almost everyone in
the world supported. So you'll remember there
was this Snake Island attack and you had, you know,
this, this news report that was put out and promoted
by the Ukrainian military and the government that showed
that there were, you know, people on the ground and the Russians demanded that they surrender, they refused. They, they used an obscenity and the Russians blew
them all up and they died. And they were seen as
heroes all over the world, except it never happened. No one was killed on Snake Island. The people were captured
and they were released. And that got a little
bit of news weeks later, but the purpose was already
served: equal disinformation. Everyone ran with that story. The New York Times, the Wall
Street Journal, they ran with that story, but it didn't
have as much of an impact because everyone was
sympathetic to Ukraine anyway. And it wasn't going to change. Whether it happened or
didn't happen wasn't going to change the outcome.
In this circumstance, early fog of war, but there was massive,
massive disagreement over like who you wanted to
sympathize with and right, because a lot of people are sympathetic to the Palestinians who've
historically had a much, much harder situation, and the Israelis are more powerful- but then a lot of people are
really sympathetic to Israel because of the terrorist
attack against all of them. So there's a lot to play for. And the fact that Hamas had that meaningfully successful
disinformation in the early moments of the war was a
really big win for them. Either way, the point is the same, that we are no longer fighting a war that is only on the
ground with the success or not of who's winning militarily. So much more of the fight
is being determined by who is able to drive
real-time disinformation with the headlines in social media. - Israel has launched a
ground defensive in Gaza. Do you believe such actions
will make Israel safer, or do you believe it could
have the opposite effect? - My view is that Israel
has every right to want to destroy Hamas as an organization. But we are talking about
30 to 40,000 fighters. And Hamas is, you know, they are, they're absolutely
integrated in the firmament of civilian society across Gaza. And you may remember that in
the early days of the war, Israel said that they were going to do a siege on all of Gaza. So not just Hamas, because you
can't have a siege on Hamas. Instead it was 2.3 million people: We're not getting you food,
we're not getting you water, we're not getting you fuel, we're not getting you medication. And you know that that is going to cause massive humanitarian tragedy. But that was the Israeli response. And my response to that is,
""You don't wanna do that."" That is, you know, that's
gonna create war crimes and so you need to get humanitarian aid. And finally they got some
men, but nowhere near enough. Then as they're bombing and they're bombing all sorts of targets. And as I said, it's not just
fighting against Hamas on the ground, it's also fighting
information warfare. They hit an ambulance. Now that ambulance, it
looks like it was being used by Hamas fighters. But if you've got videos that are showing that the Israelis are
hitting an ambulance, what is Hamas gonna say? What are people gonna run with? It's, ""Look, they're,
they're hitting ambulances."" So you can't, it's not just
what's happening on the ground, it's also how what's happening
on the ground is perceived. So now you have a ground war and that ground war is
going to lead to far, far more Palestinian
civilians getting killed. And it's happening before large numbers of
civilians can get out. The Israeli government has
been, they've sent leaflets, they've warned everyone,
you've gotta evacuate, but they're telling people
to evacuate into the south before there's adequate
food or water or fuel or medicine for those people in the south before there are adequate
refugee camps set up for those people in the South. So who's gonna leave?
How many people will go? And of course, Hamas is also preventing some of them from leaving. It's hard to do. So my
point is, Israel has time. There is an urgent desire
to get rid of Hamas, but the Israelis are now
laser-focused on their border of security in a way that
their government was not before October 7th. They are laser-focused on air defense. They're laser-focused
on sea defense in a way that they were not before October 7th. So my point is, spend more time not just on how you're
going to blow up Hamas, but also on building your information war on building your
relations with other countries. If the, if you're losing
support from the United States because you refuse to allow
in aid for the Palestinians, then you need to spend more time sending in aid with the Palestinians. If you're losing the Europeans, it's, Ukraine has been in a
much stronger position because the entire West
was standing with Ukraine. The entire West is not
standing with Israel. And in part that's because
the Israeli war cabinet has refused to allow in the aid. They've refused to provide
adequate, safe zones for the Palestinians to be
able to, to, to spend time, to get to and to live as families. That's a huge problem. So I believe that ultimately
the Israelis will be safer if they spend more time
working with their allies and developing a multilateral response. Nobody out there from the West believes that Israel should leave Hamas alone. Nobody believes that there
should be a permanent ceasefire and they don't have the
right to defend themselves. That's not the argument. The argument has been
for a humanitarian pause. The argument has been
for a temporary ceasefire that allows far more
Palestinians to have the ability to live and to live safely
because the future of Israel and peace in the region depends not just on Israel destroying Hamas, but also depends on the
ability to create conditions for peace between Israel and the Palestinians in
Gaza and the West Bank. And yes, there are some
in Netanyahu's government that have no interest in that. Those people will be out of
government after the war. The Israelis do not want them anymore. Do not trust them anymore. But, but you can't be, Israel will not be
successful if they fight this war by themselves. They will not be successful
if by destroying Hamas, they also destroy the
conditions for long-term peace with the Palestinian people. We all know that when Israel was fighting against the PLO and they removed them from Lebanon, they ended up with Hezbollah- that's not better. When the
Americans fought against Saddam Hussein and destroyed the Ba'ath
party in Iraq, they ended up with the Islamic state- that's not better. So if Israel
is going to destroy Hamas, but they don't create
the conditions for peace with the Palestinian people, they will end up with something worse. So I am not suggesting that
Israel should say, ""Okay, okay, okay, let's, we'll just
make peace with Hamas."" They can't, that's not doable. No one in Israel would support that. But they have to also
create conditions for peace with the Palestinians
that will live there 'cause they're not
going anywhere. The idea among some in
Netanyahu's government, and by the way, far too
many, that what really needs to happen is you need the
Palestinians to leave. They need to, to go to
Egypt, to the Sinai, and maybe never come back, that they need to take more territory and let the settlers just,
you know, sort of grab up all of the West Bank and the
Palestinians can go to Jordan- they won't be Israel's problem anymore. That is not a viable solution. The Palestinians won't stand for it. The Egyptians won't stand for it. The Jordanians won't stand for it. The Gulf states won't stand for it. And these are countries that
are not fundamentally Israel's enemies, but they will not tolerate it. So Israel must, must, must- at the same time they are
trying to destroy Hamas- they must create conditions for peace for the Palestinian people. And my concern about a ground war today on the ground in Gaza, is that they are creating the conditions to destroy Hamas without
creating the conditions for peace after Hamas. - The United States and Israel have been allies for a long time. What effect are you seeing
from the U.S. continuing to support Israel, and how could that play a role in the
future of U.S. politics? - I would say that Biden
could not be more supportive of Israel following the
October 7th attacks. His immediate decision
to make a trip there, the shuttle diplomacy by Secretary of State Blinken in
particular, the willingness of the U.S.
government to stay as long as the United States exists, that Israel will never
have to stand alone. Those are enormously powerful statements and they are statements that
are clearly shared in a broad and bipartisan way in the United States. But Generation Z, young people in the U.S. support the Palestinian position more strongly than they support Israel. And you have seen that
particularly on college campuses across the country, but also more broadly and many on the progressive
wing of the Democratic party. And I'm not just talking about
""the Squad"" and Rashida Tlaib and AOC I'm talking more
broadly are in increasingly, deeply uncomfortable with the extent of the Israeli military strikes against Hamas and the Palestinian
civilians in Gaza. All of the, all
of the human destruction that we are all witnessing right now. And President Biden has made it clear to the Israeli war
cabinet that the ability of the United States
to continue to provide unconstrained support
for Israel is a window that will narrow if the present levels of atrocities continue. So the conditions for peace are not just
about making sure the Palestinians have an opportunity to live, they're also about making sure
the Americans can continue to support Israel the way
they have here to fore. I think it is not guaranteed that in another four weeks time, the U.S. will still be
willing to provide the kind of military equipment,
high-tech, military equipment and support that they
have provided to Israel, historically, if Israel continues to fight the war the way
they have been fighting it, even the United States,
Biden and his cabinet and core members of Senate
in the house are facing that pressure from their
own progressive wing- and that is going to grow over time. I also think that this is
a risk for Biden in 2024 because this war right
now is primarily about Gaza and Hamas. But there are American carrier
strike groups in the Eastern med. and in the Gulf. They've already been
involved in direct strikes against Iranian Shia proxies in Syria. There will surely be more of those strikes in the coming weeks. American servicemen and women
have already taken casualties, not deaths, not so far,
but actually injured troops because of the knock-on impact of the war between Israel and Hamas. So if it turns out that the United States is
directly involved in a Middle Eastern war, that Biden has not
sold to the American people- he hasn't justified- you go from no wars started
under the Trump administration to two wars started under
the Biden administration. Neither of them started by Biden, but both of them, the American
taxpayers are paying for, and one of which the Americans
might be taking casualties. That is a very hard thing to run on if you are President Biden. And they know it. It also, the distraction of the Middle East and President Zelensky of Ukraine has just been
saying this has made it harder for people to focus on the
continued support for Ukraine, especially given a
counteroffensive that has failed. So you now have these two
massive global foreign policy crises both of which
are not looking so great for the United States
as we head into 2024. I, I expect that Trump, when he becomes the Republican nominee, and that certainly looks
very likely at this point, will make a meal out of that. That is a vulnerability
for the United States and Biden knows it. So this is very much not
just about the Middle East. This has implications for the
U.S. more broadly and globally. - A lot of people are viewing this as potentially a precursor to something like we would
see in World War III. What do you think are the factors that are keeping the
situation from escalating to a global conflict? And do you think it could
potentially escalate to a bigger conflict that involves a lot more
parties like the United States and potentially some other parties both in the region and globally? - We have seen that the
Iranian President has, and the Supreme Leader have
both said things publicly that imply that the world will burn because of what the
Israelis are doing in Gaza, but they use the passive voice. They are, they are very
careful not to say, ""We Iran will do X, Y, and Z."" They'll say, ""These are the
impacts that it will have."" These are, these are clearly
statements that are meant to put Iran at a distance
from direct involvement and engagement, even though
the Iranians are the ones that have provided weapons and
training and money for Hamas and for Israel's principle
enemies in the region. We've seen that from Lebanon. Nasrallah, Hassan Nasrallah who runs
Hezbollah, gave a really big and very strongly anticipated
speech where he said, ""You guys go Hamas,
you're doing a great job."" But certainly did not in any way imply that Hezbollah is going to
be out there fighting for and opening a second
front as a consequence of what Israel is doing
on the ground in Gaza. So, so far I would say we're four weeks in the likelihood of
expansion is significant, but nobody sees World War III coming anytime soon. What we have is an
expansion of Israel's fight against Hamas, and that means that we're
gonna see a lot, a lot, a lot more casualties. And as that happens, Israel will be under more
international pressure, there will be more antisemitism, there'll be more attacks against Jews, there will be more Islamophobia, there'll be more attacks against Muslims, there'll be more one-off
nuisance strikes against American bases in the region. There'll be more American
strikes against proxies of Iran. That is an expansion
of the war beyond Gaza. It is not a regional war. What we need to watch out
for for a regional war is that number one, Iran has influence over, but not operational control
over its proxies in the region. And as the war in Gaza gets bloodier, and if it looks like Hamas is really, truly losing everything that they have, there are others in the region
that may well be willing to fight and escalate against Israel and against Americans in
the region irrespective of what Iran does or does not say to them. So you can easily have farther escalation by those organizations themselves. The Shia militants
in Iraq, in Syria, the Houthis in Yemen in particular, they could also engage in strikes into the Straits of Hormuz. They could hit oil tankers that
could increase energy prices and create a global recession. Again, that would hurt
Biden very dramatically. We also, so far, thank God, have not seen significant lone
wolf terror attacks against Americans inside the United
States or in the region. We've already heard
from the head of the FBI and from others that that threat assessment is
higher than they've seen at any point post-9/11. That's a real concern. Obviously that's
something that can happen. If it does, the Americans
are gonna need to respond. So I, I don't think we
are anywhere close to out of the woods on this one. And I, while I'm, I'm deeply concerned about
people out there talking about World War III because I
really don't see that as a, you know, sort of proximate
risk, the likelihood that this can escalate in ways
that none of the actors want to see, but can happen anyway- I think that's a very real possibility. - This question comes from a
subscriber in our Big Think membership community. Is there a two-state solution
that ensures the rights of Palestinians as well as the
security interests of Israel? - I cannot see any environment where we have peace in
the region without a two- or three-state solution. Whether, you know, you have the Palestinians governed in the same way with the same institutions in Gaza and the West Bank are separate. I don't know. But clearly, the Palestinians must have the ability to live in peace on land that
they can defend and govern. Now we are nowhere close to that, but I think it was Henry
Kissinger that said that the time you get peace is
when both sides are exhausted. And he's someone that knows
a lot about fighting wars and war crimes, frankly, but also knows a lot
about negotiating peace. And I do think that we are oddly closer to a two-state solution today
than we were on October 6th. And the reason for that is because everyone in this region and with equities in this
region now understand that you can no longer
ignore the Palestinian issue. Or if you do, it's at your peril. So yes, the, we're still in a time of war and it's gonna get worse
before it gets better. But as we come out of this
war, the level of demand for finding a route for peace
between the Palestinians and the Israelis will
be far more prioritized. Much more capital will be expended on trying to make that happen. Some of that will be
humanitarian resources to try to rebuild Gaza. Some of that will be diplomatic
resources to try to come up with what a new Palestinian authority for Gaza might look like. Who would those people be and how would you build
such an administration? But you know, of course the more suffering we see in the coming weeks and months, I mean, if
you're already talking about half a percent of the
Palestinian population in Gaza is dead since October 7th; one of every 200
Palestinians in Gaza dead- and those numbers are going up. I don't know exactly
what those numbers are. They fight between the United Nations and between like, you know,
the Gaza Health Ministry, which is Hamas and you can't trust them, but the numbers are big. We know the numbers are big. Like every one of those
civilian deaths is going to make it harder to
get from here to there, right? We've already suffered the pain and tragedy to know that we need to move to a two-state solution. We know that. But the damage that you
can do to make that much, much harder and longer
term with the suffering that will be remembered for generations and generations, that is
a very different story. - Ian, thank you so
much for your time today and for the insights you're able to provide the Big Think
audience about this ongoing and complicated conflict. - It's great to be back with you. - If you found this conversation with Ian Bremmer valuable, we
would love to hear from you. Please respond with your feedback
in the comments about the format and the types of guests or topics you would like
to see in the future. Thanks so much for watching."," - You can't have this
conversation on CNN or Fox. You can't do it, right? Because if you are only talking about how the Israeli Defense
Forces are responsible for these brutal killings, or if you're only talking about what Hamas did on October 7th, and you don't talk about the
broader context, right, you are absolutely not understanding
what's happening in this war right now. - Today on Big Think, we're
gonna be talking to Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Eurasia Group and GZERO Media about
the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel. Ian, thank you so much
for joining us today. - It's great to be back with Big Think. - This region has been embroiled
in turmoil for thousands of years, so there's many historical factors we could discuss. But I would like to know
from your standpoint, is it more helpful to
focus on recent history to better understand this conflict? - Both the Jews and the
Palestinians have long, long running and legitimate claims to live on this territory. Palestinians, some 700,000 plus were kicked off these territories after 1948 post-Holocaust. The Jews had lived on these
territories for millennia, and a number of empires
have kicked them off. We can talk about that. There are people that are far
more expert on those histories than I am, but the reality
is that for the Jews and the Palestinians that are
fighting over this land today, they've been living there
for their lifetimes and, and so it's really not
about who has a right to live on the territory. It's rather that they need to find a way to live together in peace. And what has happened over
the past years is that everyone in the world
has basically given up on finding a peaceful solution because they've tried for
decades, it's too hard or because they're not interested; they have other things that
they would rather do. That's where we are today. The last time that the Americans who are not an honest broker
for peace in the region, the United States, a principle
ally in the entire Middle East is Israel. So you can't say, ""Oh, well,
you know, they're the ones that can broker peace between
Israel and the Palestinians, because they're equally trusted."" That's not true. But they do
have the dominant military presence in the region, and
they also have the dominant diplomatic capability on the region. So they've been the ones that have played the
most significant role. And the last time an
American senior diplomat was really invested on trying to
figure out a way to bring peace to this region was when
John Kerry was Secretary of State in the first couple of years of the Obama administration. And he did shuttle diplomacy
between the Israelis, the Palestinians, the Jordanians,
the Egyptians, I mean, all the time, for 18 months this was his top priority. He wanted a Nobel Peace
Prize for it. He failed. And after that, basically
the Americans gave up. It was the pivot to Asia. It was no longer focusing
as much on the Middle East. And then when the Russians
invade Ukraine, it's focusing on Europe too. But no one's spending real
time on the Palestinians, the Gulf States, who had
been providing so much money for humanitarian support for Palestinians living in the West Bank, and particularly Gaza, as well
as refugees in other places that they were saying
there could be no peace in the Middle East unless
the Palestinian-Israel issue is resolved. Well, it turned out they were willing to make peace with Israel. They're, they're willing to engage open diplomatic
relations, allow Jewish tourists to come to their country, trade and investment, technology
cooperation, security cooperation. But what about the Palestinians? Well, too hard to resolve, and Israel, and particularly this far-right, Netanyahu-led government has been
willing to not only expand illegally, the settlements
in the West Bank, reducing the territory that the
Palestinians can live on, and making it harder for them
to get to work, go to school, you know, have a possibility
for a viable future. But also, Netanyahu's
government was engaging more with Hamas in Gaza at the expense of the Palestinian authority, because they never wanted to
pursue a two-state solution. So they forgot about the Palestinians too. So when you look at
everyone around the world that was committed to the
Palestinians, finding a way to live viably on their territories, the answer is this has not
been a priority for anyone for a long, long time. And their own government
in the West Bank that recognizes Israel's right to
exist, as opposed to Hamas, which does not, they were corrupt. They were divided. They couldn't speak for
Palestinians in Gaza, and they were being weakened
by the Israeli government. So, I mean, this was a long introduction to talk about the history, but the point is that if
you are looking for people that are responsible, historically, for why we are in the
mess that we are in today, and it is an unholy mess, and I use that term very
literally, you know, you can look everywhere and you have people to blame that that is where we are today. - Thank you for that. I'm,
I'm curious, you know, to talk about some of the
domestic politics within Israel, because that's something that
I think has not been paid enough attention to and specifically the actions
of the Netanyahu government and the people who they are
partnering with as it relates to this conflict, but also just
internally inside of Israel. What does it look like in
terms of the partnerships and the dynamics that are happening there? What has been the lead up
to this conflict in terms of the internal politics with Israel, and how has that had an
effect on just the general relationship between Israel and the Palestinians
in the various places? - You know, Israel is a
very political society. The average Israeli citizen reads a lot about news and politics. If you go to a cafe in
Tel Aviv or in Jerusalem or Herzliya, you're gonna hear a lot of people talking about politics. It's also a very fragmented society. There are a lot of
different political parties. And, and in order to get a government
together in the Knesset, you can't govern by yourself because you'd never get a majority. You have to find a coalition
with other partners. And Netanyahu, who has,
you know, faced all sorts of internal corruption scandals and, and who's Likud party
has also been painted with a lot of those challenges. The only way he could form
a government this last time around was with a hard-right group. A party that specifically
has, you know, said some of the most horrible things about wanting Palestinians removed from
the West Bank, about wanting to take over their territories. In some ways, the hard-right partners of Netanyahu have been as unyielding and aggressive about the
Palestinians not having rights in the occupied territories as Hamas has been about the Jews not having the right to have an Israeli state. Now, that does not reflect the opinions of the Israeli people as a
whole, but it has meant that before the events of October 7th, the terrorist events against
the people of Israel, you had enormous domestic instability. That domestic instability
was the people of Israel revolting against Netanyahu, attempting to change a very strong,
independent judiciary of that country to basically
report to the executive and report to whoever was
in charge in the Knesset. And the reason for that,
more control for Netanyahu and his coalition, and the
ability to avoid getting charged and jailed for these corruption scandals and investigations that are ongoing. And, and for months, the news
in Israel had nothing to do with Hamas, had nothing to do with the Palestinians in Gaza. It instead was about a
potential constitutional crisis that was pending in Israel,
that Israel's legitimacy as a democracy in the Middle
East was under threat, not because of what they were
doing to the Palestinians, but because of what Netanyahu
was doing to the country, to the balance of power in Israel. So that was, they were taking
their eye off the ball. The other thing that happened
is the hard-right part of the Israeli government
was doing everything possible to expand their territorial
influence in the West Bank. And the Palestinians
living there were angry and there were a lot of clashes. There were violent reprisals. And the Israeli Defense Forces some of the best in the world, incredibly well-trained high
morale, while a lot of them had been sent to the West Bank and to the border zone inside
Israel proper in an effort to contain and respond to that violence. Where were they in Gaza?
Not worried about Gaza. Netanyahu was providing Hamas in Gaza with more resources, with
more money, with more ability to have work visas to
come on over into Israel. Why? Because they were
just focused on governance. According to Netanyahu, they
just wanted to rebuild Gaza 'cause he wanted a stronger Hamas to weaken the Palestinian authority. So what happened is you
took one of the world's best-trained, most
effective defense forces, intelligence forces, security
forces, border forces, and, and you had them focusing on everything but a terrorist organization
that was running Gaza with a people that had abysmal economic conditions, life
conditions, half of them without enough food to eat, 90% of them without access to clean water. And everyone is now talking about how Israel has a right to self-defense. They have a right to be able
to defend their borders. And that is absolutely true. But that right did not
begin after October 7th. That right existed before October 7th. And the Prime Minister of Israel and his hard-right government
failed the Israeli people. They did not defend their country, they didn't defend their borders. They weren't concerned with or focused on the real
threats that were right there just on the south of Israel,
that wanted to destroy everything that the Israeli
people have been building since 1948. So the Israeli people want Netanyahu out. They overwhelmingly blame him and his government for
the events of October 7th, consistently in polls taken inside Israel. In fact, one of the only things that the Middle Eastern
peoples can agree on in, in this conflict is that
the Israeli Prime Minister and his government need to go,
that they, that they are not fit for office either to govern Israel and defend Israel, or to engage and create peace with the Palestinians. - You know, it's interesting
to bring up the government of Israel and how people are perceiving their
actions in the lead up to, and even just in the response
of the October 7th attack, I'm curious, you know, to bring it to the surrounding nations and their relationship with Israel. And, you know, you
mentioned how the treatment of Palestinians has taking a back seat to sort of recent concerns. I'm, I'm curious if you
can paint a broader picture of just like what types of
relationships has been happening with, between Israel and other nations, other Arab
nations that surround them, and how the concerns of the Palestinians have just
not been the forefront of the discussions between those parties. - No, they, they have not. And to be fair, I mean, the fact that the Palestinians have not been diplomatically important to,
for example, the Gulf States or, or even to countries like Jordan and Egypt that have been more
willing to engage with Israel as the Palestinian plight has
become worse, there has been a lot of effort to bring
aid, humanitarian support in for the Palestinians and the Gulf states who are very wealthy, have been providing a lot of that. But when the Israeli government, after the events
of October 7th started engaging in widespread
bombardment across Gaza, which has led to thousands and thousands of casualties:
civilian casualties, children, almost 50% of the Gaza
population are children, right? I mean, this is now being
seen across the region, and it is impossible for any
government of the region, any Arab government of the
region to just sit and stand by and say, ""Okay, we don't care. We're still gonna work with Israel. The way we were working with
them."" Israel had benefited from being seen as an economic juggernaut, a security juggernaut, a technological juggernaut. And a lot of the countries
in the region wanted to work more closely with
Israel as a consequence of that. That's why you had the UAE and Bahrain and Morocco signing the
Abraham Accords, not just to normalize diplomatic relations, but also to dramatically expand trade and investment with Israel. That's why the Saudis were
improving their informal relations and were moving
towards normalization. Even though the Saudi population is going to be quite cautious and conservative on the
Palestinian issue, they say, ""No, the priority is we gotta find a way to work with Israel."" But once you have Israel in
response to these terrorist acts going after Hamas, and as they're doing so killing all of these Palestinian civilians, well then there's a freeze on
everything; then if you are, you know, Jordan, you
say, ""We can't work with, we can't engage with
Israel going forward."" If you're Turkey, Turkish
President Erdogan, who has said that Hamas is not a terrorist
organization, he has said that Hamas is a liberation movement, and he hasn't condemned the Hamas from the hostages that've taken from the 1,400 civilians that they killed. Not at all. So they've thrown out the Israeli diplomats
on the ground as well. And when that's happening
across the region and the Arab Street is
demonstrating in solidarity with the Palestinians, then
even if you have a number of wealthier Arab countries
that want to continue to work with Israel, they can't because
of the domestic pressure. And, and so the, the efforts that had made Israel the
strongest, geopolitically, that had had ever been,
since independence, suddenly are moving in a very different
direction, it's, it's hard for those countries to even
maintain present levels of engagement with Israel. And indeed, a lot of the progress that had been made could be lost. So it's very interesting. You have an environment where before the acts of October 7th, Israel was the most divided domestically because of the response to Netanyahu, but the strongest in the region. Then the events of October 7th happen, and suddenly Israel is enormously unified. Everyone is responding. You get a, a unity war cabinet because everyone says,
we must defeat Hamas. We must destroy these terrorists that have just threatened our homeland and have killed our children. Right? And, but the international
environment from Israel has suddenly become one of massive criticism and condemnation. And that is clearly true
in its immediate region. It is clearly true for
Iran, which continues along with Hamas to believe that, that the Jewish people in the state of Israel should be
replaced with Palestine. But that's also true
for all of the proxies of Iran across the region,
the Shia proxies in Yemen and in Iraq, in Syria. It's true across the global
South where we have governments that are outraged and coming after Israel, and even for the United States, which is by far the strongest ally
of Israel in the world. You have significant pressure, especially among young people, and especially among Democrats in Congress saying, ""We can no longer provide
the kind of support that we have historically
given what's happening presently on the ground."" So domestically in Israel,
much more cohesive and stronger and resilient; internationally,
much more fragmented and, and much more challenging for the Israelis going forward. - I'm curious, you know, to think about this situation in regards to what Hamas' motivation was for the attack. And so do you think that
there was a strategic goal of the Hamas attack on October 7th? And was this in a way,
setting a trap for Israel? And if so, was it successful? Was this outcome of
people turning the tide of opinion against Israel
internationally, part of a strategic goal for
Hamas when doing this attack? - It's very hard to
say that Hamas actually expected the kind of success that they experienced on October 7th. There were some 2,000 Hamas fighters, terrorists
that managed to get across one of the most well-defended
borders with some of the best intelligence out there. Human intelligence, signals
intelligence managed to get across the border, kill Israelis with reckless abandon, and capture some 250 hostages and bring them back into Gaza. I have a hard time
believing that Hamas expected that they would have that kind of success, that they would be able to kill more Jews in one day
than had happened anywhere in the world since the Holocaust. I have a hard time with that. I think it, it turned
out that Netanyahu and the Israeli government
was dramatically weaker and less focused on defense than Hamas could have anticipated, because the level of
success that Hamas has had is a death sentence for those leaders and for those fighters, I mean,
there is really no choice. There is no one in the
Israeli political leadership, the entire spectrum from left
to right that would say, ""Oh, we can now leave Hamas intact. We've hit him for a few
weeks. And that's enough."" I mean, the idea that Israel, after what they experienced on
October 7th would, would have a few weeks of attacks, but then could still
live neighboring to Gaza, which is being run and
controlled by Hamas- no country in the world
would live with that. And let's also remember that
the people that were killed by Hamas, the people
that are hostages, those that are Israeli, by
the way, these are not, this isn't a settler population. This isn't a hard-right population. This was a progressive population. These were the people in Israel that were most interested in making peace with the Palestinians. And so you now have a
situation where people that I know, friends of mine in
Israel that I would consider to be very thoughtful,
moderate politically, that are saying,
""I wanna level this place. I wanna make it a parking lot."" Not not differentiating
between Hamas fighters and Palestinian civilians and Palestinian women and children. That, that, I mean, to you
and I that sounds insane, but, but on the back of what the Israelis have just
experienced, that is the emotion that is coming out. And so I don't think that Hamas expected that they were going to
have that kind of success, but I absolutely believe
that Hamas' efforts to defend themselves, and when I say themselves,
I don't mean the Palestinian people, I mean just the
fighters and the leadership; they do that by attempting to get the Israeli Defense Forces to kill Palestinian innocents, to kill civilians. And what we have now seen for a month has been extraordinary
brutality and violence. And we have seen refugee
camps and hospitals and schools and United
Nations aid workers blown to pieces by Israeli Defense Forces. And the Israeli Defense
Forces are the ones that are pulling the trigger. They are the ones that
are bombing these people. And now there's a ground war. They're the ones that are
on the ground as well. But it is Hamas that is
operating on the ground with tunnels underneath those targets. It is Hamas that has their missiles and their commanders in
residential buildings and right next to playgrounds
and right next to hospitals and even shooting out of mosques. Now they know exactly what they're doing. They're not just holding 200 plus Israelis and other civilians hostage illegally, but they're also holding large numbers of Palestinian civilians hostage. And so the Israelis, yes,
the Israeli Defense Forces are responsible when they are killing lots and lots of Palestinian
civilians to get at one, two, or three militants. But Hamas is also deeply responsible for making the only way that
Israel can kill terrorists to ensure that large numbers of Palestinian civilians also die. That they are not just
fighting Israel militarily because they will lose badly if they fight Israel militarily. They are fighting in the
court of public opinion. They are fighting an information war, and they are using disinformation. We have seen this play
out over four weeks, and there aren't that many
Jews around the world. There are a lot more Muslims. And so if, if Hamas is able to get out all of this information
that says, ""Look at all of these Palestinian kids
that the Israelis are killing,"" and they don't say anything about how Hamas is also putting them at risk, well then they're going
to look a lot stronger. And is that a trap for Israel? Absolutely. That's a trap for Israel. Absolutely. That makes Israel weaker and more vulnerable than the
geopolitical position they were in on October 6th. I mean, that strong position
of Israel with the countries of the region working with
them, that's a direct threat to the future of Hamas. That's a direct threat to their being able to drive their agenda to undermine Israel, to remove Israel from the region. So, and, and the, the problem is that you can't have this
conversation on CNN or Fox. You can't do it because
it's the headlines. And, and so, you know, know
you can do a minute of it, you can do two minutes of it, then you move on to the next thing. It, if you are only talking about how the Israeli Defense
Forces are responsible for these brutal killings, or if you're only talking about what Hamas did on October 7th, and you don't talk about the
broader context, right, you are absolutely not understanding
what's happening in this war right now. - I'm interested in talking about disinformation and misinformation. You mentioned that as part of your answer to the previous question. I'm, I'm curious what you think
the role digital media plays in this conflict, both being
a vehicle for disinformation, but also being a vehicle
for accurate, on-the-ground information about what's happening. - It has become increasingly
difficult for anyone to get good, valuable information on social media, on Israel-Palestine, the number of accounts
that if you look not at one post, but if then
you go back into the account and say, ""Okay, what are they presenting? Are they actually presenting the news because it's being put out as if they're presenting the news? There's a headline that
you need to focus on,"" then you realize, wait a second, this entire account is only
focusing on the suffering of Jews, or this entire
account is only focusing on the suffering of Palestinians. I, I would wager that
that is the vast majority of the social media
verified, algorithmically promoted accounts that
people are presently digesting on this conflict. And by definition, that is disinformation because it is not interested
in understanding the entirety of what's going on. The one thing that we know
for certain is that the level of suffering that has occurred
on the ground for Jews and for Palestinians over
the last four weeks is unlike almost anything that's been experienced by anyone watching this video right now. And yet you would never feel
that way if you were digesting the accounts that are
driving most of the media in social platforms. So fundamentally, this
is a disinformation-rich and dominant environment. Some of that is assertively fake news. Some of that is assertively filtered and promote programmed news
that only gets you one piece, one side of the story. And God forbid you say
something that is more nuanced, that doesn't align fully with what either or both of those sides are promoting. They come after you and
they say it's fake news. They come after you and
they call for violence. They call to dox you, they'll call for, there'll be death threats. And I've seen this with almost
everyone I know that's trying to have a more civil,
a more focused, decent, grounded human conversation. This is nothing like what people are like in the
real world, in the real world- everyone understands
that they're both people. In fact, they come from the same part of the world, they're family. But you couldn't, you wouldn't get that- and if you were on social media. Now, I wanna, I wanna be
clear that when you say that something is not black or white, that doesn't
mean everything is the same shade of gray. I mean, we, we can all
admit that, you know, Hamas targeting civilians is not the same thing as Israel targeting the military, but also killing a lot of civilians. We can also both agree that both of those are deeply problematic compared to not having any civilians die. We know that we, we also know
that the economic conditions that Palestinians are living
under in Gaza are radically worse than those of
Palestinians in the West Bank, which are radically worse than those of Jews living in Israel. That's context. Those are
not equal shades of gray, but it's not black or white. There is no space for that on
social media. There's none. Social media is dehumanizing.
It is hate-inducing. And it is actively preventing people from getting good information and from talking to each other. What we need is less social media. We need more long-form content. We need more person-to-person engagement. We need more community,
more schools, more family. We, we need more humanity.
Algorithms are not humanity. Algorithms are programmed
by business models that are productizing people for profit. And it just so happens that
the process of doing that is more, is facilitated more directly through very, very strong emotions that, that
that is what we have today. But that is the opposite
from what we need if we want to understand and if we want to resolve
this Israel-Gaza war. - I would love to just do
a quick follow up on that 'cause you know, one of the
things that I found interesting as a dynamic was certainly
when there was the, the hospital bombing
that happened in Gaza, and there was a rush of
reports that said Israel was to blame for that attack. And then following up, there was a lot of what seemed like open source
intelligence reporting that said that that might
not have been the case. How do you take an example like that where a legacy institution
like the New York Times and some other institutions
reported something that ended up being walked back in terms of the truthfulness of the statement. How do you weigh that with what
you were just talking about in terms of social media? - Information warfare. This was the New York Times,
it was the Wall Street Journal, so it wasn't just left
or right, it was both, they both have a lot of journalists that are very professional
and they do very solid work, but they were getting their
real-time information from social media from the region, and it was a
disinformation-rich environment. And so you see these blaring headlines, and it's the middle of the
night when this hospital is hit and no one has good information. You don't have journalists that
are on the ground that are, that are real-time reporting to you. So they're getting that
information secondhand from journalists on the ground. And most of those journalists are getting that information from Hamas sources. And so they said: ""A hospital
is hit. 500 people are dead. And it was an Israeli
missile that hit them."" And it turned out that
all three of those pieces of information were false. It was a hospital parking lot was hit, far fewer people were killed, though a lot of people were killed. And it was not an Israeli Defense Forces missile that hit them. But by that point, the
story had already went out to everyone who wanted to believe that, and they ran with it. And not just the journalists
that are more supportive of the Palestinian than the Israeli cause, but also the governments in the
region who condemned Israel, the governments of the region who decided they weren't
gonna meet with Biden, the Palestinian authority,
the Jordanian, the Egyptians as Biden was meeting with Netanyahu. Now this was absolutely
essential at a time that the United States was
sending its President to try to find a way to, to
stabilize this environment. And they, they probably would've failed, but they're much more likely
to fail if they can only talk to Israel and they can't
talk to the other side. And, and they failed because
of Hamas misinformation. The, this was happening to a lesser degree in the early stages of
the Russia-Ukraine war, but it was happening
much more successfully by the Ukrainians who almost everyone in
the world supported. So you'll remember there
was this Snake Island attack and you had, you know,
this, this news report that was put out and promoted
by the Ukrainian military and the government that showed
that there were, you know, people on the ground and the Russians demanded that they surrender, they refused. They, they used an obscenity and the Russians blew
them all up and they died. And they were seen as
heroes all over the world, except it never happened. No one was killed on Snake Island. The people were captured
and they were released. And that got a little
bit of news weeks later, but the purpose was already
served: equal disinformation. Everyone ran with that story. The New York Times, the Wall
Street Journal, they ran with that story, but it didn't
have as much of an impact because everyone was
sympathetic to Ukraine anyway. And it wasn't going to change. Whether it happened or
didn't happen wasn't going to change the outcome.
In this circumstance, early fog of war, but there was massive,
massive disagreement over like who you wanted to
sympathize with and right, because a lot of people are sympathetic to the Palestinians who've
historically had a much, much harder situation, and the Israelis are more powerful- but then a lot of people are
really sympathetic to Israel because of the terrorist
attack against all of them. So there's a lot to play for. And the fact that Hamas had that meaningfully successful
disinformation in the early moments of the war was a
really big win for them. Either way, the point is the same, that we are no longer fighting a war that is only on the
ground with the success or not of who's winning militarily. So much more of the fight
is being determined by who is able to drive
real-time disinformation with the headlines in social media. - Israel has launched a
ground defensive in Gaza. Do you believe such actions
will make Israel safer, or do you believe it could
have the opposite effect? - My view is that Israel
has every right to want to destroy Hamas as an organization. But we are talking about
30 to 40,000 fighters. And Hamas is, you know, they are, they're absolutely
integrated in the firmament of civilian society across Gaza. And you may remember that in
the early days of the war, Israel said that they were going to do a siege on all of Gaza. So not just Hamas, because you
can't have a siege on Hamas. Instead it was 2.3 million people: We're not getting you food,
we're not getting you water, we're not getting you fuel, we're not getting you medication. And you know that that is going to cause massive humanitarian tragedy. But that was the Israeli response. And my response to that is,
""You don't wanna do that."" That is, you know, that's
gonna create war crimes and so you need to get humanitarian aid. And finally they got some
men, but nowhere near enough. Then as they're bombing and they're bombing all sorts of targets. And as I said, it's not just
fighting against Hamas on the ground, it's also fighting
information warfare. They hit an ambulance. Now that ambulance, it
looks like it was being used by Hamas fighters. But if you've got videos that are showing that the Israelis are
hitting an ambulance, what is Hamas gonna say? What are people gonna run with? It's, ""Look, they're,
they're hitting ambulances."" So you can't, it's not just
what's happening on the ground, it's also how what's happening
on the ground is perceived. So now you have a ground war and that ground war is
going to lead to far, far more Palestinian
civilians getting killed. And it's happening before large numbers of
civilians can get out. The Israeli government has
been, they've sent leaflets, they've warned everyone,
you've gotta evacuate, but they're telling people
to evacuate into the south before there's adequate
food or water or fuel or medicine for those people in the south before there are adequate
refugee camps set up for those people in the South. So who's gonna leave?
How many people will go? And of course, Hamas is also preventing some of them from leaving. It's hard to do. So my
point is, Israel has time. There is an urgent desire
to get rid of Hamas, but the Israelis are now
laser-focused on their border of security in a way that
their government was not before October 7th. They are laser-focused on air defense. They're laser-focused
on sea defense in a way that they were not before October 7th. So my point is, spend more time not just on how you're
going to blow up Hamas, but also on building your information war on building your
relations with other countries. If the, if you're losing
support from the United States because you refuse to allow
in aid for the Palestinians, then you need to spend more time sending in aid with the Palestinians. If you're losing the Europeans, it's, Ukraine has been in a
much stronger position because the entire West
was standing with Ukraine. The entire West is not
standing with Israel. And in part that's because
the Israeli war cabinet has refused to allow in the aid. They've refused to provide
adequate, safe zones for the Palestinians to be
able to, to, to spend time, to get to and to live as families. That's a huge problem. So I believe that ultimately
the Israelis will be safer if they spend more time
working with their allies and developing a multilateral response. Nobody out there from the West believes that Israel should leave Hamas alone. Nobody believes that there
should be a permanent ceasefire and they don't have the
right to defend themselves. That's not the argument. The argument has been
for a humanitarian pause. The argument has been
for a temporary ceasefire that allows far more
Palestinians to have the ability to live and to live safely
because the future of Israel and peace in the region depends not just on Israel destroying Hamas, but also depends on the
ability to create conditions for peace between Israel and the Palestinians in
Gaza and the West Bank. And yes, there are some
in Netanyahu's government that have no interest in that. Those people will be out of
government after the war. The Israelis do not want them anymore. Do not trust them anymore. But, but you can't be, Israel will not be
successful if they fight this war by themselves. They will not be successful
if by destroying Hamas, they also destroy the
conditions for long-term peace with the Palestinian people. We all know that when Israel was fighting against the PLO and they removed them from Lebanon, they ended up with Hezbollah- that's not better. When the
Americans fought against Saddam Hussein and destroyed the Ba'ath
party in Iraq, they ended up with the Islamic state- that's not better. So if Israel
is going to destroy Hamas, but they don't create
the conditions for peace with the Palestinian people, they will end up with something worse. So I am not suggesting that
Israel should say, ""Okay, okay, okay, let's, we'll just
make peace with Hamas."" They can't, that's not doable. No one in Israel would support that. But they have to also
create conditions for peace with the Palestinians
that will live there 'cause they're not
going anywhere. The idea among some in
Netanyahu's government, and by the way, far too
many, that what really needs to happen is you need the
Palestinians to leave. They need to, to go to
Egypt, to the Sinai, and maybe never come back, that they need to take more territory and let the settlers just,
you know, sort of grab up all of the West Bank and the
Palestinians can go to Jordan- they won't be Israel's problem anymore. That is not a viable solution. The Palestinians won't stand for it. The Egyptians won't stand for it. The Jordanians won't stand for it. The Gulf states won't stand for it. And these are countries that
are not fundamentally Israel's enemies, but they will not tolerate it. So Israel must, must, must- at the same time they are
trying to destroy Hamas- they must create conditions for peace for the Palestinian people. And my concern about a ground war today on the ground in Gaza, is that they are creating the conditions to destroy Hamas without
creating the conditions for peace after Hamas. - The United States and Israel have been allies for a long time. What effect are you seeing
from the U.S. continuing to support Israel, and how could that play a role in the
future of U.S. politics? - I would say that Biden
could not be more supportive of Israel following the
October 7th attacks. His immediate decision
to make a trip there, the shuttle diplomacy by Secretary of State Blinken in
particular, the willingness of the U.S.
government to stay as long as the United States exists, that Israel will never
have to stand alone. Those are enormously powerful statements and they are statements that
are clearly shared in a broad and bipartisan way in the United States. But Generation Z, young people in the U.S. support the Palestinian position more strongly than they support Israel. And you have seen that
particularly on college campuses across the country, but also more broadly and many on the progressive
wing of the Democratic party. And I'm not just talking about
""the Squad"" and Rashida Tlaib and AOC I'm talking more
broadly are in increasingly, deeply uncomfortable with the extent of the Israeli military strikes against Hamas and the Palestinian
civilians in Gaza. All of the, all
of the human destruction that we are all witnessing right now. And President Biden has made it clear to the Israeli war
cabinet that the ability of the United States
to continue to provide unconstrained support
for Israel is a window that will narrow if the present levels of atrocities continue. So the conditions for peace are not just
about making sure the Palestinians have an opportunity to live, they're also about making sure
the Americans can continue to support Israel the way
they have here to fore. I think it is not guaranteed that in another four weeks time, the U.S. will still be
willing to provide the kind of military equipment,
high-tech, military equipment and support that they
have provided to Israel, historically, if Israel continues to fight the war the way
they have been fighting it, even the United States,
Biden and his cabinet and core members of Senate
in the house are facing that pressure from their
own progressive wing- and that is going to grow over time. I also think that this is
a risk for Biden in 2024 because this war right
now is primarily about Gaza and Hamas. But there are American carrier
strike groups in the Eastern med. and in the Gulf. They've already been
involved in direct strikes against Iranian Shia proxies in Syria. There will surely be more of those strikes in the coming weeks. American servicemen and women
have already taken casualties, not deaths, not so far,
but actually injured troops because of the knock-on impact of the war between Israel and Hamas. So if it turns out that the United States is
directly involved in a Middle Eastern war, that Biden has not
sold to the American people- he hasn't justified- you go from no wars started
under the Trump administration to two wars started under
the Biden administration. Neither of them started by Biden, but both of them, the American
taxpayers are paying for, and one of which the Americans
might be taking casualties. That is a very hard thing to run on if you are President Biden. And they know it. It also, the distraction of the Middle East and President Zelensky of Ukraine has just been
saying this has made it harder for people to focus on the
continued support for Ukraine, especially given a
counteroffensive that has failed. So you now have these two
massive global foreign policy crises both of which
are not looking so great for the United States
as we head into 2024. I, I expect that Trump, when he becomes the Republican nominee, and that certainly looks
very likely at this point, will make a meal out of that. That is a vulnerability
for the United States and Biden knows it. So this is very much not
just about the Middle East. This has implications for the
U.S. more broadly and globally. - A lot of people are viewing this as potentially a precursor to something like we would
see in World War III. What do you think are the factors that are keeping the
situation from escalating to a global conflict? And do you think it could
potentially escalate to a bigger conflict that involves a lot more
parties like the United States and potentially some other parties both in the region and globally? - We have seen that the
Iranian President has, and the Supreme Leader have
both said things publicly that imply that the world will burn because of what the
Israelis are doing in Gaza, but they use the passive voice. They are, they are very
careful not to say, ""We Iran will do X, Y, and Z."" They'll say, ""These are the
impacts that it will have."" These are, these are clearly
statements that are meant to put Iran at a distance
from direct involvement and engagement, even though
the Iranians are the ones that have provided weapons and
training and money for Hamas and for Israel's principle
enemies in the region. We've seen that from Lebanon. Nasrallah, Hassan Nasrallah who runs
Hezbollah, gave a really big and very strongly anticipated
speech where he said, ""You guys go Hamas,
you're doing a great job."" But certainly did not in any way imply that Hezbollah is going to
be out there fighting for and opening a second
front as a consequence of what Israel is doing
on the ground in Gaza. So, so far I would say we're four weeks in the likelihood of
expansion is significant, but nobody sees World War III coming anytime soon. What we have is an
expansion of Israel's fight against Hamas, and that means that we're
gonna see a lot, a lot, a lot more casualties. And as that happens, Israel will be under more
international pressure, there will be more antisemitism, there'll be more attacks against Jews, there will be more Islamophobia, there'll be more attacks against Muslims, there'll be more one-off
nuisance strikes against American bases in the region. There'll be more American
strikes against proxies of Iran. That is an expansion
of the war beyond Gaza. It is not a regional war. What we need to watch out
for for a regional war is that number one, Iran has influence over, but not operational control
over its proxies in the region. And as the war in Gaza gets bloodier, and if it looks like Hamas is really, truly losing everything that they have, there are others in the region
that may well be willing to fight and escalate against Israel and against Americans in
the region irrespective of what Iran does or does not say to them. So you can easily have farther escalation by those organizations themselves. The Shia militants
in Iraq, in Syria, the Houthis in Yemen in particular, they could also engage in strikes into the Straits of Hormuz. They could hit oil tankers that
could increase energy prices and create a global recession. Again, that would hurt
Biden very dramatically. We also, so far, thank God, have not seen significant lone
wolf terror attacks against Americans inside the United
States or in the region. We've already heard
from the head of the FBI and from others that that threat assessment is
higher than they've seen at any point post-9/11. That's a real concern. Obviously that's
something that can happen. If it does, the Americans
are gonna need to respond. So I, I don't think we
are anywhere close to out of the woods on this one. And I, while I'm, I'm deeply concerned about
people out there talking about World War III because I
really don't see that as a, you know, sort of proximate
risk, the likelihood that this can escalate in ways
that none of the actors want to see, but can happen anyway- I think that's a very real possibility. - This question comes from a
subscriber in our Big Think membership community. Is there a two-state solution
that ensures the rights of Palestinians as well as the
security interests of Israel? - I cannot see any environment where we have peace in
the region without a two- or three-state solution. Whether, you know, you have the Palestinians governed in the same way with the same institutions in Gaza and the West Bank are separate. I don't know. But clearly, the Palestinians must have the ability to live in peace on land that
they can defend and govern. Now we are nowhere close to that, but I think it was Henry
Kissinger that said that the time you get peace is
when both sides are exhausted. And he's someone that knows
a lot about fighting wars and war crimes, frankly, but also knows a lot
about negotiating peace. And I do think that we are oddly closer to a two-state solution today
than we were on October 6th. And the reason for that is because everyone in this region and with equities in this
region now understand that you can no longer
ignore the Palestinian issue. Or if you do, it's at your peril. So yes, the, we're still in a time of war and it's gonna get worse
before it gets better. But as we come out of this
war, the level of demand for finding a route for peace
between the Palestinians and the Israelis will
be far more prioritized. Much more capital will be expended on trying to make that happen. Some of that will be
humanitarian resources to try to rebuild Gaza. Some of that will be diplomatic
resources to try to come up with what a new Palestinian authority for Gaza might look like. Who would those people be and how would you build
such an administration? But you know, of course the more suffering we see in the coming weeks and months, I mean, if
you're already talking about half a percent of the
Palestinian population in Gaza is dead since October 7th; one of every 200
Palestinians in Gaza dead- and those numbers are going up. I don't know exactly
what those numbers are. They fight between the United Nations and between like, you know,
the Gaza Health Ministry, which is Hamas and you can't trust them, but the numbers are big. We know the numbers are big. Like every one of those
civilian deaths is going to make it harder to
get from here to there, right? We've already suffered the pain and tragedy to know that we need to move to a two-state solution. We know that. But the damage that you
can do to make that much, much harder and longer
term with the suffering that will be remembered for generations and generations, that is
a very different story. - Ian, thank you so
much for your time today and for the insights you're able to provide the Big Think
audience about this ongoing and complicated conflict. - It's great to be back with you. - If you found this conversation with Ian Bremmer valuable, we
would love to hear from you. Please respond with your feedback
in the comments about the format and the types of guests or topics you would like
to see in the future. Thanks so much for watching."
42,CISbbt1x2dc," Hello, friends! 1993 was the year when Israel and Palestine were very close to drafting a peaceful solution. But what happened after it that the situation worsened to the extent that today there is a war between them? If we want to understand today's crisis properly, we need to know the history first. This is why, in today's video, let's get to know the detailed history between the two countries. How did the country Israel came to be? And how did the conflict between Israel and Palestine begin?   Our story begins thousands of years ago. You must've heard about how terribly Hitler had treated the Jews. But do you know, the atrocities against Jews began thousands of years ago. It is said that Jesus Christ was born into a Jewish family. And some Christians believe that some Jews wanted to crucify Jesus Christ. This is a belief from an ideology that remained among the Christians for
several years, decades and even centuries. And when the crusades happened around a thousand year ago, Christians killed the Jews in large numbers. At that time, there were many rumours being circulated against the Jews that they drink the blood of Christian children, or that they use the blood for religious rituals. Because of these rumours, there was rampant hatred against the Jews. The hate that the Jews had to bear hardly any religion had to bear that in the last thousand years. After the 1800s, this hatred towards the Jews was not only because of religious reasons but also because the Jews were being seen as a different ethnicity as well. Because of all these reasons, till the late 1800s, Jews living around the world began feeling that no country accepts them as their own. If they wanted to live peacefully, they would need to create their own country. To create a Jewish country. There was an Austro-Hungarian journalist named
Theodor Herzl. He started a new political movement in his 1896 pamphlet. Zionism. He said that the Jews should get their separate country. At the time this wasn't a new idea. Since the 1870s, there were several organizations calling themselves Lovers of Zion. They were already propagating this idea. Because of these reasons, in 1881, the first large scale migration of Jews was seen in the Palestine area. The Jews built many permanent settlements in the area and started living there. Why did they choose the Palestine area? Because this was a very holy area for them. Jerusalem is the holiest place for the Jews. Do remember that at that time there was no Israel, Gaza or the West Bank. The whole area was Palestine. That fell under the Ottoman empire. Under the Ottoman empire, the Christians, Muslims and Jews lived together peacefully, more or less. There were no conflicts. One reason behind it can be that most of the land was empty. There were very few settlements on the land. And the population was very little in the area. Now we fast forward to the year 1915. World War 1 began. The British, French and Arab revolutionaries were fighting the Ottoman empire. The British play a clever hand here. They tell the Arab revolutionaries that in return for their support in defeating the Ottoman empire, they will give them the Palestine area. And the Arab revolutionaries were fighting to create a unified Arab country. The Arab revolutionaries wanted one Arab country from Syria to Yemen. The Britishers promise the same thing to the Jews. That they will help them to create their own Jewish country near Palestine. Why do they do this? So that they could appease the American Jews. And could gain influence on American politics. But in reality, the British made a secret deal with the French. As soon as the Ottoman Empire fell
after World War 1, Britain and France divided the Middle East area between themselves. The British took over the control
of the Palestine region. 1918-1948 the entire Palestine area was under the control of the British Government. At this time in Germany, Hitler gets political power. And the Jews are massacred in millions
in a genocide. Why did Hitler get political power? I made an entire video on it and I'll put a link to it in the description. You can watch that as well. The Jews flee from Hitler-controlled Europe to different countries to save themselves. Some get refuge in America. But many of these Jews go to Palestine. Britain allows them to enter Palestine initially. But later, they start stopping them from coming to Palestine. Because of this, an Israeli Nationalist Movement starts in Palestine. At the same time, around the 1940s, Palestine Nationalist Movement had also begun. And the Palestinians were also demanding their own country. In 1948 the British Government realises that enough's enough. And that they cannot remain there longer. They left the Jewish to form a Jewish country and
the Palestinians to form their own country. They accepted that they could not do that and ceded the responsibility to the United Nations. The British then leave Palestine. United Nations comes up with a partition plan. About the area to be allotted for creating a Jewish country and a Palestinian country. In 1947 the United Nations Partition Plan is released. In the plan, the United Nations keeps 57% of the area for the Jewish country And 43% of the area for the Arab-Palestinian country. Jerusalem is a very historically important area for three religions, for the Jews, Christians and Muslims. So the United Nations decided that Jerusalem would be under international control. The Jews accept this plan and name their new country Israel. Here, the Israel country is born in 1948. But unfortunately, the other neighbouring Arab countries weren't pleased with this plan at all. They believed that the plan was basically the Britisher's way of continuing their colonialism. So they start a war against Israel. Saying that they will not allow the Jews to take any part of the land. This war is named the First Arab-Israeli war of 1948. And this is a very historic war in and of itself. More than 5 countries were fighting against
a tiny new country. The Jews living in Israel knew that five years ago they had seen how the rest of the world treated them. How Hitler had treated them. And then all the Arab countries were starting a war against them. If they didn't fight to survive then, they wouldn't be able to survive ever. So to save themselves, they fought with all they had. And very surprisingly, Israel won the war. Defeating all these countries. After the war ends in 1949, the areas that were supposed to be Palestine's according to the UN Partition Plan, Israel occupied several of these areas. The Gaza Strip area went to Egypt. And the West Bank area went to Jordan. This meant that the Palestinians did not have a country any longer. More than 700,000 Palestinians had to leave their homes and become refugees in Arab countries. This is named the 1948 Palestinian Exodus. After this, in 1967, the Second Arab-Israeli War takes place. This war lasts for six days. And Israel wins this easily too. Not only does Israel occupy the Gaza Strip and the West Bank area but also this large Egyptian Peninsula gets occupied by Israel after this war. Palestinians want their own country. For this reason, in 1964, Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was founded. Initially, their aim is through armed struggle. To use weapons to get their own country. In the beginning, they also wanted that Israel should cease to exist. Because of this, the USA and Israel declare it to be a terrorist organization. But one thing that needs to be remembered is if you see them from the perspective of one person they'll seem like a terrorist organization and from the perspective of another, they're revolutionaries who want freedom for their country. In 1973, the Third Arab-Israeli War begins but it isn't very important for our story because, after that, nothing changes much. But in 1974, PLO gets officially recognized by the United Nations General Assembly. To be the representative of the Palestinian people. In 1979, the peace talks between Egypt and Israel is successful And Egypt becomes the first Arab country to recognize Israel as a country that exists there. After the Peace-Talks, the entire Egyptian peninsula area captured by Israel is returned to Egypt by Israel. The Egyptian and Israeli Prime Ministers both are awarded Nobel Peace Prize for this successful peace treaty. But unfortunately, after two years, the Egyptian Prime Minister gets assassinated. By the right-wing extremists in Egypt. The fanatics questioned the Prime Minister's treaty with Israel. They wanted to kill him because he reached a compromise. And so he was assassinated. From 1967 to the 1980s, It had been more than 10 years since Israel had occupied the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. During this period, many Israelis start establishing their colonies in the West Bank. They start building settlements and living there permanently. Israeli government supported them directly or indirectly. And the prices of the homes were low there. Some people go there for cheap housing while others for their religious nationalism. Some fanatic Israelis claim that the entire West Bank area is theirs. And so they'll reside there. And so Israeli settlements start cropping up in the West Bank area. The international community deems these settlements to be illegal because these settlements go against the United Nations Partition Plan. And the Palestinians see them as colonization. Basically, their country is being colonized by the Israelis. In 1992, Israel gets an amazing Prime Minister. His name was Yitzhak Rabin. He said that PLO is not a terrorist organization. They just want their country and the Israelis should let them have it. Israel officially recognized PLO. And in return, PLO officially recognized Israel as a country. And here the 1993 Oslo Accords take place. For the first time, both of them come together and talk. About how the country can be correctly and peacefully divided. About how the Palestinian country can be created. As a result, in 1994, the Palestinian Government is established for the first time. It is named the Palestinian National Authority. But at this point in time, Israelis had already established permanent settlements in many West Bank areas. Which were supported by the Israeli Government. And the Palestinians were living in few areas in bits and pieces. It was then decided to divide the West Bank area into three parts. Area A, B and C. Area A would be where the Palestinian government would be in control. In Area B both the governments will exercise control. And Area C will be the areas where the Israeli Government will retain control. Let alone the United Nation's Partition Plan In reality, in 1994, Palestine gets only some bits and pieces in the West Bank area and Gaza Strip to form their country. But the good news is that at that point in time, Israel and Palestine were very close to come up with a peaceful solution. For this reason, in 1994, the President of the Palestinian Authority - Yasser Arafat, and the Prime Minister of Israel Yitzhak Rabin were awarded Nobel Peace Prize. But unfortunately, after this, the whole situation goes downhill. When the extreme wight-wing Jewish people assassinate their Prime Minister. In the same way that Godse assassinated Gandhi Ji. Because Gandhi Ji talked about unity between Hindus and Muslims. A Jewish extremist shot the Israeli Prime Minister thrice from a pistol at point-blank range in 1995. These fanatic Jewish people questioned the compromise with Palestine. About why they were given any land at all. They wanted entire Palestine to be Israeli's. And because of these fanatics, the situation kept on worsening. Around 5-6 years before this incident, some Islamic fanatics in Palestine came together to form the HAMAS group. HAMAS group claims that the PLO is being too secular. And compromising a lot with Israel. But in reality, they want to erase Israel from the maps. So the fanatics created a new organization to fight for the eradication of Israel. And here the HAMAS group forms. Obviously when the peace treaty is signed around 1994 between Palestine and Israel the Jewish fanatics start hating their Prime Minister and on the other hand, the HAMAS group starts hating the PLO. All because they reached a compromise with Israel. Not only does the HAMAS group boycott the 1996 Palestinian election but they also carry out suicide bombings in Israel. Because of this, on both sides, the dominance of the extreme right-wing groups starts rising. There is increasing polarization. People on both sides, the Israelis and Palestinians start hating each other. Some hatred was already there and after 1995 it keeps on increasing. Around 2002, violent protests were seen on both sides. More than 100 Israelis and Palestinians died on the other side of the border. There are clashes on the ground and the people have become so sceptical of each other that Israel starts building walls around its settlements. Security guards are deployed around the permanent houses built by the Israelis in the West Bank and checkpoints are placed. And it continues to become increasingly difficult for Palestinians to live there. In 2006, the HAMAS militant group runs in the Palestinian election and wins. It defeats the PLO party, Fatah, but by a very small margin.  It wins 74 out of 132 seats. But after this, in 2007, a civil war takes place between these two parties in Palestine. Internally, the supporters of one party start fighting the supporters of the other. In 2007, this war is known as the Battle of Gaza. And Palestine is divided into two parts. In the Gaza Strip, HAMAS establishes its control. And the West Bank area is controlled by Fatah and PLO. Who are non-violent and rule the West Bank as a government should. But today when Gaza Strip is under the rule of HAMAS, they have basically occupied the area like a terrorist group. And like I told you in the last video, the war and the rockets that we get to see are sent from the Gaza Strip area to Israel. Whereas in the West Bank where the PLO is in control, this sort of violence is not seen there. So this is the situation today, friends. There is no doubt that Israel has continued to colonize the West Bank area for several decades. Causing the clashes to intensify. The recent clash, about which I talked in the previous video, was because Israel is occupying the areas in the West Bank. And the fanatics in Israel demand that the entire West Bank area be theirs. That the entire Jerusalem be theirs. And the fanatics in Palestine want to eradicate Israel completely. The most important question is
What can be the solution to this? Look at the map of Palestine. In the West Bank, the country is divided into so many parts That today if this country were to be given an independent government how will it exist in so many bits and pieces? Some people believe that a two-state solution can still be possible. That the area is divided on the basis of 1967. On the basis of Israel and Palestine. Some people say that the division needs to be on the basis of the 1947 Partition Plan. But if this is done then the most prominent question will be What will happen to the colonies of permanent settlement that Israel had built in Palestine? There are proper societies with homes and schools and hospitals and wide roads. What will happen to these areas if they are reclaimed by Palestine? There are hundreds of thousands of people living in the settlements in the West Bank. Here I will like to ask what do you think, friends? What can be the solution to this crisis?
This problem? How should two countries be divided? Write in the comments below. I hope you found this video informative, friends. If you want to take a lesson from this video,
in my opinion, it should be that Don't stop raising your voice against the fanatics! Let's meet in the next video. Thank you."," Hello, friends! 1993 was the year when Israel and Palestine were very close to drafting a peaceful solution. But what happened after it that the situation worsened to the extent that today there is a war between them? If we want to understand today's crisis properly, we need to know the history first. This is why, in today's video, let's get to know the detailed history between the two countries. How did the country Israel came to be? And how did the conflict between Israel and Palestine begin?   Our story begins thousands of years ago. You must've heard about how terribly Hitler had treated the Jews. But do you know, the atrocities against Jews began thousands of years ago. It is said that Jesus Christ was born into a Jewish family. And some Christians believe that some Jews wanted to crucify Jesus Christ. This is a belief from an ideology that remained among the Christians for
several years, decades and even centuries. And when the crusades happened around a thousand year ago, Christians killed the Jews in large numbers. At that time, there were many rumours being circulated against the Jews that they drink the blood of Christian children, or that they use the blood for religious rituals. Because of these rumours, there was rampant hatred against the Jews. The hate that the Jews had to bear hardly any religion had to bear that in the last thousand years. After the 1800s, this hatred towards the Jews was not only because of religious reasons but also because the Jews were being seen as a different ethnicity as well. Because of all these reasons, till the late 1800s, Jews living around the world began feeling that no country accepts them as their own. If they wanted to live peacefully, they would need to create their own country. To create a Jewish country. There was an Austro-Hungarian journalist named
Theodor Herzl. He started a new political movement in his 1896 pamphlet. Zionism. He said that the Jews should get their separate country. At the time this wasn't a new idea. Since the 1870s, there were several organizations calling themselves Lovers of Zion. They were already propagating this idea. Because of these reasons, in 1881, the first large scale migration of Jews was seen in the Palestine area. The Jews built many permanent settlements in the area and started living there. Why did they choose the Palestine area? Because this was a very holy area for them. Jerusalem is the holiest place for the Jews. Do remember that at that time there was no Israel, Gaza or the West Bank. The whole area was Palestine. That fell under the Ottoman empire. Under the Ottoman empire, the Christians, Muslims and Jews lived together peacefully, more or less. There were no conflicts. One reason behind it can be that most of the land was empty. There were very few settlements on the land. And the population was very little in the area. Now we fast forward to the year 1915. World War 1 began. The British, French and Arab revolutionaries were fighting the Ottoman empire. The British play a clever hand here. They tell the Arab revolutionaries that in return for their support in defeating the Ottoman empire, they will give them the Palestine area. And the Arab revolutionaries were fighting to create a unified Arab country. The Arab revolutionaries wanted one Arab country from Syria to Yemen. The Britishers promise the same thing to the Jews. That they will help them to create their own Jewish country near Palestine. Why do they do this? So that they could appease the American Jews. And could gain influence on American politics. But in reality, the British made a secret deal with the French. As soon as the Ottoman Empire fell
after World War 1, Britain and France divided the Middle East area between themselves. The British took over the control
of the Palestine region. 1918-1948 the entire Palestine area was under the control of the British Government. At this time in Germany, Hitler gets political power. And the Jews are massacred in millions
in a genocide. Why did Hitler get political power? I made an entire video on it and I'll put a link to it in the description. You can watch that as well. The Jews flee from Hitler-controlled Europe to different countries to save themselves. Some get refuge in America. But many of these Jews go to Palestine. Britain allows them to enter Palestine initially. But later, they start stopping them from coming to Palestine. Because of this, an Israeli Nationalist Movement starts in Palestine. At the same time, around the 1940s, Palestine Nationalist Movement had also begun. And the Palestinians were also demanding their own country. In 1948 the British Government realises that enough's enough. And that they cannot remain there longer. They left the Jewish to form a Jewish country and
the Palestinians to form their own country. They accepted that they could not do that and ceded the responsibility to the United Nations. The British then leave Palestine. United Nations comes up with a partition plan. About the area to be allotted for creating a Jewish country and a Palestinian country. In 1947 the United Nations Partition Plan is released. In the plan, the United Nations keeps 57% of the area for the Jewish country And 43% of the area for the Arab-Palestinian country. Jerusalem is a very historically important area for three religions, for the Jews, Christians and Muslims. So the United Nations decided that Jerusalem would be under international control. The Jews accept this plan and name their new country Israel. Here, the Israel country is born in 1948. But unfortunately, the other neighbouring Arab countries weren't pleased with this plan at all. They believed that the plan was basically the Britisher's way of continuing their colonialism. So they start a war against Israel. Saying that they will not allow the Jews to take any part of the land. This war is named the First Arab-Israeli war of 1948. And this is a very historic war in and of itself. More than 5 countries were fighting against
a tiny new country. The Jews living in Israel knew that five years ago they had seen how the rest of the world treated them. How Hitler had treated them. And then all the Arab countries were starting a war against them. If they didn't fight to survive then, they wouldn't be able to survive ever. So to save themselves, they fought with all they had. And very surprisingly, Israel won the war. Defeating all these countries. After the war ends in 1949, the areas that were supposed to be Palestine's according to the UN Partition Plan, Israel occupied several of these areas. The Gaza Strip area went to Egypt. And the West Bank area went to Jordan. This meant that the Palestinians did not have a country any longer. More than 700,000 Palestinians had to leave their homes and become refugees in Arab countries. This is named the 1948 Palestinian Exodus. After this, in 1967, the Second Arab-Israeli War takes place. This war lasts for six days. And Israel wins this easily too. Not only does Israel occupy the Gaza Strip and the West Bank area but also this large Egyptian Peninsula gets occupied by Israel after this war. Palestinians want their own country. For this reason, in 1964, Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was founded. Initially, their aim is through armed struggle. To use weapons to get their own country. In the beginning, they also wanted that Israel should cease to exist. Because of this, the USA and Israel declare it to be a terrorist organization. But one thing that needs to be remembered is if you see them from the perspective of one person they'll seem like a terrorist organization and from the perspective of another, they're revolutionaries who want freedom for their country. In 1973, the Third Arab-Israeli War begins but it isn't very important for our story because, after that, nothing changes much. But in 1974, PLO gets officially recognized by the United Nations General Assembly. To be the representative of the Palestinian people. In 1979, the peace talks between Egypt and Israel is successful And Egypt becomes the first Arab country to recognize Israel as a country that exists there. After the Peace-Talks, the entire Egyptian peninsula area captured by Israel is returned to Egypt by Israel. The Egyptian and Israeli Prime Ministers both are awarded Nobel Peace Prize for this successful peace treaty. But unfortunately, after two years, the Egyptian Prime Minister gets assassinated. By the right-wing extremists in Egypt. The fanatics questioned the Prime Minister's treaty with Israel. They wanted to kill him because he reached a compromise. And so he was assassinated. From 1967 to the 1980s, It had been more than 10 years since Israel had occupied the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. During this period, many Israelis start establishing their colonies in the West Bank. They start building settlements and living there permanently. Israeli government supported them directly or indirectly. And the prices of the homes were low there. Some people go there for cheap housing while others for their religious nationalism. Some fanatic Israelis claim that the entire West Bank area is theirs. And so they'll reside there. And so Israeli settlements start cropping up in the West Bank area. The international community deems these settlements to be illegal because these settlements go against the United Nations Partition Plan. And the Palestinians see them as colonization. Basically, their country is being colonized by the Israelis. In 1992, Israel gets an amazing Prime Minister. His name was Yitzhak Rabin. He said that PLO is not a terrorist organization. They just want their country and the Israelis should let them have it. Israel officially recognized PLO. And in return, PLO officially recognized Israel as a country. And here the 1993 Oslo Accords take place. For the first time, both of them come together and talk. About how the country can be correctly and peacefully divided. About how the Palestinian country can be created. As a result, in 1994, the Palestinian Government is established for the first time. It is named the Palestinian National Authority. But at this point in time, Israelis had already established permanent settlements in many West Bank areas. Which were supported by the Israeli Government. And the Palestinians were living in few areas in bits and pieces. It was then decided to divide the West Bank area into three parts. Area A, B and C. Area A would be where the Palestinian government would be in control. In Area B both the governments will exercise control. And Area C will be the areas where the Israeli Government will retain control. Let alone the United Nation's Partition Plan In reality, in 1994, Palestine gets only some bits and pieces in the West Bank area and Gaza Strip to form their country. But the good news is that at that point in time, Israel and Palestine were very close to come up with a peaceful solution. For this reason, in 1994, the President of the Palestinian Authority - Yasser Arafat, and the Prime Minister of Israel Yitzhak Rabin were awarded Nobel Peace Prize. But unfortunately, after this, the whole situation goes downhill. When the extreme wight-wing Jewish people assassinate their Prime Minister. In the same way that Godse assassinated Gandhi Ji. Because Gandhi Ji talked about unity between Hindus and Muslims. A Jewish extremist shot the Israeli Prime Minister thrice from a pistol at point-blank range in 1995. These fanatic Jewish people questioned the compromise with Palestine. About why they were given any land at all. They wanted entire Palestine to be Israeli's. And because of these fanatics, the situation kept on worsening. Around 5-6 years before this incident, some Islamic fanatics in Palestine came together to form the HAMAS group. HAMAS group claims that the PLO is being too secular. And compromising a lot with Israel. But in reality, they want to erase Israel from the maps. So the fanatics created a new organization to fight for the eradication of Israel. And here the HAMAS group forms. Obviously when the peace treaty is signed around 1994 between Palestine and Israel the Jewish fanatics start hating their Prime Minister and on the other hand, the HAMAS group starts hating the PLO. All because they reached a compromise with Israel. Not only does the HAMAS group boycott the 1996 Palestinian election but they also carry out suicide bombings in Israel. Because of this, on both sides, the dominance of the extreme right-wing groups starts rising. There is increasing polarization. People on both sides, the Israelis and Palestinians start hating each other. Some hatred was already there and after 1995 it keeps on increasing. Around 2002, violent protests were seen on both sides. More than 100 Israelis and Palestinians died on the other side of the border. There are clashes on the ground and the people have become so sceptical of each other that Israel starts building walls around its settlements. Security guards are deployed around the permanent houses built by the Israelis in the West Bank and checkpoints are placed.

43,Il-Vz6X2ygg," Hello, friends! The situation between Israel and Palestine has worsened so much so that it looks like a war. Thousands of rockets are fired
and many people are losing their lives. In fact, some kids lost their lives as well. This topic is so controversial that people across the world are divided in their opinion. Even in India. Two trends were at the top on Twitter. One, India Stands With Israel. And the other, India Stands With Palestine. Who is in the right here? Why did this topic and this war start again? Come, let's try to find out in today's video.   Friends, this is the map of Israel-Palestine. You can see where Israel is on this map
very clearly. But one needs to look for Palestine. The highlighted region on the top is known as the West Bank. And the thin green strip at the bottom
is known as the Gaza Strip. In this map, the areas in green are the places where Palestinians live. And the areas in dark green are the ones governed by the Palestinian government. But the pink area in the West Bank is where
Israel is in control. Some Israelis also live there. Don't you feel that this is a weird map? How can two countries exist as hundreds of different parts? There are more than a hundred parts. And if a person starts walking from the top to the bottom, he'll find that he starts in Israel, reaches Palestine,
walks further and then re-enters Israel. Even further and he's in Palestine again;
how is this possible? How can a country exist in more than a hundred different pieces? It has its own interesting history. I won't talk about the history in this video because it will make this video very long. I'll make a different video after this that will tell you the historical situation of Israel-Palestine about how this came to be. So it is not very surprising. If two countries exist in pieces surrounded by each other  there is bound to be a lot of conflict between them. In the middle of this map is the city of Jerusalem. A very holy city for the people from three religions,
Christians, Muslims and Jews. Jerusalem faces the same situation. West Jerusalem is under Israel's control and many Israelis live there. And in the East Jerusalem area, many Palestinians live there. And according to International law, it is a part of Palestine. But Israel has occupied that area. Israel believes that the entire Jerusalem city is theirs and should be so. And Palestinians believe that it is theirs, obviously. In the last several years, in East Jerusalem, many Palestinian families had to face evictions. Israeli Government is accused of forcefully evicting many Palestinian families out of their homes. On the other hand, if we talk about the Gaza Strip, the story differs there. Palestinian Government is not in control there. It is occupied by a militant group/ political party HAMAS. The Palestinian Prime Minister governing the dark green areas in the West Bank, even he doesn't have any control over the
Gaza Strip. Because HAMAS has occupied the entire
Gaza Strip. And some countries of the world like the USA, Israel, the European Union and Japan, these countries believe that HAMAS is a terrorist group. But on the other hand, there are countries like
the UK and Australia, that consider only the militant wing of HAMAS as a terrorist group. But there are also countries like China, Russia, Turkey, Iran and Norway, that do not consider HAMAS as a terrorist group. HAMAS and the Israeli military often launch rockets against each other. Though Israel has an Iron Dome. It is a very efficient defence system that keeps them protected against the rockets from HAMAS. The firing of rockets and airstrikes occur between Gaza and Israel. The West Bank of Palestine doesn't have much to do with it and no rockets are launched by them. Because Israeli people live there too. But at the same time, the borders in Gaza are clearly defined. Israeli people don't live in Gaza, it is very clearly a dark green strip. In fact, Israel has put complete blockades all around Gaza. On one side Israel has blocked it and on the other Egypt has blocked it completely. They have been economically cut off from the rest of the world as well. Because of this, the unemployment rate in Gaza is very high. The money that comes to Gaza is from the people across the world that want to help them. Help the people living there.  But most of the time HAMAS uses that money to buy weapons and launch rockets. So it is very important to understand this difference. The problems at the border and the problems of
evicting people out of their homes, where Israel is accused of illegally occupying the land, are in the West Bank. And in Gaza, there is HAMAS. Once that you've understood this background knowledge now let's talk about the current events. It can be said that the current issue began with the topic of Sheikh Jarrah. Sheikh Jarrah is a neighbourhood in East Jerusalem. Where many Palestinian families were ordered to leave their homes. Additionally, about a week ago, some extremist right-wing Jews had provocating rallies in the neighbourhoods of East Jerusalem. Where they carried the slogans ""Death to Arabs"". When these rallies passed, fights outbroke between the Jews and the Arab Muslim communities amidst heightened tensions. And these were inflamed by the extreme right-wing Israeli politicians. Like them. They gave extremely provocating speeches. They claimed that the whole city was theirs. And this led to the worsening of the situation. On 7th May, Palestinian people were protesting against these evictions. These protests turned violent. Stones were thrown, the Israeli police tried to control the situation. The police and the protestors crashed and people were injured on both sides. On 10 May, the Israeli police entered the Al Aqsa mosque rubber bullets were fired and stun grenades were thrown at the Palestinians there. At the people praying there. Israeli police claim that they had information the some Palestinians had collected stones to be thrown at the right-wing people of the passing rallies carrying the ""Death to Arabs"" slogan. After hearing the news of the mosque, the HAMAS group gave an ultimatum to the Israeli government to withdraw Israeli police from the mosque
or else they would attack. Even though the Palestinians living in the West Bank hardly have anything to do with HAMAS, but still, HAMAS posed as the representative of the Palestinians and gave this warning. And after some hours, started firing rockets at Israel. The HAMAS group launched thousands of rockets against Israel from Gaza. And when these rockets fell on Israel,
Israel retaliated with airstrikes on Gaza. Israel carried out more than 130 airstrikes on Gaza. And in the last two days, more than 40 Palestinian people have died. Including more than 9 kids. On the Israeli side, two Israelis have died
as well as one Indian person. The biggest question arising here is
Who is right and Who's wrong? There is no end to excuses on both sides to justify their actions. Israel claims that they carried out the airstrikes because HAMAS launched rockets against them. HAMAS says that they launched the rockets because the Israelis attacked the mosque. Israel says that they attacked the mosques because people were throwing stones there. And the people throwing the stones say they did so because their land is being unfairly occupied. And then those people will say that it was not an unfair occupation of land because it was a legal matter finalized in the court. And then the conversation will turn to history. There is no end to the excuses on either side. One excuse after the another. And then it'll lead to history about what happened in the 1967 war. But a few things are very clear that we need to remember in this situation, in my opinion. First, what do international observers have to say? European Union says that the evictions by Israel are illegal on humanitarian grounds and lead to tensions among the masses. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said that the law enforced by Israel is inherently discriminatory. And the sending of Israelis to occupy land is prohibited under International Humanitarian law and that it may amount to a war crime. So it is clear that Israel's occupation of the areas of the West Bank and eviction of Palestinians is wrong according to the International observers. But does that mean that the actions of HAMAS are right? Absolutely not.  In fact, the rockets of HAMAS are often pointed at the common cities of Israel where the common citizens are harmed. It is a good thing that Israel has such a good defence system, the Iron Dome, because of this, most of the rockets launched by HAMAS cause no destruction. And there are little to no casualties on the Israeli side. But if there were no protection against the rockets from HAMAS, many Israelis would've lost their lives. Violence as a response to violence
and even more violence to its response does not improve the situation;
it worsens the situation exponentially. Like Gandhi Ji had said, ""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."" Secondly, the situation as of now is that more than 60 people have lost their lives. Including more than 17 children. All of them were humans. But the unfortunate reality is that the extremists in Israel and Palestine do not see humans. They can see only terrorists. Israelis think that all the Palestinians are terrorists. And some Palestinians believe that all the Palestinians are terrorists. They don't see them as humans. The politicians and militant groups have instigated so much hate in people on both the sides That both groups of people cannot treat each other with compassion and respect. They behave like sworn enemies. This is why they keep justifying one act of violence after the other. ""We did this in defence."" ""We did this to protect our lives."" It needs to be understood that all the Palestinians do not support HAMAS. At the same time, all the Israelis do not support the Israeli Government or its actions. In the past, there have been politicians that have tried to maintain as much peace as possible. And they were assassinated by
extremist Israeli Jews. There are a lot of extremist people on both sides. The population of the extremist people are so significant that it is overpowering. And to term the entire country as terrorist because of this reason, to say that all the Israelis are terrorists, or that all the Palestinians are terrorists, is extremely wrong. If you say this, it will only increase the hatred on both sides. The third is the quote from Spiderman,
""With great power lies great responsibility."" Look at both sides, which side has more power? It is quite obvious. The military technology of Israel, its defence system, agencies like Mossad, It is next to impossible to compete against them. Israel is one of the best military powers in the world. With so much power, their responsibility is also enhanced. The organizations like HAMAS which is considered to be terrorists by Israel. If the terrorist group launch rockets at them, they do not have to respond similarly. They do not have to respond violently to violence. The Gaza airstrikes by Israel killed many civilians and children. And Israel has so much technology that they should take precautions to target only the rocket launchers and the terrorist groups. The children as not involved in terrorism. And to say that there will be casualties every time you target them is not right. Had your family member been there. And if there were terrorists in the next building. And your family member died because the building next to them was bombed, will it be justified? It will never be.  Especially when this is done by one of the top military powers in the world. These things need to be thought of. Remember them whenever you talk about this issue with anyone. And I will make a detailed video on the history of Israel-Palestine soon. You will get the answer to many questions when you see their detailed history. Let's meet in the next video. Thank you!"," Hello, friends! The situation between Israel and Palestine has worsened so much so that it looks like a war. Thousands of rockets are fired

On 10 May, the Israeli police entered the Al Aqsa mosque rubber bullets were fired and stun grenades were thrown at the Palestinians there. At the people praying there. Israeli police claim that they had information the some Palestinians had collected stones to be thrown at the right-wing people of the passing rallies carrying the ""Death to Arabs"" slogan. After hearing the news of the mosque, the HAMAS group gave an ultimatum to the Israeli government to withdraw Israeli police from the mosque
or else they would attack. Even though the Palestinians living in the West Bank hardly have anything to do with HAMAS, but still, HAMAS posed as the representative of the Palestinians and gave this warning. And after some hours, started firing rockets at Israel. The HAMAS group launched thousands of rockets against Israel from Gaza. And when these rockets fell on Israel,
Israel retaliated with airstrikes on Gaza. Israel carried out more than 130 airstrikes on Gaza. And in the last two days, more than 40 Palestinian people have died. Including more than 9 kids. On the Israeli side, two Israelis have died
as well as one Indian person. The biggest question arising here is
Who is right and Who's wrong? There is no end to excuses on both sides to justify their actions. Israel claims that they carried out the airstrikes because HAMAS launched rockets against them. HAMAS says that they launched the rockets because the Israelis attacked the mosque. Israel says that they attacked the mosques because people were throwing stones there. And the people throwing the stones say they did so because their land is being unfairly occupied. And then those people will say that it was not an unfair occupation of land because it was a legal matter finalized in the court. And then the conversation will turn to history. There is no end to the excuses on either side. One excuse after the another. And then it'll lead to history about what happened in the 1967 war. But a few things are very clear that we need to remember in this situation, in my opinion. First, what do international observers have to say? European Union says that the evictions by Israel are illegal on humanitarian grounds and lead to tensions among the masses. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said that the law enforced by Israel is inherently discriminatory. And the sending of Israelis to occupy land is prohibited under International Humanitarian law and that it may amount to a war crime. So it is clear that Israel's occupation of the areas of the West Bank and eviction of Palestinians is wrong according to the International observers. But does that mean that the actions of HAMAS are right? Absolutely not.  In fact, the rockets of HAMAS are often pointed at the common cities of Israel where the common citizens are harmed. It is a good thing that Israel has such a good defence system, the Iron Dome, because of this, most of the rockets launched by HAMAS cause no destruction. And there are little to no casualties on the Israeli side. But if there were no protection against the rockets from HAMAS, many Israelis would've lost their lives. Violence as a response to violence
and even more violence to its response does not improve the situation;
it worsens the situation exponentially. Like Gandhi Ji had said, ""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."" Secondly, the situation as of now is that more than 60 people have lost their lives. Including more than 17 children. All of them were humans. But the unfortunate reality is that the extremists in Israel and Palestine do not see humans. They can see only terrorists. Israelis think that all the Palestinians are terrorists. And some Palestinians believe that all the Palestinians are terrorists. They don't see them as humans. The politicians and militant groups have instigated so much hate in people on both the sides That both groups of people cannot treat each other with compassion and respect. They behave like sworn enemies. This is why they keep justifying one act of violence after the other. ""We did this in defence."" ""We did this to protect our lives."" It needs to be understood that all the Palestinians do not support HAMAS. At the same time, all the Israelis do not support the Israeli Government or its actions. In the past, there have been politicians that have tried to maintain as much peace as possible. And they were assassinated by
extremist Israeli Jews. There are a lot of extremist people on both sides. The population of the extremist people are so significant that it is overpowering. And to term the entire country as terrorist because of this reason, to say that all the Israelis are terrorists, or that all the Palestinians are terrorists, is extremely wrong. If you say this, it will only increase the hatred on both sides. The third is the quote from Spiderman,
""With great power lies great responsibility."" Look at both sides, which side has more power? It is quite obvious. The military technology of Israel, its defence system, agencies like Mossad, It is next to impossible to compete against them. Israel is one of the best military powers in the world. With so much power, their responsibility is also enhanced. The organizations like HAMAS which is considered to be terrorists by Israel. If the terrorist group launch rockets at them, they do not have to respond similarly. They do not have to respond violently to violence. The Gaza airstrikes by Israel killed many civilians and children. And Israel has so much technology that they should take precautions to target only the rocket launchers and the terrorist groups. The children as not involved in terrorism. And to say that there will be casualties every time you target them is not right. Had your family member been there. And if there were terrorists in the next building. And your family member died because the building next to them was bombed, will it be justified? It will never be.  Especially when this is done by one of the top military powers in the world. These things need to be thought of. Remember them whenever you talk about this issue with anyone. And I will make a detailed video on the history of Israel-Palestine soon. You will get the answer to many questions when you see their detailed history. Let's meet in the next video. Thank you!"
