1,R0ftmf_Uv9A,No matter how many times these information gets thrown to our eyes. The ignorant will remain put a blind eye to the oppressed which is sad.
2,R0ftmf_Uv9A,Let peace prevail.

8,R0ftmf_Uv9A,Thanks for the video. True history but youtube make it age restricted?
9,R0ftmf_Uv9A,"Very interesting thing is that ,if you will look the map carefully, Israel very smartly captured the areas 1st which are bordering to jordan  to block any type of access through Jordan! So,that it will be easier for Israel to capture whole Palestinian land!!"

11,Bno1m1zhIWs,"Finally. An objective concise summary with no religious,political,or racial agenda. Well done History channel."
12,Bno1m1zhIWs,Insane how the HISTORY channel of all places actually educated people about actual History and in a notably unbiased fashion.

16,Bno1m1zhIWs,Great Britain has caused so many problems through out history
17,Bno1m1zhIWs,"Here watching this in 2023... It's sad how it's just like a broken record at this point. So many innocent people dying just because of where they were born.... all over land, random religious beliefs and man made borders. I wish we could all just get along and share this gift of a planet together."
18,Bno1m1zhIWs,WOW Insane how the HISTORY channel of all places actually educated people about actual History and in a notably unbiased fashion. Nice!

23,0anQIEeLonA,"I've done some basic research on this subject over the years, but so much of what was presented in this video is new to me...I applaud the creators for giving such a concise and focused account, sharing each side's POV, giving us a much clearer view on the past and present situation üëèüèæüëçüèæ"
24,0anQIEeLonA,"As a Palestinian, I have always felt some bias from Indian media against us. But I have to be fair, you have done a good job summarizing the history of the conflict. Thanks"

36,iRYZjOuUnlU,Thank you for this video. It really cleared things up because I was misinformed by one of my acquaintances regarding the history of Palestine-Israel. I'd like to be educated more about this conflict.

edit: In order to not ruin anyone's day, I want to clarify that both  the Israeli military and Hamas are in the wrong here. What I was trying to say with that quote was that Israel had no right to do what they did in Gaza and the West bank"
40,E4iygQ--7dk,"Another thing, when britain received he mandate over the region, it divided palestina into two part, the eastern part was given to the Hashemite family from Saudi arabia in exchange for their support in the first world war. This is how the state of jordan was created, which is actually part of palestina. Most of the Jordanians are palastinian."
41,E4iygQ--7dk,"A Brief History of the name Palestine and its derivative Adjective Palestinian:

 1.	Palestine is Judea, the Roman name for ‚ÄòLand of the Jews‚Äô when the Roman Emperor Hadrian re-named this land as Palestina in 135 CE. Since then, it was never an Islamic State. [‚ÄòIn the 2nd century CE, the Romans crushed the Jewish revolt and Judea was renamed Syria Palestina‚Äô ‚Äì Jewish Virtual Libr.]

2.	The Pre-Islamic Arabs were in the Roman armies and witnessed both Jerusalem‚Äôs destruction and the name change of Judea. [Flavius Josephus Wars, Book V, Ch 13, 4]. As well, the Quran mentions Israel as the land of the Jews. Thereby, the Muslim people would be fully aware Palestine referred to the Jews for 2,000 years.

3.	The historical archives of the Persians, Greeks, Romans, British, French and Americans refer to Palestine as the ‚Äòhistorical homeland of the Jews‚Äô, not of the Muslim peoples. America‚Äôs early Presidents initiated Israel‚Äôs return prior to Britain and Herzl: ‚ÄúRestoring the Jews to their national home in Palestine is a noble dream. My emancipated hope is the restoring of the Jews to their nation home in Palestine‚Äù - President Abraham Lincoln to Canadian Zionist Wentworth Monk; 1863. 

4.	The term Palestine was introduced in the Hebrew Bible from the term Plishtim [‚ÄòInvaders‚Äô]. The Muslims disdained the name Palestine, as they do the term ‚ÄòZionists‚Äô today. In 1947, the Arabs virtually begged of Britain not to use this name for the land. Thereby, the usurping of this name in the 1960‚Äôs is not credible as a mark of land ownership, because it was not one of historical usage by the Arabs. 

5.	 A host of Islamic scholars and historians decried and rejected Muslims as Palestinians.: ‚ÄúAllah Gave the Land of Israel to the Jews. The al-Aqsa Mosque was built on top of Solomon‚Äôs Temple.‚Äù - Eleventh century historian Muhammad Ibn Ahmad al-Maqdisi and fourteenth century Iranian religious scholar Hamdallah al-Mustawfi // ‚ÄúThere is no such thing as ‚ÄòPalestine‚Äô in history, absolutely not.‚Äù - Arab-American historian and Princeton University Professor, Philip Hitti, testifying before the Anglo-American Committee in 1946] 

6.	A host of Jewish organizations and Institutions were called by the prefix of Palestine or Palestinian in the 20th century, including ‚ÄòThe Jewish Palestine Brigade‚Äô in Britain‚Äôs WW2 Military Forces; The [Jewish] Palestine Symphony Orchestra; Today‚Äôs Jerusalem Post media was called ‚ÄúThe Palestine Post‚Äù. 

7.	 There are no Arab Muslim Palestinians on record prior to the 20th century; the land was referred only as the homeland of the Jews. It is validated by a host of archives by many nations, and some one million Archaeological relics. Thereby, the nativity claim can only apply to Jews. In fact, there was never a time of no Jews in Palestine the past 2,000 years, as evidenced by the Crusaders, Islamic invasions and the previous Ottomans. 

8.	Generally, real natives do not usurp the name of other natives, especially one they disdained. [‚ÄúThere is a propaganda war going on now with regard to the term ‚ÄòPalestine.‚Äô It is specifically employed to avoid the use of the name Israel, and must be considered an anti-Israel term.‚Äù - Dr. Thomas McCall, the Senior Theologian of Levitt Ministry, quoting Zola Levitt.] 

9.	 The previous Islamic Ottoman rulers of Arabia declared Palestine as the homeland of the Jews. - ‚ÄúWho can challenge the rights of the Jews in Palestine? Good Lord, historically it is really your country‚Äù - Ottoman Mayor and scholar Yusuf Diya al-Khalidi; Jerusalem, 1899. 

10.	 Judea‚Äôs original, previous name was Israel in 1002 BCE, established under King David; and again in 1947 when this country was re-established by the UN. ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô is mentioned in the Quran as one belonging to the Jews. [Joshua J. Mark , Ancient History Encyl.) 

11.	 All Religious Scriptures acknowledge Palestine as the ‚ÄòLand of Israel‚Äô; ‚ÄòLand of Judea‚Äô; and ‚ÄòLand of the Jews‚Äô ‚Äì including the Hebrew Bible [1 Samuel 13:19]; The New Testaments [ ‚ÄòAnd he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.‚Äô - Matt. 2:21]; The Quran - [Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:20-21.]; and the Dead Sea Scrolls. 

12.	 The Original Philistines converted to the Hebrew Belief and became Israelites. The term Palestine is derived from the Philistines, a Greek Island people who invaded Canaan some 4,000 years ago. The Philistines converted to the Hebrew belief under a peace offer by King David, and held prominent positions in David‚Äôs army. [‚ÄúThey (the Philistines) met with a severe defeat, however, early in the reign of David (2 Samuel 5:20), he succeeded in reducing them to a state of vassalage (2 Samuel 8:1). In the year of the fall of Samaria (721 B.C.) they became vassals of Sargon. After the time of the Assyrians the Philistines cease to be mentioned by this name. In the ebb and flow of warring nations over this land it is more than probable that they were gradually absorbed and lost their identity. - [The Catholic Encyl.). / The Philistine cities lost their independence to Assyria, and revolts in following years were all crushed. [Myers 1997, p. 313.] / The theory of the ‚ÄúLost Ten Tribes‚Äù calls for (1) all inhabitants of the Northern Kingdom of Hoshea to be deported by Shalmaneser and Sargon, 722-718 B.C [Hearyhim, Weebly, Armstrongism] / They (the Canaanites) were indeed assimilated into the Israelite nation. When the Assyrians overran the Kingdom of Israel, they did not leave any Canaanite aside, as they had all become Israelites by that time. Therefore, the only people that can trace back a lineage to the ancient Canaanites are the Jews. The Canaanites did not exist any longer after the 8th century b.c.e. and they were not annihilated but assimilated into the Jewish people. - [The True Identity of the So-called Palestinians, imninalu] / The Bible describes the Philistines as remaining ‚Äúsubdued‚Äù during David‚Äôs reign [Philistine; New World Enycl.]/ Josephus, Antiquities, Book 11, Ch.1] & [Esdras 13:39] Q. How then did the Muslims become Palestinians, an adjective of Palestine, in the 1960‚Äôs, and have been using this name as the antithesis of Judea and Israel¬¨¬¨¬¨? A. The Palestinian Name Deception: Those in the West who manoeuvred this name upon Muslims did so to mock, if not desecrate, the history, belief and culture of the Muslim people. Thereby it should be overturned by honourable Muslims."
42,E4iygQ--7dk,Your 1967 Map is wrong this was not occupied land.
43,E4iygQ--7dk,Well it seems that the creator of this video skipped a few HISTORY lessons.
44,E4iygQ--7dk,History starts from canaan period not 1946
45,E4iygQ--7dk,Wonderful explanation..
46,E4iygQ--7dk,"* and the muslims and christians were living next to each other * Who were the first in  State of Isreal ? . The Christians ,The Ottarmans or Muslims"
47,E4iygQ--7dk,Looks like a rat nibbling cheese
48,E4iygQ--7dk,"ü§£THAT IS NOT a map of Palestine In 1946 LOL ""Palestine"" the country or well ""the state of palestine"" didnt even exist yet. In fact in 46 Israel didnt even exist lol. It was founded in 2 years later, and the state of palestine over 40 years later. That ENTIRE area was British Mandate Palestine, which wasnt even a country first of all and then named it after the roman name of Syria Palestine, which the romans had renamed from ""Roman Province of Judea"", after beating the jewish revolt and expelling jews from their land, they renamed it after the jews historical enemies, The philistines (which have NOTHING to do with Palestine or modern day Palestenians) SO NO, that is NOT a map of ""Palestine in 46.. I mean if within the first 3 seconds you cant be unbiased, and historically accurate why even bother tackling this incredibly complex subject?"

50,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,What do you think of the conflict going on right now?
51,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,the history of the two seem very different depending on who‚Äôs telling the story.
52,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,"So much hurt and pain. Both Arabs and Jews have been on that land. I remember when I was a grade school girl our graduation from 8th grade. We had watched the movie Exodus and selected a song from that to sing during our ceremony. I still remember the words ‚ÄúThis land is mine God gave this land to me.‚Äù

Hearts and minds need to change toward each other. All believe in the God of Abraham, we are brothers. My prayers and the prayers of my spiritual group are holding that whole area in a bright golden light of gold bringing wisdom, intelligence, and love to the entire Middle East.

Now that I am almost 80 I pray I may see the peace I sang for so long ago."
53,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,As someone who has some Jewish ancestry my best friend living there and having cousins all throughout Israel and knowing some good honest Palestinian Americans it‚Äôs just sad
54,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,We want peace! No more war
55,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,"I think ti is time to find a proper solution - understanding, peace, respect , and acception of each other"
56,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,"""When a foreigner resides with you in your land, you must not oppress him. You must treat the foreigner living among you as native-born and love him as yourself, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God."" Leviticus 19:34"
57,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,"Some reading for people interested in knowing more about the issue:

Enemies and Neighbours: Arabs and Jews in Palestine and Israel, 1917-2017 by Ian Black;
Anonymous Soldiers: The Struggle for Israel, 1917-1947 by Bruce Hoffman;
1948: A History of the First Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War by Benny Morris."
58,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,"If you zoom out for a moment and just look at the two people you must state that whatever noble and/or religious goal they thought they had when they took up the fight as invader or occupant, it has surely long since outweighed any rational basis for building a future and/or living in peace by committing murder and genocide in the process. That is what happens when a seemingly righteous religious or national cause becomes fanatism, even terrorism, and bigotry of the worst kind."
59,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,Good conclusive video
60,6foH3Zc82ZQ,it's unbelievable that nobody mentions or blames the British for setting up the region for failure.
61,6foH3Zc82ZQ,I'm blown away by the Jewish solder laughing when he was asked how many Palestinians he had killed. No loss of life should ever be met by laughter.  This has truly troubled me
62,6foH3Zc82ZQ,"As I say, you don't have to be a Muslim to feel the pain, you just have to be a human"
63,6foH3Zc82ZQ,never let a british guy near a map and ask him to draw borders
64,6foH3Zc82ZQ,"Watching a documentary that presents the formation of modern Israel in such a grim light is personally jarring for me. I had long held the view of Israel as a sanctuary for a people who had suffered immeasurable atrocities. To suddenly be confronted with the idea that its foundation is marred by acts of violence, terrorism, and potentially even genocide against Palestinians shakes the core of what I thought I knew. It's like experiencing a form of betrayal, where a narrative I held to be virtuous is revealed to have dark undertones. It's not just an intellectual exercise in reassessing history; it's a gut punch that makes me question the stories we're told and the stories we choose to believe. It's a painful reckoning with complexity in a world that's easier to navigate in black and white."
65,6foH3Zc82ZQ,"What blows my mind is that after experiencing all the atrocities and persecution in Europe, Jewish people went and did pretty much the same thing to Palestinians."
66,6foH3Zc82ZQ,A lot of people are not informed about this history especially the younger generation. Knowledge is of great importance.
67,6foH3Zc82ZQ,"This sounds similar to how British split India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Once they understood they couldn't trouble anymore actively,  they left a passive trouble as a separation gift. The entire Indian Subcontinent is still enjoying that gift!"
68,6foH3Zc82ZQ,"I think the more you try to isolate yourself as ‚Äòthe chosen people‚Äô based on your religious believes, the more you will always want to fight to stay separated from other nations. As long as that‚Äôs the belief, the war will never end. No one is too special or more equal than another, we are all mere human beings just passing by, just live in harmony with others."
69,6foH3Zc82ZQ,Most of the misery in the world is created by the UK and US

72,RW105kjNtho,"Great job timeline, but terrible that they have to censor videos that show historical moments because You Tube is afraid to let people see how brutal times were."
73,RW105kjNtho,"Great verbal conveyance of history.  HOWEVER, NOTE TO YOUTUBE:  The images were filmed and photographed to ACCURATELY DOCUMENT THE REALITIES OF GIVEN EVENTS.  Digitizing out death & destruction that actually occurred, denies the depth and complete truth of a story and history, itself.  It may also support the efforts of those who would wish those realities softened and dismissed as never having had happened."
74,RW105kjNtho,This series came out a long long time ago. What‚Äôs really sad is that people are just now watching this. It‚Äôs not perfect but it definitely a start
75,RW105kjNtho,"This is also why Africa is and been in the state it's in, because of the English, French and Belgium."
76,RW105kjNtho,Dang Timeline quick wit it
77,RW105kjNtho,Thank you for having this treasure trove of interviews and perspectives to release at such a confusing and disheartening point in our time.
78,RW105kjNtho,I am ashamed that I served in the Middle East and had no idea of the full history of rationale of it all. Thank you for the insight on what caused the tension.
79,RW105kjNtho,"The part about the Arab communities having a strong case but no good advocates, and the Jews having a weaker case but excellent advocates is a perfect summary of how this panned out."

100,kI_spMxp6t8,As a uk citizen I agree with you. We have done so much damage over the decades.
101,kI_spMxp6t8,"Think of a scenario: someone came into your house as a guest and you let them stay. But within a few days he said that he's also the owner of the house, and after a few more days he kicked you out of YOUR OWN HOUSE.

The same thing happened with the people of Palestine, they were the house owner and now Israel forcefully trying to kick them out of their own lands."
102,kI_spMxp6t8,"I don't know... the whole ""We're God's chosen people"" thing doesn't sound that much different than Hitler declaring the Germans to be the master race to me."
103,kI_spMxp6t8,What right did America and Britain have to sign off another man's land to another people? This is the root cause of the conflict in the Middle East.
104,kI_spMxp6t8,"My father was born in Haifa, which was then British Palestine, in 1944.  To a British father and Palestinian mother.  When he was 4 years old, my grandparents took him to England on holiday (to see family) only to be refused back due to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.  So they had to settle and set up their life in the UK.  My grandmother was once part of the aristocracy and she ended up living on a council estate in Portsmouth and became working class.  It's strange to think that I am a product of war; I would not exist if that war had not broken out."
105,kI_spMxp6t8,I want to see more information on this topic but it does seem to be a major issue. I must admit that I agree with the people of Palestine. Israel seems to be more evil in their actions to steal the land of Palestine. I think this situation should have been treated differently and all of this violence will not happen.
106,kI_spMxp6t8,"Similarly in India, British left in a rush and left India and Pakistan fighting against each other."
107,kI_spMxp6t8,"Excellent video for explaining how things in Palestine got to be this way. Sadly, wherever the British left after Empire, they brought chaos in their wake as in Partition in India also.  Utterly distraught for the Palestinian people, robbed of their land and though I understand the need for Jewish people to have a place of safety, to treat others as they themselves were once treated is beyond any rational comprehension."
108,kI_spMxp6t8,"Compared to western reworks on this topic, this video is qualitative and truthful. Thank you, you are doing indispensable work against hypocritical reporting."
109,kI_spMxp6t8,"Bear in mind - especially to those who regurgitate Hamas, Hamas - that the Zionist state was created in 1948 and immediately started land expansion and occupation, forcibly removing indigenous Palestinians from their ancestors land.

Now back to Hamas, an organization created in late 1980s after the first uprising against the brutal occupation. Hamas was not that relevant until early 1990s. So what was going on these previous decades before Hamas came to the scene? Same occupation, brutal murders, forceful removal of people and lands, farms being stolen expanded and kept happening.

Hamas can disappear tomorrow and the situation would be far worse than what it was before they appeared. Just look at the brutal occupation that is West Bank and how utterly subjugated Palestinians live in an open air prison, their daily lives completely controlled."
110,ZXfuqUhzESg,Britian as well as many European nations on history have started many conflicts around the world that people are still suffering from in those respective countries.

It would have helped to explain a lot of what was to follow like our support of the Mujahideen's war against the Soviet Union, 9/11, the Gulf War, Operation Iraqi Freedom, the war in Afghanistan, and what's happening now with Hamas and Israel."
113,ZXfuqUhzESg,"It is very good to see a piece which gives such a clear history of the deals, both secret and open, which have led to the conflict which continues.  It is important for everybody to understand how this has come about."
114,ZXfuqUhzESg,For everyone genuinely seeking to understand & be educated on history thank you. Thank you to the documentary filmmakers of the excellent documentary. I‚Äôm thankful you made this free. This deserves an award.
115,ZXfuqUhzESg,"I appreciate the work that went into making this documentary. Whoever you are, thank you."
116,ZXfuqUhzESg,"It's funny how we get the rawness of history through the windows of documentaries and such a like, but never taught in the educational system."
117,ZXfuqUhzESg,"By far this is the very best documentary on The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict that I have ever seen!
Beautifully created and laid out!"
118,ZXfuqUhzESg,One might argue that events in the area are much older. However the Balfour Declaration created an enormous amount of very difficult issues that we are encountering today. It's really time for ALL parties to sit down at the table. Things can not continue to go on this way. It might already be too late.
119,ZXfuqUhzESg,"An incredibly important and well presented documentary.
This is a must watch for anyone who is interested in understanding how the stage was set so many years ago for the hugely significant events that are playing out right now in the present day."
120,zE8GCX1w3ys,I‚Äôve been trying to figure this conflict out. The problem is every video has a different narrative.
121,zE8GCX1w3ys,You left out the part where 2/3 of the area was given to create Jordan.
122,zE8GCX1w3ys,"Historical fact; The Romans changed the name of Judea to Syria Palaestinia in 135 AD after the Bar Kokhva Revolt, which is sometimes called the Third Jewish-Roman War. At the same time, the Romans expelled most Jews from the province. The purpose was to destroy the cultural identity of the province, and spread the Jews throughout the empire in order to prevent another revolt."
123,zE8GCX1w3ys,Absolutely wrote his own history of this situation please people do your research and make your own decisions
124,zE8GCX1w3ys,The way he emphasizes the 27% when speaking about the Jewish population rising really says it all.
125,zE8GCX1w3ys,What about the 3000 years before the first world war? And you failed to mention the Balfour agreement.
126,zE8GCX1w3ys,Lol ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go back to the beginning 1916‚Äù üòÇüòÇ oh yea that‚Äôs totally the beginning
127,zE8GCX1w3ys,"I appreciate that this video provides a few details that I had never heard before.  However, you mention ""arbitrary arrests"" and the construction of walls without mentioning the suicide attacks that precipitated them.  This is a critical mistake that calls your intentions into question.  How can I trust these new details if you leave out such obvious ones?"
128,zE8GCX1w3ys,"Up until 4:00 , his complaint would be with the British and the UN.
Immediately after that, there is no mention of Arab nations attacking Israel.
So are all of the other historical sources wrong, or is he merely choosing to omit any facts that might support Israel?"
129,zE8GCX1w3ys,Bro graduated from Wendy's kitchen üíÄ
130,F1H1SA0F_wY,"I will never forget what my highschool history teacher said, ""history is written by the winners..."" therefore its onesided. I stand with humanity and the right to survive. I stand with the innocents and civilians on both sides; the people who want peace. Corrupt governments and extremist groups are damaging in so many ways. Neither side will stop until everyone is dead in a wasteland. This is devastating."
131,F1H1SA0F_wY,After doing research on this subject i find it hard to side with one side or the other. Both have done terrible things to each other and it blows my mind how people so far removed from this conflict can be so confident in the side they support. This is an extremely complicated matter.
132,F1H1SA0F_wY,"I think that creating a homeland for Jews after the atrocities of the Holocaust during WW2 was in theory a good one. An idea that was well-intentioned. However, in tangible and practical terms Palestinians were displaced from their homes and have had to suffer in order to create this homeland. I'm not sure it was right to create suffering for one group of people in an attempt to to alleviate the suffering of another. It was well-intentioned I believe, but I do not understand how it was ever thought that it could work. Was there not even a consideration that it might cause resentment by the Palestinians? (I am NOT by the way, saying that extreme violence commiting war crimes or taking hostages  is the answer! I am in no way condoning violence or war of any kind). I am simply saying that it seems naive to think that it would not have caused problems between the Jewish people/ Israelis and The Muslim/ Palestinian people, to believe that everyone would just live in harmony..."
133,F1H1SA0F_wY,"For someone who had no idea or context on what has been happening, I'm grateful for this video. Thanks"
134,F1H1SA0F_wY,I pray that we can just live in peace and harmony one day
135,F1H1SA0F_wY,"Imagine going to sleep and waking up in the middle of a violent war with no end in sight, oh my goshüò¢"
136,F1H1SA0F_wY,"It's quite shocking and shameful that they say the world is full of educators, entrepreneurs, humanitarians, leaders, explorers, innovators, visionaries, politicians, political scientists, professors, philanthropists, scholars, rich people, rich countries, and religious leaders, yet no one has been able to provide a permanent solution to this problem."
137,F1H1SA0F_wY,This is probably the most informative explanation of current situation than any other news media. Thank you!
138,F1H1SA0F_wY,"One thing I never see explained in these videos, and perhaps the most significant part of why this conflict has persisted (and probably will for generations), is the religious side to this conflict which crucial to understand: that Jews and Muslims of Palestine both believe the area we know as Jerusalem was given to them by the God/Allah as their ""promised land / Zion"".  For muslims, it is the place where Muhammad ascended to heaven. Back in the 19th century when politics and religion were very intertwined, leaders made political decisions from religious standpoints, leading to this conflict in the first place. Understanding the religious emotions of the conflict is step one."
139,F1H1SA0F_wY,"As long as people keep focusing on differences, there will be war. Instead of seeing ourselves as American or Iranian or whatever, we should see ourselves as humans. We are all one big human family and everyone's internal dialogue is much more similar than we could imagine. Hamas needs to stop the violence and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank needs to end. Either everyone becomes a citizen of Israel with the same rights or the illegal colonies are given back to Palestine so they can have their own state. I think that saying that Israel is a country for the Jews is a fascist/racist statement. Imagine starting a new country and saying it's a country for white people for example. People would go crazy and rightly so. We should aim to make everyone feel welcome and valued in every country on earth. I don't understand the obsession with dividing ourselves."

145,6MVz5MBNqsw,Brilliant job on this. History rather than opinion.   It makes me even prouder to be a member of the time ghost army.
146,6MVz5MBNqsw,"This was a fantastic replay of history. My favorite part is Sparty's butchering of the word ""ha'atzmauet"" at 1:04:30 which was hilarious. It's a tough word for a non hebrew speaker, don't feel bad, i got a good chuckle!"
147,6MVz5MBNqsw,Thank you for taking the courageous decision to do this episode
148,6MVz5MBNqsw,leaving this comment section open? I too like to live dangerously
149,6MVz5MBNqsw,"I, as an Israeli, appreciate how you explain the conflict without storm into lies and misinformation that only exists in order to create hatred. In the end my generation pay for the sins of the past and the radicals of the present. ""If two fish are fighting in a river,¬†a long-legged Englishman has just passed by."""
150,sR0DsXH0bT4,Should I make a video on who should India support?
151,sR0DsXH0bT4,I feel sad for the children from both the sides. What have they did to go through this? No child should see war.
152,sR0DsXH0bT4,I cannot even imagine how the common people are facing the problems. They all are innocent. This is just heartbreaking
153,sR0DsXH0bT4,This is clearer than any history class I‚Äôve ever taken. Thank you for this!
154,sR0DsXH0bT4,"Thank you for making such a complicated situation easier to understand. I have been avoiding learning about it because it was so complicated, confusing and overwhelming, but after your video I feel like I understand it a tiny bit."
155,sR0DsXH0bT4,I love how she isn't fearing anyone and is voicing her opinions freely.‚ù§
156,sR0DsXH0bT4,Imagine being born into a war and growing up in it and then dying in it. Without having a choice. Just imagine that.
157,sR0DsXH0bT4,"Simple & clear narration. Especially, the analogy comparing India & Pakistan, was even better. Thanks Keerthi."
158,sR0DsXH0bT4,Who's right and who's wrong always seems to change depending on when you start measuring time.
159,sR0DsXH0bT4,"WOW, amazing video! This conflict has really been bothering me lately as I am majoring in Social Sciences and it's something that comes up relatively often. Politics is a massive element of the course. There has been so much misinformation regarding this conflict it's been so hard to understand what is right and what is wrong. Finally, after months of researching, your video allowed me to finish my report. Before watching your video my report was sitting at 5000 words but thanks to your video, I was able to write 3000 more words! Writing this report has been the best experience I've had at university so far and I just wanted to thank you for helping me achieve this."

161,OdENyo4HvX4,"That Churchill quote is one of the most deliberate, blatant admissions of racist conviction I've heard from a world leader within this century."
162,OdENyo4HvX4,"You could argue that Churchill was a product of his time, but at his core he was a ghastly, ignorant, evil, and extremely racist individual."
163,OdENyo4HvX4,"The more and more I learn about Winston Churchill, the more evil he is. When you‚Äôre younger all anyone says is how great he was in Ww2 and never elaborates. I wonder why"
164,OdENyo4HvX4,"ive made a playlist of videos trying to understand the conflict in Isreal, this video is by far the easiest to understand, most detailed, and most compassionate and empathetic video of all the ones ive seen. Thank you so much for your help üçâ"
165,OdENyo4HvX4,What I appreciate about this video is a feeling like you're encouraging people to investigate for themselves but planting sign-posts along the way like a good guide.  It's like teaching people how to study history and you're guiding them to do that for themselves well.
166,OdENyo4HvX4,That Churchill quote is bone-chilling.
167,OdENyo4HvX4,23:08 - Churchill sounding a lot like Adolph with this one.
168,OdENyo4HvX4,"Trying to offer a truly nuanced approach to this conflict is like trying to thread the eye of a needle by moonlight.  Well done, Then & Now. Thank you for the work that you do."
169,OdENyo4HvX4,I have never heard about that quote from Churchill before...Thank you for letting me know that he said this. I will remember it for the rest of my life.

172,4r1EmEni2Rw,That video explained everything to me to get a better perspective on this conflict.¬†
173,4r1EmEni2Rw,"People get so angry in the comments. Guess what, the problem ain't gonna be solved on youtube"
174,4r1EmEni2Rw,"what's confusing about living in Israel is that they teach you specific things, but when I talk to Arabic they say other things. and while I'm trying to be unbiased, it's really hard. I don't really think there's a way to resolve this conflict. There will always be people who won't want peace and some that don't want war. the only thing we can do as people is lay back and hope things go right."
175,4r1EmEni2Rw,You do know that arabs are not all muslim right? We are Christians too
176,4r1EmEni2Rw,just give the Palestinian people back there home so we can all be happy
177,4r1EmEni2Rw,"It's has explained the issue in a really crystal clear form what I was looking for.
Thank you so much."
178,4r1EmEni2Rw,Great video. The solution is one secular state giving equal rights to all.
179,4r1EmEni2Rw,This is like explaining the Balkans. Ten minutes is ten centuries too short.
180,Azs7As3MYFU,"For more background, view the additional media at https://ryanmcbeth.substack.com

The conflict is essentially one of homeland.  British Mandate Palestine promised Israel to both the Arabs and the Jews if they agreed to fight against the Ottoman Turks during World War I.  Israel's subsequent war of Independence created a refugee crisis that is still ongoing to this day.

181,Azs7As3MYFU,"If there's any place on Earth where the phrase, ""and the plot thickens"", is appropriate, it's the Israeli -Palestinian border."
182,Azs7As3MYFU,"Everyone tiptoes around this conflict. For years and years I had no idea about the specifics. I just knew it was a sensitive subject. Most people just say, ""It's complex."" That was usually enough to discourage me from placing any effort into learning about it. Thank you for a clear and concise summary."
183,Azs7As3MYFU,Thank you. I have been reading articles on this for a week now trying to get my head around things so I can understand what is going on and why. You‚Äôve explained it perfectly in 5mins.
184,Azs7As3MYFU,Your point about historical tribal conflicts over territory reminds me of a conversation I once had with a colleague (of Mexican descent) about the Arab-Israeli conflict. I remarked that nobody calls the American Southwest ‚Äúthe occupied territories.‚Äù  He promptly replied: ‚ÄúI do!‚Äù üòÇ
185,Azs7As3MYFU,Did not expect you to get SO MUCH solid information into 5:20.   Well done.
186,Azs7As3MYFU,Thank you for this. This is the first time in my 40 years that ive actually understood the situation. Its definitely a messy one.
187,Azs7As3MYFU,"It really amazes me, when someone digs into conflicts across the globe, usually history starts with: ""so, the british came.."""

190,MknerYjob0w,Watch Next: What Your Taxes Pay For in Israel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLZRmKXmmc
191,MknerYjob0w,It‚Äôs sad that a lot of people are only finding out about this now (including myself). It shows how the sufferings of Palestinians are being buried.
192,MknerYjob0w,"The world ended apartheid in South Africa through a massive boycott, but if you call for the boycott of Israel, you‚Äôre denounced as antisemitic, it‚Äôs absurd"
193,MknerYjob0w,"I had no idea this was going on.  As a South African that lived through apartheid, this is unacceptable.  How is Israel allowed to get away with this?"
194,MknerYjob0w,"20 years ago I spent 3 miserable months in the Westbank during the 2nd Intifada. Took only 3 minutes for me to understand Israel is an apartheid state. 
Only the stubbornly ignorant or pretending to be claim otherwise."
195,MknerYjob0w,As a black American I had no idea the Palestinians were being subject to these mistreatment. This is just wrong on so many levels
196,MknerYjob0w,"Yes. My mother, who is a white, American, Christian, was married to a Palestinian man and lived in Bethany/Al-Eizariya for two years. She had to go through checkpoints and show her papers (just like Jews did in the ghettos imposed by Nazis); she was forbidden to enter certain parks and public places because they were ""for Israelis only"", but Israelis would go to spaces reserved for Palestinians and would stand around and laugh and jeer at them. IDF had tried to enter her house for no reason, she was twice detained at the airport for no reason, on one occasion the armed guard told her if you try to leave I'll shoot you. She was holding my infant sister. She has seen IDF fire at Palestinian ambulances, and tells me that Israelis frequently harrassed Palestinians in the street. The Israeli government took her father-in-laws olive grove, building a wall behind his own yard blocking him off from his trees that had been in his family for generations and forbidding him from harvesting them."
197,MknerYjob0w,As a South African this sounds exactly like Apartheid
198,MknerYjob0w,"As an African who basically learned bout Israel from bible studies when I was younger, growing up n learning bout how the Israeli state was formed is really an eye opener n it‚Äôs very sad to see how Palestinian people are forced to live Israel, can‚Äôt imagine spending half my life in a small city that‚Äôs constantly bombarded, I hope the whole world comes to a peaceful resolution for this conflict n give Palestine people their basic rights as humans"
199,MknerYjob0w,"Living in the United States we are fed media that is completely one sided.  I have learned that from my time overseas and seen for myself what happens elsewhere that the US media reports on incorrectly.  Thank you for making these videos to allow us to see the other side of this conflict.  This is a real eye opener for me.  I had no idea.  I can appreciate your hard work in putting this all together for those of us that are educated enough to research, listen and keep an open mind."

224,lv1SpwwJEW8,I just can‚Äôt believe all the horrible things that were happening in the world as I sat in school learning ‚Äúhistory‚Äù
225,lv1SpwwJEW8,"For a massively in-depth, granular understanding of the conflict I'd strongly recommend Darryl Cooper's ""Fear & Loathing in the New Jerusalem"". It's universally considered even-handed/fair and gives very specific details about every event at the root of the animosity. Be warned though, it's very long."
226,lv1SpwwJEW8,"Whew. ""If this didn't happen, then something else would've happened because the status quo was unsustainable."" It's the first time I've truly understood that sentiment. Curious if a 2 state solution will ever be possible.  Just so sadüôèüèæ"
227,lv1SpwwJEW8,Take a shot whenever you hear ‚ÄúBritish occupation‚Äù in a history video. You‚Äôll never be sober.
228,lv1SpwwJEW8,Gotta love how the video conveniently skipped talking about Egypt AT ALL despite being the only other country with a border crossing with gaza and a big factor in many of the issues discussed.
229,lv1SpwwJEW8,"My heart goes out to all the victims on both sides. Regardless of politics or one sided media, I think we can all agree that killing innocent children, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and grandparents isn't something to be taken lightly, no matter what the nationality or the viewpoint.

242,GR-embMmMQc,I have learned so much from this video in 12 minutes than all the analysis of the conflict presented by major news channels. A big thank you.
243,GR-embMmMQc,"Lady, you just taught me stuff in less than 13 mins which my entire school and college syllabus could not. Thank you"
244,GR-embMmMQc,"I couldn't wait to subscribe. 
If every teacher teaches like this, no student will fail an exam. The simplicity with which she told the story was topnotch ‚ù§ That was clear and informative."

253,IDj0ghd7xMs,"Thank you, this was very informative"
254,IDj0ghd7xMs,I have a feeling religion plays a huge role in all this unnecessary conflict
255,IDj0ghd7xMs,"The conflict will be way less complicated to you if you study the history, needs and concerns on both sides of the conflict. But that's a problem. For some weird reason, everybody seems to choose a position and either become violently anti-Israel or obnoxiously anti-Palestine. It is those who want 100% recognition and zero concessions ‚Äìthose who don't really even want to move forward‚Äì who say it's a complicated never ending story. Because that serves their purpose."
256,IDj0ghd7xMs,"""I own this land cause one of my ancestors lived here more than 2000 years ago"" indeed a VERY egotistical complicated conflict."
257,IDj0ghd7xMs,it all stems back to religion and people don't admit it even though it's incredibly obvious
258,IDj0ghd7xMs,Why is it so complicated? Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ 4mins15secs should cover it.

266,pjtQ4Jmxh_8,"FANTASTIC Video! Did an amazing job showing how both sides are guilty of terrible acts towards one another and even towards themselves.

I hope this goes viral so people learn the actual history and not the Anti-Israel or Anti-Palestinian versions we see so often today."

270,oIWqTIFRlYU,British rule was the root of this problem.
271,oIWqTIFRlYU,"So basically the British promised both Jews and Palestinians the same land? Britain told Arabs help us take down the Ottoman and this land is yours, then told Jews help us take out the Arabs and it‚Äôs yours‚Ä¶then just handed the issue to the UN?"
272,oIWqTIFRlYU,"I think you forgot to talk about Britain asking the arabs and jews for help to fight the Turks (Othomon empire who was ruling Jerusalem) in world war one in return for land. I think that false promise to both sides for the same land was the root of the problem. The british did the same thing in other parts of the world, e.x. Pakistan -India, etc

It was colonials basically causes the problems now with simple short term solutions in the past."
273,oIWqTIFRlYU,"How can one people, promise a second people the land of a third people"
274,oIWqTIFRlYU,"In 1914, Britain made a promise to the Arabs. If they help the Allies split the Ottomans, Britain will help the Arabs, including the Palestinians, to establish their own state.
In 1916, Britain also promised France to run Palestine together.
In 1917, in order to win the support of the Jews, Britain promised to establish a Jewish national home in Palestine. This is the Balfour Declaration."
275,oIWqTIFRlYU,"The funniest thing is seeing self-righteous Western audiences morally deliberate over this conflict from the luxury of their web browser, deciding who's ""right"" and who's ""wrong"", as if they're the universe's moral authority."
276,oIWqTIFRlYU,"This is sad, for innocent people."
277,oIWqTIFRlYU,"Thanks for helping to explain how the initial conflicts began.  I had some knowledge, but I didn't know it started so early."

286,8kCTMyh1oqw,"And morgan keeps asking: ‚Äú do you condemn Hamas?‚Äù, he himself never condemns israel for 75 years of atrocities"
287,8kCTMyh1oqw,"I was a kibbutz volunteer in 1980 (not Jewish and certainly not a Zionist Fascist). I was shocked to discover that the kibbutz I was on, was an Arab village in 1948 before they were forced to leave.

I had a young Israeli friend in the IDF. He told me a story of a friend of his. One day his friend's IDF unit encountered PLO fighters. However, between the IDF unit and the PLO were a group of Palestinian women and children. The captain of the IDF unit ordered the friend to kill the PLO. He refused, because it would also have meant killing the Palestinian women and children. The captain then ordered another member of the IDF unit to kill the PLO. The women and children were killed along with the PLO fighters. My friend's friend was then put in a mental asylum for 5-years for disobeying that order. It shows that some Israelis have a conscience, while others are no different to the German Einsatz Gruppe in WWII. It's interesting to juxtapose the Palestinians humility against the Zionists hubris. But as we all know, hubris always precedes a great fall. The Land of David, will be rocked to it's core, for sure.

Going back to my time on the kibbutz, the one observation that I would make of the British and US Jews that came out there was their attitude of entitlement. That governs the Israeli psyche and it's the label on it's begging bowl to the US and to the World. The loss of 6 million Jews to Nazi genocide does not justify Israel doing the same to Palestinians. 

I for one don't believe October 7 was just a random act. I believe it was orchestrated by Israel to deliver it's goal of invading Gaza. Exactly the same false flag operation occurred on 9/11 to swing US public opinion for a military invasion of Afghanistan."

290,m19F4IHTVGc,Who else is trying to know whats happening  between Israel and Gaza as of now??
291,m19F4IHTVGc,Is it just me or most of us here are trying to understand the complex history of the current war in order to explain to our friends and family that wont stop asking us to tell them about it. You did a great job with this video I must say. I'm not surprised it has almost 8million views
292,m19F4IHTVGc,that ticking time bomb statement at the end was so true considering recent events. My heart goes out to all innocent civilians who are experiencing tragedy.
293,m19F4IHTVGc,For those confused by the ‚Äúsix day war‚Äù because the narrator is saying ‚Äúsixty day war‚Äù - it was the Six day war. Lasted 6 days.
294,m19F4IHTVGc,"I was working in Lebanon in 71. My partner and I got out with support from one of our customers in Cyprus. Before leaving, we could see the rocket fire from where we were staying.

295,m19F4IHTVGc,I finally have a grasp on why there has been so much conflict in the region!  Thank you for being so informative!
296,m19F4IHTVGc,I am 43 yrs old and this is the first time I've heard a brief description and yet almost complete break down of the Israeli and Palestinian war without hearing ANY bias for either side. Just the facts. THANK YOU!
297,m19F4IHTVGc,"A really informative video, thank you. The fact that this whole confilct has it's roots in a 2000+ year old claim to 'religious land' absolutely baffles me. It's utterly ridiculous that co-existence isn't possible over this."
298,m19F4IHTVGc,"Despite some imprecise pronunciations & a couple ""typos"", clear, concise & unbiased summary of a very complex history. Everyone should watch this. The last warning hits hard."

311,Lb3v8M8dzic,Thank you for this. Really helped explain the WHY behind what‚Äôs going on right now. And also what is completely missing from current MSM reporting
312,Lb3v8M8dzic,Thank you for this report. It's helped me a lot to begin to make sense of War between Palestine and Israel. I am praying for all the innocent people being affected on both sides of the border.
313,Lb3v8M8dzic,"The Israeli and Hamas conflict underscores the tragic consequences that can arise when religious differences lead to violence and division. In the pursuit of lasting peace, it's essential to transcend religious divides and prioritize the well-being of all people, regardless of their beliefs. Embracing secular values, such as human rights, equality, and diplomacy, can pave the way for a more peaceful and inclusive future where conflicts are resolved through dialogue and cooperation rather than religious affiliations. Art, as a powerful medium, can guide our morality by fostering empathy, promoting tolerance, and inspiring us to envision a world where humanity's shared values and aspirations unite us rather than divide us. Literature, in particular, has the unique ability to create open-minded perspectives by exposing us to diverse viewpoints, cultures, and ideas, which can ultimately lead to greater understanding and empathy among individuals and communities. Curiosity, not a belief in a deity, is the key to a fulfilling and meaningful life, driving us to explore, learn, and connect with the world around us in our shared human journey towards peace and enlightenment."
314,Lb3v8M8dzic,"Learning of the current Gaza war has led me in need of much education. Finding your video at this time makes it even more vital to hear a  complex issue presented clearly: you make sense of Jerusalem's centrality to three major religions. But how is it possible that such steps, leading to the most egregious attacks on  prayer in what should be a safe and respected religious site at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, should pass us by?  And how is one surprised that one day an eruption occurs, when freedom to pray and work and be is near buried?"
315,Lb3v8M8dzic,Thank you. This is so informative and the presenter is excellent with a very good delivery of the information. Excellent keep up the good work.

326,JZIIOp38KYU,"You should have also mentioned that even the Opposition party supports their PM in the fight against Palestine. This kind of mindset of putting nationalism above politics is why Israel has achieved its stature today. If that same sense prevails in India, then it can even become one of the veto powers in future."
327,JZIIOp38KYU,Man you have guts to speak up the truth! Hats off to you Sir!
328,JZIIOp38KYU,REally appreciate your effort to make it clear the situation. I have been meaning to look for this. A truth seeker from Pakistan
329,JZIIOp38KYU,"Sir, you never fail to simplify complex things in such a lucid manner ! This was beyond brilliant !"
330,zdq3NVtT6Nc,The fact that U.S. media thinks it can give you the history of Gaza in 2 minutes speaks for itself üíØüíØüíØ
331,zdq3NVtT6Nc,"The British played a key role in the creation of Israel too, when they were occupying Palestine they made a promise to hand it over to the Jewish people in order to win support from them during ww1. They made good on their promise (after ww2) with the help of the UN, leaving alot of Palestinians displaced and causing a huge amount of resentment in the middle east"
332,zdq3NVtT6Nc,You left out the sykes picot agreement during WW1. That one is extremely relevant to where we are today.
333,zdq3NVtT6Nc,"Ironically British created most of the world‚Äôs biggest conflicts like Kashmir, Gaza, Tibet etc."
334,zdq3NVtT6Nc,CNN telling history is the funniest thing I have seen today
335,zdq3NVtT6Nc,So basically they settled on land without any conciliation from the people who were living there.... and they wonder why they have problems  :/
336,zdq3NVtT6Nc,Why did you leave out the 1948 conflict?
337,zdq3NVtT6Nc,"You mentioned the proclamation of the establishment of Isreal but you forgot to mention the ethnic cleansing of Palistineans that followed in 48. So I'll point it out instead of you by quoting the Isreali historian Ilan Papp√©. 
""Once the decision was taken, it took six months to complete the mission. When it was over, more than half of Palestine's native population, close to 800,000 people, had been uprooted, 531 villages had been destroyed, and eleven urban neighbourhoods emptied of their inhabitants. The plan decided upon on 10 March 1948, and above all its systematic implementation in the following months, was a clear-cut case of an ethnic cleansing operation, regarded under international law today as a crime against humanity.""

- THE ETHNIC CLEANSING OF PALESTINE BY ILLAN PAPPE."
338,zdq3NVtT6Nc,"Imagine if the United Nations gave half of the United States to Iran, would any American agree?How can the united nation give a portion of a land they don‚Äôt own?"

344,NeZ4yXyzUG0,"Very few people can be so bold to say what you said and at the same time be so humble to think the way you do. Unfortunately, because we need more people like you Trevor."
345,NeZ4yXyzUG0,"""Whose right and who's wrong depends on when you start measuring time."" Perfectly said. A thought ALL need to think about. This is 2 years old; here in November 2023"

347,NeZ4yXyzUG0,"That was beautifully and compassionately said. Thank you, Trevor, for having the courage to state your opinion and to express this question."
348,NeZ4yXyzUG0,"Trevor is unlike any comedian i know  , he puts efforts in building his opinions and perspectives around things while making making sense of it all at the same time , the fact that he can be clear , direct and considerate each time he talks makes my respect for him grow , Trevor you're a legend"
349,NeZ4yXyzUG0,"""They can crush Gaza like that""....those words sear my mind as we fast forward 2 years."

356,cfkUE5Q0K04,It‚Äôs ironic that such supposedly holy lands are filled with so much hatred.
357,cfkUE5Q0K04,I am appalled and saddened that 40 years after this documentary the conflict still continues and innocent lives are ended in the most horrific ways.
358,cfkUE5Q0K04,"I'm Aramaic.
 Why doesn't anyone talk about the Aramaeans who have lived there for thousands of years? They were tortured and sometimes slaughtered by Jews and later by Ottomans. Things weren't going well for them among the Europeans either. Nevertheless, thousands of Aramaeans still live in Jerusalem, Bethlehem and the surrounding area today. They were not left alone among any of these peoples. Today I spoke to my relative there. They are never mentioned!"

Can't we say with the same logic: ""If Israel surrendered and laid down its arms that would be an end to the conflict"" ?"
361,FH9uVw-d35c,Why not tell Israel to stop the occupation and stealing Palestinians land.
362,FH9uVw-d35c,"Matthew Miller: ""If only the Palestinians would unconditionally accept Apartheid without resistance then they could have peace.""

If Apartheid, inequality and militarized brutality is what Miller means by ""peace"", then it's no wonder it's unsustainable."
363,FH9uVw-d35c,Israel doesn‚Äôt need spokespersons when it has these.
364,FH9uVw-d35c,"This spin makes me giddy. But obviously, if one side (Israel) laid down its arms, or at least withdraw, then the conflict would end. If Hamas were to lay down its arms, do you believe that the occupation would end? Do you believe the blockade would end? Do you believe the Nakba would end? Or the ethnic cleansing would end?

Does the US admin really believe that a Hiroshima/Nagasaki solution is the answer? The US had no intention of displacing the Japanese from Japan after that catastrophe."
365,FH9uVw-d35c,"‚ÄúEvery record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.‚Äù
‚Äï George Orwell, 1984"
366,FH9uVw-d35c,Always blaming Hamas when Israel is doing the killing.
367,FH9uVw-d35c,Matt Miller always looks and sounds like he is giving a book report for a book he has not read
368,FH9uVw-d35c,So he wants Palestinians to surrender to the occupation? Why doesn't he say the same for Ukraine?
369,K5tcwIicICg,This was great. We need long-form content from experts with intelligent questions asked sensitively.
370,K5tcwIicICg,One of the most nuanced explanation I have seen in mainstream media. Wow.
371,K5tcwIicICg,"Do people understand that this is what political science and historical studies actually do all the time, as best they can? Rational argument, differentiated, detached analysis, correction of viewpoints based on new data and new relevant interpretations? There are far too few people like Ian Bremmer who transport this knowledge into the public sphere, which instead is being swamped by the social media toxicity he refers to. Thanks, Big Think!"

411,x_isZHaZjcU,"This documentary left out the Egypt border, saying Gazans were stuck due to Israel borders on all sides. Egypt has an equally solid border because despite being Muslim they don‚Äôt like Palestinians. They allowed them to live in Egypt for a time but the Palestinians decided to attempt to overthrow the Egyptian government. Not a smart move."
412,x_isZHaZjcU,"I think it's safe to say this is the most complex conflict there exists. It's not black and white like many people try to portrait. We cannot say that there is a clear ""good"" and ""bad"" side in this conflict. May there be peace one day, although I think we won't see that in our lifetime."

Human kindness is not only a  virtue but also the means to survive peacefully, as Humans. My father's head was chopped because he wa just a farmer, growing millets, sorghum, maize, groundnuts, beens and even okra and more. 
_Do we have to hurt each other to this extent, Benjamin Netanyahu? No, Humans will always be Humans. The worst of us are like pests that just keeps bugging. Kakuma was my refugee Camp and I know the pain."

A home which we had owned for 6 whole generations was destroyed to make way for Jewish roads and settler movements without our knowledge. For hundreds of years, me and my family tree (dads side) had owned this land, and once it was flourishing with livestock, a market place, plants and trees for any fruit/veggie you could think of, a good university nearby, a mosque, a comfortably sized home, etc. Until Israeli settlers, dare I say unrightfully stole the land we‚Äôd been making for so long and claimed it as theirs. We now own 1/5th of the plants we used to and the other livestock, market place and house are now occupied by Israeli settlers completely not under our control. I now live in America but my grandparents unfortunately couldn‚Äôt afford to go to America so they illegally snuck outside the refugee camp we‚Äôd been out into and into Jordan. They were deported to Kuwait and that‚Äôs where my parents were born. My grandparents didn‚Äôt have enough money to go to America or stay in Kuwait so they moved back to a small, shady apartment in Jordan where they live now. It could‚Äôve all been so different though. Better even."
549,O454c_qs5kI,"If you take the time to learn the history behind all this, in my opinion, the reason why there‚Äôs conflict between Israel & Palestine , it‚Äôs because of the British back during pre world war 1 to world war 2. The British made a lot of bad deals between the 2-nations which led to a big mess where it is today. Now England is just hiding in the shadow hoping no one brings up their old history presence in the Middle East."
550,O454c_qs5kI,"I never thought Fox News would be the best source of information on a topic, but here I am"
551,O454c_qs5kI,"This is OK for a quick crash course, but it kind of conveniently left out a few things. Nothing on settlers? Nothing on the blockade of Gaza? It makes it seem like a two-sided territorial dispute without much characterization of what each territory is like other than ""densely populated."""
552,O454c_qs5kI,Why are all these companies telling me to stand with Israel? No
553,O454c_qs5kI,I am not a Fox fan but I see somewhat balanced news and comments. Great job gentleman
554,O454c_qs5kI,So you focused on ‚ÄúJewish being persecuted and fleeing Europe‚Äù but not ‚ÄúPalestinian forced out of their home en masse.‚Äù Let‚Äôs be objective here shall we?
555,O454c_qs5kI,"A nice attempt to explain what's going on ??
But some of the real important questions need to be answered?
Why did England want to create a State of Israel ??"
556,O454c_qs5kI,"Good presentation and generally historically correct. What is missing in the conversation is the current apartheid mindset. For some 20 years Israel has segregated the Palestinians in two reservations (Gaza and the West Bank). In an effort to quell hatred of Israel and attacks - the Palestinians in these reservations face embargos and live in hopeless poverty.  Uprisings (intifada) happen regularly due the poor conditions in these reservations. These current acts of inexcusable terrorism by Hamas will bring even more oppression and misery to the Palestinians. That said, there will be no peace until both sides are willing to talk and compromise. As long as both sides see war as the only solution there will be only war."
557,O454c_qs5kI,This might be the most comprehensive and intelligent explanation of anything I‚Äôve ever seen on Fox News.
558,O454c_qs5kI,"The U.S. needs to stay out of it and fix our own issues. Then, we can (and should) help."

602,OLr_VCqnId0,I‚Äôve missed this show. One of the most clarifying.
603,OLr_VCqnId0,"I can't believe the amount of work that went into this video!! thanks for making such a clear overview of the conflict, it helps a lot to get a better understanding of what's been going on, without all the propaganda :S looking forward to part two !!"
604,OLr_VCqnId0,On the YT channel: The Balfour Project watch Dr Ralph Wilde‚Äôs webinar on how Britain broke international law to prevent Palestinian Independence. All the other neighboring countries were given independence after the defeat of the Ottoman Turks after WW1. The British plan for Palestine was to give the land to Russian and European Zionist Jews with preferential immigration policies (Jews only) and forced land exchange to favor the Zionist Jews over the Palestinians. We would not have anything like all the endless wars in the Middle East nor the genocide in Gaza without this interference by Great Britain.

619,QUCeQt8zg5o,Thanks for watching everyone. Tell us what you think in the comments below.
620,QUCeQt8zg5o,"I'm someone who was born and raised in the United Arab Emirates. In the 90s I was living in a neighborhood which had Palestinians who were teaching Mathematics, Science and Literature at UAE government schools. Now I'm connecting the dots as this documentary shows 50% of Palestinian youth were literate by 1948. This documentary makes sense"
621,QUCeQt8zg5o,"Here in Greece, our parliament voted to recognize the Palestinian state back in 2015. All parties agreed for the first time to something, but no government since then upheld that decision. Now government and media, are trying to deform the truth about the heroic Palestinians, but we the people of Greece, are standing with them. Fredom to Palestine."
622,QUCeQt8zg5o,"As a Bulgarian I'm grateful for all the documentation and evidence that has been preserved, helping us make sense of the past and not forget how things used to be. In all honesty, I don't understand how anyone could ever believe that the region was ""a land without people"", some underdeveloped desert. One doesn't need to have studied too much about history or how human civilisation develops to have one look at the map and know that this was a cultural and commercial centre. Thank you for your work!"
623,QUCeQt8zg5o,"""What happened in 1948 is too brutal to talk about. It's indescribable.""  My eyes were filled with tears as I looked at him.  OMG, words are not enough to describe what they had to endure during those moments.  Yeah, it's ""indescribable."" üò£"
624,QUCeQt8zg5o,"This was a great documentary, it showed how Palestinian was a hustling and bustling country full of life culture, and well educated people, A special thanks for AL JAZEERA DOCUMENTARY and all the journalists who prepare this memoriable for the history of PALESTINE."
625,QUCeQt8zg5o,"I have never been this much interested or educated about Palestine and its people. Reading more and more about it makes me really sad, I can't believe I've been unaware of the sufferings that Palestinians have been going through for years. Thank you for such an informative video! I pray and hope Palestine will be free from the occupation and its people will finally be fully happy in their own homeland. I also hope that the war in Gaza will stop very soon, insha'Allah ü§≤"
626,QUCeQt8zg5o,I can relate as a  South African whose prople were displaced in their land of birth. Forced to luve in a 13% of the land and more than 80% of our rich land stolen by the colonizers . It for this reason that I support the Liberation of the Palestinian people.  Thank you Aljazeera for sharing.
627,QUCeQt8zg5o,Really great documentary. The whole world should see this! Thank you so much for helping us to realize the truths. I felt the truths in this. I cried in the end. That poor man whose Dad died when they cut down his trees. God help them.
628,QUCeQt8zg5o,Thank you Al Jazeera for this documentary. May the Palestinians be given the justice they deserve. May they find peace and forgiveness in  their heart too.
629,aPI5TmdVZCk,"In my study of the Bible, I knew this relationship and in fact I always used to say that the war in that part of the world is between brothers!"

634,aPI5TmdVZCk,A perfect narrative of the facts in complete accordance with the Holy Bible. It‚Äôs a complex problem that started thousands of years and made much more complicated with religious divisions. Brave hearts on both sides are required to come together and agree on a 2-state solution which will benefit millions of people living in perpetual fear and poor economic conditions. May God bless them to take the first courageous step towards establishing lasting peace in the region.
635,aPI5TmdVZCk,"Very informative, thanks for sharing, I wish God interveins and bring back peace to the two brothers, am tired of seeing the killing of young and old."
636,aPI5TmdVZCk,Very informative and interesting. Thank you for sharing üôè
637,aPI5TmdVZCk,A fight between two brothers can be the most ferocious. A point in case is the fight between Cain and Abel. May these two find peace because the land is big for both peoples

640,0aM7RjXE1xo,"Search ""How Israel Was Created"" and watch a video clip of how the Palestinian have their land stole from them, and ""Is Israel Guilty Of Apartheid Against Palestinians?"" to see how the Palestinian have been living under an apartheid system from the oppressive Israel system."
641,0aM7RjXE1xo,"History Lesson, you the media keep calling this the West Bank? Your Graphic Map is not correct.
It didn‚Äôt become the West Bank until 1948 when Jordan attacked the Jews.
For 4,000 years before that it was called Judea and Samaria, Israel was split in Two. That is the Holy Land of the indigenous people of Israel. Israel was destroyed by the Assyrians in 722 B.C.E.
Judah and Jerusalem fell to the Babylonian Empire and was destroyed in 586 B.C.E.

War and Empires determined Borders, over 4,000 years ago, so what is different today, the Jewish Nation has survived that long and is only defending what was their original Borders.
What do you think France under Napoleon, Germany under Hitler, and Britain did under various Kings and Queens did? Fought Wars to establish Borders. Today Wars are still fought to determine who owns what. Human history is that of Conflict, that is the one Constant that keeps Wars going.
My Ancestors were Vikings, who do you think shaped the various nations of Europe, why do you think War and Peace has survived for so long, it‚Äôs human pastime, a Game of Thrones.
The modern Borders were drawn by the West, without regard to the history of the various indigenous people, and you wonder why you still have Wars today?"
642,0aM7RjXE1xo,And she said the Palestinians were there before? Is this a joke??

681,klXaDgmM8Fs,This is brilliant. Very well explained - and from a year ago! The unshakeable bond between the US and Israel astonishing. Even unto self-evident mass genocide of Palestinians. Thank you. Jeff .... Poole ... UK

683,cn3RUZsaPmg,Poor Arabs they don‚Äôt know hypocrisy üò¢
684,cn3RUZsaPmg,This is what happens when one side is fighting for pride and the other is fighting to exist.
685,cn3RUZsaPmg,"Truly God never leave Israel, and He always keep his covenant to Jacob....Amen."
686,cn3RUZsaPmg,"It is not secret who sponsors this channel. 
But twisting history and facts in a sea of evidence and records is another level. 
People can just believe everything just like that is yet another miracle in itself."
687,cn3RUZsaPmg,"Not a word about the intensive and inflammatory Arab propaganda campaign  in the months preceding the war, the constant threats of annihilation of Israel and of throwing the Jews off to the sea.
Not a word about Nasser closing of Tiran straits, which he knew to be a casus belli for Israel.
On the other hand, not a word about the 70,000 Egyptian soldiers stuck on the quagmire of the Yemen war, which the Egyptians could not use against Israel.
I'm not sure about the description of this war as a ""non-war"", or a goose chase. Israel had 776 killed and 4500 wounded, for a very small population."
688,cn3RUZsaPmg,"Imagine invading a country, losing badly, invading again, losing badly, invading again, losing badly, and then you try to play victim."
689,cn3RUZsaPmg,"I don't know, maybe it's just me, but if a powerful adversary threatens to push you into the sea, you need to do what is necessary to prevent it."
690,cn3RUZsaPmg,Just loved The ‚Äúimpartiality and seriousness‚Äù of Al jazz era üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ now seriously‚Ä¶ I enjoyed this arab version.

692,oHlx5fB94bc,"""Most Zionists don't believe that God exists, but they do believe that he promised them Palestine."" 
~ Ilan Pappe"
693,oHlx5fB94bc,"As a Jewish person, I am revolted that people with such a long history of religious and ethnic persecution would persecute others on the same basis."
694,oHlx5fB94bc,The settler lady in the Occupied West Bank telling about Peace whereas she lives in  an illegal land is so insane.
695,oHlx5fB94bc,"The audacity of that woman, Daniella. How hypocritical she is, settling on a land that does not belong to her and saying that they are peaceful. I mean..."
696,oHlx5fB94bc,"Wow Just wow!! The sheer audacity to say that people will never have sovereignty and will be kicked out of their homes where they lived for generations while absolutely glorifying the settlers, just INSANE!!"
697,oHlx5fB94bc,Imagine someone breaking into your home and telling you that they used to live here 2000 years ago and that‚Äôs why you have to leave now. It‚Äôs a crime.
698,oHlx5fB94bc,"As a Native American it sickens me to see colonialism occurring like this, all in the name of religion‚Ä¶"
699,oHlx5fB94bc,This woman's audacity to take people's land and property and tell them that they will never have sovereignty is insane.
700,oHlx5fB94bc,"""The dream of the oppressed is to be the oppressor"". This is an endless cycle"
701,oHlx5fB94bc,"The woman claiming that they do no harm, really lady? How would you call taking someone else‚Äôs home then?"
702,ECscKICzsJ0,The YouTube algorithm has an interesting sense of humor.
703,ECscKICzsJ0,I was two and a half minutes into this before I realised it was made eight years ago. It‚Äôs comforting to know some things in life are timeless.
704,ECscKICzsJ0,"I thought The Onion was supposed to make satire, this is just actual history"
705,ECscKICzsJ0,This is the calmest comment section about Israel/Palestine I've come across this week.
706,ECscKICzsJ0,Yet another example of when comedians do a better job of journalism than journalists.
707,ECscKICzsJ0,‚ÄùGlobal leaders worked tirelessly to engineer a conflict so intractable that it could last indefinitely‚Äù I see no lies here
708,ECscKICzsJ0,This is where I get my up-to-date information on the Israeli Palestinian conflict
709,ECscKICzsJ0,We have reached peak absurdity when the Onion gives the only accurate fair and balanced synopsis of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.
710,ECscKICzsJ0,Give it another 10 years and this video will still be just as accurate.
711,ECscKICzsJ0,"No matter what‚Äôs in the news, there‚Äôs a decade old onion video about it doing a better job at explaining it that any documentary."
712,qR5TCBBhihY,iran@iraq..she said like Almost sameüò∂
713,qR5TCBBhihY,"Iran has motives, thats all you need to know."
714,qR5TCBBhihY,See Papal Bull of 1430 .  Self explanatory !
715,qR5TCBBhihY,"Israel was not not formed in 1948. Israel returned officially to its ancestral land in 1948. The Quran mentioned the Jews in many passages confirming their existence even before the advent of Islam. The Bible has over 3000 years of historical records of Israel inhabiting that Land. It‚Äôs this distortion of the facts that have made peace between the Jews and Arabs inhabiting the space impossible. A simple solution would have been a two state coexistence worked out by the parties themselves without any external interference. Let the Arabs and the Jews sit down together, use historical facts from their Holy Books, historical facts of the last millennium and the realities of today to chisel out a coexistence plan. They should work at it until they reach an agreement even if it takes a century"
716,nERZr_d343w,"The partition of the West Bank in areas A, B and C seems impossible to work out and was bound to fail.
If the West Bank was given 100% to Palestinian control and governance, the peace would have worked out.
The obstacle is and remains the settlements and right wing settlers."
717,nERZr_d343w,"If I set up a tent in a person‚Äôs backyard and tell him it is land of my ancestors‚Ä¶what will happen? He‚Äôll try to push me out. If now in defense I kill him saying ‚ÄúHey, I just defended my land‚Äù‚Ä¶how can we say that is ok? It‚Äôs unbelievable"
718,nERZr_d343w,Missing alot of important points.
719,nERZr_d343w,"Found mistake: They weren't called Palestinians in 1947. Simply Arabs or Palestinian Arabs (Because Palestinians weren't just Arabs. They were in fact the Zionists). The partition did not say ""Israel/Palestine"" state; Palestine was the land that was divided. The division was ""Arab State / Jewish State"". Arabs did not identify themselves as Palestinians until the 1960's."
720,nERZr_d343w,Sad
721,nERZr_d343w,"The accord tried to ignore a fundamental right enshrined in international law: the right of return of every Palestinian refugees who fled or otherwise left their homes during the Zionist invasion. That right is passed to the descendants as well. No politician can arbitrarily remove or simply ignore that right which every person in the world can exercise in similar circumstances. 
Using another example: If a thief steals your car, the thief must return it to you. No excuses."
722,nERZr_d343w,1978-1992
723,nERZr_d343w,It's a shame this didn't work although the idea that the West Bank wasn't going to be given fully to Palestinian control might have something do with the objections to it.
724,nERZr_d343w,Do the Israeli settlements violate the zones set out in the Oslo accords?
725,nERZr_d343w,I LOVE NAEJ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

747,r21iN7JYu2Y,"I don‚Äôt care what religion or side you‚Äôre on, watching a grieving mother talk to her deceased sons in a graveyard, while her surviving daughter stands nearby, is beyond heartbreaking."
748,r21iN7JYu2Y,I never almost cry but instantly started tearing up when that father was holding his child dead in his arms and screaming. Rest in Peace to those innocents and children who passed on both sides.
749,r21iN7JYu2Y,That father screaming to the sky and asking why! The pain and grief in that moment is something I am going to pray for his well being and happiness.
750,r21iN7JYu2Y,"Thank you for continuing to make this information free and digestible. It's so important to understand what's going on in our world, and so few media outlets take the time to tell a whole story anymore. Just what's happening RIGHT NOW. I am praying for all sides, for the innocent people and families who never asked to live this way. It's truly heartbreaking üíî üôèüèº I can't imagine having to explain all of this to your babies and still attempt to sleep at night."
751,r21iN7JYu2Y,"The man who lost his children broke my heart. He was so shocked he couldn't even cry, just scream."
752,r21iN7JYu2Y,Always appreciate that Vice news asks tough questions to both sides and dives deeper than mainstream media
753,r21iN7JYu2Y,How does somebody go to both sides of a bitter conflict and ask tough questions on both sides? This is incredible journalism.
754,r21iN7JYu2Y,At first I felt like this video was gonna be pretty biased and one-sided. However at the end it really seems like she was very sided with the civilians who are the real people being hurt here. I appreciated that. She grilled leaders on both side. 10/10 great interviews and reporting.
755,r21iN7JYu2Y,It doesn‚Äôt matter what side you‚Äôre on but seeing children who has nothing to do with this conflict die is heartbreaking
756,GYW9428fjQg,"The most sickening thing I have been seeing is that people think the murder, rape, and torture of innocent civilians is justified.  Just sick."
757,GYW9428fjQg,History repeats when you don't learn from it
758,GYW9428fjQg,"I'm praying for ALL of the innocent people, and children from both nations..."
759,GYW9428fjQg,"It‚Äôs always civilians that take the brunt when those making decisions are untouchable.
Loss of life and savagery should never be celebrated!

765,GYW9428fjQg,I've never been more worried about the world and the future it holds for my children then I am today.
766,-rBGgIaO69c,"As a Muslim, I am praying for the innocent civilians in both Palestine and Israel. I can't believe that in the 21st century, people are still fighting like pagans instead of resolving their conflicts by talking and finding a middle ground. We haven't learned anything from history..At the end of the day, the only people suffering will be the innocent kids and widows who had nothing to do with the politics and the power games of the politicians...There are no winners in wars.. The UN should sit together and find a solution for the conflict between Israel and Palestine."
767,-rBGgIaO69c,"This is extremely disturbing on both ends. I feel bad for the elderly, the men and the children in Palestine and Israel that have fallen victims to crimes committed against them. It‚Äôs extremely scary and concerning and I hope this comes to a swift end"
768,-rBGgIaO69c,"‚ÄúIf you're not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.‚Äù ~ Malcolm X"
769,-rBGgIaO69c,Disagreeing with Israeli policy and the Israeli government does NOT make you anti-Semitic.  Government and religion are not the same thing.  Stop calling people racist for not agreeing with your point of view!  There's a lot of built up rage in Gaza for the way Israeli's treat them.  There are two sides to this story!  At the same time Hamas' brutal tactics makes them equally at fault.  But I understand where their anger is coming from.
770,-rBGgIaO69c,My deepest condolences to the families who lost their lives in this conflict.
771,-rBGgIaO69c,Appreciate the educational points about the history. It helps us to understand all of the decades long devastating issues.
772,-rBGgIaO69c,Wow! That was a head scratcher ü§Ø
773,-rBGgIaO69c,"As I have commented before, the situation in Gaza, Palestine and Israel always manages to achieve the impossible - it gets even worse.  And you can be sure that the situation will get even worse than it is now.  In 10 years time - if people are still around by then - 
I am certain I shall make exactly this same comment.  People will never change their nature, even to save themselves."
774,-rBGgIaO69c,"Next time God promises the same land to two groups, I suggest a notarized written contract."

777,EhbLy11U8x4,I can't wait for an NBC report explaining the role the United States has played in the conflict between Israel and Palestine.
778,EhbLy11U8x4,"A better question is, what role does the Biden admin play?"
779,EhbLy11U8x4,ÿ≤ŸÜÿØŸá ÿ®ÿßÿØ ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ ‚òÄÔ∏èü¶ÅüáÆüá∑
780,EhbLy11U8x4,This is a wake up call for the US. Our military better not be caught off guard or distracted from the clowns in Washington.
781,EhbLy11U8x4,"Will the US sit this one out, or will they send billions of taxpayers money for ‚Äúmilitary aid‚Äù ?üíÄ
 Find out next time , on dragon ball Z"
782,EhbLy11U8x4,Americans can't complain about Iran supporting Palestine when we send Israel $3.8 billion a year
783,EhbLy11U8x4,I'm not really sure. Maybe if we send them pallets of cash again. They'll tell us what they're spending their money on?
784,EhbLy11U8x4,"Ahh yes, beating the war drums."
785,EhbLy11U8x4,What evidence Iran had anything to do with this attack?
786,VZ4ruk3KO48,"I am from India and I am a Hindu, I urge our Arab Muslims and Israeli Jews to not to fight and solve issues by table talk. In 21st century we cannot afford this kind of barbarism happening in name of territorial conflict. We human hardly live 70 to 80 years in this planet and we should work together to make our life better instead of launching war in name of countries and religion. I think we are not primitive like our ancestors and we are way more smarter and educated, so we are capable to solve our problems through dialogues."
787,VZ4ruk3KO48,"Very nice independent, unbiased journalism by the BBC as always..
Yes, I am being sarcastic"
788,VZ4ruk3KO48,"As someone who comes from a Polish family, too much h8 in this world. Innocent people are dying for no reason, my heart goes out to both sides who lost their loved ones in this terrible conflict. My grandparents survived World War II and we should be teaching peace and love."
789,VZ4ruk3KO48,"If you want to learn about the background of the conflict, don‚Äôt use BBC lol"
790,VZ4ruk3KO48,It is unfortunate that the conflict due to differences in ideology developed into war rather than dialogue.
791,VZ4ruk3KO48,The international community has inadequately failed to deal with this for 75 years of course it was going to lead to something like this.
792,VZ4ruk3KO48,Just like how the US missed the 2001 attacks.
793,VZ4ruk3KO48,"Next time God promises the same land to two groups, I suggest a notarized written contract."
794,VZ4ruk3KO48,Putting gravy into a whoopee cushion takes an amusung prank to a whole new level of authenticity.
795,VZ4ruk3KO48,This did not explain Hamas.

799,LVtt_8GTGB8,I am surprised that they told the truth as fast as possible in a few minutes. There were people there and they were forced off their land is the main plot here.

816,KjhMAMAPgeM,YOU TOOK 3 MINS TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE NEWS FEEDS HAVEN'T DONE ALL DAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND EFFORT...
817,KjhMAMAPgeM,That's some top notch reporting. Wow. No bullishit No bias No drama. Just straight facts. Brief yet descriptive reporting of the unfolded events. Good job.
818,KjhMAMAPgeM,What I feel truly sorry is people who haven't lived life outside of constant conflict and war. You are only given one life and it was wasted for reasons beyond your control.
819,KjhMAMAPgeM,"The first time I ever subbed to a news outlet.  
Providing news with integrity, delivering information without any hint of bias or hidden agenda, ensuring that the audience receives an accurate, balanced, and trustworthy report."
820,KjhMAMAPgeM,"Now look at you WSJ! You still got it in you. This is the kind of news I want. Not opinion pages, just judgement free reporting of events. It will never be perfect, because it can‚Äôt be."
821,KjhMAMAPgeM,"Great reporting , clear and concise . Thank you ."
822,KjhMAMAPgeM,"THIS is what you call journalism.
No dramatic nuisance. No opinions are made by so-called ""reporters"".
Just facts."
823,KjhMAMAPgeM,Unbiased reporting just like the good ol‚Äô days. I‚Äôm surprised.
824,KjhMAMAPgeM,"We are already aware of the individuals who will endure the greatest hardships as a consequence of the conflict. My heartfelt concern lies with those who, regrettably, will become inadvertent casualties in this situation, lacking any influence in the decision-making process leading to war."
825,KjhMAMAPgeM,War has no winner. My empathy to all civilians from both sides who were affected for no reason. It is the innocent people who pay the price unfortunately üò¢
826,7Jyc-LzXqk0,"This is the longest video I've ever published to YouTube, and I still feel like it's barely scratching the surface.

827,7Jyc-LzXqk0,if you think i‚Äôm gonna watch a 1 hour long reallifelore video then you would be absolutely correct
828,7Jyc-LzXqk0,"It would be really great to add subtitles in global languages like French, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, Spanish etc. for larger audiences to understand. My friends would watch this video but their English is not enough for this."
829,7Jyc-LzXqk0,Thank you for providing so much of the lost context that is plaguing media and social media. It's just a terrible situation nobody wants to properly deal with.
830,7Jyc-LzXqk0,Thank you for stitching together all these threads into a coherent narrative explaining this ongoing conflict and the geopolitical history and current policies behind it. I knew some of this from reading articles but you helped me understand how all of it fits together. Great job! Sadly you won‚Äôt learn much from American news.
831,7Jyc-LzXqk0,Really great video. I was scared to watch a heavily one-sided video but you mention a lot of topics and threads that keep it very interesting to watch.
832,7Jyc-LzXqk0,"As a Syrian citizen who is attempting really hard to stay objective and trying -again- really hard to tell the story in a non-biased way, I honestly think this is the most accurate video narrating the complexity of the middle-east as of now. I don't agree with the channel that this is barely scratching the surface. This is what I'm showing my friends when asked about the context. Foreign friends, Syrian friends, and whoever asks for context. You have no idea how easier this video made my life. I honestly, wholeheartedly, thank you."
833,7Jyc-LzXqk0,I love how the comments are so relaxed and no one is fighting
834,7Jyc-LzXqk0,"A lot missing here but otherwise fantastic graphics. Would have liked to see a mention of the intifada, 2008 Olmert Plan and Clinton Parameters. It‚Äôs really key in understanding how those final stretches of diplomacy failed. Also the channel made some sweeping statements about Fatah changing its tune by 1995 when historians really dispute whether this ever actually happened. Definitely captured the Israeli settlement issue perfectly though. Thank you!"
835,7Jyc-LzXqk0,"This is the most comprehensive (though not the largest) and probably most balanced explaination of the Arab Israeli conflict that I have watched. This video should be getting WAY more views. As others have mentioned, it is hard to see why the algorithm is not pushing the video more."
836,h7mFQdbpJ3Q,As a Brit I must inform you that yes we fucking did.
837,h7mFQdbpJ3Q,Ben debating college kids is like snatching candy from toddlers.
838,h7mFQdbpJ3Q,"If Hamas didn't want a war, they should not have provoked Israel."

847,eTMRMX7Pw5U,"There's a mistake in this video at 1:25.  That frame shows a picture of bodies lined up in rows and the voice over and CC indicate it is Deir Yassin.  While the massacre at Deir Yassin was very real and documented even by Zionist forces, an uncontestable event, the photo shown is not from Deir Yassin.  That image is a reproduction of a photo taken by the Army Signal Corps of a German concentration camp called Dachau.

Jordan wasn't gifted the West Bank, it invaded and occupied as a durect threat to the fledgling Jewish state. Ben Gurion announced the Stae of Israel on 14 May 1948, the local Arabs promptly attacked on 15 May and in nearly all cases got driven back despite superior manpower and weaponry. The list goes on."

It was the Egyptian President Anwar Al-Sadat who decided to announce a peace initiative and visited Israel. The following negotiations under the hospices of US President Jimmy Carter led to a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel. As a result Israel withdrew from Sinai and returned it to Egypt which paved the way to normalization and diplomatic ties between the two countries. This was the first peace agreement in the Israeli-Arab conflict and has since been in effect until this day. The peace makers, Mr. Anwar Al-Sadat and the Israeli P.M.

They suffer the anguish of losing loved ones to violence, their homes reduced to rubble, and their dreams shattered by the relentless cycle of strife. The echoes of explosions reverberate through their lives, leaving scars that run deeper than physical wounds. Amidst this turmoil, they grapple with fear, insecurity, and the trauma of an uncertain future.

They were hunted down, killed, thrown out of their homes and  forcibly exiled.

946,O454c_qs5kI,"If you take the time to learn the history behind all this, in my opinion, the reason why there‚Äôs conflict between Israel & Palestine , it‚Äôs because of the British back during pre world war 1 to world war 2. The British made a lot of bad deals between the 2-nations which led to a big mess where it is today. Now England is just hiding in the shadow hoping no one brings up their old history presence in the Middle East."
947,O454c_qs5kI,"I never thought Fox News would be the best source of information on a topic, but here I am"
948,O454c_qs5kI,"This is OK for a quick crash course, but it kind of conveniently left out a few things. Nothing on settlers? Nothing on the blockade of Gaza? It makes it seem like a two-sided territorial dispute without much characterization of what each territory is like other than ""densely populated."""
949,O454c_qs5kI,Why are all these companies telling me to stand with Israel? No
950,O454c_qs5kI,I am not a Fox fan but I see somewhat balanced news and comments. Great job gentleman

952,O454c_qs5kI,"A nice attempt to explain what's going on ??
But some of the real important questions need to be answered?
Why did England want to create a State of Israel ??"
953,O454c_qs5kI,"Good presentation and generally historically correct. What is missing in the conversation is the current apartheid mindset. For some 20 years Israel has segregated the Palestinians in two reservations (Gaza and the West Bank). In an effort to quell hatred of Israel and attacks - the Palestinians in these reservations face embargos and live in hopeless poverty.  Uprisings (intifada) happen regularly due the poor conditions in these reservations. These current acts of inexcusable terrorism by Hamas will bring even more oppression and misery to the Palestinians. That said, there will be no peace until both sides are willing to talk and compromise. As long as both sides see war as the only solution there will be only war."
954,O454c_qs5kI,This might be the most comprehensive and intelligent explanation of anything I‚Äôve ever seen on Fox News.

965,btVFgqkgkzw,"For more commentary on this issue, read the beginning of Elan Journo's book here, for free: https://bit.ly/3QABEO2"
966,btVFgqkgkzw,"One point that didn't come up in this video is that when Israel made peace with Egypt, the Egyptians insisted on getting beck every last square inch of the Sinai peninsula, yet they were quite adamant not to take the Gaza strip back to their control."
967,btVFgqkgkzw,"What I‚Äôm very surprised to see left out of this discussion regarding the importance of context is the fact that it leaves out the 4/5 of British Mandate Palestine that included ALL of Jordan and a small part of Syria, Lebanon and Egypt.  And that doesn‚Äôt include the French Mandate."
968,btVFgqkgkzw,"Though I get the point you‚Äôre trying to make even with the first frame of the map, I‚Äôm confused at the delineation that you‚Äôre suggesting that we take in which we would only show the population densities of Palestinians and Israeli‚Äôs. To say a place is only owned by those that have ownership on the land, you would then need for the governance of the land to be equal or benign. The same would suggest that I could then move to an uninhabited part of land and lay claim to it today in northern Canada. We know this simply isn‚Äôt true because there is ownership in sorts over the land. I would need to purchase this land."
969,btVFgqkgkzw,Why start in 1947 and not 2000bc - what‚Äôs the importance of 1947?
970,btVFgqkgkzw,"The main thing that this shows is that all of the peace loving, decent people all over the world have been stood upon by corrupt governments who don‚Äôt care about them or their welfare. It is extremely sad this world we are living in ü•∫"
971,btVFgqkgkzw,"I may not agree with some of the slant that I perceived but, I very much like how this commentator brings up the principle issue at hand when determining whether EITHER of these groups has some ‚Äúright‚Äù to statehood, because the real issue is dividing humans into classes that are unequal and usually diametrically opposed to the goals and needs of one another, based upon ethnic demographics and cultural background. It is observable through history that establishing a state apparatus to favor one group over any other will ALWAYS trigger violent resistance that can‚Äôt be quelled with further violence. Insurgencies happen for a reason and they happen fairly predictably given the right conditions. Violence begets violence, and somehow this doesn‚Äôt seem to be any more understood now than 1000 years ago. 

I am personally of the belief that ANY time you do this kind of thing, whether you establish a ‚Äúhomeland‚Äù for the Jewish people, or you work at exiling this Israeli population to establish some sort of Islam-centric theocracy, what we end up with is having established an ethno-state deeply rooted in non-secular tribalism and nationalism, which are almost always going to be incompatible with social harmony and human rights for ALL people. It‚Äôs unfortunate that this topic so often devolves into antisemitic hatred or white supremacist language. Because it is such a complicated issue, which is at its core, centered around a difficult philosophical question regarding peace and conflict and our relationship with the earth itself."
972,btVFgqkgkzw,"Also, you forgot to mention that the reason Israel did not give Gaza back to Egypt was because Egypt didn't want it back, and from what I learned they actually threatened to back out of the deal if Israel did not take Gaza."
973,btVFgqkgkzw,It would be helpful if you showed an accurate first map that shows where no people lived.
974,btVFgqkgkzw,"Seems like the point laid is, might makes right ( literally what Netanyahu said) and the lack of ‚Äòofficial‚Äô ownership meant it was open for the taking. Obfuscation on display."

988,x8UokctMePM,"Good synopsis, but people should still watch the full video if they haven‚Äôt already and are interested"
989,x8UokctMePM,"Like always, good presentation bro"
990,x8UokctMePM,Free PlayStation!
991,x8UokctMePM,Jordan didn‚Äôt concord Israel. The British did in 1917 and theygave Jewish land to a Muslim man that help them in another war and made him a king. Jordan is part of the promised land.
992,x8UokctMePM,You skipped 1948 to 1967. What happened?
993,x8UokctMePM,You can lie but none believe you.
994,x8UokctMePM,"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free !!"
995,aEdGcej-6D0,"If you want to learn more about how this whole conflict began, and how the British Empire helped create Israel, watch our explainer: How Israel Was Created: https://youtu.be/6foH3Zc82ZQ"
996,aEdGcej-6D0,"This is for those who thinks it started on oct 7th, especially piers‚Ä¶."
997,aEdGcej-6D0,"Imagine thinking it's okay to toss your garbage down where you know people walk? Or letting your kids throw stones at other children. I still can't wrap my head around the fact that Jews, who survived the holocaust would go and treat Palestinians in ways similar to how the Jews were treated by the Nazis. Like...did they not learn that all people deserve to be treated well? How do you go from being bullied to being the bully? Shouldn't that have taught you compassion and respect for human dignity?"
998,aEdGcej-6D0,This is legit like a horror movie; imagine living through it everyday.
999,aEdGcej-6D0,"My blood is boiling after hearing the words from this Settler. Thank u for sharing the truth with us so everyone can see this madness with their own eyes. I pray for my Palestinian brothers and sister, may god give u your freedom back.  üôèüèæ"
1000,aEdGcej-6D0,"When the girl talks about her brother saying ""look how nice their toys are. Let's go play with them"", my heart sinks. It makes me think of my kids in that situation. It makes me want to shower them with toys so they can have a normal childhood"
1001,aEdGcej-6D0,"It was heartbreaking hearing Salwa's father telling her to be strong, while she, A CHILD, was being arrested for existing as a Palestinian"
1002,aEdGcej-6D0,"I am from Warsaw and I learned a lot about how ghetto here worked during wwII and how they divided streets, how everyone was checked, about walls and fences, memorials are on the streets, stories passed down my family
this situation in Hebron looks atrociously the same as what I learned and was taught about my city and I am sick to my stomach"
1003,aEdGcej-6D0,I am half Jewish and I have always wanted to understand what is going on in Israel but it has seemed hard to get objective information.  But in your film I can see with my own eyes. I am not afraid to find out the truth and I thank you for your video.  I think the only way to find peace is to see the truth and make things better.  Sending love to you and your father.
1004,aEdGcej-6D0,Im born and raised in america and we dont realize how good we have it here until you watch videos like these. Those people do not deserve to be treated like that
1005,2Qs6kdvprt0,"People forget ""free Palestine"" was a saying before October 7th"
1006,2Qs6kdvprt0,Free Palestine has been a thing for 75 years. Hamas didn't exist until the 80's.
1007,2Qs6kdvprt0,You put your boot on someone's neck for 75 years and expect him to just be cool with you?
1008,2Qs6kdvprt0,Palestinians have a right to defend their land.
1009,2Qs6kdvprt0,"He just mentioned the actions of Hamas since October 7th, israel killed 27k civilans, since the october 7th and way more civilians since 1948. The Palestinians have the right to resist and defend they're land. Israel has no right to steal the palestinian houses."
1010,2Qs6kdvprt0,Palestime have the right to fight to fight back
1011,2Qs6kdvprt0,Palestinians have the right to resist and fight back against israel.
1012,2Qs6kdvprt0,Imagine you get bullied by a rich guy for you're whole school life and on day you slap that guy and the whole school calls you violent kid
1013,2Qs6kdvprt0,Never again for anyone and free PALESTINE
1014,2Qs6kdvprt0,"If Hamas is  terrorist, what would you call Israel? Angel?"
1015,kbPnF8Hvj0I,I had no idea Israeli settlers were Americans. Says a lot about how they treat Palestinians there.
1016,kbPnF8Hvj0I,"Is it just me or is watching those smug racists smiling while mistreating that family really, really frustrating? It makes the world seem so depressing. I've seen that type of smile before and every time that I do it's because someone is being bullied."
1017,kbPnF8Hvj0I,The nerve of a foreign people flying half way across the world to kick out indigenous people from their homes for another foreign people. This is crazy
1018,kbPnF8Hvj0I,"So sad, I‚Äôm so sorry for all the Palestinians who are suffering under Israel‚Äôs harsh regime. Everyone deserves peace dignity and respect."
1019,kbPnF8Hvj0I,Imagine being an American Tourist and kicking people out of their homeland that you are just visiitng lol
1020,kbPnF8Hvj0I,I am quickly losing respect for certain groups of people. Never thought I would feel like this üò¢
1021,kbPnF8Hvj0I,Brazil supports Palestine! Free Palestine!
1022,kbPnF8Hvj0I,Thank you for exposing the utter arrogance of  American Jews and Israeli settlers to audiences like myself who once were ignorant to the plight of Palestinans. The Truth is knowledge and knowledge is power.  Keep up the good work.
1023,kbPnF8Hvj0I,"After years of being brainwashed, thank you Aj+ for showing me and most people like me in the rest of the world who is the real trouble makers and who we stand with and support moving forward."
1024,kbPnF8Hvj0I,It‚Äôs time to revoke them as American citizens!!!!
1025,9scGFj7zp5w,I just hate what the innocent are going through on both sides. Specially the children. Breaks my heart.
1026,9scGFj7zp5w,It's horrible what all these civilians are going through on both sides. It's truly heartbreaking.
1027,9scGFj7zp5w,"Seeing the footage of the 2 year old and 5 year old made me ball my eyes out. I'm a grown ass man with two children, and I am always so thankful I live in a country that is safe. We don't realize how lucky we all are until we see things like this and we should acknowledge our blessings before then."
1028,9scGFj7zp5w,"These two guys give every impression of knowing what they're talking about. I appreciated their calm, measured tones. Badly needed right now in the midst of the hysteria."
1029,9scGFj7zp5w,My heart breaks for the innocent children and anyone caught up in this dreadful war .
1030,9scGFj7zp5w,Probably the most nuanced and unbiased take on the conflict so far
1031,9scGFj7zp5w,"Ignorance gets worse when mixed with lies, denial, and arrogance."
1032,9scGFj7zp5w,"I'm glad the reporter asked the 1 question we've all been thinking & that is how is a peaceful outcome possible between hamas/isreal. The answer was the correct & absolute truth & that's ""not possible"". Well said"
1033,9scGFj7zp5w,"Strange. 
"" We have to cover terrorist action but not call terrorists terrorists because it might sound judgey""
Like,  what?"
1034,9scGFj7zp5w,Pray and hope for a divine intervention.
1035,aBswCrpLSao,"This is complete human rights violation, totally disgusting, no one can stand this kind of oppression"
1036,aBswCrpLSao,"This is insane, inhumane and terrifying. And what's even more insane is how the whole world slept on this all these years."
1037,aBswCrpLSao,"How the hell can those soldiers invade the house of the Arab family, without being invited. Prisoners in their own home. Those settlers have to be removed!!!!! What happened to the rights of the Palestinians. They let the settlements grow and grow, they were supposed to be stopped from the beginning. This is so unjust!"
1038,aBswCrpLSao,Wow.. I can‚Äôt imagine to loose your home and being humiliated. Thank you for replaying this. I hope more people will watch this to truly understand.
1039,aBswCrpLSao,"I'm shocked how humans could treat each other this way....No matter what religion you are or where you live we should all be treated with respect and be able to live in peace..I live in California...I'm Mexican and born in the U.S...In the area I live I have friends that are Muslim, Jewish, African American, Philippino, Americans and Chinese..And we are all neighbors and help each other...I wish the whole world could live this way...We are all human beings and we all deserve freedom and peace"
1040,aBswCrpLSao,"We express our gratitude to 60 Minute for organizing and presenting this program, which sheds light on the hardships endured by Palestinians. This platform provides an opportunity for people to gain insight into the challenges faced by this community. It is important to address the mistreatment they endure, as well as the complex issues surrounding terrorism."
1041,aBswCrpLSao,Shame on all our leaders for leading us here.
1042,aBswCrpLSao,I hope more people clueless about what been going on for years watches this. This is the reality.
1043,aBswCrpLSao,Thanks 60 minutes for re-airing these stories. One of the only media who report it like it is.
1044,aBswCrpLSao,Those soldiers who keep coming inside the house without permission is such an insane violation of privacy. I always remember learning about the third amendment of the constitution forbidding the quartering of soldiers in private homes but thought it was just an old colonial British thing

1065,H7FML0wzJ6A,I admit i am not the most knowledgeable on the Palestine-Israel conflict but I found it very interesting that is actually illegal to acknowledge the ‚ÄúNakba‚Äù in Israel while also letting Israelis have all there rights but Palestinians aren‚Äôt given those same rights and live under martial law most of the time. I‚Äôve been doing research recently and another thing I noticed is how the media shows every atrocity committed by Hammas yet the atrocities committed by Israel‚Äôs IDF are not shown also the death of innocent Palestinians is barely shown yet a single Israeli death or casualty is shown everywhere.
1066,H7FML0wzJ6A,The least the world can do is learn and understand the plight of the Palestinian people and their decades-long struggle for freedom.
1067,H7FML0wzJ6A,Rewatching this as a reminder of todays event in the middle east... People please learn ur history!
1068,H7FML0wzJ6A,A 2nd Nakba is happening in Gaza right now as we speak!!! May Allah protect the Palestinian people and give victory to them
1069,H7FML0wzJ6A,One of the best documentaries on the history of Palestine. Historical documents and photographs are worth thousands of words

1071,H7FML0wzJ6A,"Thank you Al Jazeera, I urge you to repeat the telecast of all these historic documentaries about the Palestine."
1072,H7FML0wzJ6A,A Shocking History not unlike the Irish experience of British Colonialism.
1073,H7FML0wzJ6A,I've watched this series a bunch of times. This video series needs to be shown and viewed now more than ever!
1074,wQmBsbt9blg,"As a Muslim, I want to request everyone on this platform to try to tell others around you that we need to respect human life and reject any ideology that supports the killing of innocent civilians. In this era of fake news, we need to be more careful because it is becoming increasingly dangerous everyday...  with rising polarisation around us, we need to reject hate and help people around us... üò¢"
1075,wQmBsbt9blg,"He's right about people becoming radicalised because of lack of peaceful economic opportunities, and how that's happening in the West, too. There's an old African proverb: """"The child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth""."
1076,wQmBsbt9blg,"Social media has done nothing but cause me stress, full of hate, extremely polarised and tonnes of misinformation that nobody questions. This is exactly what i needed to see a well balanced and insightful view. Thank you and keep up the good work."
1077,wQmBsbt9blg,He is so well - read and balanced. Such a pleasure to listen to such people. Gives me so much clarity on the situation. Thanks.

1079,wQmBsbt9blg,Mr. Bremmer just opened our eyes to all that has and is going on. Before this I believe most of our eyes were closed  to what really was happening and how it had and is presently playing out. Please no more mistakes. THANK YOU.

1082,wQmBsbt9blg,I have been seriously avoiding clicking on anything that advertises that it‚Äôs going to cause any emotion in me. All week. I was rewarded by being served this interview in my feed. So grateful. Will rewatch and recommend to thoughtful people. Thank you.
1083,wQmBsbt9blg,A lot more than 1.1 million people need to listen to this. Thank you for this interview
1084,a34zpFaoBoM,Doesn‚Äôt anyone find it strange that the most sophisticated intelligence agency in the world didn‚Äôt notice 100s of militants and 1000s of rockets being put in place just over the fence. This is either the biggest failure in military intelligence or it was allowed intentionally. Which is worse
1085,a34zpFaoBoM,"On both sides, can we all agree this interviewer asked some terribly meaningless questions? ‚ÄúDo you think the enemy was bad? Do you think people helping the enemy should knock that off? Do you agree with people who agree with you?‚Äù 

Read the guys bio before you ask him book jacket questions. From that ‚Äúinterview‚Äù we learned nothing in depth.

1087,a34zpFaoBoM,I notice that alot of news stations are sending correspondents to israel but none to Gaza. If they belive what Israel is saying about their campaign in the Gaza strip the should go there and report the news. We know why theyre not.
1088,a34zpFaoBoM,"i laughed every time they say ""'Kremlin controlled media"""" as if our news arent the same XD"
1089,a34zpFaoBoM,I just feel bad for all the innocent people on both sides caught up in childish government leaders problems
1090,a34zpFaoBoM,"Damn this reminds me of that Lenin quote ""There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen""."
1091,a34zpFaoBoM,He has no sympathy because he knows the history and the atrocities that got us all to this point.
1092,a34zpFaoBoM,I love how they really want us to believe they knew nothing about this üòÇ I‚Äôm a stay at home mother and even I can see what‚Äôs going on here.
1093,a34zpFaoBoM,"The issue that people don't seem to understand is how this extermination was actually started and the reasons behind it. Though it's easy to point fingers and blame, society must begin to address the double standards that provoke such attacks to even begin and who it is that conducted the initial strike. The constant atrocities committed against Palestinians since 1948 have always been suppressed by Western media, though even the slightest form of retaliation in any form has always been seen as ""an act of terrorism."" Now before one can quickly choose a side, you must first understand that Hamas is not innocent in the slightest and does not follow the complex guidelines of war as ruled in the Quran though journalists must begin to stray from the demand of condemnation as it further enforces the double standards put in place. This inequity is supported by the shaming of Hamas as it suggests that while one side must be condemned, the other can run free of judgment, avoiding condemnation for the duration of their inhumane acts of violence towards the entirety of the localized Palestinian population. Universally, the expectation to condemn Hamas seems non-complex, though it proves to be the opposite in nearly every scenario when reflecting on the never-ending acts of the Israeli government. In no way does the Muslim or Arab population accept the actions of Hamas, though the barbaric response by Israel is not a response of self-defense but rather revenge. The redundancy in biased media coverage and the sympathetically neglectful approach from journalists toward Palestinian supporters comes at the cost of misinformation and provoking anger among the Muslim community, ultimately displaying them in a pessimistic manner. Overall, the action of blaming one party for the start of this conflict is harmful to not only the victims but in finding justice for those affected by said conflict. Neither side is innocent, though the extreme response and disregard for humanity by Israel has found its way to prevail even in this society, and their constant facade of innocence and victim must be overlooked. Finally, people must find sympathy for the dark history of Palestinian treatment by Israel as it's paramount to understanding the true reasons behind the merciless genocide being carried out against the Palestinians.  May the lost lives of all innocent souls be granted peace at last."

1150,_Jj8vne0ca0,"That Israeli guy is getting under my skin, kudos to the Palestinians because I‚Äôm sorry I could never sit in front of someone like that."
1151,_Jj8vne0ca0,the man who lost his 10 year old sister. i cant even begin to imagine.
1152,_Jj8vne0ca0,"I am neither Palestinian nor Israeli but I simply cannot imagine the amount of strength of character it would take to retain my composure being told my country was ""not your land"" by a comrade of the cell that murdered my little sister or my father."
1153,_Jj8vne0ca0,The amount of entitlement it takes to look somebody in the face of somebody who basically said ‚ÄúI can track my family back 9 generations and they were still in Palestine‚Äù and say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs cool I can track mine back only 7 compared to your 9 and they were in turkey‚Ä¶ But anyways that‚Äôs still not your land it‚Äôs mine‚Äù is SO INSANE.

1159,7T6hu3OaLXI,"Moral: Differences in religious beliefs often lead to conflicts. Instead of adhering to texts from ancient times and believing something that you do not know. I wish for, Humanity to be the Universal Religion with only one fundamental principle: Respect for All Individuals."

1163,7T6hu3OaLXI,Thank you for sharing the information...
1164,VpVvPNLY6hg,Move the settlements out.
1165,VpVvPNLY6hg,It is clear there is no intention from Israel to solve things unless they are forced through international pressure and sanctions. US is the biggest enabler of the impunity enjoyed by Israel üòä
1166,VpVvPNLY6hg,"Dr. Mustafa Barghouti is a great representative of the Palestinian people. As a Palestinian, I hope that he will represent us as our future leader. He is also a very endearing person."
1167,VpVvPNLY6hg,The people in the settlements will have to leave and the buildings turned over to Palestine.

1170,VpVvPNLY6hg,"it's impossible as long as US, UK, and EU supports Israel"
1171,VpVvPNLY6hg,Once Natenyahu goes to the ICC to face his punishment then the new government should work on a two state resolution
1172,VpVvPNLY6hg,"Two (2) states solution should be FAIR in order to work
= there must be a UN contingent forces and guarantor of peace in the boundaries of Palestine territory and Israel. 
= Gaza should have a territorial sea, including exploration of any resources therein not to be  controlled by any states but the state of Palestine.
= Gaza access to the sea and air should be free from intrusion of Israeli forces or government."

1185,W4gDfSNMRx4,History didn't start at October 7th
1186,W4gDfSNMRx4,"People living in independent countries, would not be able to understand the pain they were experiencing. They lost their childhoods, families, and many things in their lives to defend their homeland. They are forced to become adults and not be afraid of death from an early age.

If they could choose, they would want to live the same life as people in other countries live without having to hold a weapon."
1187,W4gDfSNMRx4,Abu khaleds accent is so good. It shows how well educated he is .

Free Free Palestine üáµüá∏üáÆüá©"
1190,W4gDfSNMRx4,"people who believe that Hamas just turm to violence are just stupid. 
You think those young men don't have dreams, families, lives, hobbies, achivements ?
Like they cannot imagine doing anything better than being at war."
1191,W4gDfSNMRx4,"11:21 ‚Äúwe dont want to act, we react‚Äù lmao you came to other people‚Äôs land, kick them out, and claimed that its your house and land, but when they resist you call them terrorist and said you react to their action?üòÇ"
1192,W4gDfSNMRx4,"That poor father losing his daughter and grandchildren, the pain in his eyes is absolutely haunting to me. RIP ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1193,W4gDfSNMRx4,"I feel even more guilty to the people in Gaza (and now west bank) because I didn't quite outspoken about their situation since years ago. I didn't even care to dig deeper about the what was framed as complication in Gaza. My apology to Palestinians and all the casualties, alive or martyred. Thank you Vice and all the cru members involved"
1194,aPI5TmdVZCk,"In my study of the Bible, I knew this relationship and in fact I always used to say that the war in that part of the world is between brothers!"
1195,aPI5TmdVZCk,Informative‚Ä¶ thanks for sharing your wisdom I‚Äôll keep following you.
1196,aPI5TmdVZCk,"Absolutely correct... all  is accurate.  Ilove this documentary clips ‚ù§

1199,aPI5TmdVZCk,A perfect narrative of the facts in complete accordance with the Holy Bible. It‚Äôs a complex problem that started thousands of years and made much more complicated with religious divisions. Brave hearts on both sides are required to come together and agree on a 2-state solution which will benefit millions of people living in perpetual fear and poor economic conditions. May God bless them to take the first courageous step towards establishing lasting peace in the region.
1200,aPI5TmdVZCk,"Very informative, thanks for sharing, I wish God interveins and bring back peace to the two brothers, am tired of seeing the killing of young and old."
1201,aPI5TmdVZCk,Very informative and interesting. Thank you for sharing üôè
1202,aPI5TmdVZCk,A fight between two brothers can be the most ferocious. A point in case is the fight between Cain and Abel. May these two find peace because the land is big for both peoples
1203,aPI5TmdVZCk,"Your video is an enduring wellspring of motivation! - ""Every setback is a chance to acquire wisdom.."""
1204,sZAneAxW7j0,Here because of the recent bombings. Praying for everyone caught in the cross fire üôèüèΩüôèüèΩ
1205,sZAneAxW7j0,"Innocent people should not be tortured, harrassed or killed as an act of vengeance."
1206,sZAneAxW7j0,"""We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.""
 
 Martin Luther King, Jr"
1207,sZAneAxW7j0,An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.¬†
1208,sZAneAxW7j0,"9 years later, it has escalated further. Innocent civilians paying the highest price on both sides. Break the cycle of hate. Let it end with you. Not because the enemy deserves it, but because your children do. Peace to all üôèüôè"
1209,sZAneAxW7j0,After 9 years‚Ä¶ this happened again üò¢
1210,sZAneAxW7j0,"3 people are killed, ends with an invasion"
1211,sZAneAxW7j0,"The trouble with this subject is that nobody agrees or wants to agree on the history of the area. As long as that's the case, there'll never be peace over there. I know that's an easy and essentially neutral position I've taken there but to actually voice a direct opinion on this subject is to light metaphorical fuse wire."
1212,sZAneAxW7j0,"without the iron dome, Israel would probably have way more casualties. If 100's missiles were launched every year (possibly more), thousands of people would've died. But at the same time, Israel would've killed way more Palestinians in retaliation. This conflict is really sad"
1213,sZAneAxW7j0,the fact that anyone gets their news from this frightens me

1246,wZBE5j2kIgY,"It is the most unbiased and actual history explained in easy terms. Hats off to this guy.

1247,wZBE5j2kIgY,It is very sad and heart wrenching to see what is happening between Israel and Palestine. Both the parties should broker peace. History is replete with instances that even if one faction wins the war the price it would pay for it in terms of human loss is not worth it.

1253,CynzeRes7mY,Personally I feel there is no way world governments couldn‚Äôt have foreseen something like this happening considering how unstable things are there
1254,CynzeRes7mY,"I've grown up in Yugoslavia during the wars so this whole conflict rings a too much big bell. I can't make myself to  support either Palestine or Israel, but goddamn I feel what those civilians are going trough. 
War is never fair to an ordinary man."
1255,CynzeRes7mY,This is an insightful video providing valuable perspectives on the Israel-Hamas conflict. It's crucial to have open discussions about this complex issue to promote understanding and hopefully contribute to a peaceful resolution. Thanks for sharing this informative content! üëç
1256,CynzeRes7mY,I trust this FAR more than mainstream media.  Thank you Simon and team
1257,CynzeRes7mY,I honestly have no idea how Simon has time to do anything other then education the world in many different subjects.
1258,CynzeRes7mY,Yes i would love like a 3 and a half hour documentary on the history here. The Warographics team does a great job and most people are getting their information from social media sites.
1259,CynzeRes7mY,"Honestly, I refuse to believe that the world didn't see this coming. Everyone saw this coming a mile away. Everyone. The crisis was always brewing. It's sad how people are slaughtered on both sides."
1260,CynzeRes7mY,"I'm genuinely grateful for your honest and unbiased coverage of this complex issue, Simon and the Warographics team. It's refreshing to find a source that provides a balanced perspective, allowing viewers to form their own opinions. Your work truly stands out in today's media landscape. üôåüåçüïä"
1261,CynzeRes7mY,"Simon, first of all, thank you for all the work you guys do to produce these and to report the details. Independent media is providing many with the whole picture and this is immensely import for democracy. 

My two cents: ‚ÄúThe crisis the world didn‚Äôt see coming‚Äù is highly debatable. This would certainly be a surprise for people that either didn‚Äôt pay attention to the last 6 months of  Iglobal affairs or if their news exposure is limited to one of the mainstream media outlets in the US. The US mainstream media does not provide us Americans with any valuable historical context for world events and doesn‚Äôt provide reliable journalism or an unbiased, honest perspective. Many Americans are woefully ill informed and lack much of the important context of understanding the world. Public discourse and debate between dissenting opinions is absent and this limits our ability to think critically of ourselves and properly analyze the world with some compassion and humility."

His followeres were Matine Luthar King and Nelson Mandela. Christains and Catholics who came to East later became non-violnt and learnt to  live with the Buddhsit and Hindus peacefully. Even Muslims in Sri Lanka are non-violant(unless they  have other methods). I do not know how peaceful is the preachings of Jew prophats. Do they also beleieve in ""An Eye for an Eye"". One thing I know is both religions are called Ibrahimic religions(and Christian?). Spanish Catholics have spread the religion in Peru using weapons and Smallpox(brought about by angry Spanish God). That was many years ago. Now they are also peaceful. I am happy to be a practicing Buddhist lived along with Hindus in Sri Lanka allowing Catholics and Muslims to build churches near Buddhst temples."

1306,htNfs-UeNvQ,"In 1921 May, the Jewish Communist and Socialist parties clashed with fists in Jaffa. Palestinian Arabs decided to add weapons to the fight, killing and pillaging.

So this goes back before 1948."

1310,htNfs-UeNvQ,"Even the very most unintelligent ordinary working class Israeli knows that to copy a Natzi philosophy will end in catastrophic failure. Yerushalayim is the place of 3 main religions . I thought the place was a dump when I was there , should have gone to Greece or Italy or somewhere, for my holiday. It‚Äôs easier for human beings to be compassionate than war , this is what all 3 religions in Jerusalem has discovered for mankind and now that place , the Holy places in Jerusalem are giving the most negative messages to the world. It has gone fundamentally wrong and I have one blame , the internet is undermining the indigenous peace that has formed in that part of the World and has taught the world for thousands of years . There is a resonance that was discovered, whether it be under Roman Violence domination or anything that is similar to the Roman violence domination , that resonance is still there if people choose it , or if they want to choose to be cavemen , from thousands of years prior to that , they will fail , because the basic resonance of the Earth has fundamentally moved on from those times , written in your old book !"
1311,htNfs-UeNvQ,"It's funny how he did not mention what part the Germans, French, British, and Turks played in what has led up to today's mess.   I watched a documentary and a well known British man in the documentary acknowledged the shameful role the Brits played in the past.  There were several countries in the past seeking power and control in middle east.   Nor does this man describe how many Palestinians have died at the hands of Israel people.  Nor the unfair treatment the Palestinians have been subjected to over the years.  Palestinians and Israelite's come from the loins of Abraham.  They are brothers and should live in peace with one another, but people need to watch factual documentaries which details how they both have been lied to and deceived over the years and how other countries in the past were seeking control not just of the region, but of the vast assets in the middle east."
1312,6Wj_j9aLxF4,"The events of the 1948 war of Jerusalem, which would lead to the founding of Israel, had been immortalized through the photographs of two war photographers, British and Palestinian. 

John Philip, the British photographer, was one of the first photojournalists in the world on the war in Jerusalem. His camera documents the Jews' perspective, the evacuation of thousands of Jews from the Old City of Jerusalem. Philip captures, for Life Magazine, the destruction of the Jewish Quarter of the Old City. 

Meanwhile, Ali Zaarour was one of the few photographers who took photos of the Palestinian side of the story. His photos had never been seen before his grandson discovered them and undertook a tremendous task to illustrate the catastrophe that this war was also for the Palestinians. The Naqba, the catastrophe and the darkest day, where 750,000 Palestinians lost their homes and became refugees."

1348,hXtzera0mkY,Watching these Israel Palestine conflict videos I have come to the conclusion that Israel should control the land they currently occupy if it‚Äôs morally or politically correct is up for debate but that‚Äôs war. You take the land and protect it. If the Palestinians don‚Äôt like it they should leave the area with the assistance of the UN. I don‚Äôt see a peaceful solution here in favor of Palestinians I‚Äôm sorry but throwing yourselves against a military power isn‚Äôt going to help unless you win in war.

1441,G-06Z_9SBBI,History was so wonderfully explained. You earned my respect.
1442,RYj9JAKiP1o,No way the Israeli intelligence apparatus was taken by surprise to this extent. Benjamin Netanyahu must have allowed this in order to bolster his power when there is so much pushback against his legal system changes.
1443,RYj9JAKiP1o,"If you increase the pressure in a pressure cooker, it is bound to explode."
1444,RYj9JAKiP1o,"Nobody should interfere in this War, let them get on with it. The Hate in the Middle East is so Intense, let them resolve their own issues without dragging the world into the conflict."
1445,RYj9JAKiP1o,Thanks for good reporting and interviews on the topic
1446,RYj9JAKiP1o,gentlemen...you can't fight in the holy land
1447,RYj9JAKiP1o,"The Palestinians have enough of living in humiliation with Isreali occupation. They may die but die in dignity. ""Give me liberty, or give me death!"" American Founding  father Patrick Henery. They  most ready his quote."
1448,RYj9JAKiP1o,"I love you Netanyahu!! God Bless You and  God Bless Israel,  God Bless the Peace of Jerusalem,, In Jesus name , Amen"
1449,RYj9JAKiP1o,Israeli government needs a massive game changing and they need to change some policy!
1450,RYj9JAKiP1o,Israel has been in violation of international law under UN Resolution in reference to settlement activities. It is about time for the US to focus on this violation and not favor Israel. There won't be peace if they don't cease settlement issues.
1451,RYj9JAKiP1o,"Russia: Sanctions
Isreal:"
1452,JAT9NQ4WkE0,Please keep up the good work. It is impossible to hear the truth from mainstream British media
1453,JAT9NQ4WkE0,"This is literally what I've been seeing online, and it made my stomach turn. I've taken screen recordings too. I've been twisting and turning in my bed, unable to sleep, crying intermittently throughout the day, feeling sick to my stomach, praying for Palestine and humanity as a whole all day, and then... I decided to check in on a boy I went to school with, in South Africa, who moved to Israel and joined the Israeli army a few years ago, he made a joke video as the IDF blew up a building in Khan Younis and posted it on Instagram, trying to build clout off of his active participation in genocide. He was laughing, while people were dying. I'm horrified, it's sickening. Their lack of remorse is the worst part of all of this. They are massacring people in cold blood. The power of systematic far-right indoctrination is scary. This is a humanitarian catastrophe and we're here witnessing it happen, in real time."
1454,JAT9NQ4WkE0,"It‚Äôs not about Joe Biden only. If the president was Trump, it‚Äôs the same thing. Who is controlling American‚Äôs capital, who is controlling the government is the question."
1455,JAT9NQ4WkE0,The action  of Aaron Bushnell   can make you  imagine what the feeling of the people sharing the same concern than him.
1456,JAT9NQ4WkE0,Its just so blatant at this stage... no shame... pride in fact. The cruelty is unfathomable. An entire nation brainwashed to hate 'the other'.
1457,JAT9NQ4WkE0,This is what the devil looks like when he takes over humans souls
1458,JAT9NQ4WkE0,It is a burden on the soul to witness these things and be unable to do anything about it.
1459,JAT9NQ4WkE0,I can‚Äôt believe that the world is allowing this
1460,JAT9NQ4WkE0,How horrible can supposed human beings become when they lack love and become monsters üò¢üò¢üò¢

1472,NgVXIBj905w,"I live in Trinidad üáπüáπ, I'm accustomed to the multireligious traditions of Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, Sikh and Buddhist buildings, people and hearing the various prayers. All I can say, if my people can share an island, and your people can share a nation, perhaps Muslims and Jews can share the site. Is not the site large enough for a Mosque and a Temple as they are all Abraham's children. To share is better than fighting."

1501,km-ciyqmAus,WATCH NEXT: Palestinian Homes Are Being Demolished in Jerusalem - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAm9-Cli6zs
1502,km-ciyqmAus,"Mainstream media should be cancelled. All these years they fed us propaganda. I feel like a fool and so betrayed!
Thanks to social media particularly YouTube with all the podcasts and video clips like these. I have learnt a lot since October 7th. Keep up the good work. Really appreciated.
Peace & love, South Africa. üôèüèæ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1503,km-ciyqmAus,"There is no such thing as an Israeli ""settler"". When you take land that belongs to someone else, that's not ""settling"". It's stealing."
1504,km-ciyqmAus,"When you are told to leave because you are asking too many questions, you know all you need to know about the validity of what they are doing."
1505,km-ciyqmAus,I saw some videos of treatment these settlers inflict and it was horrific. They were bullying and assaulting people who will be murdered if they defend themseles. I couldnt imagine living in such conditions.
1506,km-ciyqmAus,"This is what the mainstream media should show us, This is reality and it is shameful that so many people are being mislead in this conflict. Thank you for showing us this."
1507,km-ciyqmAus,So basically he opposes them having their own state. He wants to give them limited rights that Israeli's control. And he wonders why they keep getting attacked. You dont get to decide what another state thats supposed to be independent gets as a people. You already took their land and forced them out of their homes and you expect them to just sit back and watch????
1508,km-ciyqmAus,"if I was living somewhere and someone came n was like, ""Yeah, god gave me a message saying this is my home now"" I'd turn into a ""terrorist"" too"
1509,km-ciyqmAus,I‚Äôm Israeli and I‚Äôm embarrassed by the existence of Ben Gvir. Actually that‚Äôs an understatement. I‚Äôm ashamed. Everyone I know here feels the same way as me.
1510,km-ciyqmAus,"I even can't understand Israelis who are comfortable to live in such situation. How you can be lucky if your neighbour live in misery? And to believe that the terrorism from your neighbour ends with more military suppression, before finding a acceptable solution for both sides, is not only ignorant, it's crazy."
1511,O7ByJb7QQ9U,"Cant believe that this video is from 13 years ago, and tons of people still simply refuse to study history."
1512,O7ByJb7QQ9U,People will still be watching this video in a 100 years except the situation will be a little more confusing than now.
1513,O7ByJb7QQ9U,"A correction...It says ""in April 1920 Palestinians poured into the old city""...but these Arabs refused to be called ""Palestinians,"" in fact at the time and throughout the first half of the 20th century it was considered an insult to Arabs, like calling them ""dirty Jews"" since the Jews were the ones known as ""Palestinians."" They insisted on being called simply ""Arabs."" But yes, these are the people who perpetrated regular massacres of Jews in the 1920s and 1930s."
1514,O7ByJb7QQ9U,I am 17 years old girl with a learning disability. this is so hard for me to understand but I'm trying every day to be more informed......
1515,O7ByJb7QQ9U,"The fact that this was done 12 years ago, is amazing."
1516,O7ByJb7QQ9U,Starting wars @ losing them doesn't make you the victiim
1517,O7ByJb7QQ9U,I guess you can't have a 2-state solution when the Palestinians will only accept one state as the solution.
1518,O7ByJb7QQ9U,This is why i get triggerd of people that choose sides without knowing any history. The fact that this shows just how important history and knowledge is
1519,O7ByJb7QQ9U,"It would be nice to have an updated slide to include the more recent two presidents, and how the UN and others are behaving towards these groups today."
1520,O7ByJb7QQ9U,Sad that 12 years later there's actually even more people deluded about the truth. Especially the truths of history and it seems this particular conflict. More young dingbats than there ever used to be. Teaching the next gen is so important!!!

Not that I didnt know it but it is amazing how intellectual figure such as this beautiful professor with his poetic lovely voice laying it down. People and leaders around the world must submit to this wisdom if they want to save our planet from a disaster. Professor Avi Shalaim, please accept this sincere respect and regards from me as a muslim person who is hurt to see this horrific blood shed of innocent people; jews, Christian, and that of muslims."
1530,W43Rgzge4Po,I always felt the conflict was just too complex for me to even have an opinion. I can see it was a bypass and I was avoiding looking at painful things. Thank you so much for the education. Now I can also have talks with my young kids to make sure they don't rely on the mainstream media storyline ad I did for years.

1585,exyQ724_2nk,"What was important to hear first and foremost was that the ""home"" was recognized as a place of peace, family, and all that represents. It does not matter who the home belongs to - it is other people occupying it without invitation. HOW indignant other people from other countries would feel if this happened to them - yet Palestinian people have to accept it as part of the norm - their homes destroyed as part of the expansion and just because others ""CAN"".  It is not so long ago 75 years or so that Jewish homes were appropriated, their property either seized, confiscated, or destroyed. It makes no difference.  The feeling is exactly the same - helpless, traumatized, and violated. I do not condone any action of violence. ALL peoples deserve peace all over the world no matter who they are no matter what. Everyone deserves to be accorded dignity and respect."

1627,4vsEM90JSGI,Thank you @global for having the courage to report the truth!
1628,4vsEM90JSGI,"Thank you for better reporting. Before 1948, both Jews and Muslims settled there. However, after WW2 (about 1948), the United Nations gave Palestine to Israel and divided it up into the West Banks (where Palestinians can move freely but hard to live there) and or pushed Muslims into Gaza (40 km wide and Palestinians cannot move freely, like an open-air prison). West Banks now has more Israeli settlers moving in, so losing land there. Gaza's population is 2.4 M. Look at the map, very small land in Gaza. Israel controls mostly everything around it, including the water. Israel does not want to give up land or mix. People have been oppressed for 75 years since the United Nations took its actions. Israel is very wealthy compared to Palestine. What Hamas did is wrong. What Israel did is wrong. What the United Nations did is wrong. I have no solutions."

1631,kvmD7KJdpJA,I‚Äôm sure both sides will agree that God is going to sort it all out. It‚Äôs been doing a great job with it so far.
1632,kvmD7KJdpJA,What he failed to state was the reason Britain issued the Balfour Declaration even though  they had indirectly promised the Arabs full independence for help in fighting the Turks Opinion has always been divided in Britain but the state of Israel would not have been established if the US had not pushed for it and today continues to give it unconditional support.The problem is that in Israel  a religious hard right faction wields considerable political power even though a majority of Israelis are non religious.

1637,kvmD7KJdpJA,"As an American I despise the corruption of the Israeli lobby, seeing politicians declare unaccountable unconditional aid is gross.  But otherwise I support Israel, even if they deserve criticism on many occasions, it's the only Jewish country, and they are arguably much better global citizen than anyone in their neighborhood.  Muslims/Arabs have an ideologically deranged arrogance regarding their right to control their historical caliphates.  Jews have an older claim, but Israel has obligations to religious pilgrims, Jerusalem should maybe be a neutral religious enclave.   Let's be tough & recognize demographic perversions & and how some ""civilians"" coddle & cheer despicable groups, let's be innovative & ""ethical"", but let's defend our interests & be effective & steadfast!"
1638,kvmD7KJdpJA,The only pressure is from the UN and Human rights who gets consistently and constantly ignored
1639,kvmD7KJdpJA,"I think Sir Simon failed to mention that when Israel withdrew from Gaza, the Palestinians voted in Hamas. From that point, there were relentless rocket attacks and terrorist bombings. That's when Israel began the blockade on Gaza."
1640,kvmD7KJdpJA,The thumbnail for this video has a picture of Lt-col Yonatan Netanyahu - but this isn't followed up in the video itself - how very strange.
1641,8I8wuFrp7gI,We‚Äôve got a lot more videos about the situation in Palestine and Israel. Check them out here.: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZd3QRtSy5LNLB6pyzFcfL0M_bYybQT2g
1642,8I8wuFrp7gI,It is amazing how a people who claim to have had a unique and painful history now inflict pain upon other people without any pangs of conscience! Has Israel no shame?
1643,8I8wuFrp7gI,I am so sick and tired of evil people using religion as an excuse for the evil that they do and to delude themselves into believing they are good people.
1644,8I8wuFrp7gI,"""If I don't steal it, someone else will.""  How's that for a criminal defense strategy?  Defense attorney's the world over take note."
1645,8I8wuFrp7gI,I believe you are right. I am a new Palestinian supporter.  Can you believe I‚Äôm almost 65 and wasn‚Äôt Aware that APARTHEID existed in Israel!  That is appalling!  I happen to be American and I feel betrayed that I didn‚Äôt know and my Country didn‚Äôt tell us that Apartheid existed there!  There should be No More support for Apartheid anywhere on earth!!
1646,8I8wuFrp7gI,I can‚Äôt even imagine what will happen to these people on the day of judgement. May God protect all the true believers of Him.
1647,8I8wuFrp7gI,"Note to Muslims in particular Al-Aqsa Mosque is not a building with a dome Al-Aqsa Mosque is everything that the wall surrounded, including Al-Qibli Mosque, the Dome of the Rock, and the yard"
1648,8I8wuFrp7gI,"As an Orthodox Christian who isn‚Äôt Middle Eastern or Arab, It really pains to the maximum to see what Palestinian Christians and Muslims go through on a regular basis, and yet the ones talking about human rights currently against Russia‚Äôs actions rarely reported about it. 

Edit - If you highly disagree, Just know Jesus himself was a Palestinian who took refuge in Egypt. About the 2 way policy, Um nope. The house that I own was built in the early 1920s. If the great grandson of the constructor that built that home, Came with a Bible and said, ‚ÄúGive it to me because I have some roots here‚Äù, There would be no treaty or 2 way policy."
1649,8I8wuFrp7gI,70 years of this enough is enoughüò¢
1650,8I8wuFrp7gI,God bless heroes who stand for AlAqsa
1651,gLUk8vVxCpQ,"I think you misunderstood what they are saying (at least I hope because otherwise its really stupid). I think they want for the parts that were designated for Palestinians at 1948 to stop being occupied and for families who were forced to leave in 1948 and later to be allowed to come back.

I doubt they want british occupation again. And I also dont think that they want for the Israelis citizens to being forced to leave (some of them might want that but definitely not all of us). Forcing them to leave if they were born there would be unfair, but we should want to stop the idea that every Jew in the world should be allowed citizenship in Israel so easily."
1652,gLUk8vVxCpQ,We have to deal with grand scale psychopathyc eruption of totale ignorance ..shame
1653,gLUk8vVxCpQ,"Totally skipping the Nakba, nice."
1654,gLUk8vVxCpQ,"Before 48 = before problems.

1655,gLUk8vVxCpQ,These protestors don't know the history I Israel
1656,gLUk8vVxCpQ,God bless Israel
1657,gLUk8vVxCpQ,"Ok, she's persuasive...
Give it back to Rome or Syria.
Take your choice."
1658,gLUk8vVxCpQ,So let's just give it back to the UK then
1659,gLUk8vVxCpQ,Like most modern conflicts blame the British
1660,gLUk8vVxCpQ,Oh my God she is rewriting history. Unbelievable.

First Arab - Israeli War of 1948 - Political episode: http://bit.ly/2zyjAvs"
1682,CaIi-3huRLE,The UN security council is about to draft a resolution for this comment section
1683,CaIi-3huRLE,"I am not gonna lie, I do think this map is a bit chaotic, which is a shame. I personally prefer the style used in your ''Six-Day war'' video.  Nice informative video, though."
1684,CaIi-3huRLE,"Israel didn't start with tanks, they managed to build the 3 Sherman's after the war started from scrap heaps found at British ordnance yards. The first tanks Israel had was 2 Cromwell, which was liberated from the British forces during their withdrawal with help from sympathetic British soldiers."
1685,CaIi-3huRLE,One little nation against all odds and still come victorious. Respect sincerely.
1686,CaIi-3huRLE,"I spent several weeks in Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and the West Bank, and Egypt back in 2018. One thing that was amazing to me is how small this whole area is. The area covered in this video is barely the size of New Jersey. For a Texan like me, learning that the distance from Amman to Jerusalem is the same as Austin to San Antonio, or that Beirut is closer to Tel Aviv than Austin is to Waco, is really incredible. I pray that within my lifetime I can take a drive between those cities with something approaching the ease I do within my own state."
1687,CaIi-3huRLE,"Great video, but I do have to point out an error.  The agreement between Israel and Egypt signed in 1948 was not, as a matter of law, a treaty.  It was an armistice agreement, which has a lesser legal status.  There would not be any treaties between Israel and any Arab state until 1979, when Israel and Egypt did finally conclude a peace treaty."
1688,CaIi-3huRLE,Christ theres more people saying the comments are gonna be bad than the actual bad comments
1689,CaIi-3huRLE,"Interesting fact:  most of the weapons that Czechoslovakia (I apologize if I spelled that wrong) sent to the Israelis were, in fact, surplus weapons that had been manufactured for the Wermacht in WW2.  As such many, if not all of them, had improperly calibrated or sabotaged sights, which the Czechs had intended to mess with the Germans, but they forgot to inform the IDF about it until after the weapons had been shipped, issued and the Israelis had found out about the messed up sights.  Still, it must have struck several of the Jews as ironic that they were now using Czech Vz. 24s, Kar98ks and other weapons made for the Nazis, to defend themselves, along with a smattering of American, British, Russian and even homemade weapons."
1690,CaIi-3huRLE,Fun fact: The Avia S-199 was a Bf-109 airframe with the engine and propeller from a Heinkel He-111.
1691,7QNNClAYHFk,"This documentary tells the stories of Jews and Arabs, Israelis and Palestinians, caught trapped in a disputed land. But it also tells of those seeking an accommodation with each other, ways to share this land, ways to end the violence, and the endless cycle of accusation and recrimination."
1692,7QNNClAYHFk,So basically taking something that belongs to another is wrong. Unless you find it written in your favorite book that that something really belongs to you so it‚Äôs really ok to take it at all cost‚Ä¶and the other person who you robbed should completely understand and not be mad at all. Got it!
1693,7QNNClAYHFk,"An extraordinary documentary by ENDEVR. 
I have learned many things about Israel and Palestine. Thank you ENDEVR."
1694,7QNNClAYHFk,"Astonishing words from the Rabbi at the beginning. 

More than chilling to see a man of God rationalise apartheid like that."
1695,7QNNClAYHFk,great piece lets embrace peace not war
1696,7QNNClAYHFk,Great documentary. Deserve a lot more views.
1697,7QNNClAYHFk,"This is a compelling video that is well-made. Kudos to the team and the work that has clearly gone into telling this story, from both sides no less."
1698,7QNNClAYHFk,People should find ways to live together. Everyone is different. We should care and love humanity. Not become animals.
1699,7QNNClAYHFk,How can this be anyone's promised land? This seems to be a nightmare for everyone involved & it seems like Europe is responsible.

1712,wznD7uCEcLk,"This is true journalism. Not a debate with opposite extremest, which sell a lot more, but a debate with rational critical thinkers."
1713,wznD7uCEcLk,"It is so weird that I click a comedy link to find the first real peace summit between Muslims and Jews ever. Murtaza's logic is unbelievably reasonable; Yair provides a very logical counterweight as well. I was in Damascus watching an israeli airstrike unfold before my eyes as the sky turned sunset-orange at 9 pm on a winter night. I was shaking and in tears a few hours ago, and now after this conversation I'm like yeah, the METO thing could actually work. Thank you all for making me feel like this is not an impossible case again. Thank you; you have no idea how much more comfortable with being at a warzone this makes me feel. Appreciation."
1714,wznD7uCEcLk,The incredible insight and humanity that Jon Stewart possesses is something to be cherished! Kudos to Murtaza Hussain and Yair Rosemberg for showing the world that there are no boundaries to friendship and goodwill. Also for showing that the only magic in great journalism is honesty and integrity.
1715,wznD7uCEcLk,There is something so comedic about the fact that the best news you will get about the nuance of Israel Palestine foreign policy is from a tv channel called Comedy Central.
1716,wznD7uCEcLk,"I am grateful to the Comedy Central network for allowing this platform at all. Newscasters and reporters on major networks often face massive restrictions on their topics. Also, it must be said, few on camera reporters have the brilliance of Jon Stewart in breaking down complicated issues in ways that guide his audience into understanding them, while also offering them a choice to learn new and broader ways of thinking. I am so glad Jon is back at the helm of the Daily Show. Thank you to anyone and all who are responsible for that!"
1717,wznD7uCEcLk,"I'm so happy this video and the other one is getting millions of views... It's the most sane thing I've seen about the conflict.
I survived a terror attack in 2016 in Tel Aviv. My dream of peace will never die. They will never make me just another hater. Salam brothers"
1718,wznD7uCEcLk,Wow.... It's amazing what hearing an actual conversation can do for your mental health. Thank you so much.
1719,wznD7uCEcLk,"I would add that the reason the UN can‚Äôt pass a ceasefire resolution is that our country keeps vetoing it, regardless of the majority vote."
1720,wznD7uCEcLk,This is far better than the talking heads on major networks.

1742,0BasXaiHiiI,My family comes from France. Does that mean I can roll up in Paris bulldoze the Eiffel Tower and build my house there?
1743,0BasXaiHiiI,I have a coin from 1939 from Palestine... It's awesome how it's written both in Arabic and Hebrew... Shame that people would prefer to fight than be together...
1744,0BasXaiHiiI,"Very interesting. However, several studies using genetic tests show that the Palestinians have also lived in the area for thousands of years and they share the same genes with the bronze age people (Canaanaites) who lived in the region thousands of years ago. Also, it is possible that Palestinians today include Jews who converted to Christianity and Islam over the ages,"
1745,0BasXaiHiiI,"and thus the conflict between ""this is my ancestors land"" vs ""this is my land now"" goes on ...."
1746,0BasXaiHiiI,"Eh, where is the part about the weird pre world war II statement called 'The Balfourt Decleration'? 

'The Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 during the First World War announcing its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine, then an Ottoman region with a small minority Jewish population. The declaration was contained in a letter dated 2¬†November 1917 from the United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Lord Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, for transmission to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. The text of the declaration was published in the press on 9¬†November 1917. '"
1747,0BasXaiHiiI,"Where does the name Canaan fit in? Wasn't the name Palestina a name given to Judea by the Romans after the Bar Kokhba rebellion was squelched by the Romans? I certainly stand to be corrected if i am wrong,"
1748,0BasXaiHiiI,Will there be a sequel video to what happened after 1948?
1749,0BasXaiHiiI,"Many Palestinians and Jews are actually genetically related. Of course not all of them, but many are related as modern Palestinians are a mixture of ancient Israelis, Greco-Roman and Arabs."
1750,0BasXaiHiiI,"I think the problem is that many Ashkenazi Israeli Jews still have PTSD epigenetically transmitted from their ancestors who suffered under Nazi Germany and Mizrahi Jews have the same due to the expulsions from Arab lands, which leads both of these groups to think oppressing another people is ok. Just give the Palestinians their independent state. Who cares if they existed as an ethnicity 100, 200 or 1000 years ago, they‚Äôre there NOW and suffering. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be the 1967 borders."
1751,8RVoPZPKxLY,Shame to all the world leaders that couldn't solve this conflict for over 50 years.
1752,8RVoPZPKxLY,The fact that we're in 2023 and there are people who see nothing wrong with this and justify and defend it says all about humanity.
1753,8RVoPZPKxLY,"Now i understand why Palestinians themselves living with Israelis was impossible, and the notion people told that Israel government is more concerned about Palestinians was wrong on so many levels."
1754,8RVoPZPKxLY,"What happend on october 7th,23, is not a cause but a consequence of unfairness,  humiliation, abuse and dehumanization"
1755,8RVoPZPKxLY,"I'm a reform Jewish American, a Democrat. This behavior is why I'm not a Zionist. Another example of trouble caused by the far right."
1756,8RVoPZPKxLY,They all need to be held accountable for crimes against humanity.
1757,8RVoPZPKxLY,"I'm living in America and never been terrified of a society more than this one, my ultimate nightmare. Surreal. My life will never be the same again after knowing what's happening in Palestine."
1758,8RVoPZPKxLY,"""The occupying state lies in all languages of good and evil; and whatever it says, it lies-and whatever it has, it has stolen.""

Friedrich Nietzsche"
1759,8RVoPZPKxLY,It's a shame I was born on the same day the Nakbah happened just in a different century. I'm from Germany and I stand with Palestine and anyone bearing injustice. May Allah subhana wa ta'ala make it easy for my Palestanian Ummah and may everyone of you get to Jannah al Firdous.

I live in New Jersey. My roots are Jordanian and Palestinian.

I need to thank you for your voice and your great knowledge for being brave to speak the truth through oceans of hard work, pure dedication and wisdom.
Speaking the truth no matter the cost is not easy and you handled this with grace and great dignity.
I praise your courage and your love for life and justice.
You have helped me to be able to cope better and with insight from a person who knows very well the other side when it comes to the truth about Palestine.
In my eyes you are soldier of  truth and of moral high ground,brave to stand tall even though evil and blind,stone hearts attack with falsehood and plain arrogance matched with ignorance.
May you be blessed and protected with the righteous path.

O believers! Stand firm for justice as witnesses for Allah even if it is against yourselves, your parents, or close relatives. Be they rich or poor, Allah is best to ensure their interests. So do not let your desires cause you to deviate Àπfrom justiceÀ∫. If you distort the testimony or refuse to give it, then Àπknow thatÀ∫ Allah is certainly All-Aware of what you do.
Your sister,

1769,nUfWTHbCS78,Thank you Norman for dedicating your life to this work. I know you said in a recent video that you became pessimistic about your work and starting thinking that there was no solution to this tragic situation.

1774,TJ2U-cjneNg,Absolutely sick
1775,TJ2U-cjneNg,You'd also rush the food and water trucks when you're starving and dehydrated. Anyone would.

1777,TJ2U-cjneNg,Now we can understand why Aaron Bushnell has to that.  This is what he saw every day.
1778,TJ2U-cjneNg,If you told me this was footage from a zombie apocalypse movie I would believe it.
1779,TJ2U-cjneNg,That footage is deeply disturbing. So heartbreaking to see innocent folks tragically impacted by the turmoil. It's crucial that a peaceful solution is found.
1780,TJ2U-cjneNg,Wait they were ordered to shoot unarmed civilians in the legs?
1781,Tz7JJcO-rWw,"I‚Äôve searched and completed multiple pieces of research on this topic. Once you and understand what happened, it‚Äôs not hard to side with Palestinians. This is Britains fault and they should be the one cleaning up this mess."
1782,Tz7JJcO-rWw,"And now Britain seems to have forgotten about this declaration, behaving as if they have nothing to do with the problems in the region. What an embarrassment to humanity they are. üòÇ"
1783,Tz7JJcO-rWw,"Fascinating account, well put together video. 

One must not forget either, that In the First World War (1914‚Äì1918) the British sided with the Arabs to fight against the Ottoman Empire of that time. The Ottoman Turks lost that war and both Britain and France alongside the US had a meeting in Paris in 1919 where it would be decided what the fate of Turkey's lands would become in the Middle East.

The Arabs had been reassured that if they fought against the Turks, they would be given their own empire and land on which  they could rule and govern. This promise was BROKEN however, by the British at the so called 'Peace Conference'. The subsequent Arab lands ended up in the control of both Britain and France and would remain so up until they believed the Arabs were ready to rule them themselves.

To get to the depth of this period of history, one must understand the involvement of Jews in all of this. You see, the history of the Jewish people stretches back a very long time and that is not surprising as its one of the oldest Abrahamic faiths extending its origins to even before Bibical times.  When the Roman empire was reigning supreme and controlling large swathes of territory stretching from Europe to the Middle East, the Jews lived in and around a region what is now commonly called Palestine.  They were driven out of there by the Romans around 70AD and as a result Jews would migrate around the world and settle down where they could. This would happen over the course of around two millennia.

Eventually at the end of 19th Century, a man named Theodor Herzl, an Austro-Hungarian Jewish lawyer and Political activist became the pioneer and founded of what we refer to as 'The Zionist Movement'. 

The idea behind the Zionist movement was simply to establish a Jewish homeland, with Zion meaning 'promised land'.  It just so happened that this 'promised land' would be smack bang in the middle of modern day Palestine. Theodor Herzl advocated and staunchly believed that it was the place God intended the Jews to live.

Sometime around 1917, Lord Balfour, a British Government Ministor promised that the British Government would assist the Jews in establishing a homeland in Palestine. This became known to the world as 'The Balfour Declaration'. 

Ultimately what this did was put Britain in a complicated situation since this very same land was initially promised to be handed back to the Arabs, land which it must be noted never belonged to the British, the French and certainly not to USA."
1784,Tz7JJcO-rWw,"i still find it hard to understand how, why and where the british gets the gall to believe that they have power to declare something, especially one that affects the lives of a nation. why do the europeans in general feel that they're entitled to ""own"" the rest of the world and its resources? makes me wonder how the world would have been if the europeans did not exist."
1785,Tz7JJcO-rWw,"there where some mps in the Chilean Government (there about 500,000 Palestinians in chile) wanted the British Government to apologize for the Balfour Declaration"
1786,Tz7JJcO-rWw,Explained in best ever possible way - Thank You
1787,Tz7JJcO-rWw,"Great video. ""Why the mid-east bleeds"" by Ted Pike is a great watch too. Very telling!"
1788,Tz7JJcO-rWw,Can you talk about who the Rothschilds are and why the Declaration was addressed to them??? ü§îüôÑüò¨ü§≠ü§´ü§ê
1789,Tz7JJcO-rWw,"At that time the British Foreign secretary was seen as the most powerful person in the world, basically in charge of the British empire."
1790,Tz7JJcO-rWw,The Jews also promised to bring USA into ww2 if Britain gave Palestine to them.
1791,1kYWII25cxM,"Fat respect for not disabling comments, there needs to be more discussion on this"
1792,1kYWII25cxM,"I believe that there are people on both sides who would accept a two-state solution, or come up with a better solution. But at the end of the day as long as extremists exist on both sides to derail peace in their chase of their own all or nothing goals and ambitions, peace will never be possible. 
In conclusion, people on both sides will continue to die and suffer because extremists on both sides take up an all or nothing attitude. It is perhaps the saddest situation of the 20th and 21st centuries."
1793,1kYWII25cxM,Excellent summary. Factual and brief. Thxüëç
1794,1kYWII25cxM,"*Here we go, because we all know, The comment section is going to be far more interesting than the video.*"
1795,1kYWII25cxM,"By looking at the what's going on with the failures of peace talks, it seems like the problem is the leadership. Why not solve this issue by a referendum?"
1796,1kYWII25cxM,Dude looks like baker mayfield
1797,1kYWII25cxM,I lived there 14 months I am a gentile and every Arab I spoke with said they hated the jews. And the Jews always said I hope for a position solution and they were always kind to me God bless them.
1798,1kYWII25cxM,"I have watched this issue rage by entire life from the US.¬† So, I've never lived in Israel but have lived in the region once for about 18 months.¬† I think the issue can be solved but this would involve compromises from each side that maybe no one is willing to make or has been so far.¬† I think the Arab nations were crazy to reject the partition plan in the first place but, be that as it may, things turned out the way they have for many reasons.¬† This reminds me of may issues in the US where we only have two major political parties which means that compromise, while always possible, is a bit harder to actually arrive at."
1799,1kYWII25cxM,One of the best explanations I've ever seen. I live in Jerusalem. I can see the Mosque from my house.and deal with oppression on Palestinians and terror against the Israelis.

1803,dEoVzKyD_IM,"I failed every history course I've ever taken. Can't stay awake when people start talking about the past. 40min of this I learned more about israel and everything that I learned in total in school. Hell, I never knew about the 6 day war until I made some comment like ""there's never been a war that was less than a week, come on!"" and proceeded to get schooled. Ben should teach history!"
1804,dEoVzKyD_IM,"It is so evident, don't understand why there are people in the west that support Palestina"
1805,dEoVzKyD_IM,"17:37   I remember seeing this picture and the story behind it.    Apparently, the mindset was that whoever goes through the door first to the negotiating table is in a weak position.     Whereas I have always been taught that to open a door for someone and let them go in first is just a sign of politeness."
1806,dEoVzKyD_IM,Everyone who has an opinion on this conflict needs to watch this video!
1807,dEoVzKyD_IM,So Ben is talking so fast that youtube offers vietnamese subtitles
1808,dEoVzKyD_IM,"Ben Shapiro, please do an update video from 2021 to December 2023 which would help continue this history lesson"
1809,dEoVzKyD_IM,Well explained. How come college kids when watching this don't believe this and still stand with Hamas?
1810,dEoVzKyD_IM,The fact that the video is 2 years old in 2024 but still fit the current situation almost perfectely is quite unsettling

1821,ZfNbxVa3YLo,Man..piers started by saying that Hamas beheaded babies in a village but he denied that he ever said this while interviewing the guy with the Palestinian wife
1822,ZfNbxVa3YLo,"Ain't no way Piers tries to convince us he's neutural in other interviews. He's a completely different person here, no interruptions, letting ben speak as he please"
1823,ZfNbxVa3YLo,Piers in his most behaved episode.
1824,ZfNbxVa3YLo,"I know this interview was a while back. But I just finished the Andrew Tate interview Piers did, and you can tell a whole different side of journalism and professionalism when you compare the two. No interruptions and even let‚Äôs Ben finish a sentence, take a breath, and wait for Ben to get ready before asking another question. Just crazy the interaction. Prayers for all."
1825,ZfNbxVa3YLo,Pierce did mentioned ‚Äú decapitated  babies in some villages‚Äù and strongly denied it on the other interview.

1827,ZfNbxVa3YLo,"15 seconds in, he said the lie about babies being beheaded . Yet he told Bassem yesterday he never said that. Outrageous."

1839,jG8Feqn6Z0E,This isn‚Äôt old news. This is something that has been going on for decades. Now that it‚Äôs only getting more coverage from media for they‚Äôre own agenda. Unfortunately for them that they aren‚Äôt getting the help they been needing since the 90‚Äôs.

1841,XYn5t0tuuAk,"I fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, 13 years.  You would think I would hold hate and animosity toward anyone that was Muslim, or from Afghanistan or the Middle East but I do not.  War is a waste of time and resources and more importantly lives.  I love everyone around the world.  I dont hold on to hate.  It‚Äôs not worth it.  Good message Arnold.  I just have one hope, maybe one day we will all just see each other as humans, not nationality, not religion, not skin color, or sexuality."
1842,XYn5t0tuuAk,This reminded me of my grandfather.  He taught me many of these things.  It didn't take right away.  I was stubborn.  But he never gave up on me.  Eventually he got through.

The mention of the adaptation of Sykes-Picot geopolitical borders from that of the Ottomans and the fact that the Ottoman's version had already disregarded the ethnic diversities in their calculations makes it so much more comprehendible to today's observer!
