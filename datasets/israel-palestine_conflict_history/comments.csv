0,R0ftmf_Uv9A,No matter how many times these information gets thrown to our eyes. The ignorant will remain put a blind eye to the oppressed which is sad.
1,R0ftmf_Uv9A,"*To learn who RULES over you, simply find out who you are NOT allowed to CRITICIZE.*"
2,R0ftmf_Uv9A,"Say that part again: Jewish , Christian‚Äôs and Muslims were living peacefully till some Europeans came and then you make people refugees and take their land  also if you were trying to come live in someone‚Äôs house for any reason at least bring a plan that shares equally or give the owner 70 and take 30"
3,R0ftmf_Uv9A,So sad. They were living in peace and now suffering for 7 decades üò¢
4,R0ftmf_Uv9A,Why start at 1946?
5,R0ftmf_Uv9A,"Thank's Ireland, for being consistent n vocal to supporting our Palestinian brothersüôèüôè, we from Indonesia really appreciate thisüôèüôè"
6,R0ftmf_Uv9A,"This is not a  conflict, this is occupation."
7,R0ftmf_Uv9A,"What‚Äôs interesting and perhaps often missed is that Jews and Arabs were living peacefully together for many years in the Middle East before the State of Israel was created. 

Jews in the Middle East did not suffer problems with discrimination, however Jews in Europe did. It was the European Jews who agitated for the creation of the State of Israel, in which both Arabs as well as non-European Jews are considered inferior to the European Jews. We keep saying Israel is a Jewish state. It would be more accurate to say that it‚Äôs a ‚ÄúEuropean Jewish‚Äù state, in which all who are not of European Jewish descent are discriminated against, in one way or another."
8,R0ftmf_Uv9A,Let peace prevail.
9,R0ftmf_Uv9A,What happened the video was removed and put again!!
10,Bno1m1zhIWs,Who else is here trying to understand what‚Äôs going on right now
11,Bno1m1zhIWs,Insane how the HISTORY channel of all places actually educated people about actual History and in a notably unbiased fashion.
12,Bno1m1zhIWs,"Finally. An objective concise summary with no religious,political,or racial agenda. Well done History channel."
13,Bno1m1zhIWs,This is the first video which has actually explained things thoroughly! Best way to understand a problem is go back to the original roots of the situation. Thank you for the insight.
14,Bno1m1zhIWs,"Here watching this in 2023... It's sad how it's just like a broken record at this point. So many innocent people dying just because of where they were born.... all over land, random religious beliefs and man made borders. I wish we could all just get along and share this gift of a planet together."
15,Bno1m1zhIWs,Thank you for this excellent breakdown of the history. So many have never heard the total story. Your summation of the multigenerational conflict was well presented.
16,Bno1m1zhIWs,Great Britain has caused so many problems through out history
17,Bno1m1zhIWs,The best and most concise clip on explaining this conflict I have ever seen.  And in only six minutes.
18,Bno1m1zhIWs,"I read a complete history once, like 800+ pages worth. But it‚Äôs such a complex and polarising history that relatively small/ brief events have had long lasting impact.
So absolutely I‚Äôm here for the refresh, like almost everyone."
19,Bno1m1zhIWs,WOW Insane how the HISTORY channel of all places actually educated people about actual History and in a notably unbiased fashion. Nice!

21,0anQIEeLonA,"As a Palestinian, I have always felt some bias from Indian media against us. But I have to be fair, you have done a good job summarizing the history of the conflict. Thanks"
22,0anQIEeLonA,"From someone who's a history buff, thank you for this unbiased reporting of history."
23,0anQIEeLonA,"I've done some basic research on this subject over the years, but so much of what was presented in this video is new to me...I applaud the creators for giving such a concise and focused account, sharing each side's POV, giving us a much clearer view on the past and present situation üëèüèæüëçüèæ"
24,0anQIEeLonA,An excellent presentation of how the Israel-Palestine conflict began. Very well written in a chronological order in simple English. Hope millions will watch this video. I expect more of this to come in the future. Good luck to you Priyanka.
25,0anQIEeLonA,Thank you for explaining the reasons for this war from both sides so clearly and factual. I appreciate the history lesson.
26,0anQIEeLonA,"The most concise , informative explanation of this crisis done in under 14 minutes. I‚Äôll pass this on and hope others do too."
27,0anQIEeLonA,"Amazing synopsis, pertinent timelines, and balanced & unbiased presentation‚Ä¶all done in approx 14 minutes!üòÇ‚ù§ My decree:  This MUST be shared with the multiples!üòÇ"

36,iRYZjOuUnlU,Thank you for this video. It really cleared things up because I was misinformed by one of my acquaintances regarding the history of Palestine-Israel. I'd like to be educated more about this conflict.
37,iRYZjOuUnlU,"Britain and France be like: ""Hobbies include drawing straight lines on maps"""
38,iRYZjOuUnlU,What a great video. A lot of people my age blindly support one side or the other without actually knowing anything about the history at all
39,iRYZjOuUnlU,"My father was born in Haifa, which was then British Palestine, in 1944.  When he was 4 years old, my grandparents took him to England on holiday only to be refused back due to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.  So they had to settle and set up their life in the UK.  My grandparents were once part of the aristocracy and they ended up living on a council estate in Portsmouth.  It's strange to think that I am a product of war; I would not exist if that war had not broken out."
40,E4iygQ--7dk,"Another thing, when britain received he mandate over the region, it divided palestina into two part, the eastern part was given to the Hashemite family from Saudi arabia in exchange for their support in the first world war. This is how the state of jordan was created, which is actually part of palestina. Most of the Jordanians are palastinian."
41,E4iygQ--7dk,"A Brief History of the name Palestine and its derivative Adjective Palestinian:

 1.	Palestine is Judea, the Roman name for ‚ÄòLand of the Jews‚Äô when the Roman Emperor Hadrian re-named this land as Palestina in 135 CE. Since then, it was never an Islamic State. [‚ÄòIn the 2nd century CE, the Romans crushed the Jewish revolt and Judea was renamed Syria Palestina‚Äô ‚Äì Jewish Virtual Libr.]

2.	The Pre-Islamic Arabs were in the Roman armies and witnessed both Jerusalem‚Äôs destruction and the name change of Judea. [Flavius Josephus Wars, Book V, Ch 13, 4]. As well, the Quran mentions Israel as the land of the Jews. Thereby, the Muslim people would be fully aware Palestine referred to the Jews for 2,000 years.

3.	The historical archives of the Persians, Greeks, Romans, British, French and Americans refer to Palestine as the ‚Äòhistorical homeland of the Jews‚Äô, not of the Muslim peoples. America‚Äôs early Presidents initiated Israel‚Äôs return prior to Britain and Herzl: ‚ÄúRestoring the Jews to their national home in Palestine is a noble dream. My emancipated hope is the restoring of the Jews to their nation home in Palestine‚Äù - President Abraham Lincoln to Canadian Zionist Wentworth Monk; 1863. 

4.	The term Palestine was introduced in the Hebrew Bible from the term Plishtim [‚ÄòInvaders‚Äô]. The Muslims disdained the name Palestine, as they do the term ‚ÄòZionists‚Äô today. In 1947, the Arabs virtually begged of Britain not to use this name for the land. Thereby, the usurping of this name in the 1960‚Äôs is not credible as a mark of land ownership, because it was not one of historical usage by the Arabs. 

5.	 A host of Islamic scholars and historians decried and rejected Muslims as Palestinians.: ‚ÄúAllah Gave the Land of Israel to the Jews. The al-Aqsa Mosque was built on top of Solomon‚Äôs Temple.‚Äù - Eleventh century historian Muhammad Ibn Ahmad al-Maqdisi and fourteenth century Iranian religious scholar Hamdallah al-Mustawfi // ‚ÄúThere is no such thing as ‚ÄòPalestine‚Äô in history, absolutely not.‚Äù - Arab-American historian and Princeton University Professor, Philip Hitti, testifying before the Anglo-American Committee in 1946] 

6.	A host of Jewish organizations and Institutions were called by the prefix of Palestine or Palestinian in the 20th century, including ‚ÄòThe Jewish Palestine Brigade‚Äô in Britain‚Äôs WW2 Military Forces; The [Jewish] Palestine Symphony Orchestra; Today‚Äôs Jerusalem Post media was called ‚ÄúThe Palestine Post‚Äù. 

7.	 There are no Arab Muslim Palestinians on record prior to the 20th century; the land was referred only as the homeland of the Jews. It is validated by a host of archives by many nations, and some one million Archaeological relics. Thereby, the nativity claim can only apply to Jews. In fact, there was never a time of no Jews in Palestine the past 2,000 years, as evidenced by the Crusaders, Islamic invasions and the previous Ottomans. 

8.	Generally, real natives do not usurp the name of other natives, especially one they disdained. [‚ÄúThere is a propaganda war going on now with regard to the term ‚ÄòPalestine.‚Äô It is specifically employed to avoid the use of the name Israel, and must be considered an anti-Israel term.‚Äù - Dr. Thomas McCall, the Senior Theologian of Levitt Ministry, quoting Zola Levitt.] 

9.	 The previous Islamic Ottoman rulers of Arabia declared Palestine as the homeland of the Jews. - ‚ÄúWho can challenge the rights of the Jews in Palestine? Good Lord, historically it is really your country‚Äù - Ottoman Mayor and scholar Yusuf Diya al-Khalidi; Jerusalem, 1899. 

10.	 Judea‚Äôs original, previous name was Israel in 1002 BCE, established under King David; and again in 1947 when this country was re-established by the UN. ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô is mentioned in the Quran as one belonging to the Jews. [Joshua J. Mark , Ancient History Encyl.) 

11.	 All Religious Scriptures acknowledge Palestine as the ‚ÄòLand of Israel‚Äô; ‚ÄòLand of Judea‚Äô; and ‚ÄòLand of the Jews‚Äô ‚Äì including the Hebrew Bible [1 Samuel 13:19]; The New Testaments [ ‚ÄòAnd he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.‚Äô - Matt. 2:21]; The Quran - [Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:20-21.]; and the Dead Sea Scrolls. 

12.	 The Original Philistines converted to the Hebrew Belief and became Israelites. The term Palestine is derived from the Philistines, a Greek Island people who invaded Canaan some 4,000 years ago. The Philistines converted to the Hebrew belief under a peace offer by King David, and held prominent positions in David‚Äôs army. [‚ÄúThey (the Philistines) met with a severe defeat, however, early in the reign of David (2 Samuel 5:20), he succeeded in reducing them to a state of vassalage (2 Samuel 8:1). In the year of the fall of Samaria (721 B.C.) they became vassals of Sargon. After the time of the Assyrians the Philistines cease to be mentioned by this name. In the ebb and flow of warring nations over this land it is more than probable that they were gradually absorbed and lost their identity. - [The Catholic Encyl.). / The Philistine cities lost their independence to Assyria, and revolts in following years were all crushed. [Myers 1997, p. 313.] / The theory of the ‚ÄúLost Ten Tribes‚Äù calls for (1) all inhabitants of the Northern Kingdom of Hoshea to be deported by Shalmaneser and Sargon, 722-718 B.C [Hearyhim, Weebly, Armstrongism] / They (the Canaanites) were indeed assimilated into the Israelite nation. When the Assyrians overran the Kingdom of Israel, they did not leave any Canaanite aside, as they had all become Israelites by that time. Therefore, the only people that can trace back a lineage to the ancient Canaanites are the Jews. The Canaanites did not exist any longer after the 8th century b.c.e. and they were not annihilated but assimilated into the Jewish people. - [The True Identity of the So-called Palestinians, imninalu] / The Bible describes the Philistines as remaining ‚Äúsubdued‚Äù during David‚Äôs reign [Philistine; New World Enycl.]/ Josephus, Antiquities, Book 11, Ch.1] & [Esdras 13:39] Q. How then did the Muslims become Palestinians, an adjective of Palestine, in the 1960‚Äôs, and have been using this name as the antithesis of Judea and Israel¬¨¬¨¬¨? A. The Palestinian Name Deception: Those in the West who manoeuvred this name upon Muslims did so to mock, if not desecrate, the history, belief and culture of the Muslim people. Thereby it should be overturned by honourable Muslims."
42,E4iygQ--7dk,Well it seems that the creator of this video skipped a few HISTORY lessons.
43,E4iygQ--7dk,Your 1967 Map is wrong this was not occupied land.
44,E4iygQ--7dk,"ü§£THAT IS NOT a map of Palestine In 1946 LOL ""Palestine"" the country or well ""the state of palestine"" didnt even exist yet. In fact in 46 Israel didnt even exist lol. It was founded in 2 years later, and the state of palestine over 40 years later. That ENTIRE area was British Mandate Palestine, which wasnt even a country first of all and then named it after the roman name of Syria Palestine, which the romans had renamed from ""Roman Province of Judea"", after beating the jewish revolt and expelling jews from their land, they renamed it after the jews historical enemies, The philistines (which have NOTHING to do with Palestine or modern day Palestenians) SO NO, that is NOT a map of ""Palestine in 46.. I mean if within the first 3 seconds you cant be unbiased, and historically accurate why even bother tackling this incredibly complex subject?"
45,E4iygQ--7dk,History starts from canaan period not 1946
46,E4iygQ--7dk,"* and the muslims and christians were living next to each other * Who were the first in  State of Isreal ? . The Christians ,The Ottarmans or Muslims"
47,E4iygQ--7dk,Looks like a rat nibbling cheese
48,E4iygQ--7dk,"See the sies pico agreement from 1916 which divided the territory between France and britain, and created new countries. See olso the agreement from the Paris peace conference of 1919 in which the arabs and the jews reached  an agreement on a Jewish state in the territory of Israel including the west Bank. and a large arab state that including the area of syria and jordan. The agreement failed only when the arab learned that syria had been given to france in sies pico agreement."

50,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,What do you think of the conflict going on right now?
51,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,the history of the two seem very different depending on who‚Äôs telling the story.
52,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,"So much hurt and pain. Both Arabs and Jews have been on that land. I remember when I was a grade school girl our graduation from 8th grade. We had watched the movie Exodus and selected a song from that to sing during our ceremony. I still remember the words ‚ÄúThis land is mine God gave this land to me.‚Äù

Hearts and minds need to change toward each other. All believe in the God of Abraham, we are brothers. My prayers and the prayers of my spiritual group are holding that whole area in a bright golden light of gold bringing wisdom, intelligence, and love to the entire Middle East.

Now that I am almost 80 I pray I may see the peace I sang for so long ago."
53,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,As someone who has some Jewish ancestry my best friend living there and having cousins all throughout Israel and knowing some good honest Palestinian Americans it‚Äôs just sad
54,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,We want peace! No more war
55,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,"""When a foreigner resides with you in your land, you must not oppress him. You must treat the foreigner living among you as native-born and love him as yourself, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God."" Leviticus 19:34"
56,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,"If you zoom out for a moment and just look at the two people you must state that whatever noble and/or religious goal they thought they had when they took up the fight as invader or occupant, it has surely long since outweighed any rational basis for building a future and/or living in peace by committing murder and genocide in the process. That is what happens when a seemingly righteous religious or national cause becomes fanatism, even terrorism, and bigotry of the worst kind."
57,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,"Some reading for people interested in knowing more about the issue:

Anonymous Soldiers: The Struggle for Israel, 1917-1947 by Bruce Hoffman;

59,ZQUtT3pnw5Q,Good conclusive video
60,6foH3Zc82ZQ,it's unbelievable that nobody mentions or blames the British for setting up the region for failure.
61,6foH3Zc82ZQ,"Watching a documentary that presents the formation of modern Israel in such a grim light is personally jarring for me. I had long held the view of Israel as a sanctuary for a people who had suffered immeasurable atrocities. To suddenly be confronted with the idea that its foundation is marred by acts of violence, terrorism, and potentially even genocide against Palestinians shakes the core of what I thought I knew. It's like experiencing a form of betrayal, where a narrative I held to be virtuous is revealed to have dark undertones. It's not just an intellectual exercise in reassessing history; it's a gut punch that makes me question the stories we're told and the stories we choose to believe. It's a painful reckoning with complexity in a world that's easier to navigate in black and white."
62,6foH3Zc82ZQ,"This is the reason us Irish üá®üáÆ, proudly support the Palestinians and their cause but most people around the world fail to understand that or what this conflict is all about üò¢."
63,6foH3Zc82ZQ,never let a british guy near a map and ask him to draw borders
64,6foH3Zc82ZQ,I'm blown away by the Jewish solder laughing when he was asked how many Palestinians he had killed. No loss of life should ever be met by laughter.  This has truly troubled me
65,6foH3Zc82ZQ,"That first Israeli soldier laughing about how he didn't count how many Palestinians he killed and that he had a 250 bullet clip.... Imagine if a former Nazi soldier gave an interview like that about their conduct during WW2. 

They'd be hauled off to the World Court and hanged.

This guy.... Gets to hang out in polite society and live out his life in relative peace. 

Humans are insane.

EDIT: It's insane to me how many people out there give cover to a holocaust being perpetuated upon a people, by another group of people who should f++king know better after they suffered a holocaust. 

There are Israeli politicians literally calling for another Nakba."
66,6foH3Zc82ZQ,free palestine
67,6foH3Zc82ZQ,"As I say, you don't have to be a Muslim to feel the pain, you just have to be a human"
68,6foH3Zc82ZQ,"This sounds similar to how British split India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Once they understood they couldn't trouble anymore actively,  they left a passive trouble as a separation gift. The entire Indian Subcontinent is still enjoying that gift!"
69,6foH3Zc82ZQ,"What blows my mind is that after experiencing all the atrocities and persecution in Europe, Jewish people went and did pretty much the same thing to Palestinians."

90,zE8GCX1w3ys,I‚Äôve been trying to figure this conflict out. The problem is every video has a different narrative.
91,zE8GCX1w3ys,You left out the part where 2/3 of the area was given to create Jordan.
92,zE8GCX1w3ys,"Historical fact; The Romans changed the name of Judea to Syria Palaestinia in 135 AD after the Bar Kokhva Revolt, which is sometimes called the Third Jewish-Roman War. At the same time, the Romans expelled most Jews from the province. The purpose was to destroy the cultural identity of the province, and spread the Jews throughout the empire in order to prevent another revolt."
93,zE8GCX1w3ys,"It was the British that started this.  After they made a mess of things, they said, ""Here UN you fix our mess.""  My heart breaks for all the souls that lost their loved ones."
94,zE8GCX1w3ys,"May I be so bold as to point out the Palestinians rejected the two state solution on 5 separate occasions.  Too, when one group calls for the extermination of the other group, peace is not possible."
95,zE8GCX1w3ys,"you miss the part that after 1948 war, west bank become jordan and gaza become egypt belonging and.. you also miss the part that palestina not yet become a country at that time until today. that the reason why the urgency palestina become a nation is more urgent than seizing the whole state."
96,zE8GCX1w3ys,"There‚Äôs an old Indian proverb:
If you see 2 fish in a pond fighting...a British just walked by."
97,zE8GCX1w3ys,"Up until 4:00 , his complaint would be with the British and the UN.
Immediately after that, there is no mention of Arab nations attacking Israel.
So are all of the other historical sources wrong, or is he merely choosing to omit any facts that might support Israel?"
98,zE8GCX1w3ys,"I appreciate that this video provides a few details that I had never heard before.  However, you mention ""arbitrary arrests"" and the construction of walls without mentioning the suicide attacks that precipitated them.  This is a critical mistake that calls your intentions into question.  How can I trust these new details if you leave out such obvious ones?"
99,zE8GCX1w3ys,Interesting video. Now you know what it was like to be a Christian in Turkey from the fall of Constantinople in 1453 to the present day.
100,F1H1SA0F_wY,"I will never forget what my highschool history teacher said, ""history is written by the winners..."" therefore its onesided. I stand with humanity and the right to survive. I stand with the innocents and civilians on both sides; the people who want peace. Corrupt governments and extremist groups are damaging in so many ways. Neither side will stop until everyone is dead in a wasteland. This is devastating."
101,F1H1SA0F_wY,After doing research on this subject i find it hard to side with one side or the other. Both have done terrible things to each other and it blows my mind how people so far removed from this conflict can be so confident in the side they support. This is an extremely complicated matter.
102,F1H1SA0F_wY,"I think that creating a homeland for Jews after the atrocities of the Holocaust during WW2 was in theory a good one. An idea that was well-intentioned. However, in tangible and practical terms Palestinians were displaced from their homes and have had to suffer in order to create this homeland. I'm not sure it was right to create suffering for one group of people in an attempt to to alleviate the suffering of another. It was well-intentioned I believe, but I do not understand how it was ever thought that it could work. Was there not even a consideration that it might cause resentment by the Palestinians? (I am NOT by the way, saying that extreme violence commiting war crimes or taking hostages  is the answer! I am in no way condoning violence or war of any kind). I am simply saying that it seems naive to think that it would not have caused problems between the Jewish people/ Israelis and The Muslim/ Palestinian people, to believe that everyone would just live in harmony..."
103,F1H1SA0F_wY,"For someone who had no idea or context on what has been happening, I'm grateful for this video. Thanks"
104,F1H1SA0F_wY,"It's quite shocking and shameful that they say the world is full of educators, entrepreneurs, humanitarians, leaders, explorers, innovators, visionaries, politicians, political scientists, professors, philanthropists, scholars, rich people, rich countries, and religious leaders, yet no one has been able to provide a permanent solution to this problem."
105,F1H1SA0F_wY,I pray that we can just live in peace and harmony one day
106,F1H1SA0F_wY,This is probably the most informative explanation of current situation than any other news media. Thank you!
107,F1H1SA0F_wY,The fact this lady says ‚ÄúHamas killed hundreds of ‚Äúcivilians‚Äù and Israel responded by killing 100s‚Äù rather than referring to the Palestinian civilians brutally killed as ‚Äúcivilians‚Äù speaks volumes about the media‚Äôs complicity in the massacres of Palestinians.
108,F1H1SA0F_wY,"One thing I never see explained in these videos, and perhaps the most significant part of why this conflict has persisted (and probably will for generations), is the religious side to this conflict which crucial to understand: that Jews and Muslims of Palestine both believe the area we know as Jerusalem was given to them by the God/Allah as their ""promised land / Zion"".  For muslims, it is the place where Muhammad ascended to heaven. Back in the 19th century when politics and religion were very intertwined, leaders made political decisions from religious standpoints, leading to this conflict in the first place. Understanding the religious emotions of the conflict is step one."
109,F1H1SA0F_wY,"Imagine going to sleep and waking up in the middle of a violent war with no end in sight, oh my goshüò¢"
110,kI_spMxp6t8,As a uk citizen I agree with you. We have done so much damage over the decades.
111,kI_spMxp6t8,"I don't know... the whole ""We're God's chosen people"" thing doesn't sound that much different than Hitler declaring the Germans to be the master race to me."
112,kI_spMxp6t8,"Think of a scenario: someone came into your house as a guest and you let them stay. But within a few days he said that he's also the owner of the house, and after a few more days he kicked you out of YOUR OWN HOUSE.

The same thing happened with the people of Palestine, they were the house owner and now Israel forcefully trying to kick them out of their own lands."
113,kI_spMxp6t8,What right did America and Britain have to sign off another man's land to another people? This is the root cause of the conflict in the Middle East.
114,kI_spMxp6t8,"My father was born in Haifa, which was then British Palestine, in 1944.  To a British father and Palestinian mother.  When he was 4 years old, my grandparents took him to England on holiday (to see family) only to be refused back due to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.  So they had to settle and set up their life in the UK.  My grandmother was once part of the aristocracy and she ended up living on a council estate in Portsmouth and became working class.  It's strange to think that I am a product of war; I would not exist if that war had not broken out."
115,kI_spMxp6t8,I want to see more information on this topic but it does seem to be a major issue. I must admit that I agree with the people of Palestine. Israel seems to be more evil in their actions to steal the land of Palestine. I think this situation should have been treated differently and all of this violence will not happen.
116,kI_spMxp6t8,"Similarly in India, British left in a rush and left India and Pakistan fighting against each other."
117,kI_spMxp6t8,"Excellent video for explaining how things in Palestine got to be this way. Sadly, wherever the British left after Empire, they brought chaos in their wake as in Partition in India also.  Utterly distraught for the Palestinian people, robbed of their land and though I understand the need for Jewish people to have a place of safety, to treat others as they themselves were once treated is beyond any rational comprehension."
118,kI_spMxp6t8,I‚Äôm glad many people are learning more about this.  I pray for justice for the Palestinians!
119,kI_spMxp6t8,"Compared to western reworks on this topic, this video is qualitative and truthful. Thank you, you are doing indispensable work against hypocritical reporting."
120,ZXfuqUhzESg,Britian as well as many European nations on history have started many conflicts around the world that people are still suffering from in those respective countries.

122,ZXfuqUhzESg,"I appreciate the work that went into making this documentary. Whoever you are, thank you."
123,ZXfuqUhzESg,For everyone genuinely seeking to understand & be educated on history thank you. Thank you to the documentary filmmakers of the excellent documentary. I‚Äôm thankful you made this free. This deserves an award.
124,ZXfuqUhzESg,"I wish this had been taught when I was in school. It would have helped to explain a lot of what was to follow like our support of the Mujahideen's war against the Soviet Union, 9/11, the Gulf War, Operation Iraqi Freedom, the war in Afghanistan, and what's happening now with Hamas and Israel."
125,ZXfuqUhzESg,"It is very good to see a piece which gives such a clear history of the deals, both secret and open, which have led to the conflict which continues.  It is important for everybody to understand how this has come about."
126,ZXfuqUhzESg,"It's funny how we get the rawness of history through the windows of documentaries and such a like, but never taught in the educational system."
127,ZXfuqUhzESg,"By far this is the very best documentary on The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict that I have ever seen!
Beautifully created and laid out!"
128,ZXfuqUhzESg,"The latest attack led me to this channel.  I may have to watch it again, quite complicated, but essential to understanding what is happening now.  Wonderful footage too."
129,ZXfuqUhzESg,"This is interesting, informative, and includes marvelous photos and film.  Worthwhile and well produced.  Thank you."

136,6MVz5MBNqsw,"This was a fantastic replay of history. My favorite part is Sparty's butchering of the word ""ha'atzmauet"" at 1:04:30 which was hilarious. It's a tough word for a non hebrew speaker, don't feel bad, i got a good chuckle!"

139,6MVz5MBNqsw,"Maybe I shouldn't be picking nits, but something Sebastian said around 15:00 grated on me. ""Ahad Ha'Am"" is a single-phrase pen name that sort of means ""One of the people"". ""Ha'Am"" is not a family name. Calling him ""Ha'Am"" is like calling the Sundance Kid ""Kid""."

141,sR0DsXH0bT4,I feel sad for the children from both the sides. What have they did to go through this? No child should see war.
142,sR0DsXH0bT4,I cannot even imagine how the common people are facing the problems. They all are innocent. This is just heartbreaking

148,sR0DsXH0bT4,Who's right and who's wrong always seems to change depending on when you start measuring time.
149,sR0DsXH0bT4,"WOW, amazing video! This conflict has really been bothering me lately as I am majoring in Social Sciences and it's something that comes up relatively often. Politics is a massive element of the course. There has been so much misinformation regarding this conflict it's been so hard to understand what is right and what is wrong. Finally, after months of researching, your video allowed me to finish my report. Before watching your video my report was sitting at 5000 words but thanks to your video, I was able to write 3000 more words! Writing this report has been the best experience I've had at university so far and I just wanted to thank you for helping me achieve this."

152,OdENyo4HvX4,"You could argue that Churchill was a product of his time, but at his core he was a ghastly, ignorant, evil, and extremely racist individual."
153,OdENyo4HvX4,That Churchill quote is bone-chilling.

155,OdENyo4HvX4,What I appreciate about this video is a feeling like you're encouraging people to investigate for themselves but planting sign-posts along the way like a good guide.  It's like teaching people how to study history and you're guiding them to do that for themselves well.
156,OdENyo4HvX4,"ive made a playlist of videos trying to understand the conflict in Isreal, this video is by far the easiest to understand, most detailed, and most compassionate and empathetic video of all the ones ive seen. Thank you so much for your help üçâ"

160,Azs7As3MYFU,"For more background, view the additional media at https://ryanmcbeth.substack.com

The conflict is essentially one of homeland.  British Mandate Palestine promised Israel to both the Arabs and the Jews if they agreed to fight against the Ottoman Turks during World War I.  Israel's subsequent war of Independence created a refugee crisis that is still ongoing to this day.

161,Azs7As3MYFU,"If there's any place on Earth where the phrase, ""and the plot thickens"", is appropriate, it's the Israeli -Palestinian border."
162,Azs7As3MYFU,"Everyone tiptoes around this conflict. For years and years I had no idea about the specifics. I just knew it was a sensitive subject. Most people just say, ""It's complex."" That was usually enough to discourage me from placing any effort into learning about it. Thank you for a clear and concise summary."
163,Azs7As3MYFU,Thank you. I have been reading articles on this for a week now trying to get my head around things so I can understand what is going on and why. You‚Äôve explained it perfectly in 5mins.
164,Azs7As3MYFU,Your point about historical tribal conflicts over territory reminds me of a conversation I once had with a colleague (of Mexican descent) about the Arab-Israeli conflict. I remarked that nobody calls the American Southwest ‚Äúthe occupied territories.‚Äù  He promptly replied: ‚ÄúI do!‚Äù üòÇ
165,Azs7As3MYFU,Thank you for this. This is the first time in my 40 years that ive actually understood the situation. Its definitely a messy one.
166,Azs7As3MYFU,Did not expect you to get SO MUCH solid information into 5:20.   Well done.
167,Azs7As3MYFU,"It really amazes me, when someone digs into conflicts across the globe, usually history starts with: ""so, the british came.."""
168,Azs7As3MYFU,"I‚Äôm learning a lot today about this issue.  One question I have is with regards to referring to Palestinians as refugees.  If this land was Palestine before the British/French/Russians split up the Ottoman Empire, aren‚Äôt they actually refugees on the own homeland?"
169,Azs7As3MYFU,"Always, the best, level-headed and measured explanation. Thank you, Ryan!"
170,HXe9iZQpJ1M,"Moving the embassy is controversial, breaking with decades of official US policy ‚Äî and it comes at a particularly tumultuous time for Israel and the region. Read more on Vox.com: http://bit.ly/2k3pFIE"
171,HXe9iZQpJ1M,"It is kind of ironic (but not really) that it is one of the holiest cities in the world, but there is much aggression and violence there."
172,HXe9iZQpJ1M,"""Violence is not new in the Holy City."" *Such irony.*"
173,HXe9iZQpJ1M,I love how Christian Palestinians are completely absent from this narrative which has simply been reduced to Jews vs Muslims....

177,HXe9iZQpJ1M,*Politically and religiously aggressive comment*
178,HXe9iZQpJ1M,"I see a lot of people calling anyone who values Jerusalem idiot here in the comments. I might not be religious, but if the city I grew up in and learned culture from was being torn apart by two different groups with exclusionary ideologies, I would be upset as well. It's not just about it being a holy place, it's also about it being a place of culture and belonging. There's nothing productive about belittling their struggles because your values are removed from theirs."

It would be great if Jerusalem was like the Vatican. If it was just an independent city state which allowed anyone to come and worship."

204,MknerYjob0w,It is absolutely insane how this Apartheid has been allowed to continue for so long. Palestinians are people! They are humans! They deserve dignity and respect just like everyone on this planet!
205,MknerYjob0w,As a black American I had no idea the Palestinians were being subject to these mistreatment. This is just wrong on so many levels
206,MknerYjob0w,"Living in the United States we are fed media that is completely one sided.  I have learned that from my time overseas and seen for myself what happens elsewhere that the US media reports on incorrectly.  Thank you for making these videos to allow us to see the other side of this conflict.  This is a real eye opener for me.  I had no idea.

226,lv1SpwwJEW8,"My heart goes out to all the victims on both sides. Regardless of politics or one sided media, I think we can all agree that killing innocent children, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and grandparents isn't something to be taken lightly, no matter what the nationality or the viewpoint.

260,cfkUE5Q0K04,"This documentary didn't mention about the history of the region during ww1, which is important. Prior to ww1, the whole region was ruled under ottoman empire. Then, between 1914~1917, Britain asked the arabs, who had been living under the ottoman rule in this region, to fight against the ottoman empire. Britain agreed to create a unified-arab-kingdom (from Syria in north, to Yemen in south) basically most of western middle east, if Britain&arabs won. Well, the arabs agreed, and the British-arab coalition fought and won against the ottomans.
But instead of keeping the agreement of a unified-arab-kingdom, Britain, created many different arab countries (as can be seen today), and then, gave part of Palestine to the Jewish people. All of these events occurred by 1917. 
Known as the British duplicity, of course this created a messy situation there after for both sides."

They were not left alone among any of these peoples. Today I spoke to my relative there. They are never mentioned!"

290,Lb3v8M8dzic,Thank you for this. Really helped explain the WHY behind what‚Äôs going on right now. And also what is completely missing from current MSM reporting
291,Lb3v8M8dzic,"Learning of the current Gaza war has led me in need of much education. Finding your video at this time makes it even more vital to hear a  complex issue presented clearly: you make sense of Jerusalem's centrality to three major religions. But how is it possible that such steps, leading to the most egregious attacks on  prayer in what should be a safe and respected religious site at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, should pass us by?  And how is one surprised that one day an eruption occurs, when freedom to pray and work and be is near buried?"
292,Lb3v8M8dzic,"The Israeli and Hamas conflict underscores the tragic consequences that can arise when religious differences lead to violence and division. In the pursuit of lasting peace, it's essential to transcend religious divides and prioritize the well-being of all people, regardless of their beliefs. Embracing secular values, such as human rights, equality, and diplomacy, can pave the way for a more peaceful and inclusive future where conflicts are resolved through dialogue and cooperation rather than religious affiliations. Art, as a powerful medium, can guide our morality by fostering empathy, promoting tolerance, and inspiring us to envision a world where humanity's shared values and aspirations unite us rather than divide us. Literature, in particular, has the unique ability to create open-minded perspectives by exposing us to diverse viewpoints, cultures, and ideas, which can ultimately lead to greater understanding and empathy among individuals and communities. Curiosity, not a belief in a deity, is the key to a fulfilling and meaningful life, driving us to explore, learn, and connect with the world around us in our shared human journey towards peace and enlightenment."
293,Lb3v8M8dzic,Thank you for this report. It's helped me a lot to begin to make sense of War between Palestine and Israel. I am praying for all the innocent people being affected on both sides of the border.
294,Lb3v8M8dzic,Thank you. This is so informative and the presenter is excellent with a very good delivery of the information. Excellent keep up the good work.
295,Lb3v8M8dzic,"This was so helpful to people like me who are watching from far away.  Trying to understand how they got to this place.  It is very complicated, and has happened over years and years.  I like that you stay neutral so we can understand both sides. I really like Sandra's voice and her manner of presentation."
296,Lb3v8M8dzic,"It is really difficult to broker peace between Israel and Palestine. What is more baffling is the fact that religion tells us these people are the same parents. I have been to Israel, Palestine and Egypt and felt very sad at the level of insecurity within those regions. No free life."
297,Lb3v8M8dzic,"Conspicuously missing from AJ's summary is the history of access to the Western Wall by Jewish worshippers when the Old City wasn't ""occupied"" (i.e. when it was under Jordanian control). Nothing to remark there? ü§î"

299,oIWqTIFRlYU,British rule was the root of this problem.
300,oIWqTIFRlYU,"So basically the British promised both Jews and Palestinians the same land? Britain told Arabs help us take down the Ottoman and this land is yours, then told Jews help us take out the Arabs and it‚Äôs yours‚Ä¶then just handed the issue to the UN?"
301,oIWqTIFRlYU,"I think you forgot to talk about Britain asking the arabs and jews for help to fight the Turks (Othomon empire who was ruling Jerusalem) in world war one in return for land. I think that false promise to both sides for the same land was the root of the problem. The british did the same thing in other parts of the world, e.x. Pakistan -India, etc

It was colonials basically causes the problems now with simple short term solutions in the past."
302,oIWqTIFRlYU,"How can one people, promise a second people the land of a third people"
303,oIWqTIFRlYU,"In 1914, Britain made a promise to the Arabs. If they help the Allies split the Ottomans, Britain will help the Arabs, including the Palestinians, to establish their own state.
In 1916, Britain also promised France to run Palestine together.
In 1917, in order to win the support of the Jews, Britain promised to establish a Jewish national home in Palestine. This is the Balfour Declaration."
304,oIWqTIFRlYU,Bottom line.....every territorial dispute from Kashmir to Israel can be traced back to the British
305,oIWqTIFRlYU,"This is sad, for innocent people."

307,oIWqTIFRlYU,Must be really horrible to live in countries that just keep going round in circles. This has been going on for decades and will just as likely still be ruining lives at the end of this century too.

You did a great job with this video I must say. I'm not surprised it has almost 8million views
311,m19F4IHTVGc,that ticking time bomb statement at the end was so true considering recent events. My heart goes out to all innocent civilians who are experiencing tragedy.

324,8kCTMyh1oqw,"I was a kibbutz volunteer in 1980 (not Jewish and certainly not a Zionist Fascist). I was shocked to discover that the kibbutz I was on, was an Arab village in 1948 before they were forced to leave.

I had a young Israeli friend in the IDF. He told me a story of a friend of his. One day his friend's IDF unit encountered PLO fighters. However, between the IDF unit and the PLO were a group of Palestinian women and children. The captain of the IDF unit ordered the friend to kill the PLO. He refused, because it would also have meant killing the Palestinian women and children. The captain then ordered another member of the IDF unit to kill the PLO. The women and children were killed along with the PLO fighters. My friend's friend was then put in a mental asylum for 5-years for disobeying that order. It shows that some Israelis have a conscience, while others are no different to the German Einsatz Gruppe in WWII. It's interesting to juxtapose the Palestinians humility against the Zionists hubris. But as we all know, hubris always precedes a great fall. The Land of David, will be rocked to it's core, for sure.

Going back to my time on the kibbutz, the one observation that I would make of the British and US Jews that came out there was their attitude of entitlement. That governs the Israeli psyche and it's the label on it's begging bowl to the US and to the World. The loss of 6 million Jews to Nazi genocide does not justify Israel doing the same to Palestinians. 

I for one don't believe October 7 was just a random act. I believe it was orchestrated by Israel to deliver it's goal of invading Gaza. Exactly the same false flag operation occurred on 9/11 to swing US public opinion for a military invasion of Afghanistan."

""Once the decision was taken, it took six months to complete the mission. When it was over, more than half of Palestine's native population, close to 800,000 people, had been uprooted, 531 villages had been destroyed, and eleven urban neighbourhoods emptied of their inhabitants. The plan decided upon on 10 March 1948, and above all its systematic implementation in the following months, was a clear-cut case of an ethnic cleansing operation, regarded under international law today as a crime against humanity.""

371,x_isZHaZjcU,This documentary leaves out the Balfour declaration and the Haavara agreement.
372,x_isZHaZjcU,"Some things the documentary leaves out that is somewhat important. It was the Arabs that started the first war and asked the 700,000 Palestinians to leave their homes and return after ""they kill all the jews"". Another fact, all the neighboring Arab countries expelled all their Jews to Israel during the same period yet nobody ever talks about them. It's important to point out who started the war, it would dispel a lot of sentiment of entitlement towards Palestinians to the land lost."

Hi Aina Maya,

I found your video incredibly informative and engaging. To enhance the viewer experience and provide easy navigation through the content, I've created timestamps for various sections of the video (shown above). Feel free to copy and paste these timestamps into the video description. It's my small way of contributing to the community and making the content more accessible to your audience. If you have any specific format preferences for the timestamps or want to change the 3-word titles for each section, feel free to adjust them accordingly before adding them to the description.

Keep up the great work!"

517,zmxJrMpIRh4,She missed an important point about Israeli citizens migrating and settling in West Bank which made the issue more complex and lead to various subdivisions being created over there.

533,E0uLbeQlwjw,"What you failed to mention is that the settlers didn‚Äôt move in without permission. They moved in with government support and encouragement, kicked and demolished Palestinian homes and murdered many with full military support and then and only them they started to ‚Äúsettle‚Äù as you nicely and smoothly made it sound."
534,E0uLbeQlwjw,"Unfortunately, this is what happened to my great grandpa. A home which we had owned for 6 whole generations was destroyed to make way for Jewish roads and settler movements without our knowledge. For hundreds of years, me and my family tree (dads side) had owned this land, and once it was flourishing with livestock, a market place, plants and trees for any fruit/veggie you could think of, a good university nearby, a mosque, a comfortably sized home, etc. Until Israeli settlers, dare I say unrightfully stole the land we‚Äôd been making for so long and claimed it as theirs. We now own 1/5th of the plants we used to and the other livestock, market place and house are now occupied by Israeli settlers completely not under our control. I now live in America but my grandparents unfortunately couldn‚Äôt afford to go to America so they illegally snuck outside the refugee camp we‚Äôd been out into and into Jordan. They were deported to Kuwait and that‚Äôs where my parents were born. My grandparents didn‚Äôt have enough money to go to America or stay in Kuwait so they moved back to a small, shady apartment in Jordan where they live now. It could‚Äôve all been so different though.

549,B12qniUwPMg,"‚ÄûAll land that was once inhabited by Germanic people must be added to Germany, no place for a Polish state.‚Äú Now make an intelligent guess who said that."
550,B12qniUwPMg,"The term ""Palestine"" first appeared in the 5th century BCE when the ancient Greek historian Herodotus wrote of a ""district of Syria, called Palaistin√™"" between Phoenicia and Egypt in The Histories"
551,B12qniUwPMg,"If the security aspects could be overcome, and there was general and genuine support for two independant state solution from the Palestians; what would the average Israeli view be for 2 state solution? Would there be support? If there was support what would the solution likely look like?"
552,B12qniUwPMg,"Can you document (as in stating specific historical sources for) the claim that large numbers of Arabs moved to Palestine to work for the British during the Mandate period of 1917 to 1947?  I'm under the impression that this claim has been disputed and am interested in knowing more about it, especially if you have some hard numbers."

557,B12qniUwPMg,"And let's not forget, we can totally address multiple concerns simultaneously. Because why settle for just criticizing one country's actions when we can spread our criticism around? It's not like each country should be held accountable for its own actions or anything."
558,B12qniUwPMg,"Correction the Romans named it Syiria Palestine after the Philistines, who were one of the ancient people that lived in that area many centuries ago before being defeated, conquered and later annexed by their rivals the Judeas, now they were not an Arab people but another group of people that belonged Israelite family, whose main rivals were the Judeans, it was, in essence, a regional war of centralization, they named that region to spite them after their defeat by Emperor Hadrian, it was renamed again as such by the English because dumb reasons, 
Now were there Beduin Arabs and the likes in that, then likely but were nomads and traders, was there trade between them as much as conflict, yes, like in any region of the world,
Jereuseulem only fell under Arab rule because of the rise of the Islamic Caliphate, but they were not better off, under Roman Law unless you started trouble for the state it did not matter your faith, with Christianity it was mixed, under Islam it was the rule of the whip, Saladin's own grandson or nephew was said to hunt Jews for sport with Leopards, during Ottoman Rule Jews and Christians alike were treated as second class citizens,
Can Israel fully work with all the people there, yes, if it starts adopting a more Roman-like policy of separating faith from the state, which from a historical point of view considering the Jews will be hard, very, very hard, mostly thanks in large to the Jewish self indoctrinated cultist mindset,"

In historical context, I feel some mistakes were made by one party or the other at every step. But today, those missed opportunities have gained a momentum that seems unstoppable. Dr. Morris is a pragmatist, and I respect that. But the parties have made little, if any, progress toward a pragmatic solution, and the trend is toward even less realism. The issues are being magnified to a mortal fear of losing for both sides, obviously an impossible situation.

Very much appreciated, Coleman."

Also the channel made some sweeping statements about Fatah changing its tune by 1995 when historians really dispute whether this ever actually happened.

689,klXaDgmM8Fs,Backspace is preparing for another season! What major news media stories do you want us to look at?
690,klXaDgmM8Fs,As a native American Southern Piute I feel  for the Palestinian people.  Israel has no Intention on leaving them with anything less then reservations. Thank you for this video
691,klXaDgmM8Fs,"The recent conflict in Israel and Gaza, is making many of us take a closer look at the history of this land and the constant minute to minute oppression that Palestinians face under the apartheid regime of Israel. Watching the mainstream news media recently cements everything that has been described in this video about America and Israels tight ties. Thank you and keep exposing the truth ."
692,klXaDgmM8Fs,"""To learn who rules over you, simply find out who are not allowed to criticize."" -Voltaire"
693,klXaDgmM8Fs,Shot out to my Irish-American grandpa that was against Israel from day oneü§ç may Allah have mercy on himü§ç
694,klXaDgmM8Fs,"American here, and I will always and forever support Palestine. üáµüá∏‚ù§Ô∏è"
695,klXaDgmM8Fs,LOOK EVERYONE THIS WAS POSTED BEFORE OCTOBER 7TH 2023! Since some want to paint a narrative about October 7th being the start of all of this.
696,klXaDgmM8Fs,"""We know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians."" -Nelson Mandela"
697,klXaDgmM8Fs,"I am not Palestinian, but I thank you so much for your important info !"
698,klXaDgmM8Fs,"Huge thanks for this piece. Excellent. And from Ireland, we have always been clear about what Israel has been unlawfully doing. We know our history! We also see how, (and I have to say it) how far too many Americans have been 'brainwashed'"
699,QUCeQt8zg5o,Thanks for watching everyone. Tell us what you think in the comments below.
700,QUCeQt8zg5o,"I'm someone who was born and raised in the United Arab Emirates. In the 90s I was living in a neighborhood which had Palestinians who were teaching Mathematics, Science and Literature at UAE government schools. Now I'm connecting the dots as this documentary shows 50% of Palestinian youth were literate by 1948. This documentary makes sense"
701,QUCeQt8zg5o,"Here in Greece, our parliament voted to recognize the Palestinian state back in 2015. All parties agreed for the first time to something, but no government since then upheld that decision. Now government and media, are trying to deform the truth about the heroic Palestinians, but we the people of Greece, are standing with them. Fredom to Palestine."
702,QUCeQt8zg5o,"""What happened in 1948 is too brutal to talk about. It's indescribable.""  My eyes were filled with tears as I looked at him.  OMG, words are not enough to describe what they had to endure during those moments.  Yeah, it's ""indescribable."" üò£"
703,QUCeQt8zg5o,"As a Bulgarian I'm grateful for all the documentation and evidence that has been preserved, helping us make sense of the past and not forget how things used to be. In all honesty, I don't understand how anyone could ever believe that the region was ""a land without people"", some underdeveloped desert. One doesn't need to have studied too much about history or how human civilisation develops to have one look at the map and know that this was a cultural and commercial centre. Thank you for your work!"
704,QUCeQt8zg5o,"This was a great documentary, it showed how Palestinian was a hustling and bustling country full of life culture, and well educated people, A special thanks for AL JAZEERA DOCUMENTARY and all the journalists who prepare this memoriable for the history of PALESTINE."
705,QUCeQt8zg5o,"I have never been this much interested or educated about Palestine and its people. Reading more and more about it makes me really sad, I can't believe I've been unaware of the sufferings that Palestinians have been going through for years. Thank you for such an informative video! I pray and hope Palestine will be free from the occupation and its people will finally be fully happy in their own homeland. I also hope that the war in Gaza will stop very soon, insha'Allah ü§≤"
706,QUCeQt8zg5o,I can relate as a  South African whose prople were displaced in their land of birth. Forced to luve in a 13% of the land and more than 80% of our rich land stolen by the colonizers . It for this reason that I support the Liberation of the Palestinian people.  Thank you Aljazeera for sharing.
707,QUCeQt8zg5o,"Thank you for this magnificent tribute to Palestinian history. At this precarious time, I am sharing it with everyone I know. God bless Palestine."
708,QUCeQt8zg5o,Really great documentary. The whole world should see this! Thank you so much for helping us to realize the truths. I felt the truths in this. I cried in the end. That poor man whose Dad died when they cut down his trees. God help them.
709,ECscKICzsJ0,The YouTube algorithm has an interesting sense of humor.

713,ECscKICzsJ0,Yet another example of when comedians do a better job of journalism than journalists.
714,ECscKICzsJ0,This is the calmest comment section about Israel/Palestine I've come across this week.
715,ECscKICzsJ0,This is where I get my up-to-date information on the Israeli Palestinian conflict
716,ECscKICzsJ0,We have reached peak absurdity when the Onion gives the only accurate fair and balanced synopsis of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.
717,ECscKICzsJ0,Give it another 10 years and this video will still be just as accurate.
718,ECscKICzsJ0,"No matter what‚Äôs in the news, there‚Äôs a decade old onion video about it doing a better job at explaining it that any documentary."

720,r21iN7JYu2Y,"I don‚Äôt care what religion or side you‚Äôre on, watching a grieving mother talk to her deceased sons in a graveyard, while her surviving daughter stands nearby, is beyond heartbreaking."
721,r21iN7JYu2Y,I never almost cry but instantly started tearing up when that father was holding his child dead in his arms and screaming. Rest in Peace to those innocents and children who passed on both sides.
722,r21iN7JYu2Y,"The man who lost his children broke my heart. He was so shocked he couldn't even cry, just scream."
723,r21iN7JYu2Y,That father screaming to the sky and asking why! The pain and grief in that moment is something I am going to pray for his well being and happiness.
724,r21iN7JYu2Y,At first I felt like this video was gonna be pretty biased and one-sided. However at the end it really seems like she was very sided with the civilians who are the real people being hurt here. I appreciated that. She grilled leaders on both side. 10/10 great interviews and reporting.
725,r21iN7JYu2Y,"Thank you for continuing to make this information free and digestible. It's so important to understand what's going on in our world, and so few media outlets take the time to tell a whole story anymore. Just what's happening RIGHT NOW. I am praying for all sides, for the innocent people and families who never asked to live this way. It's truly heartbreaking üíî üôèüèº I can't imagine having to explain all of this to your babies and still attempt to sleep at night."
726,r21iN7JYu2Y,How does somebody go to both sides of a bitter conflict and ask tough questions on both sides? This is incredible journalism.
727,r21iN7JYu2Y,It doesn‚Äôt matter what side you‚Äôre on but seeing children who has nothing to do with this conflict die is heartbreaking
728,r21iN7JYu2Y,Always appreciate that Vice news asks tough questions to both sides and dives deeper than mainstream media
729,0aM7RjXE1xo,This explains nothing to me. 260 people just died at a music festival. I need more context ‚Äúreporters‚Äù
730,0aM7RjXE1xo,And she said the Palestinians were there before? Is this a joke??
731,0aM7RjXE1xo,"Search ""How Israel Was Created"" and watch a video clip of how the Palestinian have their land stole from them, and ""Is Israel Guilty Of Apartheid Against Palestinians?"" to see how the Palestinian have been living under an apartheid system from the oppressive Israel system."
732,0aM7RjXE1xo,"History Lesson, you the media keep calling this the West Bank? Your Graphic Map is not correct.
It didn‚Äôt become the West Bank until 1948 when Jordan attacked the Jews.
For 4,000 years before that it was called Judea and Samaria, Israel was split in Two. That is the Holy Land of the indigenous people of Israel. Israel was destroyed by the Assyrians in 722 B.C.E.
Judah and Jerusalem fell to the Babylonian Empire and was destroyed in 586 B.C.E.

War and Empires determined Borders, over 4,000 years ago, so what is different today, the Jewish Nation has survived that long and is only defending what was their original Borders.
What do you think France under Napoleon, Germany under Hitler, and Britain did under various Kings and Queens did? Fought Wars to establish Borders. Today Wars are still fought to determine who owns what. Human history is that of Conflict, that is the one Constant that keeps Wars going.
My Ancestors were Vikings, who do you think shaped the various nations of Europe, why do you think War and Peace has survived for so long, it‚Äôs human pastime, a Game of Thrones.
The modern Borders were drawn by the West, without regard to the history of the various indigenous people, and you wonder why you still have Wars today?"
733,0aM7RjXE1xo,HAM????????????
734,0aM7RjXE1xo,"I didn't watch this.

  I think it's going to take a bit more than 170 seconds to explain it well enough for someone to fully understand.

756,mITaDOAUAQE,"I think Brits could empathise better if we ask them to imagine that migrant communities who are in the UK suddenly decide they want to establish their own state in London and other superdiverse cities, and America agrees to it! Then, they wouldn't call it terrorism."

762,btVFgqkgkzw,"For more commentary on this issue, read the beginning of Elan Journo's book here, for free: https://bit.ly/3QABEO2"
763,btVFgqkgkzw,"One point that didn't come up in this video is that when Israel made peace with Egypt, the Egyptians insisted on getting beck every last square inch of the Sinai peninsula, yet they were quite adamant not to take the Gaza strip back to their control."
764,btVFgqkgkzw,"What I‚Äôm very surprised to see left out of this discussion regarding the importance of context is the fact that it leaves out the 4/5 of British Mandate Palestine that included ALL of Jordan and a small part of Syria, Lebanon and Egypt.  And that doesn‚Äôt include the French Mandate."
765,btVFgqkgkzw,"The main thing that this shows is that all of the peace loving, decent people all over the world have been stood upon by corrupt governments who don‚Äôt care about them or their welfare. It is extremely sad this world we are living in ü•∫"
766,btVFgqkgkzw,"Just a fact finder (have no affiliation either way) 4:23 - The map says Jewish Settlements and Palestinian Land (LAND, not settlements where Palestinians lived) so this guy is not addressing what the actual map says. He‚Äôs forcing a narrative that it‚Äôs saying the same thing, which it does not"
767,btVFgqkgkzw,"Though I get the point you‚Äôre trying to make even with the first frame of the map, I‚Äôm confused at the delineation that you‚Äôre suggesting that we take in which we would only show the population densities of Palestinians and Israeli‚Äôs. To say a place is only owned by those that have ownership on the land, you would then need for the governance of the land to be equal or benign. The same would suggest that I could then move to an uninhabited part of land and lay claim to it today in northern Canada. We know this simply isn‚Äôt true because there is ownership in sorts over the land. I would need to purchase this land."
768,btVFgqkgkzw,"I may not agree with some of the slant that I perceived but, I very much like how this commentator brings up the principle issue at hand when determining whether EITHER of these groups has some ‚Äúright‚Äù to statehood, because the real issue is dividing humans into classes that are unequal and usually diametrically opposed to the goals and needs of one another, based upon ethnic demographics and cultural background. It is observable through history that establishing a state apparatus to favor one group over any other will ALWAYS trigger violent resistance that can‚Äôt be quelled with further violence. Insurgencies happen for a reason and they happen fairly predictably given the right conditions. Violence begets violence, and somehow this doesn‚Äôt seem to be any more understood now than 1000 years ago. 

I am personally of the belief that ANY time you do this kind of thing, whether you establish a ‚Äúhomeland‚Äù for the Jewish people, or you work at exiling this Israeli population to establish some sort of Islam-centric theocracy, what we end up with is having established an ethno-state deeply rooted in non-secular tribalism and nationalism, which are almost always going to be incompatible with social harmony and human rights for ALL people. It‚Äôs unfortunate that this topic so often devolves into antisemitic hatred or white supremacist language. Because it is such a complicated issue, which is at its core, centered around a difficult philosophical question regarding peace and conflict and our relationship with the earth itself."
769,btVFgqkgkzw,"Also, you forgot to mention that the reason Israel did not give Gaza back to Egypt was because Egypt didn't want it back, and from what I learned they actually threatened to back out of the deal if Israel did not take Gaza."
770,btVFgqkgkzw,It would be helpful if you showed an accurate first map that shows where no people lived.
771,btVFgqkgkzw,And with the same reasoning I assume he could say that land was never taken from the Native Americans by Europeans because the Native Americans never even had the concept of land ownership.
772,-rBGgIaO69c,"As a Muslim, I am praying for the innocent civilians in both Palestine and Israel. I can't believe that in the 21st century, people are still fighting like pagans instead of resolving their conflicts by talking and finding a middle ground. We haven't learned anything from history..At the end of the day, the only people suffering will be the innocent kids and widows who had nothing to do with the politics and the power games of the politicians...There are no winners in wars.. The UN should sit together and find a solution for the conflict between Israel and Palestine."
773,-rBGgIaO69c,"This is extremely disturbing on both ends. I feel bad for the elderly, the men and the children in Palestine and Israel that have fallen victims to crimes committed against them. It‚Äôs extremely scary and concerning and I hope this comes to a swift end"
774,-rBGgIaO69c,"‚ÄúIf you're not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.‚Äù ~ Malcolm X"
775,-rBGgIaO69c,Disagreeing with Israeli policy and the Israeli government does NOT make you anti-Semitic.  Government and religion are not the same thing.  Stop calling people racist for not agreeing with your point of view!  There's a lot of built up rage in Gaza for the way Israeli's treat them.  There are two sides to this story!  At the same time Hamas' brutal tactics makes them equally at fault.  But I understand where their anger is coming from.
776,-rBGgIaO69c,My deepest condolences to the families who lost their lives in this conflict.
777,-rBGgIaO69c,"As I have commented before, the situation in Gaza, Palestine and Israel always manages to achieve the impossible - it gets even worse.  And you can be sure that the situation will get even worse than it is now.  In 10 years time - if people are still around by then - 
I am certain I shall make exactly this same comment.  People will never change their nature, even to save themselves."
778,-rBGgIaO69c,Appreciate the educational points about the history. It helps us to understand all of the decades long devastating issues.
779,-rBGgIaO69c,"Next time God promises the same land to two groups, I suggest a notarized written contract."
780,-rBGgIaO69c,Wow! That was a head scratcher ü§Ø
781,-rBGgIaO69c,It is high time to understand the basic wrongs of each side that are becoming a cause of atrocities. Blaming the other side will not result in peace. Evil generates further evil. We need a wise decision from both sides and at the international level to stop the human plight.

785,qR5TCBBhihY,"Israel was not not formed in 1948. Israel returned officially to its ancestral land in 1948. The Quran mentioned the Jews in many passages confirming their existence even before the advent of Islam. The Bible has over 3000 years of historical records of Israel inhabiting that Land. It‚Äôs this distortion of the facts that have made peace between the Jews and Arabs inhabiting the space impossible. A simple solution would have been a two state coexistence worked out by the parties themselves without any external interference. Let the Arabs and the Jews sit down together, use historical facts from their Holy Books, historical facts of the last millennium and the realities of today to chisel out a coexistence plan. They should work at it until they reach an agreement even if it takes a century"

In 21st century we cannot afford this kind of barbarism happening in name of territorial conflict. We human hardly live 70 to 80 years in this planet and we should work together to make our life better instead of launching war in name of countries and religion.

Not a word about Nasser closing of Tiran straits, which he knew to be a casus belli for Israel.
On the other hand, not a word about the 70,000 Egyptian soldiers stuck on the quagmire of the Yemen war, which the Egyptians could not use against Israel.

864,9n5GX1gUvCI,Amazing piece.
865,9n5GX1gUvCI,Excellent analysis as always!! But what's the thing with the book table?  Why not have some reading material on the topic that you are discussing in that particular episode...
866,a34zpFaoBoM,Doesn‚Äôt anyone find it strange that the most sophisticated intelligence agency in the world didn‚Äôt notice 100s of militants and 1000s of rockets being put in place just over the fence. This is either the biggest failure in military intelligence or it was allowed intentionally. Which is worse
867,a34zpFaoBoM,"On both sides, can we all agree this interviewer asked some terribly meaningless questions? ‚ÄúDo you think the enemy was bad? Do you think people helping the enemy should knock that off? Do you agree with people who agree with you?‚Äù 

Read the guys bio before you ask him book jacket questions. From that ‚Äúinterview‚Äù we learned nothing in depth. 

Most Predictable Interview of the Year Award winner here."
868,a34zpFaoBoM,"The moment ,as an American, you‚Äôd rather hear from Putin instead of Biden üòÇ"
869,a34zpFaoBoM,I notice that alot of news stations are sending correspondents to israel but none to Gaza. If they belive what Israel is saying about their campaign in the Gaza strip the should go there and report the news. We know why theyre not.
870,a34zpFaoBoM,"i laughed every time they say ""'Kremlin controlled media"""" as if our news arent the same XD"
871,a34zpFaoBoM,I just feel bad for all the innocent people on both sides caught up in childish government leaders problems
872,a34zpFaoBoM,"Damn this reminds me of that Lenin quote ""There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen""."
873,a34zpFaoBoM,He has no sympathy because he knows the history and the atrocities that got us all to this point.
874,a34zpFaoBoM,I love how they really want us to believe they knew nothing about this üòÇ I‚Äôm a stay at home mother and even I can see what‚Äôs going on here.
875,a34zpFaoBoM,"The issue that people don't seem to understand is how this extermination was actually started and the reasons behind it. Though it's easy to point fingers and blame, society must begin to address the double standards that provoke such attacks to even begin and who it is that conducted the initial strike. The constant atrocities committed against Palestinians since 1948 have always been suppressed by Western media, though even the slightest form of retaliation in any form has always been seen as ""an act of terrorism."" Now before one can quickly choose a side, you must first understand that Hamas is not innocent in the slightest and does not follow the complex guidelines of war as ruled in the Quran though journalists must begin to stray from the demand of condemnation as it further enforces the double standards put in place. This inequity is supported by the shaming of Hamas as it suggests that while one side must be condemned, the other can run free of judgment, avoiding condemnation for the duration of their inhumane acts of violence towards the entirety of the localized Palestinian population. Universally, the expectation to condemn Hamas seems non-complex, though it proves to be the opposite in nearly every scenario when reflecting on the never-ending acts of the Israeli government. In no way does the Muslim or Arab population accept the actions of Hamas, though the barbaric response by Israel is not a response of self-defense but rather revenge. The redundancy in biased media coverage and the sympathetically neglectful approach from journalists toward Palestinian supporters comes at the cost of misinformation and provoking anger among the Muslim community, ultimately displaying them in a pessimistic manner. Overall, the action of blaming one party for the start of this conflict is harmful to not only the victims but in finding justice for those affected by said conflict. Neither side is innocent, though the extreme response and disregard for humanity by Israel has found its way to prevail even in this society, and their constant facade of innocence and victim must be overlooked. Finally, people must find sympathy for the dark history of Palestinian treatment by Israel as it's paramount to understanding the true reasons behind the merciless genocide being carried out against the Palestinians.  May the lost lives of all innocent souls be granted peace at last."

917,eTMRMX7Pw5U,Why can't people tell this story without massive bias and omission?
918,eTMRMX7Pw5U,"There's a mistake in this video at 1:25.  That frame shows a picture of bodies lined up in rows and the voice over and CC indicate it is Deir Yassin.  While the massacre at Deir Yassin was very real and documented even by Zionist forces, an uncontestable event, the photo shown is not from Deir Yassin.  That image is a reproduction of a photo taken by the Army Signal Corps of a German concentration camp called Dachau.  This image is widely misused like this, unfortunately this misuse has been used by Nakba deniers to undermine the truth."
919,eTMRMX7Pw5U,you faild to mention that the arabs rejected the partition plan and started the war and lost in a convinsing way
920,eTMRMX7Pw5U,"Quite inaccurate at times. On the one hand, how can you explain a 100-year old conflict in 5 mins, but on the other, how can there be so much inaccuracy in just 5 mins? Jordan wasn't gifted the West Bank, it invaded and occupied as a durect threat to the fledgling Jewish state. Ben Gurion announced the Stae of Israel on 14 May 1948, the local Arabs promptly attacked on 15 May and in nearly all cases got driven back despite superior manpower and weaponry. The list goes on."

When we say Israel is an apartheid state, we know exactly what we are talking about. An apartheid state is formed with human rights violation at its core, it does not deserve any support, in fact, it deserves a world condemnation."

Arabs did not identify themselves as Palestinians until the 1960's."

They were hunted down, killed, thrown out of their homes and  forcibly exiled.

Before 1946, Palestinians made up 96 % of the population.

Persecution, marginalisation, forced evictions, expulsions, - has lead to Palestinians being a minority in their own country."

976,btVFgqkgkzw,"For more commentary on this issue, read the beginning of Elan Journo's book here, for free: https://bit.ly/3QABEO2"
977,btVFgqkgkzw,"One point that didn't come up in this video is that when Israel made peace with Egypt, the Egyptians insisted on getting beck every last square inch of the Sinai peninsula, yet they were quite adamant not to take the Gaza strip back to their control."
978,btVFgqkgkzw,"What I‚Äôm very surprised to see left out of this discussion regarding the importance of context is the fact that it leaves out the 4/5 of British Mandate Palestine that included ALL of Jordan and a small part of Syria, Lebanon and Egypt.  And that doesn‚Äôt include the French Mandate."
979,btVFgqkgkzw,"The main thing that this shows is that all of the peace loving, decent people all over the world have been stood upon by corrupt governments who don‚Äôt care about them or their welfare. It is extremely sad this world we are living in ü•∫"
980,btVFgqkgkzw,"Just a fact finder (have no affiliation either way) 4:23 - The map says Jewish Settlements and Palestinian Land (LAND, not settlements where Palestinians lived) so this guy is not addressing what the actual map says. He‚Äôs forcing a narrative that it‚Äôs saying the same thing, which it does not"
981,btVFgqkgkzw,"Though I get the point you‚Äôre trying to make even with the first frame of the map, I‚Äôm confused at the delineation that you‚Äôre suggesting that we take in which we would only show the population densities of Palestinians and Israeli‚Äôs. To say a place is only owned by those that have ownership on the land, you would then need for the governance of the land to be equal or benign. The same would suggest that I could then move to an uninhabited part of land and lay claim to it today in northern Canada. We know this simply isn‚Äôt true because there is ownership in sorts over the land. I would need to purchase this land."
982,btVFgqkgkzw,"I may not agree with some of the slant that I perceived but, I very much like how this commentator brings up the principle issue at hand when determining whether EITHER of these groups has some ‚Äúright‚Äù to statehood, because the real issue is dividing humans into classes that are unequal and usually diametrically opposed to the goals and needs of one another, based upon ethnic demographics and cultural background. It is observable through history that establishing a state apparatus to favor one group over any other will ALWAYS trigger violent resistance that can‚Äôt be quelled with further violence. Insurgencies happen for a reason and they happen fairly predictably given the right conditions. Violence begets violence, and somehow this doesn‚Äôt seem to be any more understood now than 1000 years ago. 

I am personally of the belief that ANY time you do this kind of thing, whether you establish a ‚Äúhomeland‚Äù for the Jewish people, or you work at exiling this Israeli population to establish some sort of Islam-centric theocracy, what we end up with is having established an ethno-state deeply rooted in non-secular tribalism and nationalism, which are almost always going to be incompatible with social harmony and human rights for ALL people. It‚Äôs unfortunate that this topic so often devolves into antisemitic hatred or white supremacist language. Because it is such a complicated issue, which is at its core, centered around a difficult philosophical question regarding peace and conflict and our relationship with the earth itself."
983,btVFgqkgkzw,"Also, you forgot to mention that the reason Israel did not give Gaza back to Egypt was because Egypt didn't want it back, and from what I learned they actually threatened to back out of the deal if Israel did not take Gaza."
984,btVFgqkgkzw,It would be helpful if you showed an accurate first map that shows where no people lived.
985,btVFgqkgkzw,And with the same reasoning I assume he could say that land was never taken from the Native Americans by Europeans because the Native Americans never even had the concept of land ownership.

1004,a34zpFaoBoM,"The issue that people don't seem to understand is how this extermination was actually started and the reasons behind it. Though it's easy to point fingers and blame, society must begin to address the double standards that provoke such attacks to even begin and who it is that conducted the initial strike. The constant atrocities committed against Palestinians since 1948 have always been suppressed by Western media, though even the slightest form of retaliation in any form has always been seen as ""an act of terrorism."" Now before one can quickly choose a side, you must first understand that Hamas is not innocent in the slightest and does not follow the complex guidelines of war as ruled in the Quran though journalists must begin to stray from the demand of condemnation as it further enforces the double standards put in place. This inequity is supported by the shaming of Hamas as it suggests that while one side must be condemned, the other can run free of judgment, avoiding condemnation for the duration of their inhumane acts of violence towards the entirety of the localized Palestinian population. Universally, the expectation to condemn Hamas seems non-complex, though it proves to be the opposite in nearly every scenario when reflecting on the never-ending acts of the Israeli government. In no way does the Muslim or Arab population accept the actions of Hamas, though the barbaric response by Israel is not a response of self-defense but rather revenge. The redundancy in biased media coverage and the sympathetically neglectful approach from journalists toward Palestinian supporters comes at the cost of misinformation and provoking anger among the Muslim community, ultimately displaying them in a pessimistic manner. Overall, the action of blaming one party for the start of this conflict is harmful to not only the victims but in finding justice for those affected by said conflict. Neither side is innocent, though the extreme response and disregard for humanity by Israel has found its way to prevail even in this society, and their constant facade of innocence and victim must be overlooked. Finally, people must find sympathy for the dark history of Palestinian treatment by Israel as it's paramount to understanding the true reasons behind the merciless genocide being carried out against the Palestinians.  May the lost lives of all innocent souls be granted peace at last."
1005,2Qs6kdvprt0,"People forget ""free Palestine"" was a saying before October 7th"

1090,wQmBsbt9blg,I have been seriously avoiding clicking on anything that advertises that it‚Äôs going to cause any emotion in me. All week. I was rewarded by being served this interview in my feed. So grateful. Will rewatch and recommend to thoughtful people. Thank you.
1091,wQmBsbt9blg,Nice to hear a level headed intelligent person discussing the topic.
1092,wQmBsbt9blg,"I'm so glad I came across this brilliant, insightful man. I hope we hear more from him."
1093,wQmBsbt9blg,Mr. Bremmer just opened our eyes to all that has and is going on. Before this I believe most of our eyes were closed  to what really was happening and how it had and is presently playing out. Please no more mistakes. THANK YOU.
1094,wQmBsbt9blg,A lot more than 1.1 million people need to listen to this. Thank you for this interview
1095,H7FML0wzJ6A,I admit i am not the most knowledgeable on the Palestine-Israel conflict but I found it very interesting that is actually illegal to acknowledge the ‚ÄúNakba‚Äù in Israel while also letting Israelis have all there rights but Palestinians aren‚Äôt given those same rights and live under martial law most of the time. I‚Äôve been doing research recently and another thing I noticed is how the media shows every atrocity committed by Hammas yet the atrocities committed by Israel‚Äôs IDF are not shown also the death of innocent Palestinians is barely shown yet a single Israeli death or casualty is shown everywhere.
1096,H7FML0wzJ6A,"Imagine that you are living in your land in peace...and someone comes and takes your land, demolishes your house, and steals what your ancestors earned in the past just because his religion tells him that this is your land...which religion accepts this crime?"
1097,H7FML0wzJ6A,The least the world can do is learn and understand the plight of the Palestinian people and their decades-long struggle for freedom.
1098,H7FML0wzJ6A,Rewatching this as a reminder of todays event in the middle east... People please learn ur history!
1099,H7FML0wzJ6A,A 2nd Nakba is happening in Gaza right now as we speak!!! May Allah protect the Palestinian people and give victory to them
1100,H7FML0wzJ6A,One of the best documentaries on the history of Palestine. Historical documents and photographs are worth thousands of words
1101,H7FML0wzJ6A,I've watched this series a bunch of times. This video series needs to be shown and viewed now more than ever!
1102,H7FML0wzJ6A,This is a very important documentary to watch. Everyone needs to see it. üëçüáµüá∏‚ú®
1103,H7FML0wzJ6A,"I wish you have various subtitles for this documentary, so it would help people around the world to know the history well"
1104,H7FML0wzJ6A,"Its so frustrating to learn there was so much more than to what we have been told, learned in school; ""there was WW2 and Israel was created to give jews a safe haven"". And this reportage provided the most informative early background I have found so far. Thanks!"

1110,7T6hu3OaLXI,There are places of worship of three religions and even Israel cannot manage a single city and on the one hand we manage the whole country with interfaith harmony. Literally our Bharat is great üáÆüá≥‚ù§
1111,7T6hu3OaLXI,"Moral: Differences in religious beliefs often lead to conflicts. Instead of adhering to texts from ancient times and believing something that you do not know. I wish for, Humanity to be the Universal Religion with only one fundamental principle: Respect for All Individuals."

1113,7T6hu3OaLXI,"Zechariah 12:3‚Äì4¬†God says, ‚ÄúI will make Jerusalem like an intoxicating drink that makes the nearby nations stagger when they send their armies to besiege Jerusalem and Judah. On that day I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock. All the nations will gather against it to try to move it, but they will only hurt themselves.‚Äù"

1124,_Jj8vne0ca0,"Thank you so much to YouTube for making it possible to produce this important episode of Middle Ground. We want to say thank you to our participants but also to our audience for always enabling respectful and meaningful conversation in our comments. We know this discussion does not address all aspects or perspectives of this very deep and historical conflict, but we did our best to represent as many perspectives as we could.  For those of you that don‚Äôt know, Jubilee's philosophy for Middle Ground is to bring people together and have an open dialogue in order to develop a deeper sense of understanding and empathy. We hope you all enjoy :) If you felt as moved as we did by the conversation, please share the video to as many people as you can!"
1125,_Jj8vne0ca0,"The Palestinian guy in the white t-shirt didn't smile even once. You can clearly see that when he lost his 10 year old sister in front of his eyes, his vision in life completely changed"
1126,_Jj8vne0ca0,"Arab (the Palestinian guy) saying, ""i hope we all live long and in peace"" not knowing what's gonna happen 4 years later (which is now) is heartbreaking. I hope they are all alive."
1127,_Jj8vne0ca0,"The Palestinian guy, with all the pain in his eyes, he genuinely wants and needs peace."
1128,_Jj8vne0ca0,Bro‚Äôs whole seven generations comes from Hungary and he has the audacity to tell Arab ‚ÄúiT iS nOt yOuR laND‚Äù
1129,_Jj8vne0ca0,The Israeli guy... people like him are the reason this conflict will go on forever.
1130,_Jj8vne0ca0,"That Israeli guy is getting under my skin, kudos to the Palestinians because I‚Äôm sorry I could never sit in front of someone like that."
1131,_Jj8vne0ca0,The Palestinian guy has gone through some serious lows in his life. I hope he finds at least a little happiness and smiles again.
1132,_Jj8vne0ca0,"I am neither Palestinian nor Israeli but I simply cannot imagine the amount of strength of character it would take to retain my composure being told my country was ""not your land"" by a comrade of the cell that murdered my little sister or my father."
1133,_Jj8vne0ca0,The amount of entitlement it takes to look somebody in the face of somebody who basically said ‚ÄúI can track my family back 9 generations and they were still in Palestine‚Äù and say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs cool I can track mine back only 7 compared to your 9 and they were in turkey‚Ä¶ But anyways that‚Äôs still not your land it‚Äôs mine‚Äù is SO INSANE.
1134,jwvsrybklf8,This man is one of the few who really knows what he is talking about.
1135,jwvsrybklf8,Respect. Not many people can outgrow this kind of environment. An inspiration for every human.
1136,jwvsrybklf8,"As a Jew, I can only say that this man is my brother. Freedom for Judaism, freedom for Christians, freedom for Muslims, Freedom for ALL!"
1137,jwvsrybklf8,I really love this man really for telling the real truth ‚ù§
1138,jwvsrybklf8,"That's completely fine for innocent children and women  to die  but, he fears the life of the soldiers and feel sorry for them. üëè"

1142,jwvsrybklf8,You need to understand what it means for him to say this. The courage needed. There's no democracy / free speech with HAMAS. Bravo Mosab! I admire you!

1145,W4gDfSNMRx4,History didn't start at October 7th
1146,W4gDfSNMRx4,"People living in independent countries, would not be able to understand the pain they were experiencing. They lost their childhoods, families, and many things in their lives to defend their homeland. They are forced to become adults and not be afraid of death from an early age.

If they could choose, they would want to live the same life as people in other countries live without having to hold a weapon."
1147,W4gDfSNMRx4,Abu khaleds accent is so good. It shows how well educated he is .
1148,W4gDfSNMRx4,"Someone came to your land, robbed your house,forcing you out from your home and make you as refuge then when you decide to fight them, you being labelled as terrorist. üòÇ"
1149,W4gDfSNMRx4,"I feel even more guilty to the people in Gaza (and now west bank) because I didn't quite outspoken about their situation since years ago. I didn't even care to dig deeper about the what was framed as complication in Gaza. My apology to Palestinians and all the casualties, alive or martyred. Thank you Vice and all the cru members involved"
1150,W4gDfSNMRx4,"people who believe that Hamas just turm to violence are just stupid. 
You think those young men don't have dreams, families, lives, hobbies, achivements ?
Like they cannot imagine doing anything better than being at war."
1151,W4gDfSNMRx4,How Vice managed to secure an interview with both a Hamaz member and the General of Israeli Air Force is beyond me.
1152,W4gDfSNMRx4,"Rakyat Palestina sdh merasakan penderitaan selama puluhan tahun...mereka pantas mempertahanakan, melawan dan mendapatkan kemerdekaan dr penjajahan karena itu hak mereka...

1158,wZBE5j2kIgY,"It is the most unbiased and actual history explained in easy terms. Hats off to this guy.

1162,wZBE5j2kIgY,It is very sad and heart wrenching to see what is happening between Israel and Palestine. Both the parties should broker peace. History is replete with instances that even if one faction wins the war the price it would pay for it in terms of human loss is not worth it.
1163,wZBE5j2kIgY,As a muslim i can clearly say you have stated the actual and real facts Sir. Great work. I am your subscriber now because of your quality content

1170,sZAneAxW7j0,"3 people are killed, ends with an invasion"
1171,sZAneAxW7j0,"The trouble with this subject is that nobody agrees or wants to agree on the history of the area. As long as that's the case, there'll never be peace over there. I know that's an easy and essentially neutral position I've taken there but to actually voice a direct opinion on this subject is to light metaphorical fuse wire."
1172,sZAneAxW7j0,"without the iron dome, Israel would probably have way more casualties. If 100's missiles were launched every year (possibly more), thousands of people would've died. But at the same time, Israel would've killed way more Palestinians in retaliation. This conflict is really sad"
1173,sZAneAxW7j0,"Nice time to recommend this, Susan"

Everyone knows what we see ‚Äúwar on terror‚Äù and ‚Äúthey are the bad guys‚Äù. I also had the luxury of growing up in CDN - and in a city where it has always been welcoming to every religion and race but I never asked anyone ‚Äúwhat brought you here‚Äù of fear of offending: but I wish I did because maybe I‚Äôd understand more then I do. I‚Äôm glad I opened my heart and eyes to this devastating tragedy. God bless all the Palestinians world wide. We are with you all."
1177,qNoxt-I6MOY,"two years later first time seeing this . What happen now on both side  heart breaking .The innocent people, kids ,babies so so sad for them"

1185,QkblP7cxMAI,They think it‚Äôs okay to do that as long as the world is watching and doesn't move a muscle
1186,QkblP7cxMAI,"Any parents will sacrifice their lives to give some food to their children, if we were in the same situation like them, we would absolutely do the same.. no matter what it is true or not, Israel should take responsibility for its action. So brutal!"
1187,QkblP7cxMAI,I'm sure that the most moral army in the world would not lie about a tragedy like this.
1188,QkblP7cxMAI,"Disgraceful, channel 4 needs to start calling this out for what it is"
1189,QkblP7cxMAI,This is completely insane. How is this allowed to happen? These people are not treated like human beings. Even ants have more dignity.
1190,QkblP7cxMAI,"The fact that someone can be canceled, fired, censored/censured and, or called antisemitic for criticizing Israel's ethnic cleansing in Gaza tells you who is ""truly afraid"" of the truth and who is ""actually quite brave""...."

1219,aPI5TmdVZCk,"Very informative, thanks for sharing, I wish God interveins and bring back peace to the two brothers, am tired of seeing the killing of young and old."
1220,aPI5TmdVZCk,A perfect narrative of the facts in complete accordance with the Holy Bible. It‚Äôs a complex problem that started thousands of years and made much more complicated with religious divisions. Brave hearts on both sides are required to come together and agree on a 2-state solution which will benefit millions of people living in perpetual fear and poor economic conditions. May God bless them to take the first courageous step towards establishing lasting peace in the region.
1221,aPI5TmdVZCk,Very informative and interesting. Thank you for sharing üôè

1224,wyt0jlbOPqA,Concise and very much educational. Thank you for your hard work in compling and sharing this .
1225,wyt0jlbOPqA,Great video. Always seemed hard to understand actually what's going on with Israel and the more complicated version of explaining how it came into being. Very concise and to the point on understanding. Thanks
1226,wyt0jlbOPqA,Well done. A balanced approach to the conflict.
1227,wyt0jlbOPqA,Thank you for this wonderful presentation. Its educative.
1228,wyt0jlbOPqA,USSR & Czechoslovakia's involvement fascinating. Definitely worth more research
1229,wyt0jlbOPqA,Cannot conclude this is a balanced account without a mention of Deir Yassin or Plan Dalet. Very relevant exclusions.
1230,wyt0jlbOPqA,Phenomenal video on Birth State of Israel . A very long time quest and hunger to know how it happened . Thank you for this historical video A truly an awesome presentation Keep up your good work Take care
1231,wyt0jlbOPqA,For the first time I heard the true story from the beginning to the modern day. Thanks a lot.

1234,QN_Tm_KScLo,Your historical map must go back 6000 years.
1235,QN_Tm_KScLo,"Silly - history shows a very different explanation - Egypt and Jordan held their areas you are calling Palestine. WB was Jordan, Gaza was Egypt.   Palestine? a bit of a myth."
1236,QN_Tm_KScLo,Check @700AD
1237,QN_Tm_KScLo,This is a completely distorted account of the history of the region. He deliberately ignore the fact that Jews lived there more than 3000 years ago until chased away by Muslim conquerors around the 7th century
1238,QN_Tm_KScLo,"strange that you failed to mention Israel was attacked by Egypt Jordan Syria Lebanon iraq saudi arabia yemen and frame them all as ""Historic Palestine"" which was British mandated territory taken from the disbanded collapse of the ottoman empire after ww1"
1239,QN_Tm_KScLo,USA busybody

1242,htNfs-UeNvQ,"Whos Idea was it to have the dates on the glass? They should get fired, that's horrendous."
1243,htNfs-UeNvQ,Not an adequately nuanced explanation. Leaves out context of formation of Israeli state and tends towards simplistic bias. Rory Stewarts explanation is far better.
1244,htNfs-UeNvQ,Funny how he forgets british role in this

1246,htNfs-UeNvQ,"In 1921 May, the Jewish Communist and Socialist parties clashed with fists in Jaffa. Palestinian Arabs decided to add weapons to the fight, killing and pillaging.

So this goes back before 1948."
1247,htNfs-UeNvQ,Wow guys been studying 40 years and doesn‚Äôt mention how they came in to Palestine in 1941 smh
1248,htNfs-UeNvQ,This clears up a number of questions. Hamas put those children of the people and the Palestinian families in danger.
1249,htNfs-UeNvQ,It feels as if this guy is deflecting and that he doesnt understand the conflict :S
1250,htNfs-UeNvQ,"Even the very most unintelligent ordinary working class Israeli knows that to copy a Natzi philosophy will end in catastrophic failure. Yerushalayim is the place of 3 main religions . I thought the place was a dump when I was there , should have gone to Greece or Italy or somewhere, for my holiday. It‚Äôs easier for human beings to be compassionate than war , this is what all 3 religions in Jerusalem has discovered for mankind and now that place , the Holy places in Jerusalem are giving the most negative messages to the world. It has gone fundamentally wrong and I have one blame , the internet is undermining the indigenous peace that has formed in that part of the World and has taught the world for thousands of years . There is a resonance that was discovered, whether it be under Roman Violence domination or anything that is similar to the Roman violence domination , that resonance is still there if people choose it , or if they want to choose to be cavemen , from thousands of years prior to that , they will fail , because the basic resonance of the Earth has fundamentally moved on from those times , written in your old book !"
1251,htNfs-UeNvQ,"It's funny how he did not mention what part the Germans, French, British, and Turks played in what has led up to today's mess.   I watched a documentary and a well known British man in the documentary acknowledged the shameful role the Brits played in the past.  There were several countries in the past seeking power and control in middle east.   Nor does this man describe how many Palestinians have died at the hands of Israel people.  Nor the unfair treatment the Palestinians have been subjected to over the years.  Palestinians and Israelite's come from the loins of Abraham.  They are brothers and should live in peace with one another, but people need to watch factual documentaries which details how they both have been lied to and deceived over the years and how other countries in the past were seeking control not just of the region, but of the vast assets in the middle east."
1252,wznD7uCEcLk,"While we applaud for Jon doing this interview and segment, let's also thank Comedy Central to let Jon use this platform to do what is right for the world."
1253,wznD7uCEcLk,The incredible insight and humanity that Jon Stewart possesses is something to be cherished! Kudos to Murtaza Hussain and Yair Rosemberg for showing the world that there are no boundaries to friendship and goodwill. Also for showing that the only magic in great journalism is honesty and integrity.
1254,wznD7uCEcLk,"It is so weird that I click a comedy link to find the first real peace summit between Muslims and Jews ever. Murtaza's logic is unbelievably reasonable; Yair provides a very logical counterweight as well. I was in Damascus watching an israeli airstrike unfold before my eyes as the sky turned sunset-orange at 9 pm on a winter night. I was shaking and in tears a few hours ago, and now after this conversation I'm like yeah, the METO thing could actually work. Thank you all for making me feel like this is not an impossible case again. Thank you; you have no idea how much more comfortable with being at a warzone this makes me feel. Appreciation."
1255,wznD7uCEcLk,"I am grateful to the Comedy Central network for allowing this platform at all. Newscasters and reporters on major networks often face massive restrictions on their topics. Also, it must be said, few on camera reporters have the brilliance of Jon Stewart in breaking down complicated issues in ways that guide his audience into understanding them, while also offering them a choice to learn new and broader ways of thinking. I am so glad Jon is back at the helm of the Daily Show. Thank you to anyone and all who are responsible for that!"
1256,wznD7uCEcLk,"I'm so happy this video and the other one is getting millions of views... It's the most sane thing I've seen about the conflict.
I survived a terror attack in 2016 in Tel Aviv. My dream of peace will never die. They will never make me just another hater. Salam brothers"
1257,wznD7uCEcLk,"This is true journalism. Not a debate with opposite extremest, which sell a lot more, but a debate with rational critical thinkers."
1258,wznD7uCEcLk,"you Sirs are a shining example that we can get along if we just TALK to each other, THANK YOU!"
1259,wznD7uCEcLk,Wow.... It's amazing what hearing an actual conversation can do for your mental health. Thank you so much.
1260,wznD7uCEcLk,Ok. I cried and laughed. What a brilliant get together with the 3 so intelligent people. Thank you to all of you.
1261,wznD7uCEcLk,"You have to have conversations like this, calm and insightful. Yelling and inciting fear never gets anyone, anywhere."
1262,CynzeRes7mY,"Dear Simon, a video on the history of Israel-Palestine conflict would be very much appreciated."
1263,CynzeRes7mY,Personally I feel there is no way world governments couldn‚Äôt have foreseen something like this happening considering how unstable things are there
1264,CynzeRes7mY,"I've grown up in Yugoslavia during the wars so this whole conflict rings a too much big bell. I can't make myself to  support either Palestine or Israel, but goddamn I feel what those civilians are going trough. 
War is never fair to an ordinary man."
1265,CynzeRes7mY,This is an insightful video providing valuable perspectives on the Israel-Hamas conflict. It's crucial to have open discussions about this complex issue to promote understanding and hopefully contribute to a peaceful resolution. Thanks for sharing this informative content! üëç
1266,CynzeRes7mY,I trust this FAR more than mainstream media.  Thank you Simon and team
1267,CynzeRes7mY,I honestly have no idea how Simon has time to do anything other then education the world in many different subjects.
1268,CynzeRes7mY,Why can‚Äôt mainstream media show this level of unbiased coverage? Brilliant work
1269,CynzeRes7mY,"Honestly, I refuse to believe that the world didn't see this coming. Everyone saw this coming a mile away. Everyone. The crisis was always brewing. It's sad how people are slaughtered on both sides."
1270,CynzeRes7mY,"I'm genuinely grateful for your honest and unbiased coverage of this complex issue, Simon and the Warographics team. It's refreshing to find a source that provides a balanced perspective, allowing viewers to form their own opinions. Your work truly stands out in today's media landscape. üôåüåçüïä"
1271,CynzeRes7mY,Thank you so much Simon! You're many channels and coverage is something i appreciate SO much!!
1272,8V-9LRLSzLg,"A youtube channel Jazby has done an amazing job of tracing the region back during ottoman times. 
Middleeast was only weakly controled by the ottomans. There are 100s of battles fought between local rulers over the 300 years leading up to British rule. It was never peaceful."
1273,8V-9LRLSzLg,What was the justification for settling Gaza?

Bilibili is one of the largest, if not the largest, video-sharing platform in mainland China with an operation mode similar to YouTube. This wave of antisemitism is largely due to Chinese official media's support of Hamas."
1276,8V-9LRLSzLg,"England controlled so much territory in the early 20th century‚Ä¶. Imagine how different it would be if they had just been like ‚ÄúHere you go Jewish people, take Jamaica or New Zealand.‚Äù instead of territory in the Middle East."
1277,8V-9LRLSzLg,This is probably the best video on the topic that is out there.
1278,8V-9LRLSzLg,Blame the Romans..
1279,8V-9LRLSzLg,"Mahathama Gandhi, believer of Hinduism  and Lord Buddha's teachings, made the British Empire to crumble by using ""PAssive Resisitance"", non-violant war. His followeres were Matine Luthar King and Nelson Mandela. Christains and Catholics who came to East later became non-violnt and learnt to  live with the Buddhsit and Hindus peacefully. Even Muslims in Sri Lanka are non-violant(unless they  have other methods). I do not know how peaceful is the preachings of Jew prophats. Do they also beleieve in ""An Eye for an Eye"". One thing I know is both religions are called Ibrahimic religions(and Christian?). Spanish Catholics have spread the religion in Peru using weapons and Smallpox(brought about by angry Spanish God). That was many years ago. Now they are also peaceful. I am happy to be a practicing Buddhist lived along with Hindus in Sri Lanka allowing Catholics and Muslims to build churches near Buddhst temples."

1292,hXtzera0mkY,Thank you for not telling us about the underlying issues of the conflict. The most relevant underlying perspectives ignored for convenience.
1293,hXtzera0mkY,You did a great job of glossing over the history that would provide any context to what you said. Great job at confusing people further (y)

1296,hXtzera0mkY,"""and then the king divided the land in twain"""
1297,hXtzera0mkY,Watching these Israel Palestine conflict videos I have come to the conclusion that Israel should control the land they currently occupy if it‚Äôs morally or politically correct is up for debate but that‚Äôs war. You take the land and protect it. If the Palestinians don‚Äôt like it they should leave the area with the assistance of the UN. I don‚Äôt see a peaceful solution here in favor of Palestinians I‚Äôm sorry but throwing yourselves against a military power isn‚Äôt going to help unless you win in war.

1303,WTjGtfVmIbA,The people of Gaza will be the ones that will suffer the most as they will risk getting killed or displaced. I think there is potential that Israel will use this as an opportunity take over the entire Gaza strip. They've always had the means to do it but they never had an excuse until now.
1304,WTjGtfVmIbA,"Netanyahu CLEARLY SAID, its NOT a conflict or a campaign but its WAR. He said it if you were listening! Say it like it is!"

1357,Y58njT2oXfE,"This is the first I've heard of the group ""Jewish Voice for Peace"" on Democracy Now...  instantly, I dropped everything to go on YouTube to search for the group and here I am. :) I am soooo proud you guys.

1359,Y58njT2oXfE,that video gives me goosebumps .... and¬†treas in eyes ¬†
1360,Y58njT2oXfE,This is by far one of the best videos that I have seen on the subject. They really get to the basic heart of the matter in such a clear and concise way. I wish everyone in the US could watch this.
1361,Y58njT2oXfE,Even after watching this I still don't get what's going on over there.
1362,6Wj_j9aLxF4,"The events of the 1948 war of Jerusalem, which would lead to the founding of Israel, had been immortalized through the photographs of two war photographers, British and Palestinian. 

John Philip, the British photographer, was one of the first photojournalists in the world on the war in Jerusalem. His camera documents the Jews' perspective, the evacuation of thousands of Jews from the Old City of Jerusalem. Philip captures, for Life Magazine, the destruction of the Jewish Quarter of the Old City. 

Meanwhile, Ali Zaarour was one of the few photographers who took photos of the Palestinian side of the story. His photos had never been seen before his grandson discovered them and undertook a tremendous task to illustrate the catastrophe that this war was also for the Palestinians. The Naqba, the catastrophe and the darkest day, where 750,000 Palestinians lost their homes and became refugees."
1363,6Wj_j9aLxF4,What a timing of this great documentary.

1422,wznD7uCEcLk,"While we applaud for Jon doing this interview and segment, let's also thank Comedy Central to let Jon use this platform to do what is right for the world."
1423,wznD7uCEcLk,The incredible insight and humanity that Jon Stewart possesses is something to be cherished! Kudos to Murtaza Hussain and Yair Rosemberg for showing the world that there are no boundaries to friendship and goodwill. Also for showing that the only magic in great journalism is honesty and integrity.
1424,wznD7uCEcLk,"It is so weird that I click a comedy link to find the first real peace summit between Muslims and Jews ever. Murtaza's logic is unbelievably reasonable; Yair provides a very logical counterweight as well. I was in Damascus watching an israeli airstrike unfold before my eyes as the sky turned sunset-orange at 9 pm on a winter night. I was shaking and in tears a few hours ago, and now after this conversation I'm like yeah, the METO thing could actually work. Thank you all for making me feel like this is not an impossible case again. Thank you; you have no idea how much more comfortable with being at a warzone this makes me feel. Appreciation."
1425,wznD7uCEcLk,"I am grateful to the Comedy Central network for allowing this platform at all. Newscasters and reporters on major networks often face massive restrictions on their topics. Also, it must be said, few on camera reporters have the brilliance of Jon Stewart in breaking down complicated issues in ways that guide his audience into understanding them, while also offering them a choice to learn new and broader ways of thinking. I am so glad Jon is back at the helm of the Daily Show. Thank you to anyone and all who are responsible for that!"
1426,wznD7uCEcLk,"I'm so happy this video and the other one is getting millions of views... It's the most sane thing I've seen about the conflict.
I survived a terror attack in 2016 in Tel Aviv. My dream of peace will never die. They will never make me just another hater. Salam brothers"
1427,wznD7uCEcLk,"This is true journalism. Not a debate with opposite extremest, which sell a lot more, but a debate with rational critical thinkers."
1428,wznD7uCEcLk,"you Sirs are a shining example that we can get along if we just TALK to each other, THANK YOU!"
1429,wznD7uCEcLk,Wow.... It's amazing what hearing an actual conversation can do for your mental health. Thank you so much.

1495,Fo77sTGpngQ,"came back to this video and just struck by how insidiously evil it is for that pastor to tell palestinian christians to just ""stay out of this conflict,"" as if bombs aren't being dropped on palestinians of all religions. how exactly do you expect any palestinian to just ""stay out of"" the violent destruction of their land and families?"
1496,Fo77sTGpngQ,Jesus would cry out loud for the injustice happening in Palestine.

1503,O7ByJb7QQ9U,People will still be watching this video in a 100 years except the situation will be a little more confusing than now.
1504,O7ByJb7QQ9U,"A correction...It says ""in April 1920 Palestinians poured into the old city""...but these Arabs refused to be called ""Palestinians,"" in fact at the time and throughout the first half of the 20th century it was considered an insult to Arabs, like calling them ""dirty Jews"" since the Jews were the ones known as ""Palestinians."" They insisted on being called simply ""Arabs."" But yes, these are the people who perpetrated regular massacres of Jews in the 1920s and 1930s."

1511,O7ByJb7QQ9U,"Among the many ironies of the history is that since 1948, the Druze have almost always been supporters of Israel, including serving in the IDF.  But it was the Druze who attacked Jews or led the attacks on Jews back in 1660 and in the 1800s."

1524,exyQ724_2nk,"World peace to everyone. No more war, no more hurts and no more pain but love."
1525,exyQ724_2nk,"What was important to hear first and foremost was that the ""home"" was recognized as a place of peace, family, and all that represents. It does not matter who the home belongs to - it is other people occupying it without invitation. HOW indignant other people from other countries would feel if this happened to them - yet Palestinian people have to accept it as part of the norm - their homes destroyed as part of the expansion and just because others ""CAN"".  It is not so long ago 75 years or so that Jewish homes were appropriated, their property either seized, confiscated, or destroyed. It makes no difference.  The feeling is exactly the same - helpless, traumatized, and violated. I do not condone any action of violence. ALL peoples deserve peace all over the world no matter who they are no matter what. Everyone deserves to be accorded dignity and respect."
1526,exyQ724_2nk,"Only time showed how this commander saved so many life‚Äôs, as write this at least 600 lost there lives from a attack from Gaza and many innocent were kidnapped into Gaza. May Hashem bless the commander and save many more lives."

1529,exyQ724_2nk,It is sad to see this happen to the civilians but they are not being attacked they are being moved to another fully built home recompensed and transported there with respect... Which is way more than how the Palestinian families were being treated by these people

1545,4vsEM90JSGI,"Wow. Unbiased report from Global?

My heart is broken for the families and children facing these atrocities üíî"
1546,4vsEM90JSGI,"Thank you for better reporting. Before 1948, both Jews and Muslims settled there. However, after WW2 (about 1948), the United Nations gave Palestine to Israel and divided it up into the West Banks (where Palestinians can move freely but hard to live there) and or pushed Muslims into Gaza (40 km wide and Palestinians cannot move freely, like an open-air prison). West Banks now has more Israeli settlers moving in, so losing land there. Gaza's population is 2.4 M. Look at the map, very small land in Gaza. Israel controls mostly everything around it, including the water. Israel does not want to give up land or mix. People have been oppressed for 75 years since the United Nations took its actions. Israel is very wealthy compared to Palestine. What Hamas did is wrong. What Israel did is wrong. What the United Nations did is wrong. I have no solutions."
1547,4vsEM90JSGI,I have never been more proud of Global News. This is as close to an unbiased reporting of news as we can hope for. Thank you!

1582,kvmD7KJdpJA,I‚Äôm sure both sides will agree that God is going to sort it all out. It‚Äôs been doing a great job with it so far.
1583,kvmD7KJdpJA,I found this explainer really useful. Israel Palestine is so complex. I don't know how many have a serious understanding of how things in the region have come to be.
1584,kvmD7KJdpJA,What he failed to state was the reason Britain issued the Balfour Declaration even though  they had indirectly promised the Arabs full independence for help in fighting the Turks Opinion has always been divided in Britain but the state of Israel would not have been established if the US had not pushed for it and today continues to give it unconditional support.The problem is that in Israel  a religious hard right faction wields considerable political power even though a majority of Israelis are non religious.
1585,kvmD7KJdpJA,Thank for bringing a foreign office diplomat.
1586,kvmD7KJdpJA,üôèüèª thank you
1587,kvmD7KJdpJA,"As an American I despise the corruption of the Israeli lobby, seeing politicians declare unaccountable unconditional aid is gross.  But otherwise I support Israel, even if they deserve criticism on many occasions, it's the only Jewish country, and they are arguably much better global citizen than anyone in their neighborhood.  Muslims/Arabs have an ideologically deranged arrogance regarding their right to control their historical caliphates.  Jews have an older claim, but Israel has obligations to religious pilgrims, Jerusalem should maybe be a neutral religious enclave.   Let's be tough & recognize demographic perversions & and how some ""civilians"" coddle & cheer despicable groups, let's be innovative & ""ethical"", but let's defend our interests & be effective & steadfast!"
1588,kvmD7KJdpJA,"I think Sir Simon failed to mention that when Israel withdrew from Gaza, the Palestinians voted in Hamas. From that point, there were relentless rocket attacks and terrorist bombings. That's when Israel began the blockade on Gaza."
1589,kvmD7KJdpJA,The only pressure is from the UN and Human rights who gets consistently and constantly ignored
1590,kvmD7KJdpJA,"2:-20: ""nothing should be done to prejudice the civil and religious rights of others (Arabs)...""; Israel has not, is not, that falls on Hamas and Fatah (PLO).  Israel just responds to, and benefits from, aggression from Arab states; Arabs never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity; Arabs have killed the possibility of a ""2-state"" solution.  The only option now is a ""3-sstate"" solution meaning Israel, Egypt and Jordon !!!  3:26 the refugee displacement wasn't a 'tragedy of war'; it was a deserved boon to Israel brought on by the arrogance of its enemies.  This Hamas attack falls into the same category; the only 'tragedy' is the slaughter of Israelis by Hamas!  BTW: why does Times Radio keep showing an empty chair?  I've noticed this before; Is the camera preprogrammed for 'face time'?"
1591,kvmD7KJdpJA,why didn‚Äôt you mention the 1948 war and who started it?
1592,8I8wuFrp7gI,We‚Äôve got a lot more videos about the situation in Palestine and Israel. Check them out here.: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZd3QRtSy5LNLB6pyzFcfL0M_bYybQT2g
1593,8I8wuFrp7gI,It is amazing how a people who claim to have had a unique and painful history now inflict pain upon other people without any pangs of conscience! Has Israel no shame?
1594,8I8wuFrp7gI,I am so sick and tired of evil people using religion as an excuse for the evil that they do and to delude themselves into believing they are good people.
1595,8I8wuFrp7gI,"""If I don't steal it, someone else will.""  How's that for a criminal defense strategy?  Defense attorney's the world over take note."
1596,8I8wuFrp7gI,I believe you are right. I am a new Palestinian supporter.  Can you believe I‚Äôm almost 65 and wasn‚Äôt Aware that APARTHEID existed in Israel!  That is appalling!  I happen to be American and I feel betrayed that I didn‚Äôt know and my Country didn‚Äôt tell us that Apartheid existed there!  There should be No More support for Apartheid anywhere on earth!!
1597,8I8wuFrp7gI,"Nelson Mandela once said ""We know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians."""
1598,8I8wuFrp7gI,"Note to Muslims in particular Al-Aqsa Mosque is not a building with a dome Al-Aqsa Mosque is everything that the wall surrounded, including Al-Qibli Mosque, the Dome of the Rock, and the yard"
1599,8I8wuFrp7gI,"As an Orthodox Christian who isn‚Äôt Middle Eastern or Arab, It really pains to the maximum to see what Palestinian Christians and Muslims go through on a regular basis, and yet the ones talking about human rights currently against Russia‚Äôs actions rarely reported about it. 

Edit - If you highly disagree, Just know Jesus himself was a Palestinian who took refuge in Egypt. About the 2 way policy, Um nope. The house that I own was built in the early 1920s. If the great grandson of the constructor that built that home, Came with a Bible and said, ‚ÄúGive it to me because I have some roots here‚Äù, There would be no treaty or 2 way policy."
1600,8I8wuFrp7gI,I am truly heartbroken for Israel's  deliberate/intentional destruction of this important Muslim mosque & all of persecution which they have committed. üíî
1601,8I8wuFrp7gI,I can‚Äôt even imagine what will happen to these people on the day of judgement. May God protect all the true believers of Him.

So do not let your desires cause you to deviate Àπfrom justiceÀ∫. If you distort the testimony or refuse to give it, then Àπknow thatÀ∫ Allah is certainly All-Aware of what you do.

1672,XYn5t0tuuAk,"I fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, 13 years.  You would think I would hold hate and animosity toward anyone that was Muslim, or from Afghanistan or the Middle East but I do not.  War is a waste of time and resources and more importantly lives.  I love everyone around the world.  I dont hold on to hate.  It‚Äôs not worth it.  Good message Arnold.  I just have one hope, maybe one day we will all just see each other as humans, not nationality, not religion, not skin color, or sexuality."
1673,XYn5t0tuuAk,This reminded me of my grandfather.  He taught me many of these things.  It didn't take right away.  I was stubborn.  But he never gave up on me.  Eventually he got through.
1674,XYn5t0tuuAk,"The Truth IS the greatest ""weight"" some people struggle with....but the more you struggle with it ....the stronger you get....Thank you Arnold for proving that Truth."

A good effort to get through to the people who need to be told without actually naming them.

1682,l_c3QVjjmwc,"When you look at the technology they utilize, it makes it even harder to understand how Hamas breached their border using some tractors and motorcycles. Even if Israel intelligence didn't see this coming, I don't understand how Hamas was able to physically ingress so far into Israel."
1683,l_c3QVjjmwc,"The IDF actually had about 450,000 reservists wanting to take part in this war, but had to turn some of them away since they decided they only need 300,000. people kept insisting they want to help"
1684,l_c3QVjjmwc,"Respect. We had Israelis here in Australia, women and men, jumping on planes to go back and volunteer to protect their home land the day after the Hamas atrocities. That from the heart devotion to their country is something other countries should take note of."
1685,l_c3QVjjmwc,Do they have plasma rifles in the 40 watt range?
1686,l_c3QVjjmwc,Note that they are not even professional soldiers. All citizens are trained to respond and are in a rota to defend their country. Its incredible üòéüëçüí™
1687,l_c3QVjjmwc,"The reason why our army is the best is because we don‚Äôt have a choice but win.. we fight for our survival. We all, in Israel, pray for peace!!"
1688,l_c3QVjjmwc,"Finally giving Israel her due. Israel isn't fighting for her Image, Isreal is fighting for her life. That is the difference."
1689,l_c3QVjjmwc,"Here are some more unstated reasons for the IDF's success.
1. Everyone who is conscripted starts off as a private. No one begins as an officer. All the generals started as privates.
2. One can only move up in rank based solely on merit. All soldiers are taught to think independently to solve situational challenges and think ""outside the box"".
3. Rank is secondary. All officers are encouraged to listen to subordinates for other ideas. The old concept of ""4 heads are better than one"".
4. Because the IDF conscripts from the entire eligible population, it has the ability to discern the various skills and talents of their recruits and place them in those forces that best match their intelligence and skill sets.
5. Officers always lead first in a fight. That's why their officer casualty rate is higher than other armies.
6. They have to win because they have no other choice."
1690,l_c3QVjjmwc,Loved the scriptwriting and in-depth information in this video. Great work!
1691,l_c3QVjjmwc,"You‚Äôre forgot to mention the 1956 Suez crisis. Israel was key to the British and French successes, until the U.S. forced them to withdraw."

1732,0BasXaiHiiI,My family comes from France. Does that mean I can roll up in Paris bulldoze the Eiffel Tower and build my house there?
1733,0BasXaiHiiI,I have a coin from 1939 from Palestine... It's awesome how it's written both in Arabic and Hebrew... Shame that people would prefer to fight than be together...
1734,0BasXaiHiiI,"Very interesting. However, several studies using genetic tests show that the Palestinians have also lived in the area for thousands of years and they share the same genes with the bronze age people (Canaanaites) who lived in the region thousands of years ago. Also, it is possible that Palestinians today include Jews who converted to Christianity and Islam over the ages,"
1735,0BasXaiHiiI,"When asked about Israel and Palestine, Israeli advocates go as far back as 3000 years ago to make you forget about what‚Äôs happening now üòÇ"
1736,0BasXaiHiiI,"Many Palestinians and Jews are actually genetically related. Of course not all of them, but many are related as modern Palestinians are a mixture of ancient Israelis, Greco-Roman and Arabs."
1737,0BasXaiHiiI,"and thus the conflict between ""this is my ancestors land"" vs ""this is my land now"" goes on ...."
1738,0BasXaiHiiI,Will there be a sequel video to what happened after 1948?
1739,0BasXaiHiiI,"Eh, where is the part about the weird pre world war II statement called 'The Balfourt Decleration'? 

'The Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 during the First World War announcing its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine, then an Ottoman region with a small minority Jewish population. The declaration was contained in a letter dated 2¬†November 1917 from the United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Lord Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, for transmission to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. The text of the declaration was published in the press on 9¬†November 1917. '"
1740,0BasXaiHiiI,"I think the problem is that many Ashkenazi Israeli Jews still have PTSD epigenetically transmitted from their ancestors who suffered under Nazi Germany and Mizrahi Jews have the same due to the expulsions from Arab lands, which leads both of these groups to think oppressing another people is ok. Just give the Palestinians their independent state. Who cares if they existed as an ethnicity 100, 200 or 1000 years ago, they‚Äôre there NOW and suffering. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be the 1967 borders."

But at the end of the day as long as extremists exist on both sides to derail peace in their chase of their own all or nothing goals and ambitions, peace will never be possible. 
In conclusion, people on both sides will continue to die and suffer because extremists on both sides take up an all or nothing attitude. It is perhaps the saddest situation of the 20th and 21st centuries."

I've also visited Israel several times. Between all of that, as well as having an extensive library on the topic, I can say that you did well to explain a very complicated situation in 15 minutes.

1749,1kYWII25cxM,"I have watched this issue rage by entire life from the US.¬† So, I've never lived in Israel but have lived in the region once for about 18 months.¬† I think the issue can be solved but this would involve compromises from each side that maybe no one is willing to make or has been so far.¬† I think the Arab nations were crazy to reject the partition plan in the first place but, be that as it may, things turned out the way they have for many reasons.¬† This reminds me of may issues in the US where we only have two major political parties which means that compromise, while always possible, is a bit harder to actually arrive at."

1774,Tz7JJcO-rWw,"Fascinating account, well put together video. 

One must not forget either, that In the First World War (1914‚Äì1918) the British sided with the Arabs to fight against the Ottoman Empire of that time. The Ottoman Turks lost that war and both Britain and France alongside the US had a meeting in Paris in 1919 where it would be decided what the fate of Turkey's lands would become in the Middle East.

The Arabs had been reassured that if they fought against the Turks, they would be given their own empire and land on which  they could rule and govern. This promise was BROKEN however, by the British at the so called 'Peace Conference'. The subsequent Arab lands ended up in the control of both Britain and France and would remain so up until they believed the Arabs were ready to rule them themselves.

To get to the depth of this period of history, one must understand the involvement of Jews in all of this. You see, the history of the Jewish people stretches back a very long time and that is not surprising as its one of the oldest Abrahamic faiths extending its origins to even before Bibical times.  When the Roman empire was reigning supreme and controlling large swathes of territory stretching from Europe to the Middle East, the Jews lived in and around a region what is now commonly called Palestine.  They were driven out of there by the Romans around 70AD and as a result Jews would migrate around the world and settle down where they could. This would happen over the course of around two millennia.

Eventually at the end of 19th Century, a man named Theodor Herzl, an Austro-Hungarian Jewish lawyer and Political activist became the pioneer and founded of what we refer to as 'The Zionist Movement'. 

The idea behind the Zionist movement was simply to establish a Jewish homeland, with Zion meaning 'promised land'.  It just so happened that this 'promised land' would be smack bang in the middle of modern day Palestine. Theodor Herzl advocated and staunchly believed that it was the place God intended the Jews to live.

Sometime around 1917, Lord Balfour, a British Government Ministor promised that the British Government would assist the Jews in establishing a homeland in Palestine. This became known to the world as 'The Balfour Declaration'. 

Ultimately what this did was put Britain in a complicated situation since this very same land was initially promised to be handed back to the Arabs, land which it must be noted never belonged to the British, the French and certainly not to USA."
1775,Tz7JJcO-rWw,Explained in best ever possible way - Thank You
1776,Tz7JJcO-rWw,"i still find it hard to understand how, why and where the british gets the gall to believe that they have power to declare something, especially one that affects the lives of a nation. why do the europeans in general feel that they're entitled to ""own"" the rest of the world and its resources? makes me wonder how the world would have been if the europeans did not exist."
1777,Tz7JJcO-rWw,"Great video. ""Why the mid-east bleeds"" by Ted Pike is a great watch too. Very telling!"
1778,Tz7JJcO-rWw,The Jews also promised to bring USA into ww2 if Britain gave Palestine to them.
1779,Tz7JJcO-rWw,"there where some mps in the Chilean Government (there about 500,000 Palestinians in chile) wanted the British Government to apologize for the Balfour Declaration"

1786,CaIi-3huRLE,"Interesting fact:  most of the weapons that Czechoslovakia (I apologize if I spelled that wrong) sent to the Israelis were, in fact, surplus weapons that had been manufactured for the Wermacht in WW2.  As such many, if not all of them, had improperly calibrated or sabotaged sights, which the Czechs had intended to mess with the Germans, but they forgot to inform the IDF about it until after the weapons had been shipped, issued and the Israelis had found out about the messed up sights.  Still, it must have struck several of the Jews as ironic that they were now using Czech Vz. 24s, Kar98ks and other weapons made for the Nazis, to defend themselves, along with a smattering of American, British, Russian and even homemade weapons."

The ground operation will be like the war in fallujah, traps, leading soldiers into choke points, it will be terrifying."

1826,8f6XZedkO-Y,"Ever since the start of this conflict I‚Äôve consumed a fuck ton of content on this topic. Yours has been one of the most informative one, especially about the popularity of hamas, elections and ground offensive of israel.

Unfortunate part about all these events is that innocent civilians are bearing the brunt of terrorists‚Äô actions"
1827,8f6XZedkO-Y,"I think you are missing a few points here. Afghanistan is huge compared to Gaza. It's distance from the US is large as well. Logistics are much different compared to Israel and Gaza. Also it has been a decade since 2014 ,if Hamas has learned more about a ground invasion, so has Israel. The relative improvement in technology is vastly superior for the Israelis."

1832,oLIIV1IXuig,Merci pour les explications claires et concises que vous avez donn√©. Malheureusement les m√©dias d'aujourd'hui ne sont plus des m√©dias d'informations mais des m√©dias d'opinion. Chacun donne son avis sans expliquer les tenants et les aboutissants. Le format de votre video est top. BRAVO !

1835,oLIIV1IXuig,"Bravo pour ce travail professionnel et objectif avec lequel vous avez r√©ussi √† r√©sumer bri√®vement un conflit qui date depuis des si√®cles et dans lequel il y a plein de d√©tails
N√©anmoins, je crois qu'il manquait d'expliquer le r√¥le des grands pays dans ce conflit, les raisons de leur soutien inconditionnel, qu'ils portent toujours √† la m√™me partie ; ceci pouvait expliquer clairement les √©carts des pertes entre les 2 parties de ce conflit, ainsi que pourquoi ce conflit, qui dure depuis tout un si√®cle, ne prend jamais fin malgr√© toutes les pertes en vies humaines des 2 c√¥t√©s.
Il est temps de voir un travail objectif pareil sur nos m√©dias plut√¥t que cette propagande infinie qui incite toujours √† la haine et qui nous √©loigne de tout discours pouvant mener √† la paix et la justice."

1838,oLIIV1IXuig,"Parfait ! Tellement de gens se concentrent sur l'instant, au lieu de revenir juste un peu en arri√®re pour comprendre r√©ellement ce conflit g√©n√©r√© par la cr√©ation d'un Etat sorti de nulle part."
1839,oLIIV1IXuig,"En tout cas bravo, vous avez r√©ussi √† nous faire un r√©sum√© de toute l‚Äôhistoire en 20 minutes et c‚Äôest extraordinaire tout ce qu‚Äôon a pu savoir. Merci chefüëèüí™‚ò∫Ô∏è"

Je laisse pas souvent de commentaire sur les r√©seaux mais la je dois dire que les vid√©o de Hugo d√©crypte devrait tourner en boucle pour √™tre regard√© par le plus grand nombre
