0,im3otpqYAiQ,Covid Vaccine Study Finds Links to Health Conditions,"Vaccines that protect against severe illness, death and lingering long Covid symptoms from a coronavirus infection have been linked to small increases in neurological, blood, and heart-related conditions. Jason Gale discusses the findings of he largest global vaccine safety study to date on Bloomberg Television.

You can find out more on this story here: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-19/largest-covid-vaccine-study-yet-finds-links-to-health-conditions",2024-02-20,31101,558,653,UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg," [CC may contain inaccuracies] In terms of how widespread the adverse
event reporting has been. Talk us through what the findings were.
Yeah. So these findings are not really at all
surprising. We have known about these side effects
really since the vaccines began rolling out at the end of 2020, early 2021.
We've seen this myocarditis inflammation of the heart muscle pericarditis,
inflammation of the sac around the heart, as well as this unusual blood
clot that forms in the brain from the virus vector vaccine.
So none of these findings are new, but they are actually fairly reassuring
because they didn't find anything else that was that was at all alarming,
Heidi. And it did look at a few different
vaccine types as well. Was there any difference across them?
There was indeed. Yes.
They did see this increased risk for for the brain blood clots in in relation to
the AstraZeneca viral virus vector vaccine.
And and also we did see the increased risk of of myocarditis and pericarditis
with the mRNA vaccines that are the ones made by Pfizer, Biontech and Moderna.
There were some other interesting findings as well.
Guillain-Barré syndrome was shown to be a an event of concern linked to mostly
to the Oxford AstraZeneca virus vector vaccine.
Otherwise, everything else was pretty much as we
had already expected. Thinks
so. And we've talked about some of those
pre-established conditions of interest. Did they find anything that was
pertinent across that subsection of the study?
Beyond those 13 events that they were looking for that they didn't see, they
weren't looking specifically for other aspects of vaccine injury.
That has been noted in the past. Postural orthostatic tachycardia
syndrome that is increase heart rate that has been noted in relation to
vaccines. The researchers have also seen in a
higher frequency associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
So while the vaccines were known to be associated with this problem, they were
actually occurring more frequently from an infection."

Here he shares new findings on the theory and practical medical management of these two conditions. Thank you, Professor, as always for sharing your time and expertise.",2024-01-18,610043,26236,5632,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg," well a warm welcome to this talk and a particularly warm welcome back to Professor Robert clany all the way from Sydney Professor welcome back and thank you for coming my great pleasure John as always now Robert Clans is well known to the the channel he's a consultant physician a professor of immunology and holds qualifications in Medicine Science and pathology and is a holder of the Australia medal so great to great to have him back now you've been doing quite a lot of work recent L Robert on uh long Co and I think we should say that one of the big advantages of being shall we say at our stages in later stages in our careers is you don't have to worry about publication so much so quite a lot of what we're going to talk about now is fairly original work so thank you for sharing that with us so we want to talk about um post vaccine and post infection long covid um now both of these syndromes you you you've been seeing you've been seeing patients with these can you just tell us roughly roughly roughly what you see patients with long covid patients with long covid vaccine injury what are what are you seeing well I think the first point uh John is that uh there's no great mystery to to these conditions uh what happened was with the infection uh initially people were seeing ongoing symptoms and came up with a diagnosis that was vague and confusing and it was called long coov now long coov was anybody who had symptoms following Co infection that persisted for more than 3 months and the confusion for this is that it it included a number of different problems and every patient had a different mix of these problems and so uh for people who uh were working outside of say Immunology and related um related disciplines it it was incredibly difficult but to simplify there there are basically two different components uh it's been known really since the late 1800s that people who get particular infections uh have a chance of getting a persistent fatigue illness that follows it and that's quite it's nothing different about Co and so the essential component of long Co is what is essentially post viral infection fatigue and it has two Central components the first is what I call Energy activated fatigue which means that if you do something uh then you pay for it you get more fatigue and the way I discuss that with patients is I talk about a ceiling I say we've all got a ceiling and uh in people with post viral fatigue syndrome long Co that ceiling comes down and if you try to push yourself with energy then you hit that ceiling that ceiling pays you back and you suffer for hours or days with of increased fatigue uh and um Associated characteristics the the second character the second feature of this uh chronic inflammatory state is cognitive defects and most people don't say I've got a cognitive defect they say I've got brain fog and uh it comes in many different forms I always have I had a I worked at McMaster University in Canada for some years and set up the Immunology Department there and I I remember I had this wonderful patient uh who was always late for appointments and um I once said why is it that you're always late you know I'm seeing you at the end of the clinic when you're actually supposed to be here 2 hours ago she said well it's it's part of my my problem I stand at the bus stop and I see the bus coming along and it says mcmas University and by the time it's sort of registered the bus is gone and I've got to wait for the next one and so there are all sorts of variations I had other patients who were Math teachers who had to give up because they they couldn't sit and look at the board and do simple mathematics so brain fog is a terribly a terribly incapacitating problem but when we came to Long co uh patients had these symptoms but they had other sets of symptoms which were more structural damage and so while in classic chronic fatigue illnesses you don't have so much in the way of structural damage to tissues the brain the heart in Long Co you did and that's because uh if you look at the underpinning cause of all of these it's the antigen is persistent uh in classic chronic fatigue it's commonly not always but commonly the epstar bar virus which is the virus in my country we call glandular fever I'm not sure what you call in in England is it glandular fever or infe nucleo well the Americans like yeah we would say glandular fever or if you're feeling a bit more correct infectious mononucleosis yeah there's a lot of confusion of but there's no question that a number of patients will have that incarcerated into their cells and under various stresses uh the virus escapes and you get fatigue illness maybe a sore throat big lymph nodes uh things like that and so we've known a lot about that but long um long Co and the patients had damage to their peripheral nerves often uh small fiber neuropathy with burning feet burning legs uh major problems in the brain uh cardiac issues a whole range of structural abnormalities and they got all thrown in together and you can understand the the confusion of people saying well how do I sort this out you know there's no obvious treatment um what's going on here and that's the way I know it's interesting I knowing that we were going to talk today I I just printed out uh the latest paper that I found on cause of um long Co which came out just last month and um it's a very interesting paper because it's full of detail but not full of message and it's whole list of different things that people see without saying wait a second what's the big picture here what's really going on and unless you approach it in that way you can't really really help the patient because the patient wants to understand what's going on and wants to have some logic in terms of what they can do about it uh and I I think that's where an immunologist basically looks after these patients I mean people with chronic fatigue illness have usually fallen into the basket of clinical Immunology because um most people who work in vertical systems like chest or heart or lung or brain um look at a particular disease in that system whereas immunologists look at a mechanism across the different systems and so we try to understand a process that's going on in a a person with autoimmune disease chronic fatigue illness various conditions like that and then address the diagnosis uh in that form uh look at tests that might help understand that process and medications or processes that can help uh the patient with those issues so I I think that's the broad sort of difference that underpins this now so that was chronic that was chronic fatigue in the context of um of U the covid infection and then more recently people are saying wait a second I'm seeing people uh who have had vaccination who have never had uh uh uh Co and these people are developing very similar symptoms uh and I I see in I don't see a lot of patients these days but I certainly see a number and I I have a number of patients who have uh had vaccines never had Co um but they've got essentially long Co syndromes and again it's a mixture of classic um energy activated fatigue brain fog together with certain structural problems uh so and the reason that it's very similar is that the persistent antigen is the same antigen it's Spike protein so you're getting Spike protein from the infection Co and that can persist at least 12 months maybe a lot longer in some of these patients whereas uh with vaccine we know that the spike protein the messenger RNA vaccine that is given uh disseminates through the body uh it provides expression of the spike protein on potentially any cell in the body and that can go on for months or year at least a year and remember the these are new syndromes we we didn't know about them until the the last couple of years so we don't know how long these conditions go but the bottom line is that there's the same cause for the Post vaccine long Co if you like and the post infection long Co and this is incredibly important to understand and sadly it is not understood very widely because if you go and have I've got a patient at the moment who had uh postvaccine uh long Co and then got Co infection and of course um people said who dear me all those terrible symptoms you've got of long they've got worse um we thought if you'd had a vaccine you'd get um much less problem with with with Co but of course uh it's a totally different situation when you're looking at a small proportion of people who get postvaccine long Co to the average person who might get uh a a vaccine which reduces the intensity of covid and therefore is linked to a degree of less chance of getting severe long Co disease and so there's this commonality of persistent antigen that underpins both those conditions and we need to understand that if we're going to apply effective management strategies it's it's really quite hard to understand this so when someone's vaccinated if they get this long vaccine covid situation instead of producing the antigen for a few hours they're producing the antigen chronically over o over a year or or more um what what is what is happening there how can the vaccine which is a single dose go on and produce Spike protein for a year or more well I think that's that's the big question isn't it and the answer is fairly straightforward that if you have a messenger RNA vaccine that messenger RNA we know um in the way in which it's packaged and presented will go throughout the body and can uh be taken up into essentially any cell in the body now when it does that it the messenger RNA uh expresses through the ribosomal system in the cell the factory for proteins it it it expresses Spike protein which is represented on the surface of the cell and can be detected in blood uh for a length of time now when it's expressed on the uh length of um uh on on the cell surface uh in most people it's probably only a relatively short period of time but in some people in fact a significant number of people they'll express it for a long period of time and they get an immune response because that remember that's what you're trying to to do with messenger RNA vaccine you're trying to stimulate an immune response but what uh was not understood and and sadly had not been properly tested right at the beginning uh was that this antigen um Can persist for a long period of time and be the focus of a self-destructive immune response very similar to autoimmune disease and that's exactly what's causing one of the two main causes of the structural damage I'm talking about remember I I said you get a chronic inflammatory situation due to the Persistence of the antigen and an ineffective immune response that's not clearing it which leads to lowlevel inflammation which leads to the exercise induced fatigue and the brain fog but now you can also Express this antigen uh as a foreign antigen on the cell surface and that's destroyed by t-lymphocytes as that's the job of the T it's not supposed to do that because it's someone's injected messenger RNA into you uh and so you get structural damage uh one of the commonest ones I see are people with um small fiber neuropathy um which is terribly disconcerting uh Burning uh feet uh disbalance um neurological issues flare up of demyelinating diseases uh cardiac issues uh all of these structural damages and they're different in every person which makes understanding and analyzing postco either postco syndrome extremely complicated and extremely difficult I mean it's it's probably getting into the pathophysiology a bit but if you're going to go on produce producing Spike protein for a year after vaccine do you think that means that the RNA has somehow gone into the DNA and there's an ongoing process of transcription here I think there are probably two ways of answering that firstly I don't think there's any doubt that you can reverse transcribe into DNA that's been shown in human cells uh at least to my knowledge on three occasions um and and that is a worry in its own and quite different to the problems we're talking about here uh that's looking at how I can change DNA expression in the individual uh it ra it raises all the questions of um um Progressive and expanded cancer uh it looks at transgenerational defects if it gets into the germline cells uh so that's that's a different issue here we're talking about messenger RNA without necessarily going to DNA just working doing what messenger RNA does and that's code for the amino acid sequence in a protein on the ribosomal Factory in the cell and so you're making all a spike protein don't need the DNA for that uh you've got the the DNA normally makes messenger RNA but we're actually giving messenger RNA so we're we're we're adding to to to the pool and so you've got all these cells making Spike protein for God only knows how long uh we don't know how long a long time and um that's creating uh and one of the factors that conditions a very important factor because not everyone gets postco not everyone gets fatigued uh it would seem that there is a subset of people who are more prone to develop um persistent nonresolved antigen in other words the messenger RNA keeps producing antigen and the body's immune response doesn't effectively clear it um if we had a lot of time I could run through the the the background information for this but let me just summarize and say in my view about 20% of people are fatigue prone uh there's a phenotype um you know you look at kids who go to university and say how many of you you uh have ever had fatigue at the time of exams and whatever bit of a sore throat about 20% will say that about 20% of athletes um get uh um essentially overtraining syndrome which is a a form of chronic fatigue it's a form that most people with chronic fatigue would love to have means they just drop their their time for 100 yards by 0. one of a second but it gets them out of the final um but but it is a very good model system that we we looked at very closely some years back the uh so you've got this situation where is a a group of people who appear to be prone and they're the ones who will get postvaccine fatigue and probably the the ones who have got the persistent formation of um the spike protein and get um long coed with both the fatigue and the structural uh defect problem using different mechanisms totally different mechanisms for the two so it sounds like we've got two mechanisms going on well the main mechanism whether it's long Co or postvaccine long Co is Persistence of the spike protein the spike protein is still produced for whatever reason whether it's long covid or postvaccine injury chronically being produced sometimes the features are as as a result of specific tissue damage because the tea cells are beaten up these cells would You're expect ing the spike protein wherever that is and of course we know that can be anywhere in the body now because the vaccine is systemically distributed so we've got the tissue damage but we've also got the ongoing inflammatory effects the the effects of the chronic inflammation that we're seeing as long covid or long postvaccine long covid that's are they the two sort of main causes of the clinical features exactly but keep in mind there is one underpinning common denominator and that is persistent antigen production which is a feature of all the chronic fatigue illnesses going back to influenza and all the other issues that that we um and this may this is just my view might I often turn out to be wrong but it's my view is that there's a phenotypic um uh uh proness if you like to developing uh fatigue illness when they're stressed with and they're more likely for some reason to get a persistent antigen because they have uh a less effective immune response than other people so most chronic fatigue syndromes can be explained in terms of the ongoing Persistence of some virus presumably mostly a virus causing these these chronic features so in theory if you could like wave of magic wand and eradicate all the virus from the body the patient would get better apart from the pathology that's caused by the tissue damage the irreversible tissue damage that's absolutely right and in fact um um when we were dealing with the uh Institute of sport in Australia with the elite swimmers uh you might remember they they win gold medals uh but some of them didn't and um uh we found that what was happening uh at the time the stress of international competition is in a number of these people start excreting epara virus in their throat so normally it's contained by a wall of tea cells and under the stress in the people who have got a partial immune deficiency so they've got a predisposition of not having a really effective immune response when they're expressed and people with long Co will say the same where under psychological or physical stress um I get worse and um we looked at this very carefully with the elite swimmers and we were able to uh completely obliterate that expression of epstar bar virus coming out in a condition which used to be called overtraining syndrome by doing one of two things uh the first is we we actually treated them with highly potent antivirals and prevented this and maintained their swimming capacity uh or we identified that the main precipitating factor was a particular type of physical stress which was um high high energy training and so we changed their training program and the Olympics uh in 2000 uh every Australian Elite swimmer swam to their predicted best which had never been before and it gave our physiology colleagues a very good jobs for the English Olympics which came next because the English wanted to know why our swimmers were doing so well uh and partly was because they didn't get subjected to uh fatigue induced impaired performance um by changing their training program so all of these issues um come together with this Persistence of of antigen and control of that antigen uh epstar virus as you know gets integrated into the DNA of cells uh and it should stay there and the tea cells are critical for that uh with Spike protein uh they should never it should never uh be expressed systemically and should never um have a persistence uh of expression but in some people of course it is and they're the ones prone to developing these fatigue illnesses so you're going to be getting in and dat with the emails from Olympic committees from around the world now Robert asking for your assistance I'm sure I'm sure about that all that work's been published a couple of years back and and sadly our competitors know about it so um so this means that basically everyone has been exposed to Epstein bar virus just that some people managed to eliminate it and some people don't exactly uh 80% of people um with the the athletes uh was pretty much 95% of the athletes uh had been exposed had Mar a IG antibody and this is the interesting thing that the the people who um have glandula have the epstar bar virus uh and who are prone to getting fatigue never quite make the right sort of te- cell response and I I'll give you two quick examples and these relate exactly to the situation in uh that I'm certainly seeing and has recently been published to some extent uh with long Co um if you look at antibody production the antibodies are made by a cell given the very imaginative title of a a b cell a b lymphocyte requires T lymphocytes to help them so we have these helper tea cells now it appears that there's a defect in the tea helper cells in people with long Co and this has been identified in different studies and certainly exact L the same in people with other chronic fatigue illnesses and the way the te cell deficiency expresses itself is that the B cell has markers of not working as well as it should now if you get a virus infection you make what's called an IGM antibody the IGM antibody is the first antibody but it's not a particularly High Affinity good effective antibody and so what the body does it replaces it with an IGG antibody so you go from IGM to ig now uh which is a much higher Affinity antibody and you make different subclasses of IGG and there's four sub IGG 1 2 3 and four now two things I noticed over the years looking after literally hundreds of people with chronic fatigue illnesses is that number one many of these patients never switch from the IGM to the IG anybody and so when you do a routine epstar bar virus in antibody and every Doctor Who who's watching this will know you look for IGM antibody because that tells you you've got a current infection you've just got the infection and suddenly and I I used to get a phone call every couple of weeks from General Practitioners that I work with saying hey this is confusing I got a patient who's got IGM and IG antibodies and they've had them for weeks and months and of course these are the people who have got ongoing chronic fatigue and they're not actually eliminating or controlling their epstar bar virus by virtue of the fact they're not making a particularly effective immune response and the response defect goes back to the te- cell because it's not helping the B efficient effective IGG response and so when you do a routine test the IGM which should tell you it's a recent infection but it's not it's been there for weeks or years and an IG and and the second and this is really interesting because only just a month or so ago uh this was found for long Co that in people with chronic fatigue syndrome one of the things that uh we noticed uh in our Clinic was that a number of these patients have IGG subclass deficiency particularly an igg2 subclass and it didn't initially it didn't make much sense and I started seeing both the IGM IGG confusion plus the IGG subclass deficiency both of which depend on good te cells working um now different subclasses have different jobs and so ig2 has a particular job and if it's very low then you've got a defective antibody response by virtual of this so what a wonderful study I saw I think it was about a month ago John um where they looked at IGG subclasses in Long Co and lo and behold there's a highly significant reduction across the long Co something that's never really been done for chronic fatigue syndrome uh the classics um significantly lower igg2 so exactly the same things is occurring in Long Co which brings all of these chronic fatigue illnesses collect ly together so moving on to the sort of um management strategies that we going to use Robert I mean I mean the question is of course what the heck do we do we do about this so um do we need to promote a more effective immunity within the respiratory tract and how would we do that well uh I don't have all the answers no one has all the answers but I I think that if you understand the process that's going on you can see some sense in going forward now I can run through there there are five things that that uh I do with with my my patients uh or I I'm thinking about uh the first is that we we we've developed the idea and I I've talked briefly about this with you before of what I call immune resilience and that is um and I think in the context we discussed it before I said why is it 99% of people who get long co uh inconvenience for a few days they feel a little sick a fever sore throat and then they get better whether you treat them or not but 1 or 2% get very sick H and some may die and yet you look at that Collective group and of course there are predisposing factors for getting very sick but many of them are just like you and me uh that we all look the same we think we're the same and yet we handle the virus differently and this has been an area that my group's been interested in for a long period of time and um we developed the idea that there's a thing called immune resilience and that there are ways of Shifting that immune resilience so that that 1% behaves like the 99% now that that's something that that that my own we've been certainly working on and uh not available yet but but I I think is the way one of the ways to go in the future so in other words people who uh get uh Airway infections uh handle it more effectively and don't run into the complications which obviously include long Co because of a defective immune response so I I think that's uh for the soon future not not a long term uh the second is to understand the process as being persistent antigen uh now the spike protein um is I think without our question the persistent antig both these cases uh and this is a practical area uh and there are two approaches currently uh being used um uh our friends and colleagues in America uh have developed various enzyme packages uh based on ninas which is a long St very interesting um uh orally uh an ingested enzyme that has specificity for Spike protein and I know studies are being done uh in uh in America uh using these um substances uh and we're really looking for forward to seeing uh how how they come out uh the second thing you can do about the expression of Spike protein is blocking its effect um really really exciting work has come out in the last few months about how icton works and there's a complete relook now at iaon uh about time I may add but um and I think I think one of the things that's bridged from the The Narrative that that was very unkind to iaon and the reality of science is the demonstration by uh a combination French and American groups showing that ican blocks the uh blocks Spike protein so it blocks the spike protein getting into the cell and it blocks it aggregating red cells which is the reason that you get low oxygen tension uh low oxygen saturation in patients who get significant co uh and I I was on one of the three papers that that showed that it was amazing within 24 hours of taking icton oxygen desaturation reversed now that's not suppressing inflammation and now by virtue of these studies it's shown that uh you disaggregate the cells and so the oxygen can return very quickly now I've been treating some of my own patients with moderately high dose of ivaan for a month I think I've treated five or six and every one of those has improved now that doesn't mean a thing it's not a randomized control trial uh it's it's it's what I call clinical medicine you you look uh at at a problem you say this is a process uh what logically can be done now it's not necessarily going to change all the structural damage that's been done but certainly there's been some improvement not not necessarily dramatic Improvement some improvement uh in a month or so of taking icton I I think what really is needed is people who um have access to um academic uh um academic situations where they can study and do these a randomized control of icton in Long Co properly done uh would be the most important thing that can happen uh in in Long Co um the third thing that um that I think is really really interesting in Long Co is that uh and particularly a couple Chinese groups have been promoting this and that is that people who get long Co get a disturbance of the microbiome in the bow now you might say how on Earth can that relate to something that's going on in the airway well um I was lucky enough years ago to work with John benstock in Canada uh who came up with the idea of the common mucosal system which has been underpinning my work over many years uh in humans and uh it it's just suddenly I realized that all our focus on this common mucosal system was the immune expression not the microbial drive and when you think that the the architecture of this common system that expresses control over all the different mucosal surfaces of the body the architecture involves sensor systems all the way down the gut not just the small bow with pair patches but all sorts of little patches with specialized M cells they're called over them that allows bacteria to come in and so I I think the important thing to understand here is that the commonality of mucosal immunology and expression involves the microbiomes at the different sites and so uh what happens uh in the airway by swallowing and affecting P patches can distort the microbiome in the gut and the microbiome in the gut can equally influence what's going on in the airway and I'll just give you one exciting um observation and that is a group was looking at uh in mice they were looking at csel pneumoni which is a nasty bacteria that causes pneumonia and they couldn't understand why on Earth when they gave pneumonia to the mouse by putting the the bug in the airway their microbiome changed uh this is in the gut and of course um the reason is this commonality this communication system that's so effective so what they found was and this is exactly what was found in the patients with long Co a particular type of bacteria was depressed and these bacteria well bacteria that produce short chain fatty acids butyric acid um acetic acid propionic acid those three main one two and three um carbon short chain fatty acids um now the people working with the mice and ciella said well what happens if we um reduce these bacteria uh in the gut then the the main product from the bacteria uh is things like butc acid and so they measured butc acid and found it was very low so very sens they just started feeding butc acid to these these mice and the eclips and pneumoni became much much uh improved uh didn't completely cure them but it certainly improved showing there was this connection between the two so you have two ways in which the microbiome can change the expression of any form of chronic fatigue one is by metabolic transfer of of receptors of um molecules that can move around through the blood seam and secondly by changing the cell Delivery Systems through the aggregated infid issue of P patches um sequel patches and the various ones in the column so that to me is very exciting and again if you can bear with me for 20 seconds I I'll I'll give you a very very important example many years ago Tom Baro who was the guy who discovered the uh the treatment for peptic ERS to which eradicated them uh he also was the person who um really developed the idea of feal microbiome transplants by changing the microbiome by washing you out and giving you some healthy ones um Tom Tom is uh quite extraordinary um he Tom treated patients who came to him with fatigue and non-specific gut symptoms and was surprised to find not only did the gut symptoms improve with this fmt but so did the fatigue now uh no one quite believed it so he went back 10 years later 10 years later and found something like 60% of the patients and most of those patients still had a resolution of their symptoms including their fatigue now you don't see that in chronic fatigue illnesses in other words by having a specific intervention there was some resetting of the system which we don't understand very well and so um I'm I I do a clinic in in in Tom's practice uh and uh he was is my PhD student and um he Tom uh I'm I'm actually if he's watching this or I'm going to send him an email Tom uh you've got to go back and start looking at uh how we can manipulate the microbiome and have outcomes in Long Co um so um I I think the the next thing that I think is really important so we there are the three things that I think are really important the next thing is don't feed the syndrome don't keep giving people vac who have got long Co syndrome because um you look at the literature and I I just did a review for a journal last week on a metaanalysis of all the studies done on vaccination and and long Co and it blew me away I mean it was a very well done study and and 20 there was a 20% reduction of long covid in people who have been vaccinated but I looked at the number of people was 1 million if you're looking at probably a 100,000 or a couple hundred, thousand people they get lost in they're very different they're the people who have got a fatigue illness maybe phenotype that have develop this uh in the context of the vaccine and you give them more vaccine or they get Co and they get worse this is a concept that I find nobody really or or most people have great trouble grasping I just noticed this morning while I was waiting to hear from you John that Peter McCulla wrote one of his um uh reviews and it was making exactly the same point you know you don't vaccinate people with chronic fatigue syndrome you're just putting petrol on the fire and of course yeah the final thing is you address the issues the person has um uh I noticed that some of my colleagues say a lot of these people have got in the morning uh you can't work you lose your job you're broke um you're going to have a touch of reactive depression and anxiety and um it's not that they have a primary mental health problem they've got serious responses mental health responses of a normal type to a uh to a very uh incapacitating problem so that's that's our approach anyway to uh to chronic fatigue illnesses excellent updates and uh we'll um certainly keep an eye on this one but I I think gives us real cause for for Hope here Robert that there is potential ways ahead for people that are suffering in this way yeah but for now thank you very much as always okay"
9,YVFAvoeFahI,Do Americans who questioned COVID vaccine deserve an apology? | On Balance,"A new study confirmed an increased risk of several conditions following COVID-19 vaccination. “On Balance” host Leland Vittert says  it is now clear that politics in virtue signaling took the place of science during the pandemic during the conversation about the vaccine, as those who expressed doubts risked getting canceled. Dr. Brett Giroir, who served in the Trump administration as assistant secretary of health and was the COVID-19 “testing czar,” joins “On Balance” to weigh in.

THANK YOU, GREG DRIER HERE, FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR HEALTH, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. IT'S GOOD TO SEE ADMIRAL, AS ALWAYS. UPON REFLECTION. DO A LOT OF AMERICANS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE VACCINE DESERVE AN APOLOGY. ABSOLUTELY. I I BELIEVE THEY WE APPROACH THIS. HAVE TO BE OPEN WITH PEOPLE. WE KNEW VERY EARLY ON THAT THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN THE HEART INFLAMMATION MYOCARDITIS MUCH MORE WITH A COUPLE OF AT VERSUS PFIZER. BUT THIS VERY LARGE STUDY OF ABOUT 100 MILLION PEOPLE SHOWS THAT THERE ARE RARE NEUROLOGICAL EFFECTS. THERE ARE RARE IMMUNE EFFECTS AND THERE ARE THE HEART INFLAMMATION AND THESE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS. WE HAVE TO BE OPEN WITH PEOPLE THAT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE 7 YEARS OLD OR 75? YEAH. IT AND THAT RISK YOU SHOULD BE GETTING THE BOOSTERS. BUT IF YOU'RE 25 UNHEALTHY, PARTICULARLY A MALE. AND YOU HAD COVID BEFORE THAT RISK OF MYOCARDITIS IS ABOUT THE SAME OR MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN YOUR RISK OF HAVING A SERIOUS OUTCOME. SO YES, PEOPLE DESERVE AN APOLOGY. I OPEN, HONEST SCICIENTIFC DISCUSSION WAS CRUSHED. AND EVEN I MYSELF, I HAD A BAND BECAUSE I SIMPLY STATED THE FACT PROVEN BY DATA THAT THOSE WHO ARE NATURALLY IMMUNE WHO HAD COVID SHOULD NOT LOSE THEIR JOBS SHOULD NOT NEED PASSPORT SHOULD NOT MEET OTHER THINGS BECAUSE THEY WERE EQUALLY MUNIZ. THOSE WHO GOT THE VACCINE AND THE DELTA FATE STUNNING TO ME ALWAYS THE BANNING AND SORT OF THE THE STIFLING OF FREE SPEECH BECAUSE IT WAS THE ID IDEAS MORE SOMEHOW SCARY TO THE ORTHODOX. YOU'RE SOMEHOW TOOK AWAY THE POWER OF THE OF THE INSTITUTIONS. TO THAT I WAS SO MUCH TRUST LOST IN IN OUR INSTITUTIONS, IN PUBLIC HEALTH. CDC AND NIH SEEMED TO JUST BE DOUBLING DOWN IN THEIR ARROGANCE. NOPE, WE WERE WRONG. KNOW. WE WERE COMPLETELY RIGHT. PROBLEM? WHY DO YOU THINK THEY REFUSE TO LEARN AND APOLOGIZE TO WHAT IS ALWAYS A PRETTY FORGIVING AMERICAN PUBLIC? YOU KNOW, I I THINK THERE'S SOME COLLEGE E THERE BECAUSE ONE OF THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF OF OF BEING A PHYSICIAN, AS I AM TO BE HONEST WITH YOUR PATIENT AND TO RESPECT THEIR AUTONOMY, YOU PROVIDE THE BEST INFORMATION YOU CAN AND YOU LET THEM MAKE A DECISION. WE'RE NOT IN A PATERNALISTIC SOCIETY WHERE WE FORCE PEOPLE TO HAVE AN OPERATION OR FORCE PEOPLE TO TAKE VACCINES. WE GIVE THEM THE INFORMATION. AND THAT IS I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON THAT PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS NEED TO LEARN. GET BACK TO BASICS. AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SMART. THEY CAN HANDLE THE TRUTH. DON'T TRY TO WHITEWASH INTERCOURSE PEOPLE DOCTOR FAUCI CLEARLY NUMBER OF OCCASIONS AND LET AMERICANS MAKE THEIR OWN DECISION. I WASN'T. AND I WAS SURPRISED O LEARN THAT IT WAS FORMER FDA COMMISSIONER, BUT WHO WAS THEN A BOARD MEMBER OF PFIZER GETTING THE BAND FOR SIMPLY SYING THAT NATURAL IMMUNITY IS POWERFUL. THAT'S HOW DEEP IN CORRUPT THE SYSTEM YEAH, I REMEMBER THOSE TIMES. THEY WERE WILD MEMOIR OF THE PANDEMIC. IS YOUR BOOK AND I THINK IT'S REALLY THAT YOU GO INTO THESE ISSUES. YOU DEAAL WITTHEM. HONESTLY, YOU'VE BEEN ONE OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. I THINK WE HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY, HEY, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW, WHICH UNFORTUNATELY CAME VERY DIFFICULT TO SO MANY TO SAY.

10,zQdzb57fi1o,Video: Broken Arrow family blames COVID vaccine for daughter’s death,A Broken Arrow family blames the COVID vaccine for their 18-year-old daughter's death.,2024-02-20,159628,6299,4567,UCL3kHlUwZr0fXFODgfGVp2A," and tonight we are hearing from a broken arrow family who blames the covid vaccine on their 18-year-old daughter's death thanks so much for joining us I'm Sarah Whitley and I'm Shay Rousy they tell me they faced challenges trying to get their daughter trista's medical records and get her story out there I'm looking into their concerns and what the medical community is saying about vaccine reactions in My Fox 23 investigation she was just a really funny girl and she worked really hard she was a little Spitfire she was not really afraid of of anyone or anything Trista was a beautiful beautiful girl more full of life and joy than anybody I've ever known that's how Taylor and Alan Martin described their daughter Trista she graduated from Broken Arrow High School in 2022 that summer she was promoted to a management position at a local Broms she walked her dogs and worked out with her older sister she had plans to go to college and had a heart for helping others after she passed we found a bucket list that she had made when she was 16 yeah adopt a teenager number 28 number 29 be a foster parent number 27 be a mother that one gets me out cut punch dreams that will never come true Trista died November 9th 2022 12 days after her parents believe she got her second covid vaccine they found her vaccination card from her first appointment in her purse it shows she received the first fizer shot July 20th of that year her parents had no idea while Trista still lived at home as an 18-year-old she decided it was time to get her own doctor and make her own medical decisions and so what did she say she was making the appointment for um she said she was just going in for a checkup into like a established care and she didn't tell you after that first appointment that she had gotten the covid vaccine you learned that later right yeah okay we learned that in the hospital the day she died the Martins say they were not against the vaccine at the time but with it being new and having some immunity from experiencing covid they felt their family didn't need it he just woke up on that morning November 9th and said I'm having trouble breathing she was at a friend's house um she I'm having trouble breathing and my whole entire body hurts and she just went to go try and lay down she thought she could like sleep it off she was tough thought she was just getting sick or something um and then her sister went to check on her and couldn't get her to wake up and that's when they they called me and I rushed over there and by the time I got there she was no longer breathing and they had to start CPR and it was complete shock nothing nothing that nothing prior to that said she was going to be dead nothing that had to be so hard performing CPR on you it is something I wish on no one I mean you you you cannot imagine it's and especially to performing CPR and it not helping you know I mean it was it's something that will never leave me at the hospital trista's Health continued to decline there were so many people and they were all trying the best they could I mean St Francis they were amazing they really were they they had the like the heads of every department down there they had people on the phone that weren't at work that day trying to figure out what was going on I just couldn't he said well I don't know what's causing it but you know her her kidneys are failing they said her toxicology had come back clean she tested negative for Co they didn't know what was going on but all of her organs were shutting down her heart was swollen and they were putting in a lot of fluids but nothing was coming out he said cuz if we do CPR on her again it's it itself is going to kill her um because we found out later that it had they had to continue CPR in the ambulance she crashed multiple times on the way to the hospital and someone coming asking you know make a you have to make a decision whether to let your child die or not and I mean it is it's unreal like it's just it's unreal of course we were like no we're not just going to make her you know please continue to try but you don't kill her but yeah but if if she does start to crash and I mean we will let her go so 50:5 she was gone it was it's it's the worst thing in the entire world I remember thinking you know okay what do I have to do I have to I have to hold her hand cuz I'm not going to get to do that ever again I'm going to kiss her forehead I got to give her a hug I got smell her hair cuz whatever you need to get done you got to do it right now cuz it's your last shot was it at that time that you've learned that she had taken the covid vaccine um it was actually on our way upstairs to the ICU one of her friends said I think I should probably tell you guys this you know she got the covid vaccine and she told us not to tell you and and yeah and we were just kind of like you know I wish she would have done that or I wish she would have told us or you know anything there's no way but it was like surely that that's that's was our initial thought is there's no way that this is what's doing this this the whole world they pushing this shot on everybody there's no way this is what did it a couple of weeks after trista's passing they say they started researching covid vaccine reactions came together and said I I think this might be what killed her this is we started finding more people and everything everything that we would search that would come back that would be what was coming back things they said in the hospital things we knew uh just from what kind of things well the swollen heart the myocarditis um the fail elevated um uh blood glucose levels when she was not by diabetic cuz her glucose level was yeah 610 610 yeah and she was diab not diabetic at all yeah it's just her Organ Stop working yeah multiple they could not figure out multiple system organ failure in a way it was a little comforting to know that we weren't alone but at the same time it was terrifying and yeah cuz it's I mean it's they're still pushing it the CDC now recommends covid-19 vaccination for everyone ages 6 months and older in the United States here's the vaccine information statement given to patients by their healthc care provider when they get the shot on the back section four details risk of a vaccine reaction from pain swelling or redness where shot is given to myocarditis inflammation of the heart muscle or pericarditis inflammation of the lining outside the heart seen rarely but observed most commonly in males 12 to 39 years old with the chance of this occurring described as low the statement goes on to warn of a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction other Serious injury or death when I reached out to fizer they sent me the following statement that reads in part quote fizer recognizes that there may be rare reports of my carditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination according to the CDC and other health authorities this is an extremely rare side effect and only an exceedingly small number of people will experience it after vaccination they added it quote retains a positive benefit risk profile the hard part is if you are the person who gets vaccinated or your child gets vaccinated and there is an adverse event a bad reaction u a heart issue or death that hurts oh absolutely any any childhood death is a tragedy you know none of us like thinking about that or you know as a parent I can't even imagine that the pain of losing a child I turned to Dr Dale bratzler for answers to be clear he never treated Trista Martin nor reviewed her medical records you may remember he served as the chief covid officer for U health throughout the pandemic and is the current dean of U's Hudson College of Public Health some people do get myocarditis in the vast majority it tends to be M most people actually don't have to be hospitalized a typical heart muscle is pictured up top in this image from the Mayo Clinic on the bottom is myocarditis the inflammation can reduce the heart's ability to pump blood and can cause chest pain shortness of breath and Rapid or irregular heart rhythms it's an autoimmune reaction where their body develops antibodies that attack the heart muscle and cause this inflammation of the heart or called myoc itis um um there's no way to predict it to my knowledge at this point uh it is not common it's actually pretty rare but with any thing that happens with the heart it can be very serious obviously Dr bratzler says viruses like covid-19 are one of the main causes of myocarditis and that you're more likely to get it from the virus itself than from the vaccine he shared a comprehensive article with me published in circulation research and May of 2023 it was funded partly by the National Institutes of Health the American Heart Association and the Mayo Clinic it found 150 cases of myocarditis reported for every 100,000 people with covid versus one to 10 cases reported for every 100,000 people who received the vaccine I've highlighted before that there are probably medications that people take as a matter of routine that have if you look at the side effect and complication profile are much greater than most of the vaccines that are currently recommended you still feel that the covid infection does more harm to someone than a covid vaccine and that is why you recommend people get vaccinated I still do yes the Martin say not enough information is out there about adverse reactions they point to recent fiser commercials this one has the words do not attempt on the bottom of the screen as Martha Stewart sharpens a sword she promotes getting a CO booster shot there's no warning about side effects or adverse reactions from the shot by comparison other commercials for drugs made by fizer and other manufacturers spend most of the time on the benefits of the drug and another portion on possible side effects and those who shouldn't take it the Martin say they hit one roadblock after another trying to get trista's medical records from her doctor let to um stop calling yeah stop calling your daughter wasn't a patient here and so we found uh the text messages in her telephone uh confirming the appointments and and part of the of the discovery that we got there is a blank page where they she went in on October 28th 12 days before she died they've had little luck on social media as well we can't post this our story anywhere except for Twitter because it gets taken down get taken downb Facebook takes it down you get put in Facebook jail if you talk about I've had accounts removed I've had been suspended that's one of the reasons they took part in the shot dead documentary that explores adverse reactions and deaths reportedly from the covid vaccine you called me mister can I take the boys to eat and play basketball I said yes ma'am of course she took them to the part they got off the truck and took off running across the parking lot and he collapsed I believe the autopsy is conclusive for the cause of death being covid-19 vaccine induced myocarditis the produc ERS tell me Facebook blocked their documentary and YouTube took it down you can watch it by typing shot dead. Org the Martins also tell me it took eight months to get the autopsy it lists complications with trista's heart her lungs and her blood in specific medical terms part of her medical history shows recent coronavirus vaccination it does not show myocarditis as the parents say they heard doctors talking about in the hospital ultimately it shows trista's manner of death to be undetermined [Music] determined it's really weird to think that that's your your child in there but we come in and talk to her and you know say things and she didn't like to be cold we have her wrapped up in a blanket that she made she made this blanket and homech um Apple t-shirts and stuff they find comfort in trista's room and strength to be her voice to warn others about their experience [Music] now the Martins have a website Justice for Trista tocom and they do have three lawsuits in the works now I also reached out to the Tulsa health department and the American Heart Association locally they do send their condolences of course to the Martin family as do we but they also told me they still feel the benefits of the covid vaccine outweigh the potential risks and we know there's a lot of debate surrounding this subject we were talking about it earlier the one thing I think everybody can agree on this is tragic no parent should have to go through that an 18-year-old girl so full of life yeah oh wow all right thanks so much we do have extended coverage in the story on fox23.com [Music]"
11,RRJqsK0tqc0,What COVID &#39;Vaccine&#39; Mandates?,"We're told in the media that 'vaccine' mandates are over, yet my office hears from many Australians who are refused employment or threatened with being sacked from their jobs unless they take two, sometimes three jabs. What is the current guidance on mandates in the health sector? Department of Health has no particular view and says it can be the employer's individual decision — there is no national policy or vaccine mandate in place. The Minister has not heard of anyone, including nurses, being sacked recently. 

The terms of reference inquiry for a potential COVID Royal Commission involved witnesses who gave this testimony. Despite an alarming shortage of nurses and other healthcare workers, skilled and willing staff are being rejected for their decision based on informed consent. We hear from many healthcare workers and others from across Australia who are still faced with the 'no jab, no job' discrimination to this day. 

This looks very much like the rule of ""hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil"" is being applied by the Minister and the health department. Until they take responsibility and offer a position around employers' choices over applying mandates there will continue to be a 'free for all' on the use of coercion and discrimination to the detriment of individuals and our health care services.

#davidpakmanshow #joerogan #covid",2024-02-10,107839,5735,4146,UCvixJtaXuNdMPUGdOPcY8Ag," Speaker 1: This is really painful to watch. On 
the bonus show today, we are going to talk about   the continued influence of the Joe Rogan Podcast. 
We are going to talk about how, I mean, listen,   influential is the most accurate word about the 
Joe Rogan podcast, and that's part of why this   is so painful to see. On a recent episode, Joe 
Rogan, on whose show I've appeared twice, just   casually said, you know, it's crazy how many young 
people got vaccinated and then died suddenly.   This is one of the most, what's the word? Is 
it destructive? Is it pernicious? Is it just   dishonest? Is it inaccurate? Is it depressing? 
What misstatements and inaccuracies about the   Covid vaccine? I'm going to play it for you. Then 
we're going to talk about it. Listen to this.  Speaker 3: This is how many people 
were promoters of the vaccine,   then died suddenly. It's crazy how many young 
people just died in their sleep after they took   it. And everybody's like nothing to see here.
Speaker 4: Sudden adult death syndrome.  Speaker 3: Yeah. Just died suddenly. You ever 
go to the died suddenly Instagram page like,   Holy. There's so many and so many people like 
talking about people who are, you know, anti   Darwin anti-vaxxers and then then you're dead. 
Sorry if you bought, you bought into the wrong   bullshit. But that's, you know, if you really want 
to get cruel, that's Darwinism. Do you not know   they lie by now do you not. Are you not aware of 
the opioid crisis? You're not aware of vioxx? Not   aware of the very like to 25% of all FDA approved 
drugs that get pulled? It's one out of four and   you're like, really? You're an anti-vax really 
reality. What are you, a conspiracy theorist? You   fool. Darwin's going to do its work with you. 
You're modifying your genes, you idiot. Like,   what are you doing? What are you doing? You're 
just going to trust Pfizer. Well, they do support   Anderson Cooper. Brought to you by Pfizer.
Speaker 1: Oh boy. Oh my goodness. Where do   you even start with this? Where do you even start? 
With the amount of damage that is being done here?   You know, every single one of these claims is 
wrong. First of all, the idea that the vaccine   modifies your genes. It's not true. It's been said 
so many times. It's been explained no matter what   sort of medical expert you have, explain it. Some 
of these folks just don't want to accept it or   believe it. He talks about the movie died suddenly 
and the Facebook page died suddenly. That is a   propaganda film, widely debunked and completely 
non empirically based. Which features a bunch of   headlines that you can find on Google about people 
that died and then suggests this never used to   happen. Healthy young adults never used to die. 
And it's happening now at a greater rate than it   used to. And it's because of the vaccine and the 
film has gotten. At one point it was more than 20   million views. It's so hard to know because it's 
on different platforms. And yeah, tens of millions   of views is fair to say. And, when you look into 
the film, you find that, number one, the rate of   these, deaths hasn't increased other than by 
the degree to which we know people have died   from Covid. We also have investigated some of the 
specific people that died suddenly. They weren't   even vaccinated. So some of the people featured 
in the film were not actually vaccinated with   the Covid vaccine. So total propaganda film that 
is leading people dangerously astray. And then,   you know, there's always some, as Sam Harris 
said to me last week in our interview or the   week last week, you. Sometimes these conspiracy 
theories have some grain of truth. And the grain   of truth here is pharmaceutical companies 
have lied and pharmaceutical companies have   done bad things. Joe Rogan mentions vioxx and 
he mentions opioids. It's really important to   understand that these are dramatically different 
sorts of medications. Vioxx was an Nsaid designed   to treat pain and inflammation, marketed for 
osteoarthritis and for some acute pain conditions,   and it was withdrawn from the market because there 
were concerns it would increase heart attack and   stroke if you used it for a long period of time. 
Okay. The opioid crisis. Opioids are an entire   class of prescription pain relievers. You've got 
your oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine and others.   The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. They 
are known for pain relieving effects, but huge   addiction, potential overdose. We, know about the 
Sackler family and their, deliberate, deception   when it comes to clinical trials, side effects 
and risk for addiction, etc.. Vaccines are meant   to help the body generate immunity without getting 
the disease. That's the idea. And vaccines are one   of the most effective ways to prevent diseases, 
including diseases that can cause death, as well   as diseases that are that are less likely to cause 
death. So when you look at the risk profiles with   vioxx, the risk was related to cardiovascular 
events, and it was significant enough to say,   we've got to withdraw this from the market. With 
opioids, you've got addiction risk, dependency,   overdose, death risk. These are significant, and 
it has generated a public health crisis. Vaccines   are low risk. Most side effects are extremely 
mild and temporary. Even the more rare serious   side effects almost always resolve on their 
own. When we've talked about the myocarditis,   pericarditis, and do you sometimes get a serious 
adverse event? Are there a few people that have   died from serious vaccine side effects? From 
just about any vaccine? Yes. But the point is,   you don't suspend an incredibly successful 
and effective public health campaign because   any intervention can have these extremely rare 
side effects. You look at opioids and vioxx,   it's a completely different, situation. So anyway, 
the vioxx opioid comparisons are just absurd. It's   really sad to see Rogan go in this direction. 
And, you know, I don't know who people write to   me. They go, David, you know, if only he would 
allow you back on, you could set them straight.   First of all, it's not about setting people 
straight. I don't know if he would ever have   me back on. I would appear anytime. That's what 
I've said. And, that that's where I will leave it"

lot of excitement right now around the record speed
vaccines for COVID-19, some of which are already
starting distribution in parts of the world. But given that these are mRNA vaccines are relatively new technology that has not been widely used before. We wanted to explain how
they work and what happens to your body from the moment
that needle touches your skin. - Like vaccines, we're used
to seeing these vaccines will be injected into the
upper muscle of your arm but unlike typical vaccines which introduce inactive or
weakened forms of a virus, these will release genetic
material called messenger RNA. So what exactly does this mRNA do? Well in a regular cell of your body, you have DNA inside of the
nucleus and this DNA stores all the information and
instructions important to the functioning of your cells your body and ultimately makes you you. Inside your cell is machinery
that reads through your DNA and transcribes it into mRNA which then leaves the nucleus
and goes into your cytoplasm. And it's here that the ribosomes and yourselves read the RNA and depending on the specific code to
build a series of amino acids which fold in on
themselves to make proteins which keep you alive and functioning. This process is known as translation. In fact, it's this process
that viruses take advantage of in the first place. They insert their own
genetic information into you and then your cell machinery
unwittingly starts taking that information and building proteins to help create more viruses. - So back to the needle, the mRNA that is being injected into you from the vaccine also
carries genetic instructions but in this case, it's only coding for one small part of the virus instead of the whole thing. You've probably seen SARS
CoV2 represented like this with the spikes on it. And it's this spike protein
which on its own is harmless that the vaccines mRNA codes for. The mRNA makes its way into
the cytoplasm of your cells where the ribosomes read the information and start to create the spikeD proteins. Once the protein is made, it goes to the cell membrane
and then your cell breaks down and destroys the injected
mRNA instructions. - So what good does having a
tiny fragment of viral spike in your body do? Well, it gives your body
and more importantly, your immune system, a preview
of what the virus looks like without causing disease. Suddenly your antibodies
will notice it and go, well, this doesn't belong here which triggers an immune
response to recognize and prepare your body for the real thing without ever having to come in contact with the actual virus itself. Your immune system
essentially gets a headstart by creating powerful
antibodies that can neutralize and kill the real virus. And this antibody memory
is stored in your B cells so that if you're ever
infected in the future with the SARS CoV 2 virus, your
body now has the upper hand. This is known as an
adaptive immune response. Your body has already seen
these spike proteins before and therefore it already knows what to do. Essentially, these mRNA
vaccines allow your body to protect itself from a future infection without ever having to
risk the consequences of getting the COVID-19. - So why haven't mRNA
vaccines been used before? While they are relatively new researchers have actually been experimenting
with them for decades but in the past they've
been very unstable. Enzymes in your body would
break down the mRNA quickly so they needed to be packaged well. The ones being released
now have the mRNA encased in lipid nanoparticles
which essentially protect the mRNA from being degraded. Since there are more unstable
than other types of vaccines, they have to be kept cold. For example, the Pfizer vaccine it has to be stored at
minus 70 degrees Celsius and at normal refrigerated temperatures can only last five days. Of course, a global pandemic
has certainly increased the funding and resources going towards these types of vaccines which has helped to accelerate their development. - What makes these vaccines so appealing is that unlike other vaccines, they can be made in a lab with
readily available materials and actually made much quicker
than other types of vaccines. Instead of fully developing
non-infectious viruses and then injecting them,
these mRNA vaccines can sort of pass many hurdles
by using your own body in an ingenious way. It's also far more cost-effective
to create mRNA molecules rather than the proteins themselves and also a lot more scalable which is helpful when we are
in a global pandemic waiting for a vaccine. - So is it safe? And given that it's a
relatively new technology, should you be concerned at all? Well, that's what these initial
trial stages have been for. Not only to test whether or not they work and cause immunity but to make sure they have minimal side effects. As of now around 70,000 people have been given these vaccines with no serious concerns, a caveat being that the full research hasn't been published yet
as of recording this video. But it's important to remember that just because it's safe doesn't mean there won't be any soreness or pain. Some recipients did report aches and pains and as of now you'll
need to receive two shots to ensure efficacy. I saw a really great analogy
by the professor Shane Crotty who works in vaccine research and he said, ""It's not unlike going to
the gym and getting exercise ""and really sore muscles. ""A bit of pain can be a positive sign ""that good things are happening. ""Sometimes you have to earn your immunity, ""just like you have to earn
those biceps you wanted so bad."" - We know you've been asking
about these vaccines a lot, we've also had our questions. So we hope that all this
information was useful and concise and educational for you 'cause it does sort of help make things seem less unknown and scary
in a very strange time. - Thank you all so much for watching. If you want to hear more about vaccines, our podcast is on YouTube. You can check that out, we

16,k1ZwC4mhcxA,Health expert weighs in after study links COVID-19 vaccine to slight increase in some disorders,"A study from the Global Vaccine Data Network has found a link between COVID vaccines and a slight increase in heart, brain and blood disorders. Dr. Matthew Sims with Corewell Health, joins CBS News Detroit to weigh in on the study.",2024-02-24,170,5,3,UCXVcNr1VztNcc0YVTJAmpKw," to get through this brief little moment, right? We'll get back on track. Yes, sounds good. Thank you, Stacey. Well, there is a major study on COVID vaccines that has found a link between some of those vaccines and a small increase in heart brain and blood disorders. This is according to a study by the global vaccine Data Network. The vaccines connected to those disorders include Pfizer, The organization says that this is the largest vaccine study to date. Still another study finds COVID vaccines prevented an estimated year that they were available. So joining us now is Dr. Matthew Sims. He is the director of infectious disease research at Craughwell Health. Thank you for being here with us. Happy to be here. So this was a big question that a lot of people had with the rollout of the vaccines. A lot of people even now to this day still debating the safety of the vaccines. What do you make of these findings in these studies? You know, I think we have to be very careful not to blow this study out of proportion. The numbers of increased conditions that they found like Gene Barry syndrome, etc. were very small. You know, you're talking it like 0.8 per million which means for the 99 million people you know across the study less than 100 cases compared to the number of people who were saved by the COVID vaccine. In addition, one of the things looked at these particular conditions again is because COVID itself causes them. And if you look at the amount occur in people who get COVID, it's much higher than the numbers found in this study. The other thing to know is several of these were linked really specifically to one vaccine or another. But especially the AstraZeneca vaccine, as you mentioned was the one that had the you have the transverse myelitis link that that vaccine's not available in the United States right now. It was here for research purposes. They were trying to study it. But that's not one of the ones in the U.S.. The other thing to realize is one of the things they said is that they couldn't find a consistent link with every dose of the vaccine. So they saw it with some doses, not with others which makes it is necessarily from the vaccine, these sort of conditions. A lot of them are caused by viral infections and you know, other viral infections in the community could cause increases at different times of the year . Yeah. And the researchers even said that the association between the vaccine and those adverse listing is actually may not possibly the root cause of some of these conditions. I know that's confusing for a lot of people because a lot about taking it in general. How do people need to process this information? You know, the thing to know is that as I said, if this risk is really there, it's incredibly small. Right. Over the you know, billions of doses have been given out at this point. It's estimated that, you know, population has gotten at least one dose of these vaccines. These are incredibly, incredibly small risks compared If you remember what COVID did when nobody was vaccinated and nobody had any immunity to it. You know the number of deaths, the number of other conditions that followed COVID, the number of people who got long COVID syndrome and are still suffering from it it dwarfs these minor things. So the thing to remember is the COVID vaccine is incredibly protective against severe consequences of COVID and it saved a lot of lives as you mentioned in the beginning. It did We lost millions of people during that time when we did get the rollout of a new vaccine. Obviously in this case there was a race to get something out there to try to protect people. Is there often some risk associated with a new vaccine unique to the COVID 19 vaccine? No, it's absolutely not unique. In fact, if you remember back in the 70s the swine flu vaccine which got rolled out exact concern about Guillain-Barre syndrome. They thought they saw a spike in the number of cases of embrace syndrome. To this day people still worry about that because the flu vaccine But when they went back and looked you know, there are some studies that actually say that while, you know, there was a small risk from the vaccine for Guillain-Barre, it actually Guillain-Barre than the increased risk because flu itself can give you an array at a much higher rate than the vaccine could. Similar to COVID vaccines. Right. While you may see an occasional issue with somebody having a side effect, the the sheer amount of disease that it prevents both COVID itself and the associated conditions is Yeah, something you mentioned earlier sticks out. You know you look at the risks here, a lot of people talking about this now but you also put into the equation the risk of exposure to the virus itself. When you balance it out that way, it leaves you with that conclusion. Absolutely. I'll tell you, I've gotten you the first vaccines back when they first came out. I couldn't wait to get my first booster. I have gotten every single booster as they've come out. know, this is a vaccine that I have you know, can easily say I can stand fully behind And I've gotten each one of them. So with that. Okay. So in closing, you don't feel like there's an immediate risk for people and there's no cause for alarm? Absolutely not. You know, I still recommend getting the COVID vaccine and it's still helping people. All right. Dr. Matthew Sims with Cornwall Health."

SO EVERYTHING S  POTENTIAL RISK. THE PROBLEM IS  WHAT IS THE RISK OF THE THING  THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO  PREVENT?  >> AND THAT'S WHAT COMES INTO  PLAY. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU  HAVE A FOR PARENTS, RIGHT, IF  YOU'VE GOT A HEALTHY 3  YEAR-OLD WHO'S HAD COVID 4  TIMES ALREADY. WELL, THEN I'D  SAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE  BENEFIT IS THAT YOU'RE GOING  TO GET GETTING THAT VACCINE  TODAY. BUT IF YOU TELL ME THAT  YOU GOT A, YOU KNOW, 84  YEAR-OLD IN A NURSING HOME  SOMEHOW CAME OUT OF A TIME  MACHINE AND IS NOW ENTERING  THE WORLD IN 2024, HE'S NEVER  HAD A COVID VACCINE. WELL FOR  THAT FIRST TONIGHT SAY, WELL,  ABOUWHETR VID CCINE TO THINK  MAKES SENSE FOR THEM.  >> SINCE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC  BEGAN IN MARCH OF 2020, NEARLY  7 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE DIED  ACROSS THE GLOBE FROM  COVID-19. THAT INCLUDES MORE  THAN 1 MILLION PEOPLE IN  AMERICA. IT'S ALSO ESTIMATED  THAT 71% OF THE WORLD'S  POPULATION HAS RECEIVED AT  LEAST ONE DOSE OF THE COVID-19  AND AS YOU HEARD DOCTOR  KANTOR, THEY'RE SAYING, YOU  KNOW, HIS BIGGEST TAKEAWAY IN  MIND TO HAVE TO DO IN THE  STORY WAS THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU  HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR OWN  PERSONAL RISK AND WHETHER OR  NOT YOU HAVE ANY ANY  CONTRIBUTING FACTORS THAT  COULD LEAD TO, YOU KNOW, SO  ND OF COMPLICATIONS.

20,rNaIMC4XMhc,Novak Djokovic breaks silence over Covid vaccine refusal - BBC News,"Tennis star Novak Djokovic has said he would rather miss out on future trophies than be forced to get a Covid vaccine.

Speaking exclusively to the BBC, he said he should not be associated with the anti-vax movement, but supported an individual's right to choose.

The Serbian was asked if he would sacrifice taking part in competitions such as Wimbledon and the French Open over his stance on the vaccine.

COVID Vaccine Hesitancy and Risk of a Traffic Crash 

https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(22)00822-1/fulltext

Background

Coronavirus disease (COVID) vaccine hesitancy,

is a reflection of psychology that might also contribute to traffic safety. 

So
People that take covid vaccines are the sort of people who have less traffic accidents

People who do not take covid vaccines are the sort of people who have more traffic accidents

Methods
Population-based longitudinal cohort analysis of adults

Determined COVID vaccination status from electronic medical records

Traffic crashes requiring emergency medical care

Subsequently identified accidents from all (178) hospitals

One month follow-up

Results, (2021)

N = 11,270,763

Total traffic accidents, 6,682

Unvaccinated, 16%

Vaccinated, 84%

Unvaccinated individuals

1,682 traffic crashes (25%)

Equal to a 72% increased relative

Confidence interval, (95%) 63% to 82%

(P less than 0.001)

What about

Socioeconomic status

Alcohol

Sleep apnea

Diabetes

Depression

Dementia

Hypertension

Cancer

Covid infection

Equal to a 48% increase after adjustment

Confidence interval, (95%) 40% to 57%

(P less than 0.001)

The increased risks extended across the spectrum of crash severity

Results similar for Pfizer, Moderna, or other vaccines

Conclusions

These data suggest that COVID vaccine hesitancy is associated with significant increased risks of a traffic crash. 

An awareness of these risks might help to encourage more COVID vaccination.

Factors

Distrust of government

Belief in freedom

Misconceptions of everyday risks

Faith in natural protection

Antipathy toward regulation

Chronic poverty

Exposure to misinformation

Political identity

Negative past experiences

Limited health literacy

Social networks, misgivings around public health guidelines

Primary care physicians who wish to help patients avoid becoming traffic statistics, 

could take the opportunity to stress standard safety reminders such as wearing a seatbelt, obeying speed limits, and never driving drunk

Paramedics, should be aware that unvaccinated patients are overrepresented in the aftermath of a traffic crash.

Driver insurance policies in the future

Together, the findings suggest that unvaccinated adults need to be careful indoors with other people and outside with surrounding traffic.

But

Unvaccinated in Canada could not use, planes, trains, buses

Also
https://covid19-sciencetable.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Science-Brief_Vaccines-in-Essential-Workers_20210423_published2.pdf

Vaccinated more likely to work remotely in Ontario in 2021

‘Essential workers’ had lower vaccination rates 

(several pile ups in ice and bad weather)

Over 65s do not commute 

So
Staying at home reduces the chances of being in an accident

Invalid title

Patient in emergency department as a driver, passenger, or pedestrian (codes V00-V69)

Total = 6,682

Drivers, 2,856
Passengers, 1,189
Pedestrians, 2,637
(Table 3 of the study)

(Therefore, unvaccinated pedestrians more likely to be in an accidents that vaccinated pedestrians)

People were considered unvaccinated for the first 14 days after vaccination

Given the study only lasted a month, this is half of the time.

So how many casualties were misclassified?

If 602 of the 6,682 were misclassified,

Any difference between the two groups would vanish (Igor Chudov)

https://igorchudov.substack.com/p/the-unvaccinated-had-more-car-crashes

Deaths at Scene

Excluded

42 deaths at scene

8 deaths were included

(550 people were actually admitted to hospital)

Therefore 84% of death outcomes ignored

This also excluded all sudden deaths that resulted in an accident

What about people not in the system

Dr Clare Craig
https://twitter.com/ClareCraigPath/status/1602650802186772481

Unvaccinated typically underestimated

Therefore

Rate of incidence of anything overestimated in the unvaccinated

Rate of incidence of anything underestimated in the vaccinated

E.g. Covid cases, hospitalisations, deaths, car accidents

Or indeed, anything else

Forest plot

In all subgroups the risk is increased by the same amount (possible systematic bias)

Source data not available to public

The study dataset is held securely in coded form at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES).",2022-12-17,542627,29915,12227,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg, a warm welcome to today's Talk Saturday the 17th of December now I'd been reading about this article in the popular press and on various social media places about a study which purported to show that people that were unvaccinated against covid-19 were 72 percent more likely to be involved in a traffic accident now I just assumed that this was a joke um but it actually turns out it's not when I actually looked into it it turns out this is actually based on something that's purported to be a scientific paper and here it is it comes largely from workers in Toronto and it's published in the American Journal of Medicine and it's a full scientific paper absolutely quite uh incredible and uh for example here here there pointing out that uh people that are of uh no vaccine get more accidents than people that have had the uh the vaccine over a period of a month um this is not a joke this is actually purported to be a genuine scientific paper and I really feel that these authors and the American Journal of Medicine have done themselves no favor at all with with this now they do claim of course that the uh the study is is a correlation they're not saying it's causal but there is there is a but here because they actually put forward this diagram as well here uh where they actually point out potential causal mechanism and I'm not going through this at all it's quite weak but while they actually say um that this is a correlation study they actually do try and give some potential causal mechanisms now it's a population study over 11 million people quite how they got the data I don't know you and I can't get access to the data of course it's not public domain data but they give these reasons why it's good data and that they attest to the validity of this data so I think we can accept that but um pity that was not open to a public access there for peer review um talking about peer review it really makes me wonder what the peer reviewers were thinking when they looked at this article but there's a few factors so 72 percent more likely to have an accident if you are unvaccinated in other words vaccination against covert is protecting against uh against uh accidents according to this this line of thinking but there's a few things to look at and I'm going to look at this in quite a lot of detail but not in this short video this is just a bit of an introduction so in Canada in 2021 when this data is referring to uh people that were unvaccinated weren't allowed to use public transport a lot of public transport in Canada anyway Planes Trains buses so they were forced to rely on cars so they were going to be traveling more and the unvaccinated it turns out in onto Ontario were more likely to work sorry the vaccinated in Ontario were more likely to work remotely so people that were unvaccinated were more likely to have to travel in to work and again I've got evidence for this that's in the description so for example over 65s had a very low accident rate but of course they don't uh commute that they don't commute to work now it turns out that this data and they look at over 6 000 accidents includes drivers passengers and pedestrians so are they seriously trying to make the point that covered vaccination protects protest pedestrians against road traffic accidents it really is a bitter is a bit bizarre and there was nearly as many pedestrians involved in the study as there were drivers as well as passengers um now they they classed people unvaccinated for 14 days after the vaccination but the study only lasted for one month so so if people if people had been vaccinated uh there were classed as unvaccinated for 14 days after after the vaccination now um this this could completely all you would need is about six like most 700 people to have been misclassified out of this over six thousand and that were completely invalidate this data utterly completely invalidate the results another thing that's slightly more disturbing really deaths at seen when people died at the scene were excluded and this actually works out that it excludes 84 percent of the deaths in the study now it some people might think it's a bit convenient that they uh excluded deaths at the scene because sometimes the road traffic accident is caused by a medical emergency so for example just say for example if someone a driver had myocarditis for example and that caused a spontaneous ventricular fibrillation a cardiac arrest and that will cause the accident and the person would be dead at scene that their body May well be traumatized but the cause of death would actually have occurred before the accident because of the cardiac arrest they were excluded from the study completely excluded from the study I'll leave you to draw your own conclusions from that now under vaccinated percentage in populations is usually uh underestimated so unvaccinated is usually underestimated or people vaccinated normally overestimated and now that means that the rate of anything will appear higher or overestimated in people that are unvaccinated so it doesn't matter what it is if you're comparing vaccinated unvaccinated so you could have um you could say that people um people who are unvaccinated have a greater liking for porridge in the morning or whatever so because the unvaccinated percentage is usually underestimated in the vaccinated percentage is usually overestimated the rate of anything will appear higher or overestimated in the unvaccinated in this case road traffic accidents and the rate of anything will appear underestimated in the vaccinated so really uh quite a um an amusing study if it wasn't so if it wasn't so serious that this actually gets into the medical literature really is uh quite bemusing and that's just a very quick romp through that um I'll just point out some of the factors that the the authors suggested they suggested a distrusting government it might be a factor in other words people that distrusted government were more likely to be involved in road traffic accidents as well as more less likely to be vaccinated um some people might think that's offensive belief in Freedom might be a factor this awful thing this belief in Freedom Dearing me imagine believing in freedom but that might be a factor that makes people less likely to be vaccinated and more likely so people that believe in Freedom are more likely to be involved in road traffic accidents okay misconceptions of everyday risk that they are uh purporting as an idea they don't talk about vaccine risk they're talking about covert risks of course uh people that have faith in natural protection are less likely to be vaccinated according to their thinking and more likely to be involved in a traffic accident faith in natural protection antipathy towards regulation chronic poverty is another Factor they uh propose again saying this makes people less likely to be vaccinated more likely to be involved in an accident exposure to misinformation political identity so are they really saying that your political identity influences your likelihood of being involved in a road traffic accident is that really what they're purporting here and this is this is in the published medical literature it really is quite incredible negative past experienced limited health literacy so all you stupid people out there who have got low uh uh health literacy it appears that you're more likely to be involved in road traffic accidents because you don't realize that when a ton and a half of metal hits your body it can do some damage it's just incredible that this has made the literature social networks misgiving around Public Health guidelines so people that have misgivings amongst Public Health guidelines really don't seem to think it's a problem to walk out in front of a car dear me primary care physicians who wish to help patients to avoid traffic accident statistics could take this opportunity they say to stress standard reminders such as wearing seat belts obeying speakers and for drinking alcohol so if you're going to drive let me give you some advice wear a seat belt don't exceed the speed limit oh and don't drink and drive groundbreaking stuff paramedics should be aware that unvaccinated patients are over represented in the aftermath of a traffic crash so all these these people are unvaccinated are a really big dangerous to paramedics here according to this thinking and they actually talk about this affecting driver insurance policies in the future so because of this groundbreaking research we now realize that people that are unvaccinated are going to covid-19 are more likely to have road traffic accidents therefore we should increase their insurance premiums are they really saying this anyway that's just a few things about that I'm going to look at it in a bit more detail because I'm aware I haven't given my full uh sort of a level of evidence so we'll be giving all the references for this but I'm going to do that as a separate video because it is quite complicated but there there we go um needless to say we don't accept the the uh this contention that uh covid-19 is uh associated with uh fairly to take covid-19 vaccines associated with increased risk of road traffic accidents and uh it's done the medical literature and The credibility of science no good at all in my view that this has been published so we'll leave that there for now um I'm going to do this in detail uh straight away while it's all still fresh in my head if you want to watch it do check out the next video for all the detail for now thank you for watching

Speaker 3: I'm going to cover it with mine.   And I'm going to tell you that I love you.
Speaker 2: Wow. What a 180 that was.  Speaker 3: I love you and I don't want to 
hurt you. I love your hand there. I want mine.  Speaker 2: Oh, that's right. Right.
Speaker 3: I love you. And I want to   bring everybody together to see they're getting 
screwed and robbed. Okay. Now, are we on the   same page with that? Yeah. Okay, now let's talk.
Speaker 2: All right. I have a lot of videotape,   and if I wanted to go into the archive, I could 
send you where I pretty much alone in media was   questioning the pharmaceutical industry and 
think people like Monsanto. I was the early   part of the century with the growers, 
right? Yeah. So I'm not the guy to hit   that for you. And you're for Monsanto.
Speaker 3: I was the vaccine shit.  Speaker 2: And I've been way 
out on a limb on that one too.  Speaker 3: You were wrong.
Speaker 2: I don't know   which one. I don't know what your stance on 
vaccines is. Why don't you tell me yours and   I'll tell you mine and we'll see who's wrong. 
They're trying to kill us. They're trying to.  Speaker 3: Yeah. That's why 
they're giving us the vaccine.  Speaker 2: I don't think they're trying.
Speaker 3: Well, they are killing us.  Speaker 2: Well, it's much more.
Speaker 3: Complicated than us.  Speaker 2: Who hates us? The 
pharmaceutical industry? No, actually.  Speaker 3: The crazy psychopath billionaires. 
Oh, boy. They hate the regular people.  Speaker 2: Okay, Bernie. So. But you're 
not one of the regular people. Look at   you. You're a southern belle. You're like in 
a Tennessee Williams play. And you're the.  Speaker 3: I've always depended 
on the kindness of strangers.  Speaker 1: All right. They're killing us. They are 
killing us. The vaccine is killing us. We really   need to take this head on, because this. This 
will not go away. This talking point will not   go away. Has even a single person died from the 
Covid vaccine? I'm open to the possibility that   someone has in the sense that when millions and 
millions and millions and hundreds of millions,   maybe billions of people get a vaccine, there are 
different adverse reactions. And could someone die   from an adverse reaction? Sure. But I've been 
looking everywhere for instances where someone   died from the Covid vaccine. I just haven't found 
a single instance. Right. We start looking into   the data. There have been rare cases of serious 
side effects. The JNJ vaccine was associated with   a rare blood clotting disorder, specifically women 
under 50. The AstraZeneca vaccine wasn't even used   in the United States associated with those issues. 
But have any actual deaths been attributed to   it? I wasn't able to find any in terms of more 
generally. There's this idea that if you're 80   and you get vaccinated and you die three months 
later, that that's a vaccine death. And a lot   of the vaccine deaths reported in the Vaya system 
are things like that. But can we attribute even a   single one to the vaccine? I haven't been able 
to find a single one with any vaccine. You can   have an anaphylactic reaction and it seems with 
the Covid vaccine, it was happening in five out   of every million doses administered. It's a severe 
allergic reaction. It can occur after a flu shot   or whatever. From what I've been able to find. 
No deaths from anaphylaxis were reported. There   were studies done of other sorts of reactions. 
The myocarditis, the pericarditis. Uncomfortable   certainly can be serious. I have been able to 
find no evidence that anybody actually died from   it. Now, you might. You might be able to find 
something. Hey, here's two people that we know   died from a reaction they had to the vaccine. 
Okay. Send it to me and I will look at that.   But Tucker Carlson pulled this as well, saying 
the vaccine could be killing thousands, hundreds   of thousands of us. I still have not been able 
to find any evidence of that. And importantly,   there have been population studies of large groups 
of people. Just here's a group of people the same   age. One group was vaccinated, one wasn't. The 
vaccinated group had a lower rate of all cause   death in the period following the vaccine. So I 
would love it if someone presented some of the   evidence. Roseanne Barr certainly didn't. Tucker 
Carlson certainly didn't when he brought it up.   If someone in the audience has the evidence, 
please send it to info at David packman.com."

to this talk Monday the 12th of February now the prime minister in my country the United Kingdom has been doing a sort of question time uh today on GB news let's go straight over to the question from a Mr John what hi rank I've got so much to say but such little time my name is John W and I'm one of the covid vaccine injured in this country I want you to look into my eyes Rush soon I can I want you to look at the pain the trauma and the regret I have in my eyes we have been left with no help at all not only am I in here that's vaccine injured there's another man over there whose life's been ruined by That covid-19 vaccine I know people who have lost legs amputations I know people with heart conditions like myself richy sunak why have I had to set up a support group in Scotland to look after the people that have been affected by That covid-19 vaccine why are the people who are in charge who told us all to do the right thing have left us all to RW and left me and the thousands and the tens of thousands in this country to RW R soon look me in the eye when are you going to start to do the right thing the vaccine damage payment scheme is not fit for purpose in Scotland right now according to the yellow card system there are over 30 th000 people have had an adverse reaction to That vaccine and deaths John thank you very much indeed for your question for you to start doing the right and you youve you've made a really strong point John prime minister yeah John well I'm very sorry to hear about your personal circumstances and you said someone over here also seems to have suffered by the similar by a similar thing now obviously I I don't know about the individual situation that you're in Rush well silence well social media and everything we are silenced we are the most silenced people in this country Sil in the Press because my story in the press okay had to go to the government for comment and they made take all the stuff out for forgive me forgive me both no no no one no one no one is say no I've lost my house my wife successful career and Sir You Raised some very valid points I'm sure what I've got to say is though we haven't got you on microphone and as you know we've got to get through this I'm sure we can we can raise your points with the prime minister at a later date but in the meantime prime minister if cover the issue I'm very happy to so there is a vaccine compensation scheme that's in place as you alluded to in the NHS obviously everyone individually will work through their cases it's difficult for me to comment on anyone's individual case I'm sure you'll appreciate that I'm very happy to go and look at the cases and I'm sure you'll get them to the team here I mean I'm I'm very saddened and shocked to hear that you've been silenced by anybody that is surprising to me so please do get your details to Steven and the team and I will happily take that away of course you should be able to speak about your experience what's happened to you and as I said we have a compensation scheme in place for that and I'll make sure that we're working through that obviously I think you'll appreciate it's hard for me to comment on your specific circumstances just not knowing them and those things forgive me sir we haven't got a microphone on you so our viewers and listeners won't be able to hear I the the last thing I'd say is you know we went through a pandemic like everyone else at the points when it came to the vaccine those decisions were always taken on the basis of medical advice from our medical experts to tell us as politicians who are obviously not doctors about how best to roll out the vaccine what was in the public health interest the priority order how that should be done who should be eligible that was something that the doctors recommended on and that's something that we followed now obviously if there are individual circumstances which haven't worked out then that's why we have the compensation scheme in place and I'll make sure that we follow up on your cases okay prime minister thank you jents both of you do give us your details we will get that to the Prime Minister and as he said he will I'm sure look at that for you in the meantime let's move on to another question sir well that was a pretty hard-hitting and Powerful message and I'm not really going to comment on that you saw the pain in Mr watt's eyes I think that uh say is all that needs to be said really and expressed himself quite eloquently another gentleman there who was also vaccine injured now that's rather strange really because this was Mr sunak in Parliament Wednesday the 31st of January 2024 couple of weeks ago less than a couple of weeks ago brid thank you Mr Speaker more than two decad decades ago the then Prime Minister Tony Blair misled this house by promoting and endorsing the post office Horizon it system as perfect protecting the large corporation that created it and causing Untold harm and damage and misery to innocent people can the current prime minister think of anything he has promoted in partnership with huge businesses as safe and effective which has ultimately harmed the British people and will he use this opportunity to correct that safe and effective state or will he choose the same line as Tony Blair sit back do nothing and let the misery just continue to pile up Prim Minister Mr Speaker as we've been clear the Horizon Scandal is a terrible miscarriage of justice and we're doing everything that we can to make it right and to what he was more broadly insinuating let me be unequivocal from this dispatch box that covid vaccines are safe Mr Speaker well that's just two video clips you might see some contradiction there let me know um I'm not going to comment further just now I'm just going to leave it there but it would be good to get some official reaction preferably from the dispatch box from the Prime Minister let hope this is immediately or rapidly forthcoming in the meantime let me know your views and um thanks to uh to Mr wat for his uh for making this contribution for bringing for bringing this to light and uh I'm sure we can all see the suffering that's been injured there and uh we we'll leave this video there thank you for watching you

Covid-19 vaccination can induce multiple sclerosis via cross-reactive CD4+ T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and myelin peptides

https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/pt/covidwho-2138820?lang=en

Both natural infection and the mRNA based vaccinations can be accompanied by transient autoimmune phenomena,

or onset of autoimmune diseases. 

Objective

Two cases of multiple sclerosis (MS),

with clinical and new radiological signs,

beginning in close temporal relation to spike (S) protein mRNA based vaccinations. 

Aim

The onset of MS in these two cases is very likely caused by CD4+ T cell clones,

that cross-recognize SARSCoV- 2 S protein,

from myelin proteins.

Method

Spike specific CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood,

and CD4+ T cells from CSF sample were isolated,

then underwent autoantigen screening test. 

(An endogenous antigen that stimulates the production of autoantibodies)

A list of well-known MS related autoantigens,

Result(s)

Self-reactive T cells were detected from Spike specific T cell population,

also showed reactivity to MBP, MOG, (Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) peptides PLP peptide pools.

Multiple sclerosis and myelin basic protein: insights into protein disorder and disease

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8810476/

Myelin basic protein (MBP) is an abundant protein in central nervous system (CNS) myelin. 

MBP has long been studied as a factor in the pathogenesis of the autoimmune neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis (MS). 

MS is characterized by CNS inflammation, demyelination, and axonal loss.

Finally, 

we found proinflammatory T cell clones,

that recognize both Spike protein and immunodominant Myelin basic protein peptides,

and Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptides, which have previously been implicated in MS.

Conclusion(s) 

Detailed studies of both peripheral blood, and CSF derived CD4+ T cells show that the onset of MS in these two cases is very likely caused by CD4+ T cell clones that cross-recognize SARS-CoV-2 S protein derived peptides and peptides derived from myelin proteins, which have previously been implicated in MS.

Posts misrepresent research on multiple sclerosis and COVID-19 vaccines found in WHO database

https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-WHO-COVID-multiple-sclerosis-591321248797

New diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in the setting of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine exposure (January 2022)

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34922126/

Multiple sclerosis (MS) with onset in the setting of acute SARS-CoV-2 virus infection has been reported,
 
and reactivation of MS following non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccination has been noted, 

There have been three reports of newly diagnosed MS following exposure to mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. 

The association cannot be determined to be causal,

We report a series of 5 cases of newly diagnosed MS following recent exposure to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. 

Latency from vaccination to initial presentation varied. 
Neurological manifestations and clinical course appeared to be typical for MS,

including response to high dose steroids

Conclusion 

Acute neurological deficits in the setting of recent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine administration may represent new onset multiple sclerosis.

We are concerned that Parliament has not discussed and will not have a say on the 307 proposed amendments to the International Health Regulations, 

AND the amendments to 5 Articles of the IHR that were ADOPTED by the 75th World Health Assembly on 27 May 2022.",2023-05-29,1355284,53474,14004,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg, well a warm welcome to today's talk Monday the 29th of May now last week the World Health Organization put out a release showing that there was a possible cause or relationship between covid-19 vaccine and multiple sclerosis and we're allowed to report on this because it is an official who paper we're limited to other things we can report but we can report this now this is the paper here now um it says covid-19 vaccination can induce multiple sclerosis via cross reactivity with t helper cells so quite a mission from the World Health Organization now this isn't available on quite a few servers now but I've got DuckDuckGo on my um on my desktop so I could find it again but that's that's that's it there and it is as I say who publication so we can actually talk about this nice to be able to talk about things now what is this actually uh showing what what is going on here well I'm going to sort of do a quick explanation of what seems to be going on so what we have here imagine this is a nerve fiber here so the nerve that the nerve impulses will travel down here and this will be in the brain or the spinal cord and these nerve fibers are surrounded by this protective myelin sheath and in the nest central nervous system they're made by cells called oligodendrocytes here we have the spike protein from a natural uh SARS coronavirus II infection and here we have the spike protein produced by the vaccine on its own now in learning to recognize this is the CD4 lymphocyte here the T helper cell this is the famous tea helper cell that's disordered in um in HIV so when people become immunocompromised in AIDS acquired immunodeficiency syndrome what actually happens is is the virus destroys a lot of the CD4 helper cells until they can't produce any immune response but here it's not lack of immune response it's too much immune response that is the uh the problem so the CD4 is learning to recognize rightly as in the principles of vaccination these uh these Spike proteins and it can beat up these Spike proteins which of course is is good these are the spike proteins produced by the vaccine and the idea is that will help the CDL CD helper cells to get rid of the spike protein should there be a natural infection which we could argue about but the point is the same sort of chemical profile that we're finding on the surface of the spike protein um molecules there we're finding very similar proteins on the surface of the well there are very similar proteins on the surface of the myelin sheath so the T helper cells are also orchestrating a response which beats up on these myelin sheaths and when the myelin sheaths go in central nervous system um that is multiple sclerosis the myelin sheaths of course are essential they facilitate what we call bouncing transmission much faster so-called salutatory transmission of nerve fibers the nourish protect the protect the nerve fiber so without them basically you get progressive paralysis that is the main feature with multiple sclerosis and I've looked after many hundreds I guess of multiple sclerosis patients so over the years horrible debilitating disease although with a very varying path so that's what seems to be happening and that's reporting on this paper so if you can't find it on Safari or something do do try Duck Duck Go because that's where I got it I actually started to prep this about three days ago and when I went and clicked on it this morning it just wasn't there you know one of those can't find it sort of make messages anyway let's look at a little more detail now because it's a pretty significant paper and it's not only showing what this this particular autoimmune reaction is to Multiple Sclerosis but is there other autoimmune reactions well the one I'm allowed to talk about is is this one because it's a who publication um you get the impression it's probably been taken down from some other servers um but hey what do I know now this is the paper here uh covid-19 vaccination can induce now this is the this is the who so Canon juice multiple sclerosis via cross-reactive T helper uh CD4 Health cells recognizing SARS coronavirus to Spike protein and as we've said myelin this essential myelin that protects the cells in the central nervous system now the article goes on both natural infection and mRNA vaccine based vaccinations can be accompanied by transient autoimmune phenomena now this is pretty significant in itself because here we have the who actually admitting that uh SARS coronavirus 2 vaccines can cause autoimmune phenomena this is actually a pretty big breakthrough um let's hope this paper stays up because it really is quite a groundbreaking piece and I am live from the who website now via Duck Duck Go uh and uh and um I can't remember the search engine now but just don't don't go anyway um do let me know if you find it under the search engines because I've had difficulty um so on set of autoimmune disease confirmed by the World Health Organization now here we have a test case of two multiple sclerosis patients with clinical signs and new radiological Signs Now what this means is radiological signs is the um if you do MRI of the brain and the spinal cord it's very obvious when you see multiple sclerosis because you have these multiple patches in the old days multiple sclerosis used to be called disseminated sclerosis because you get patches in different parts of the body hence the different uh symptoms in different parts of the body from different lesions in the brain and spinal cord but we now call it multiple sclerosis now they're saying it's a temporal relationship to the spike protein vaccine in other words the vaccine came first and the multiple chlorosclerosis came second does this mean there's an automatic cause or correlation no it doesn't but we go back to the title of the paper covid-19 vaccination can induce multiple sclerosis so the very title of the paper is indicating that there is a causal relationship at least that's the way I read the title of that paper how long it will be there for of course is a different matter um the aim of the study uh the onset of multiple sclerosis in two cases are very likely so the saying very likely caused by the CD helper cells that cross recognize SARS coronavirus to spike protein from myelin proteins now um Spike specific uh T helper cells from peripheral they found these cells in peripheral blood and they found them in the cerebrospinal fluid most of you probably know the cerebrospinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord all the central nervous systems in this cerebral spinal fluid is a shock absorber but it's also immunologically very important as as well and they were underwent Auto antigen screening now an auto antigen is is part of you it's a it's a it's a it's a it's part of you it's endogenous um but it stimulates the production of Auto antibodies so it's when one of your own proteins stimulates antibodies to beat up on your own proteins which of course is the the essence of autoimmune disease and that is what is happening in this case according to the who circular which is uh which is still there um um so they looked up a list of well-known Auto antigens in multiple sclerosis these people knew what to look for the results self-reactive T cells were detected from Spike specific T-cell populations so the yes the vaccine in that sense worked it stimulated the T helper cells but also showed reactivity against various proteins now this MBP we'll look at in a minute the MOG is the myelin oligodendrocyte protein now what that means is this is the um this is the central nervous system here's the myelin sheath and in the central nervous system this myelin sheath is produced by the oligodendrocytes or the oligodendron glial cells so it's a protein that's specific to these cells that are producing this myelin sheath the oligodendrocytes so these are specific myelin related proteins now I'm just going to give a quick this is papers in parenthesis here but um this is just to give a some insight this is about multiple sclerosis and myelin based proteins um my myelin-based protein uh so this MBP that they found the cross reactivity to one of the ones so this cross-reactivity between the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and the spike protein there's also a cross-reactivity between this myelin-based um protein here it's a central nervous system protein in the myelin as uh MBP has long been studies as a factor in the pathogenesis and the beginning of autoimmune the auto neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis so this is not new science this is well established it is the cross-reactivity where the antibodies produced from the vaccine that is new and multiple sclerosis is characterized by central nervous system inflammation demyelination axon or loss and as we said Progressive paralysis so getting back to the paper finally we found pro-inflammatory T cell clones so in other words these the T cells were involved as as well um now it's the T Cell involved here just seems to be the T helper cells whether other ones were involved we're not told but anyway these pro-inflammatory T cell clones like the CD helper cell the CD4 cell they recognize spoke Spike protein and immunodominant myelin-based proteins in other words they're beating up on the myelin tooth as well as the spike protein and as we said myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptides which have previously been implicated in multiple sclerosis their conclusion detailed studies of both peripheral blood and cerebral spinal fluid derived CD4 plus T cells that's the C help Burton CD4 helper cells the T helper lymphocytes shows that the onset of multiple sclerosis in these two very likely caused by the T helper cells clones that the population of these cells that are developed the cross-recognized SARS coronavirus 2 Spike protein derived peptides and peptides derive from myelin proteins in other words it's beating upon the same it's beating up on the same similar structures a similar molecular structures in both of these areas beating up on the spike protein is good beating up on your own um myelin in the central nervous system is potentially a disastrous so um I think we'll actually leave that out there's more I'll tell you well we'll go on for a bit more there's always more there's always more to say but um um you've got the main effort so that's just part of the text I was working on before I lost before I found the new DuckDuckGo site uh now post misrepresent research on multiple sclerosis vaccines found by 2who databases now the fact Checkers have helpfully waded in on this and um quite a few fact Checkers it's obviously put the wind up them a bit um very good of these fact Checkers to tell us uh what's going on so we don't need to bother thinking for ourselves but I think we'll pass on it because I think we do like to think for ourselves now this is a bit of line because this is not new now this is a paper here this is another paper new diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in settings of mRNA covered vaccine exposure this is published published published in January 2022 so this is based on data collected in 2021. why wasn't this highlighted at the time why wasn't it highlighted at the time multiple sclerosis with onset uh with onset in the settings of acute SARS coronavirus 2 virus infected people has been reported so yes it's possible after natural infection and reactivity of multiple sclerosis following mRNA covered vaccines there have been three reports of newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis following exposures to mRNA covered vaccines so yes that is occurring in 2021 the association cannot be determined to be causal of course because it could be caused by other factors but it's temporal correlation whereas the new who paper goes further and says it's now lightly um we report a series of five cases of newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis following recent exposure of mRNA covered vaccines now this bit's a bit concerning latency from vaccination to initial presentation varied neurological manifestation the clinical course appear to be typical for MS so the time between people getting vaccinated and developing the features of multiple sclerosis varied there was latency how long could this latency be we don't know in these cases it was fairly short because of course the vaccines only started in in 2021 so these must have been within the course of a year are there more to come we don't know that not least we haven't been told that someone there's probably some information around somewhere um but there's multiple sclerosis responding as normal so their conclusion was acute neurological deficits in the settings of recent mRNA covered vaccination and administration may represent new onset multiple sclerosis so we knew that in uh 2022 and yet nothing changed incredible why won't the warned of these risks at a much earlier stage well the the research wonders but it didn't translate into um any meaningful findings right now just a couple of quick things um this is um petition if you're in the if you're in the UK you can sign this petition here that we're concerned about the new who amendments and some amendments that are going to kick in in just a few months that we didn't know about that have been kept quiet so if you click on that if you're in the UK you can sign that uh petition and when we get to 100 000 signatures there has to be a parliamentary debate albeit it's a fairly small one but there has to be something let's get up to a hundred thousand and um stop this uh uh these new international health things from the World Health Organization or at least not stop them let's have a parliamentary debate rather than rubber stamping it and the other thing I'll put a link in in the description as well but I've started a sub stack as well um don't know how much time I'll have to put on things but um you can put some I've put some quite detailed physiology and pathophysiology on there and um as well as news more news related items so there we go World Health Organization quite surprising really covid-19 vaccinations can induce multiple sclerosis from The Who itself um and I can tell you about this one because it is an official who site let's hope the who published more so I'm free to discuss more pathology a bit concerning about what's going to happen over the next couple of years in terms of prevalence but um we'll find out won't we we'll leave it there for now and uh thank you for watching

main story tonight which concerns the covid vaccines the end result of the world's greatest scientists working around the clock to save countless lives immortalized in a card we'll all definitely lose in a month vitally important but also too big to fit in any standard wallet way to fumble at the one yard line science and look not that we needed it but this week saw yet another reminder of just how dangerous kovid is with cases in india in particular surging at a truly terrifying rate india set a world record for daily covert cases of over 400 000 and that is probably an undercount and obviously the world should be doing everything it can to help india right now but our best way out of this mess long term is clearly vaccines and it's worth remembering we in the us are incredibly fortunate we currently have access to a lot of vaccines and more than half of u.s adults have now gotten at least one dose which is great the bad news is some vaccination locations have already gone from having not enough supply to not enough demand according to the cdc the daily average for vaccinations has dropped 20 percent since the start of the month a worrying trend vaccine demand declining in south carolina some providers left with extra doses and appointments for wide open palm beach county health care district says it is now facing 10 000 appointments for the county's vaccine sites remain unfilled since they opened this week appointments are going unfilled we've got thousands of appointments available over the next few weeks and no takers at this point it's true a worrying amount of people are holding off on getting the free covered vaccine and i'm not saying that you should immediately get something just because it's free i wouldn't recommend getting these old dolls on craigslist just because they're free they're weird broken and they will kill you in your sleep but these vaccines could save not just your life but the lives of people around you and it's genuinely dispiriting that just a few months into the vaccine rollout we are already at this point and the problem is for the coronavirus the herd immunity threshold is thought to be between 70 and 90 of the population but a survey found that while 60 of american adults have got or want to get the vaccine another 18 say maybe and 22 say no and if you're thinking well hold on if every maybe gets the vaccine that still puts us at 78 unfortunately that poll doesn't take into account children who were not vaccinating right now and who make up around 22 of the population so we need to get the vaccine into as many adults as possible as soon as possible and that means you really need to get vaccinated and obviously i mean the collective you but also you mike mike in baltimore i know you've got this on in the background at work on monday so listen to me schedule your vaccine mike don't say you're gonna look into it later just google vaccine finder baltimore it takes seconds here are a list of vaccine sites in your area and if you're thinking yeah i'm not sure i need it joe rogan says i'm probably fine look it is true you might not get seriously sick from covid or indeed sick at all but you could still inadvertently pass it to someone who could then die and before you say well vulnerable people should just get vaccinated then the vaccines are only 95 effective mike so they'll probably be okay but maybe not also the more the virus circulates the likely we'll see mutations that make it more dangerous possibly helping it to evade the vaccine completely putting us all the way back to square one so get the vaccine mike the point is there is a problematic amount of vaccine hesitancy right now even among people who you would really like to think would not need convincing we met robert gannon before he went in to visit his 77 year old mother kia who was on a ventilator right now in the icu due to coven had she been vaccinated she was not vaccinated i think she was being hesitant just wanting to see how things played out have you been vaccinated i have not what would it take for you to get vaccinated um i'd want to make sure that it's safe wow there is perhaps no clearer sign of just how deep vaccine hesitancy runs than someone in that guy's position still questioning whether to get it instead of asking is there such a thing as too much vaccine because if not i'm going to keep going back for injections until i'm around 80 percent pfizer so given all of that tonight let's talk about the covid vaccines why people are hesitant what their worries are and how they might be reassured and let's start with the fact you can't characterize any one group as uniformly vaccine hesitant no demographic is a monolith every group will have some who are excited and others who are anxious and different groups will be anxious for different reasons for instance early on you probably heard a lot about hesitancy among some black americans which can be a real thing even this pediatrician had reservations when the vaccine was first made available to both of you did you both jump at the chance to get it no no i mean not me anyway i am black first in this country and that has with it a lot of baggage to tell you the truth and so then my public health degree the culminating experience that i did was related to the the relationship between black people and physicians and that relationship has been a cantankerous one and so those are the kinds of things that are deeply embedded and challenging to overcome even within someone who's a scientist honestly i do understand that we've talked before on this show about the fraught relationship black americans have with healthcare based on both current bad experiences and the history of incidents like the tuskegee experiment where doctors lied to black men allowing them to suffer from untreated syphilis over decades or as most u.s history students would describe it something i have not heard of although it does feel important to mention that that doctor did wind up getting the vaccine and in general black vaccine hesitancy has dropped fast another group you might have heard have high hesitancy rates are republicans and that is also true around 30 percent of republicans say they won't get it and it's not hard to see why because fears and doubts about the vaccine have flown around conservative media with one of the most prominent super spreaders being this guy what about this vaccine why are americans being discouraged from asking simple straightforward questions about it questions like how effective are these drugs are they safe do you need a reason to turn on the vaccine and what happens if you do turn it down would you be allowed to fly on airplanes or go to work or enter the front doors of madison square garden oh now they're telling us the vaccine has a delayed response okay delayed by how long they don't say if vaccines work why are vaccinated people still banned from living normal lives honestly what's the answer to that so maybe it doesn't work and they're simply not telling you that well you hate to think that especially if you've gotten two shots but what's the other potential explanation okay it is genuinely weird to see someone hosting a show on a supposed news network and ending every sentence with a question mark especially when answers to most of those questions are out there for anyone who cares to know so for instance that last complaint that the cdc still recommends wearing masks indoors when around vulnerable unvaccinated people does not mean the vaccine doesn't work clinical trials found that the vaccines are spectacularly successful at preventing people from getting serious disease as for whether they protect you from spreading the virus the trials weren't designed to assess that but evidence so far indicates that they drastically reduce transmission the reason we still see mask and distancing recommendations is that the cdc is being cautious and wants to be sure that it is not spreading around during a global pandemic like a frozen dinner duke with a tv show anyway i hope that answers at least one of your gaped mouthed bad faith wonderings tucker you scrunch-faced fear baboon and the problem is when people like tucker raise questions without bothering to answer them there is a lot of misinformation out there for people to then stumble on anti-vaccine groups have been waiting for a moment like this to spread doubt and the scary thing is they don't actually need to convince people they're right they just need to convince people that no one is and that tracks with recent polling while few believe specific myths about the vaccine larger numbers say that they didn't know whether particular myths were true or false for instance only four percent of people believe the covet vaccine is more deadly than the disease but 25 percent say they don't know and that is not good because if anti-vaxxers can simply spread enough misinformation to cause people to throw up their hands and say i just don't know enough to get the shot they have already seriously things up for all of us and to be clear most people who are hesitant are not fanatics or conspiracy theorists many are just trying to make the best decision for themselves and their family like that pediatrician that we saw earlier you definitely know people like that in your life so i'm actually going to spend the rest of this piece trying to clear up some of the biggest myths flying around and some are pretty easy to debunk quickly like the claims that bill gates is using the vaccine to put a microchip in all of us something his wife had this response to i know my husband is not vaccinating people and putting a microchip in her arm because that technology doesn't even exist and he's never uttered the words out of his mouth so okay that wasn't the reassuring push back to a batshit conspiracy theory that i had hoped for to be honest we're not microchipping people because the technology doesn't exist yet and my husband hasn't said it out loud to me why would you put it like that there are lots of things a husband won't say out loud to his wife not dark things just things quiet thoughts a partner might not be ready to hear like how sometimes late at night i think wouldn't it be nice to live in an egg an egg to be in not just an oval-shaped sleeping pot i can get an oval-shaped sleeping pod nobody wants one of those i mean an egg a big egg with me in it or maybe a normal egg and i'm small it doesn't matter what matters is i'm in an egg not alone i'm with the gloop too it's just me and the glue no opening no windows no way to ever know if it's morning or night so do you know what time it is all the time egg time just egg time for me and the glute sometimes it's warm and that's when i feel safest sometimes i can tell i'm being carried or moved about and it's jarring enough that i'm nervous but not so rough that i'm panicking and you can shake me but do make sure not to do it hard because remember i'm fragile i am egg the point is you can't say any of that to melinda gates she'd never understand what wife could anyway for the record there are no microchips in the covid vaccine that rumor is based on the fact that the gates foundation funded research years ago which is frequently taken out of context in that study researchers looked into creating an invisible ink that could potentially be injected along with a vaccine in order for populations like refugee kids to be able to retain vaccine records without paperwork over time the original context was lost contorted and kind of telephoned its way into becoming something something bill gates microchips on facebook a claim which if you think about it for just a second doesn't make sense because if your main concern is that bill gates could use microchips to track you he can already do that that's what your phone is now another more reasonable sounding concern has to do with just how fast the vaccine came together wouldn't want to get it um i felt like i was too rushed i think the whole thing has been rushed through too fast it kind of came really fast like the vaccine they made up one really fast it was done way too quick i just i don't feel comfortable with taking it not anytime soon i think that they're using the public as guinea pigs right and that doesn't sound good nobody wants to be a guinea pig although i don't really know why being a guinea pig seems great you can eat a pepper while wearing the stem as a little hat run around a tiny city made of cardboard and best of all you get to use the guinea pig bridge [Music] yeah being a guinea pig has its upsides that's all i'm saying the infrastructure alone is incredible but that is clearly not the concern that those people have their worry is that we are being used as guinea pigs for a rushed untested vaccine it is an understandable thing to worry about even if some express it in less than ideal ways tell me why you're concerned six words testing testing testing testing and more testing it's important if you're going to put something into your body that it's absolutely and totally tested i tell you what i admire about that guy his confidence because i don't think i've seen anyone more self-assured than the man who just promised six words said seven and counted five all without even flinching that guy is so secure in his thinking he could be wrong about numbers on camera twice and do it with an unbreaking smile but it is worth understanding exactly how the vaccine was able to come to market so fast because researchers had been working on vaccines against other coronaviruses for years so when covid19 hit they had a significant head start operation warp speed as it was famously called wasn't about rushing the science it was about significantly cutting through bureaucracy that could have otherwise slowed it down as this vaccine researcher explains did you ever imagine that we'd be able to develop a vaccine in 12 to 18 months the short answer is no we're able to compress the timeline so that things that we would normally do in a linear fashion a to b we actually start the f and the a at the same time as a and b exactly they took steps that usually happen sequentially and save time by running them simultaneously and to be honest i am envious of that level of efficiency i would save so much time every morning if i could shower shave eat breakfast kiss my family and brush my teeth all at the same time unfortunately i've only ever managed to do three of them at once but i am so close to that fourth one now another concern that you may have heard or seen online is that the pfizer and moderna vaccines are the first authorized to use messenger rna which is true but that has given rise to speculation about what mrna is capable of doing basically anyone taking these vaccines they're all designed to the same thing is going to have neurological disorders within one year most of the people taking the vaccine will be dead within 10. let me tell you something you take the mrna it creates plaque in your brain it gives you alzheimer's and i got the studies too so hey you think they just put flora in the water to dumb you down man alex jones is having a blast isn't he no one else has as much fun while making the world a worse place to live in it's like he invented a jet pack that sprays everyone beneath him with human  but the thing is there is absolutely no evidence or credible studies supporting any of what he just said as for the claim that mrna vaccines modify your dna it is very important to know that the vaccines mrna does not enter our genome it does its work far from the cell's nucleus which is where your dna is but the fear of what the vaccine contains or what it could do to you seems to be common some evangelicals are concerned that it contains cells from aborted fetuses which it does not others worry that it could change the body's inner workings you might have had a friend tell you that they are worried that the vaccines cause infertility those rumors were fueled by a blog post which falsely claimed that pfizer's vaccine contained ingredients capable of training the female body to attack a protein that plays a crucial role in the development of the placenta but a few things there first experts say of that claim it's a myth it's inaccurate there is no evidence to support it and there is already pretty good proof that pfizer's vaccine doesn't cause infertility because during the trials last year multiple women became pregnant and the only one who suffered a pregnancy loss was given the placebo so it is just not true and look the final myth you may have heard is that the risks from the vaccine are somehow greater than the risks of covid that is a perception fed by the constant circulation of misleading headlines about people falling ill or dying after getting their shot for instance you may have seen this story that was widely shared about 23 people in norway dying within a week of getting the shot which does sound scary but that headline is missing some pretty major context while those people did die at that point in norway the vaccine was being administered to the oldest or sickest people and a certain percentage of them were statistically going to die that week vaccine or no vaccine on average 400 people died every week in nursing homes in norway and when the world health organization reviewed those incidents they didn't find any unexpected or untoward increase in fatalities which does make sense correlation isn't causation the vaccine protects against covid not the concept of mortality it is weird that i have to clarify this but you are in fact going to die one day mike yeah mike stop listening to what joe rogan tells you he's a and those are his words not mine that also goes for stories that you might see hyping up scary sounding data from veyers the vaccine adverse event reporting system it's a database that collects stories of medical events following vaccinations but any lay person has to treat data coming out of it with extreme caution because reports can be entered by anyone and are not routinely verified one doctor once claimed that the flu vaccine turned him into the hulk and that report was accepted and entered into the database which is completely absurd a drug cannot turn you into the hulk although admittedly it can turn you into captain america the only superhero whose origin story is a metric ton of experimental nazi steroids and look if we're just gonna share random unverified side effects i might as well show you this truly shocking video about what might happen to your mom so my mom got the vaccine because she's a healthcare worker and she told me she's experiencing some side effects mom what's that side effect you said you're experiencing being a boss ass very good and look i'm not saying veyers is useless it very much isn't the reason the cdc collects this data is so if a pattern does emerge actions can be taken that is exactly what happened with the johnson and johnson shot the cdc found a potential pattern of rare blood clots and paused the rollout under an abundance of caution and while some vaccine skeptics pointed to that as evidence that they were right about vaccines being dangerous in reality it kind of proves the opposite that the safety risk of vaccines is rigorously and publicly analyzed not secretly buried and somehow leaked to the human football's neon scream hour and none of this is to say that there are no side effects to the vaccines there can be it is just that serious ones like anaphylaxis are incredibly rare 4.7 cases per million for pfizer two and a half cases per million for moderna and you should know those also occur mostly in individuals with a history of severe allergies the fact is the vast majority of people can expect at most typical colds or flu symptoms in the first few days after they're shot or maybe just a sore arm or maybe nothing at all for what it's worth i actually got my second shot this thursday my arm hurt a little bit for a day but that's basically it i will admit the following afternoon for a couple of hours i did feel a little bit like a boss ass but that passed quickly and anyway the key thing to remember is that no side effect of the vaccine is worse than the alternative covid a disease that has killed over 500 000 people in the u.s alone while once again to date the vaccine has been proven to kill exactly zero so it is more than natural to have questions but there are reassuring answers out there and anyone just throwing out questions without acknowledging that probably has another agenda entirely but the problem is to get anywhere close to herd immunity we badly need to convince anyone who can be convinced so the question is how do we do that while some republican lawmakers to their credit have tried to reassure their voters although occasionally those attempts have looked like this live free and beauty surrounds you the world still astounds you each time you look at a star i'm senator john kennedy i can't sing very well but i'm free be free be cool get the vaccine i did it works okay i don't love that and not just because it is the worst thing to come out of a kennedy's mouth since the back of a kennedy's head but also because the truth is that probably didn't convince anyone in researching this piece experts repeatedly told us that the vaccine hesitant generally don't respond well to hearing from politicians celebrities or athletes telling them to get the vaccine and i get that i would love to think that i could end this piece having carefully laid out some data with a triumphant call for people to get vaccinated featuring a mascot of some incongruous animal know a vaccine cicada you don't think that that's something that i would be interested in doing the truth is we actually did that we had a vaccine cicada costume made but after being advised that this technique would not be remotely effective in convincing people who were hesitant we scrapped the idea completely we emailed our mascot guy and we told him not to come in because it was an absolutely stupid idea a vaccine cicada can you imagine how dumb that would look it probably wouldn't even look like a cicada more like some kind of unhinged cockroach it was a terrible concept that could have fundamentally undermined the very important message that we were trying to send and i am so so glad that we avoided making that mistake because the truth is i'm not going to be able to convince the people in your life who are hesitant the person with the best chance of doing that is you so if you know someone who is worried for whatever reason and you want to convince them otherwise don't show them this video but maybe do try and use some of the information inside it to tell them yourself and when you are trying to do that don't dismiss or judge them for having doubts and i know that that is not always easy i could have given that guy a pass for holding up the wrong number of fingers but i couldn't do it i don't have that level of restraint i'm a small petty man and that guy is a idiot but if you think you can do better it is incredibly important that you try or to put in the terms that that guy could understand i've got two words for you please just try as hard as you can you

indicates that research credibility is at an all-time low as a rash of fake papers made their way into the academy into prestigious journals of medicine and other categories of science according to the guardian tens of thousands of bogus research papers being published in joural in an international Scandal it's worsening every year scientists have warned medical research is being compromised drug development hindered and promising academic research jeopardized thanks to a global wave of sham science that is sweeping Laboratories and universities the concerns over the veracity of scientific inquiry come as a new study indicates that some concerns about vaccine related injury may not have been all that far-fetched per Fox News the largest covid vaccine study to date by the global vaccine Data Network in New Zealand analyzed 99 million people who received Co vaccinations across eight countries the study found that the vaccine was linked to a slight increase in neurological blood and heart related medical conditions on the note of covid related maladies new Research into long covid indicates that there may be a connection to brain damage and the disorder per science alert analyzing 203 patients hospitalized with covid-19 or its Associated simp symptoms and comparing the results with 60 people without the infection researchers noted elevated levels of four brain injury biomarkers Key signs of biological change in those infected with covid-19 what's more two of those signs of brain injury persisted into the recovery phase suggesting that they continue Even After The covid-19 Infection has gone so there's which I want to start at the top of this well starting just with that that last one you know we when long Co comes up on the show there's often the critique that because of the nature of the symptoms and as you point out the population that disproportionately seems to be complaining about long covid it's easy to write it off as a kind of psychological issue where people are told that they have a problem and they have a kind of a psychosomatic response and that there isn't really a there there and what's interesting about this study is that because of that skepticism about long Co they specifically look for biomarker so like biological changes that are observable um scientifically and recordable and measurable and they have found a number of biomarkers associated with people who have been hospitalized with covid and more alarmingly that at least some of those biomarkers persist after the virus has been cleared suggesting that there could be long-term effects AKA long Co particularly for people who were sick enough with Co initially to be hospitalized I think that's I don't have any doubt that that if you are if you're hospitalized with Co that there can be long-term damage and I it's important to for scientists to evaluate what could be a potential you know to look at potential treatments and cures and those sort of things for people who are still suffering these long-term effects I yeah I I don't doubt that and we need to get more information about it um but the article we discussed at the top here is very worrisome indeed um it looks like a lot of um frankly it was a problem in a lot of other countries including China and India where um um young doctors trying to make careers for themselves are coming up with fake papers that there's a whole industry of writing fake papers paper mills that are again just utterly false they're not valid at all not just like exaggerated or you actually did the research and you reached to the wrong conclusion but are deliberately like made up like you know cheating on your research paper in college level like and being accepted by prestigious journals and then being treated as as fact there's not enough peer review there's not enough skepticism this problem has been well known well a slightly different problem in the in the social sciences psychological Sciences for uh a long time we've heard talk about the um um reproducibility problem it's diff so many papers I think some estimates are as many as 50% although that could be from a paper that's also frul but that a a high number of papers on social science behavioral observation papers that are accepted for publication um when they subst try to do a subsequently try to do a study to reproduce the same finding they cannot reproduce the finding at all and a lot of those make it through um yeah it also makes me think of the this is even more serious this is the harder Sciences sure I makes me think of the case that we talked about with respect to VI ramaswami where the allegation is that he was able to make a lot of money off of his first uh business venture by basically following an finding an abandoned um Alzheimer drug his mother is a doctor that specializes in geriatric disease maybe geriatric oncology I can't remember um but geriatric medicine uh and she basically writes a paper that suggests some potential application and promise to the drug which did not pan out but that enabled Vic to remarket it as um the next big thing and basically do a sort of a pump and dump make a lot of money off of selling this drug that had been because research had demonstrated that it didn't actually have that much promise so there's certainly a lot of manipulation that goes on in this industry and there are some serious questions about how you can restore public trust in what is some legitimate science when there is so much illegitimacy out there especially when as many people were pointing out in light of the um reporting about the vaccine effects how suppressed any discourse around that was earlier in the Arc of this pandemic right at very least allowing there to be some level of push back and mooding and debate of these sorts of issues I think would engender more trust in what the scientists are saying and that taking the exact opposite approach I think has led people to believe that all they can trust is their selves or what they see on their Facebook feed sometimes to to really bad effect because the way skepticism was treated by um governmental Medical Health authorities during the pandemic I just think ended up being really counterproductive you remember Fouch famous I am the science and how dare you mistrust me you know at a time where he was making claims about um about mass that have subsequently been you know he made several different conflicting claims about those that did not pan out being true in terms of how uh how totally satisfactory the the lower quality Mass were perfectly good um remember earlier early promises about how good the vaccines would hold up in terms of not just preventing severe disease and death and mitigating symptoms but actually to preventing the spread was a line that they uh they clung to for a long time um the denial of of a of a um infection acquired immunity um saying that was no good for so even though it became obvious that people once they had had covid had some level of protection akin to the level of protection you get from the vaccine frankly and you weren't like allowed to discuss that in po company and that's without you know getting into any of the origins of Co stuff as well which is some of the that has fared the worst of all um people you know people were demonized for having some rational skepticism and uh that's been that's been very damaging now we and we see from reports like this there's you know every reason you can be too skeptical you can you know reject absolutely everything because you just want to be contrarian or something that's not healthy either but you need to at least you know consider a variety of sources explore which questions have you know legitimate and respected people on the other side saying well wait a minute about this and that's how we get a more thoughtful and more informed public I mean I also think that that you need to have scientific literacy and the same way that some people talk about a crisis of Journalism and fake news and they think the answer is controlling what news is out there no I think that treating teaching people media literacy is really important and I think that a lot of folks on all across the political Spectrum who've wanted to control the American Mind Over years understand how integral education and media literacy and scientific literacy is to being able to think for yourself and push back against authoritarianism and I've worked over time to limit people's access to education and getting those skills and so I would also be very skeptical of anybody who wants to ban books make it harder for people to go and get education make it harder for people to access materials that help them understand these kind of journals and be able to assess them on their own merits and to to have more people from different kinds of backgrounds enter into research programs to be able to do the translation work of scientific journalism which is incredibly important well that does it for us for today tomorrow on Rising Brian and I will be back to bring you the biggest news and we can't wait to have another episode of our show maybe we'll do some rewatching of Heroes between now and then oh I'd like that that's a good relief be sure to like share and

35,Y0sg9G5BBVU,A Message for People Who Don’t Want the COVID Vaccine,"26% of Americans are planning to skip the COVID vaccine. We get that people are skeptical of politicians and celebrities telling them what to do but we should listen to doctors. The men and women who have been on the front lines of the pandemic risking their lives to save ours are frustrated. If we don’t get more people vaccinated we could see vaccine-proof new mutations of the virus and go through this all over again. So as a public service we asked some real doctors and nurses to offer their best advice to those who are on the fence about the vaccine. Pay attention, this is important.

#davidpakmanshow #covid #vaccine",2023-01-28,160366,7008,5827,UCvixJtaXuNdMPUGdOPcY8Ag," Speaker 1: Anti-vaccine so-called expert Sherri 
Tenpenny is again spreading fear and promulgating   disinformation about the COVID 19 vaccine. She is 
now warning everyone that is close to you is soon   going to die from the COVID vaccine, not from 
COVID, from the COVID vaccine. Sherri Tenpenny   is now warning about a tsunami of deaths in 
2023. She says by the end of this calendar year,   the year of the Lord 2023, every one of us will 
know five, maybe ten or more people who have died   from the COVID vaccine. Okay. Let's listen to what 
she had to say. This is very instructive in terms   of fear mongering and so many other things.
Speaker 4: Let's listen now. We're seeing the   tsunami of deaths. Tsunami I've been talking about 
since the beginning of 21. Millions of people are   going to die. You know, when Judy Mikovits came 
out on Plandemic at the beginning of that and by.  Speaker 1: The way, that was one of the biggest 
nonsense propaganda films. Plandemic and Mikovits   It's crazy to even mention it.
Speaker 4: That   that more than 50 million people are going 
to die. And everybody was like, Whoa!   And when they started interviewing me and I and 
they asked me, what did I think about that number,   I said, It's way too low. Oh, it's going to be 
much more than 50 million people in America alone.   And we're already starting to see it.
Speaker 1: We're not.  Speaker 4: So the tsunami of deaths is 
coming. It's already here. And I believe   that what's happening now is is starting 
to happen now is the tsunami of regrets   of the people that fell for the lies, 
the fear, friends and family members and   parents and children. And all they did 
to your grandchildren just could not be   told otherwise. But now that people are dying 
like flies, I mean, my business partner has   83 close people in his life that have died.
Speaker 1: You know, most the truth is most   people don't have 83 people in their lives that 
they are close to. This is like a separate issue,   but these are obvious lies.
Speaker 4: 83.  Speaker 1: Yeah. No.
Speaker 4: It's the beginning.   And I predict that by the end of this year, 
every person in this room and every person   listening behind here is going to know a minimum 
of five, probably ten or more close friends and.  Speaker 1: Figure you don't have as many 
friends as her business partner. So you'll   have only 5 to 10 people die.
Speaker 4: Members that have   died from these shots.
Speaker 1: Right.   So I want to remind everybody, and this is so 
controversial every time people say David, is   Sherri Tenpenny a doctor? Is she not a doctor? And 
when I explain it, people get mad. Sherry Tenpenny   is not a medical doctor. She is an osteopathic 
physician. Now, whenever I make that distinction,   people start writing in, including osteopath, 
saying, David, you shouldn't act as though that   is less than being an MD. I'm not saying anything. 
I'm just telling you she's not an M.D. She's an   osteopathic physician, and her claims have no 
scientific basis. It doesn't mean every osteopath   believes the things Sherri Tenpenny believes. I'm 
not saying that at all. All I'm telling you is   actual medical doctors have debunked her claims. 
Health organizations have debunked your claims.   Many osteopathic have also debunked her claims. 
But in the sense that osteopathic physicians   are doctors, she is indeed a doctor. Now, if she 
sounds familiar, and this is really the big point   I want to make. It's because we have listened 
to her predictions in the past, and of course,   none of them have come to pass. What I would like 
is accountability for these people when they make   these predictions. Let's remember and then we can 
follow up and say, hey, that stuff didn't happen.   Because remember when she said this last year?
Speaker 4: The more shots you get, the more the   more you destroy your immune system and the 
faster that happens. And it's anticipated.   The German data says that by the end of 
2022, every fully vaccinated person over   the age of 30 may have the equivalent of full 
blown vaccine induced immune suppressed AIDS.  Speaker 1: Ladies and gentlemen, as a fully 
vaccinated person over the age of 30, I am here   today to tell you I do not have full blown vaccine 
induced immune suppressed AIDS. I do have a little   neck pain from a weird movement I did at the gym 
three days ago, but I don't have full blown AIDS.   So the point is, it's fear, fear, fear. And we're 
going to talk about this later. I can't believe   I'm saying these words. But later on in the show, 
I'm going to talk to you about Tucker Carlson,   fear mongering about a space vagina. I know it 
sounds insane, but it's what it is. They have to   induce fear. Fear generates the environment they 
need in order to then sell you something, whether   it's tickets to an event or a product or liquid, 
liquid, silver, whatever it is they sell you.   And then there's no follow up and there's no 
accountability. We have to hold these people   accountable for their endless failed predictions. 
This is yet another one of those. And if you want   to if you're listening today and you want to see 
what this looks like when this woman makes these   claims. We'll have all of these clips on our 
YouTube channel, YouTube.com slash The David   Pakman Show and on our Instagram, which you can 
find by searching Instagram for David Pakman show."

Reported by 0.8% of registrants",2022-11-25,1759008,55830,15179,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg, welcome to today's talk Friday the 25th of November now for the first time in the United States we've got data that says there's been more covert deaths in people that are vaccinated versus people that are unvaccinated and we want to look at that in a little bit of detail in a minute and put some context in that and also we want to look at the bivalent vaccine boosters that are being given in the states and we're going to be looking at information from V safe which shows that 54.8 percent of vaccine recipients of the bivalent boosters had a systemic side effects most of which weren't serious in the time frame they were looking at now that's about the only way I can summarize this it is a bit complicated and of course YouTube rules and my own personal standards insist that we will be looking at a data from official sources and other reputable sources of data so we're not going against any uh any guidelines from the United States government now um here we have this this is this is this was a report it was commissioned by The Washington Post Kaiser Family Foundation vice president Cynthia Cox who does a lot of this kind of work now um this is quite interesting 58 of coronavirus deaths in August with people who were vaccinated or boosted and that is people who'd had a primary uh course of vaccines at least a primary course of vaccines so what it looks like is happening here is we're getting waning of the protective effects of the vaccines it's now waning and of course this combined with the systemic side effects that we're going to look at from the booster doses needs to be taken into account as we consider the the consider the risk of benefit analysis because we started these vaccination programs a while ago and the risk benefit analysis has changed um we're not saying the vaccines aren't effective we're not saying that there are anything about the vaccines we're just saying the risk benefit analysis has changed let's go on um so therefore 42 of deaths in August were in people who were unvaccinated so the majority For the First Time The More Death covered deaths in the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated population in the United States now it's fair to contextualize this because if we look at CDC data we do find that 80.06 percent of the United States population is vaccinated so there's more people in the vaccinated group than in the unvaccinated group but it's also true as we saw that there were more covert deaths in the vaccinated group for the first time now historically this is quite interesting September 2021 vaccinated people 23 percent of the coronavirus fatalities in people that were vaccinated January in February 2022 had gone up to 42 percent and as we saw now it's now gone up to 58 percent so we see that the risk of benefit analysis is changing the data is there before our eyes so a direct quote from the Kaiser foundation in the Washington Post we can no longer say this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated so uh Mr Biden's um not saying Mr Biden was wrong at the time but um times have changed we know protective effects Wayne and this needs to be taken into account when we look at risk benefit analysis in my view so this was a the Kaiser Foundation had conducted the analysis now A Center for Disease Control and prevention morbidity and mortality weekly report and this is this paper here from from the CDC so we're banging bang in the middle of official U.S government data safety monitoring a bivalent covid-19 vaccines now um August the 31st 2022. um the FDA authorized the bivalent booster for Pfizer and moderna um MRI encoding the spike protein from the original SARS coronavirus II and from Oregon ba4 and ba5 so it was this bivalent combination vaccine advisory committee on immunization uh practice recommended all persons over 12 receive an age-appropriate dose of the one of these vaccines that was their recommendation at the time and indeed still is now v-safe is a voluntary smartphone-based U.S safety surveillance system established by the CDC to monitor Adverse Events after covid vaccination and here we have it it's a v safe here now I don't actually know too much about that so if people that are using it in the states have been giving me some feedback on that that would actually be really uh really quite useful to get some information on that as of the 3rd of October I believe there were 10 million users of that period of time so it looks like it's being fairly well used are we getting better data now from the states it certainly is starting to look that way we're getting better quality data now vaccine Adverse Events reporting system is the other way of course and um information is also taken from that total data from the 31st of August the 23rd of October 14 odd million uh had received a Pfizer bioentec 8.2 million uh the modernist just over uh I think the modern is just over 18s so pretty large numbers that we're getting here now v-safe is a bit more confusing it looks like in this period of time there was 211 959 registrants age over the age of 12. slightly complicated as well because people under the age of 16 have to have supervision to use this program so quite how that's working out I don't really know in the states but registrants now it looks like these are people that had just started using the app in that period of time but as is often the case with CDC it's not that clear really the way the writers is not that not that transparent very often August 31st to 23rd of October is the period of time so um just that finite window of time 2022 reports in the week after vaccination be put so this is just a one week period now clearly you don't have to be a that clever to realize that this isn't going to pick up any potential long-term side effects we're not saying there are long-term side effects but any potential long-term side effects would by definition not be picked up in the first week so it is limited but anyway injection site reactions 60.8 that's not too surprising and it's not really concerning you get a soil arm of course um systemic reactions though this is more concerning to me 54.8 percent fewer than one percent and I think we'll see later it's about point eight percent uh received Medical Care so vsafe is reporting that some people did need uh medical opinions and medical care after the vaccination I don't think that's controversial it's a simple statement of fact uh vaccine Adverse Events reported system so uh 5542 reported Adverse Events of bivalent uh vaccine pretty small number really actually um are all the cases being reported to bear as of course not of course not uh but 4.5 of those were serious now remember this is of cases actually reported but still a reasonable proportion of the case is actually reported were classified as being serious Adverse Events now this is straight from the CDC Healthcare Providers and patients can be reassured that Adverse Events reported after bivalent boosters are consistent with those reported after monovalent vaccines do you see what they've done here they're comparing the bivalent boosters with the monovalent they're comparing two groups this is a relative risk not an absolute risk not saying the CDC are being disingenuous not at all but we they are reporting a relative risk not an absolute risk the absolute risk um they didn't put that in not given so it's a relative risk the absolute risk is going to be smaller than the relative risk how much smaller don't know they didn't say information not given disappointing from the CDC that they're just talking about relative risk the health impacts after covered vaccines uh vaccination are less frequent and less severe than those associated with covered illness again they're comparing people that have had illness with people that are vaccinated a relative risk not an absolute risk for the whole population not saying the CDC are being deliberately disingenuous here but it would have been better to have information on absolute risk as well as relative risk unfortunately the the absolute risk is not given but we know it will be smaller than the relative risk now the reference they use for this is interesting because they're making this broad statement here health health impacts which so Health impacts is a broad statement it applies to everything but the reference they give reference to there is quite specific now that's the reference there and uh it just refers to myocarditis pericarditis and combinations of those or multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children within seven days or 21 day risk window after the index date so again this is only a 14-day window that they're taking this information from and even then they're giving it as a relative risk I mean we're not saying the CDC are trying to give the wrong impression here but it just doesn't seem very well written to me um I I I know many relatively Junior academics who could write it much more clearly than this I think but we're not arguing with the numbers that the CDC are giving we're more uh commenting on their on their presentation okay comparison between and after uh vaccines after infection again they're comparing between the infections and uh after the vaccines two groups the relative risk between those absolute risk not given again so we see that the CDC are really giving relative risks comparing one group with another group not giving the absolute risk for the population as a whole CDC please you need to give both we need to know what the absolute risk is as well as the relative Risk please now a bit do a bit more detail here a review of these safe data from the mobile app again during August the 31st to 23rd of October same time period now this is what they say 211 212 000 nearly registrants these are presumably people that registered new newly in that period of time um they're covered a fairly good age group um a few to 12 to 17s as we see there more in the uh more in the older age groups but a good a good spread of Ages no complaints there at all uh quite a few of these 50 45 were the fourth dose and the fifth dose was 50.2 percent but of course we know that if these risks if the heart disease complications especially that the CDC does admit can occur after vaccines they're more likely after the second dose so again it's not giving a really good overall picture it's really quite specific to these um bivalent boosters that they're talking about uh in the week after rece receiving um a bivalent booster dose local injection site reactions now this is interesting uh 49.7 amongst the over 65s higher in the younger age group and the age group they use for comparison here is the 18 to 49. so younger people men and women getting more local uh reactions systemic reactions it's the same 18 to 49 getting 67.9 local reactions as opposed to 43.5 in the over 65s and when they look at the specific problems they see this same Trend that it's younger people that are getting more so 30 in older people 53 in younger people headache again 19.7 in older people 42.8 in younger people and again we see it the same with the muscle pain and the fever now it reported inability to complete normal daily activities was 10.6 amongst those over 65 and 19.8 percent in those aged 18 to 49 after vaccination so over 19 in that younger age group couldn't carry out their normal activities after the uh the booster vaccine I would have thought these are fairly fairly High numbers uh receipt of Medical Care was reported by 0.8 percent now 0.8 percent who took medical advice after vaccination I would have thought that is rather high but the CDC just report it they don't say anything about it they just say that's what it was I would have thought it's rather High 0.8 percent you can decide whether you think that's high low or indifferent again we're talking about risk benefit analysis so so there we go um I know that's fairly data intense um but it looks like um the risks after the risk of side effects after vaccination are becoming clearer with uh vsafe although I don't yet fully understand how it's working but it's good that these are being honestly reported and just combine that with the risk benefit analysis um that more covert deaths are now occurring in vaccinated versus on vaccinated despite the fact we have to be clear about it only 20 of the the population are unvaccinated so the vaccinated is a much larger group thankfully though uh covert cases are getting milder they still do cause some deaths as we'll see seeing some hospitalizations but the trend is that they're getting milder and I think these things should be taken into account where the risk benefit analysis so that's about as far as we can go on this talk I think lots of data there all the references are given I've been as honestly I've been as honest to the data as I can and um check the links and uh I'm pretty sure all of my numbers are accurate you'll have to decide uh how you interpret the information I have given you interesting don't want to say any more well could say more but probably best not say more thank you for watching

#COVID19 #Omicron #Coronavirus",2023-02-26,487587,11137,3263,UCG-iSMVtWbbwDDXgXXypARQ, [Music] welcome to another medcram covid-19 update today we're going to review a couple of papers that go into detail about autopsy findings in patients with disease in the heart related to Spike protein who have been previously vaccinated and specifically we're going to look at the brain and the heart in a particular case where someone died with Encephalitis we at medcram have talked extensively about the vaccines and not only their efficacy but also side effects and that goes back to April of 2021 when we covered the vaccine pause of the Johnson Johnson vaccine as it related to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis there was about six cases out of six million cases at that time and we also covered in September of 2021 in our video called coveted vaccines 10 key questions answered with Rhonda Patrick where we delved into the connection between mRNA vaccines and myocarditis as a pulmonary and critical care physician in full practice and on the faculty at two medical schools the side effects of medications are not foreign to me I use these medications all the time in the Intensive Care Unit and one of the medications that we see used often but also with side effects are blood thinners and so it was a privilege for me to be involved in research prior to the pandemic in 2017 where we looked at clinical outcomes of prolonged anticoagulation with rivaroxaban which is a blood thinner after unprovoked venous thromboembolism people who have blood clots and we don't know why they have blood clots get put on anticoagulation for a set period of time and then they are taken off of anticoagulation and so the question is how long should they be on it and whether or not they should be on it indefinitely so this was a real world study where we actually looked at patients who had discontinued anticoagulation which you see here in red and those that had continued anticoagulation clearly you can see that those that discontinue initial month period had a higher risk of venous thromboembolism than those who actually had stayed on it and so that's an important thing to see the efficacy of a medication but the flip side of it is to see the safety if we're getting benefit but also seeing worsening and side effects that's not good so we asked the same question of the same cohort except in a little different way we asked how many of these actually had major bleeding which of course we see all the time in the Intensive Care Unit when patients are put on blood thinners and as you can see here there really wasn't much difference so this was a boon this is basically a situation where there's very little risk of continuing the medication and if you continue the medication you reduce their chances of getting blood clots no-brainer in this one we came to the conclusion that continued riverox event in this case beyond the initial three or six month treatment period significantly lowered the risk of recurrent thromboembolism without a significant increase in major bleeding compared to the treatment that discontinued at three or six months and so the key here is that for any medical intervention that you're ever going to do you have to understand that there's always risk it would be very surprising to me to hear that perhaps there's never been any kind of side effects in any way shape or form to the vaccines I think that's just Preposterous any medical intervention that we do even drinking water to an excess can cause difficulties so when those side effects happen they have to be characterized and I think that's a legitimate thing and here we're going to talk about a case that was published back in October of 2022 titled a case report multifocal necrotizing Encephalitis and myocarditis after bnt-162b2 which is basically the Pfizer mRNA vaccine against covet 19. this was published recently in just October of last year it talks about a 76 year old gentleman who had gotten three doses of a covid-19 vaccine now the first one was actually the AstraZeneca the Oxford AstraZeneca which is not an mRNA vaccine but rather a DNA this one actually goes into the nucleus it is a Dental viral vaccine chimpanzee specifically according to this article when they interviewed the family they said that the patient on day one of that injection actually started to have cardiovascular side effects dose 2 which was in July of 2021 so a good two months later was actually the Pfizer vaccination and after some time it doesn't say how long after that but sometime after that there was behavioral and psychological changes and worsening of their Parkinson's disease so this patient had already been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease is not only a neurological degradation it's also a manifestation of mitochondrial dysfunction and it also has cardiovascular effects so there is a confounder there in the fact that Parkinson's disease is well known to cause cardiovascular issues and neurological issues of course and autonomic issues that's the shrine Drager aspect of the parkinsonian disease and then finally in December of 2021 so a full five months later the patient had the second dose of the Pfizer biotech vaccine two weeks after that had collapsed while eating apparently the patient was continuing to do worse ever since shortly after July and then again in one week where the patient actually collapsed it was felt that the patient had had an aspiration to money that's where the patient cannot control how they swallow which is actually very common in Parkinson's disease the food goes down the wrong way and causes a pneumonia and actually that was what was seen on autopsies we'll talk a little bit a family was quizzed about this there was no symptomatic coveted disease although the paper does not mention whether or not the patient was actually ever tested for SARS cov2 infection they don't mention it so I don't believe they probably were by the way you can find this article here in this link you can also search it by title let's get into this in a little bit more detail on the lungs microscopically there was cloudy secretions they're purulent spots brittle parenchyma bilateral muco purulent tracheal bronchitis dissol is basically code words in the anatomic pathology and Pulmonary discourse for basically pneumonia copious purulent secretions that is what I would see on a bronchoscopy if I was to Bronk this patient or put a scope down into the lungs and this is basically the manifestation of a significant and very bad pneumonia which in people who are immunocompromised don't really cause a lot of symptoms unfortunately people who are older and immunocompromise when they get pneumonia they don't complain of shortness of breath they don't complain of chest pain instead they become lethargic sleepy tired and pass away I see this often so yes bilateral broth and ammonia was known in the lower lungs there was multiple stages development of lobe filling with secretions and fragile parenchyma this is basically what you would see in chronic aspiration that's exactly what you would see in Parkinson's disease as well as the patient has difficulty controlling their ability to swallow things will silently aspirate down into the lungs no surprise there but some surprises here as we go along there was actually quite a lot of findings in the heart macroscopic examination revealed manifestations of acute and chronic cardiovascular insufficiency that just means basically coronary artery disease there was a pulmonary edema so when the heart doesn't work the fluid backs up into the brain congestion chronic hepatic congestion this is one of the organs right behind the heart renal tissue edema pituitary tissue edema evidence of shock kidney disorder and so forth and so forth there was hyper contraction of cardiomyocytes there was a number of histiocytic infiltrates this just means inflammation prominent endothelial swelling this is not what you want to see and also something called coagulation necrosis as well as fibrin clots so a lot of damage going on and what they did was they started to stain the tissues to look for two things specifically one is the spike protein and the nucleocapsulin protein now why that's important is because of the following when you have the virus the virus is made up of Spike proteins which sit on the surface and has been the target of vaccines for antibodies and then there are the nucleocapsid proteins which are inside which are not the target of vaccines and so this is what a virus would look like a true virus and the vaccine of course is just going to make Spike proteins or ask your cells to make those Spike proteins nucleocapsids if they are seen are basically indicative that the virus is there and that's the important part with understanding about nucleocapsids when they stain for Spike and when they stain for nucleocapsid this is a respiratory secretion in a patient who has been infected with SARS cov2 this is not the patient that we're talking about who died and is in the autopsy and is part of the paper this is in the paper but they're showing you a control that you can stain for this you can use an antibody which has the dye Amino bin benzodine marker on it and that's what you're seeing here with this brown so what you're seeing here is antibodies against the spike protein so we're seeing spike in respiratory secretions in a patient who is positive for SARS cov2 in those same respiratory secretions we're staining for nucleocapsid proteins these are in the respiratory epithelial cells in the respiratory secretions that's primarily where the infection is taking place so that's important to understand this is the control that they're doing in this situation now let's go back to the patient that died and was getting the autopsy so when they looked at the patient's brain they did the same sort of staining here they're looking for the presence of Spike protein in the brain of the deceased patient who they never tested for SARS cov2 but what did they find as you remember he was vaccinated three times and the purpose of those three vaccinations is to make Spike protein and what are they seeing here they're seeing Spike protein here in the brain so this is lighting up on this immunohistochemical staining for SARS cov2 Spike subunit one when they do the same thing for the nucleocapsid protein it's crickets they don't see anything there's no staining whatsoever in the brain why is there no nucleocapsid protein that is up for discussion but there isn't any as we can see here on this page let's go to another specimen from the same patient also brain again we're looking for the presence of Spike and as you can see here there is Spike protein Spike protein this blue arrow by the way is not Spike protein it is actually an individual glial cell so just ignore that that is not Spike protein Amino histochemical stating again brain deceased they're looking for nucleocapsid protein and again we don't see anything there's no nucleocaps in protein staining all right let's keep going now let's look at the hearts in the same deceased patient we're looking for Spike protein and we see again Spike protein staining on immunohistochemical staining we look for nucleocapsid protein and once again we do not see any nucleocapsulin protein in that individual so what did this lead the author of this paper that was published in October to say well first of all on the autopsy the final diagnosis was this is the official death diagnosis after the autopsy bilateral bronchopneumonia undeniable because the patient was probably silently aspirating Parkinson's disease necrotic Encephalitis based on what they saw and myocarditis as well let's see what the author says they say immunohistochemistry for SARS cov2 antigens which is the spike protein and the nucleocapsid revealed that the lesions with necrotizing Encephalitis that means dying part of the brain inflammation as well as acute inflammatory changes in the small blood vessels in the brain and heart were associated with abundant deposits of Spike protein subunitive one since the nucleocapsid protein of SARS cov2 was consistently absent it must be assumed that the presence of Spike protein in affected tissues was not due to an infection of SARS cov2 but rather to the transfection of tissues by the gene-based covid-19 vaccines the reason why they can safely say that this was not an infection from SARS cov2 is because there was no nucleocapsid proteins seen on the autopsy they go on importantly Spike protein could be only demonstrated in the areas with acute inflammatory reactions brain heart and small blood vessels and in particular the endothelial cells microglia and astrocytes this is strongly suggested that the spike protein may have played at least a contributing role to the development of the lesions and the course of the disease in the patient they go on based on the alteration pattern in the brain and heart it appear that the small blood vessels were especially affected in particularly the endothelium endothelial dysfunction is known to be highly involved in organ dysfunction during viral infections he does mention that this can happen in viral infections as it induces a pro-coagulant state microvascular leak and organ ischemia this is also the case for SARS cov2 infection so in other words this is looking like a SARS cov2 infection however he's not calling the SARS cov2 infection because there's no nucleocapsid proteins in the extra respiratory tissues they say here where a systemic exposure to the virus and a spike protein elicits a strong immunological reaction in which the endothelial cells play a crucial role leading to vascular dysfunction immunoth thrombosis and inflammation and those of you who know us at medcram we've talked extensively about this and how oxidative stress in the endothelial cells can lead to damage releasing on von Willebrand's fractor which causes these small micro clots in the circulation of the lungs and causing hypoxia that's probably what leads to happy hypoxics he goes on although there was no history of covid-19 for this patient immunochemistry for SARS cov2 antigens was performed Spike protein could indeed be demonstrated in the years of acute inflammation in the brain particularly within the capital endothelium and the small blood vessels of the heart remarkably however the nucleocapsid was uniformly absent during an infection with the virus both proteins should be expressed and detected together he says it doesn't give a reference for that interestingly but it makes logical Sense on the other hand the gene-based covid-19 vaccines encode only the spike protein and therefore the presence of Spike protein only but no nucleocapsid protein in the heart and brain on the current case can be attributed to vaccination rather to infection this agrees with the patient's history which includes three vaccine injections the first one was a DNA the last two were RNA and the third one just three weeks before his death but no positive laboratory clinical diagnosis of the infection doesn't sound like the patient actually had a covid-19 test which could be asymptomatic so the conclusion illusion was numerous cases of encephalitis and encephalomyelitis have been reported in connection with the gene-based covid-19 vaccines with many being considered causally related to vaccination however this is the first report to demonstrate the presence of the spike protein actually in these encephalitic lesions and to attribute it to vaccination rather than infection these findings corroborate the causative role of gene-based covid-19 vaccines and this diagnostic approach is relevant to potentially vaccine-induced damage to other organs as well he's making the point here that the absence of the nucleocapsid is the cinquequinone to speak the Latin that this is definitely vaccination contrast this with this paper this is a paper that was published in the annals of diagnostic pathology its original contribution notice here that this was available online even though it was published in October around the same time as the other paper the results of this paper were available since May of last year let's find out what this paper says they say here cardiac manifestations are common in severe coven 19. so these these are looking at covid-19 deaths these are deaths that are attributed to covid-19 and they're looking actually at 11 of these and 11 controls and what they're able to do is something called insight to hybridization which is a way of measuring RNA samples and they're also using exactly the same technique that they used in the first paper which is immunohistochemistry for viral proteins and what did they do they looked for ace2 expression which we're not going to get into because that's not really the purpose of this they did see that ace2 expression was 10 times greater than the heart tissues of cases and controls with obesity or type 2 diabetes I think that's really interesting but what they found is these are covid-19 cases that died and what they found starting right here is interesting however in each case abundant SARS Kobe 2 Spike protein was evidence but SARS cov2 RNA and nucleocapsid protein were rarely detected in situ in any covid-19 heart let me repeat that again here these are known to have covid-19 from source cov2 even in these cases in non-respiratory tissue whereas they found plenty of Spike protein they did not find nucleocapsid protein as well what they conclude though is that the viral Spike protein is endocytized by macrophages in the lung and are carried to the heart and the brain and other organs and that's the reason why you're seeing the spike protein and not the nucleocapsid so let's take a look at some of the data here here's what's called a western blot from proteins extracted either from the nasopharynx which is NP that's part of the respiratory where you'll see a lot of nucleocapsidin Spike with no evidence of SARS cov2 or a positive result so here's the nasopharynx it's negative and you can see here we don't see any proteins here's the nasopharynx with someone with a very high copy count of SARS cov2 and what you see here is you see this band and you see this band this blue band at the top is the spike protein and this Brown Band down here is the nucleocapsid protein notice that when you look at the nasal pharynx and you have low copy count you can see still the spike protein but this nasal frenchial sample of nucleocapsid protein is almost non-existent which means that even in respiratory tissue where there's a high copy count you might not pick up nucleocapsid protein even if you are infected with SARS cov2 all right let's move on to the nucleocapsid proteins specifically so here we have nucleocapsid protein and this is the band that you want to look at because that is the nucleocapsid protein these are covered lungs covered lung one covered lung two notice in normal lung we do not see that nucleocaps at protein by the way these are just reference lines let's take a look at these covid organs we have covid liver organ one there is no band if we look in the brain in this coveted patient no band covid cns-1 no band how about the spleen in covid no band of course the normal CNS there's no band either they said their nucleocaps of protein is only evident in the lung samples and nasopharynx that's respiratory that's where it divides and it's not found in any of the other organs tested what about Spike maybe it's just not there maybe the spike isn't there either maybe it just didn't go it was a mild infection no because most of the covid-19 heart samples showed a band that analyzed for viral spikes so where's the spike protein this is Spike this is Spike so in the lung we see spike in the heart we see a light spike in this heart we see a light spike in this heart we see a light spike in this coveted heart too we see a light Spike pre-covet heart no Spike spike can go to extra respiratory organs but we have not seen an example here where the nucleocaps that goes to extra respiratory organs in SARS Kobe 2. they say here quote interestingly only the covid-19 lung and nasopharyngeal samples showed a signal for the nucleocapsid protein specifically 0 out of 11 cardiac cases were positive for the nucleocapsid protein whereas 7 out of 11 were positive for the viral Spike and the envelope proteins they did not show that data in this but that's what they showed now let's take a look at the immunohistochemical staining which is what they did in that first study and let's see what we see here we see lung do we see nucleocapsid absolutely we see nucleocapsid in the same way that we would normally see it but do we see heart Spike yes these little pink things are heart Spike well if we're seeing heart Spike we should also see heart nucleocapsid right because this is a viral infection but we see crickets here we see nothing there is no nucleocapsid in viral infections so what do they say they say the source of the endogenous Spike protein in severe covid-19 would likely be the extremely high copy viral load seen in the lungs of these patients they're saying here that in the lungs of patients this is where the virus is replicating so much that you're going to be able to see both Spike and nucleocapsid the virus in the lung induces a micro angiopathy that causes viral degeneration and is a logical source of viral Spike proteins entering the circulation this is exactly what we've been talking about and docking in organs with a high perivascular bed and ace2 population that would be Hearts preliminary data suggests that the viral Spike protein alone with the Matrix and envelope proteins are carried by macrophages in the circulation this could explain in many studies which have shown that the viral Spike protein per se or more accurately the S1 subunit the spike protein which has the RBD sequence for ace2 can demonstrate cytotoxic effects so you may never see the nucleocapsid going to distant organs that are non-respiratory because it's the spike that gets picked up by the macrophages and not the nucleocapsid so remember when we go back to that first study remember there was a control and here we saw a spike in the respiratory secretions and here we saw nucleocapsid in the respiratory secretions but we never saw this for non-respiratory secretions remember that the author of the first study says since the nucleocapsid protein of stars cov2 was consistently absent it must be assumed that the presence of Spike protein in affected tissues was not due to infection I'm not sure if that is a logical assumption anymore based on the data that we have now and that was actually available at the time of publication even back as far as May of 2022 it seems very likely in fact that you're not going to pick up the presence of nucleocapsid proteins in non-respiratory organs of the body in patients who are infected with SARS cov2 let's go back to our case study again I would be very surprised if there wasn't a single case out there or multiple cases even where there has been significant injury or even death from an intervention right I see this all the time in my Intensive Care Unit I have patients that come in with head bleeds because they're on anticoagulation and clearly as a result of the anticoagulation that they're on but the Hope was is that that anticoagulation would prevent a stroke and indeed we know that every year thousands and thousands of Strokes are prevented because people are put on blood thinners but we also get maybe a few tens 20s 30s of people who have head bleeds and we look at that risk benefit and so I think it's important to continue to look for these things but we also have to look at the data and make the analysis here to see whether or not in fact this is going on and this is what I've done looking at data and actually telling you things that could falsify my interpretation conclusions in this situation the patient had a mRNA vaccine dose 3 and it was two weeks later that the patient collapsed and then one week later the patient died so three weeks after this basically this mRNA Pfizer vaccine was given so the question is if this is actually happening we should see a signal after people have been vaccined so I go again to the graph of vaccination versus excess deaths here up on the top we see daily SARS cov2 infections during the beginning of the pandemic we have the first wave this is a scale going to 1 million you can see here the first wave was about 300 000 and this Delta wave here again was probably maybe 250 000. this was up here almost a million we didn't catch all of these people some of them weren't tested but we tested as many as we could and we can kind of get relative looks at these things down here we have excess mortality so this is anybody who died and the thing I like about excess mortality not none coveted mortality it doesn't matter what's put on the death certificate whatever's on the death certificate is on the death certificate all you need is a death certificate and a date and it goes in here so it doesn't matter if the patient is misdiagnosed as having covet or not having coveted or they died of encephalitis and they didn't think it was from covet it's all going in here it's all being captured notice here that the same pattern of SARS cov2 matches the same pattern here of this excess wave happening exactly at the time that it should happen maybe two to three weeks after it we have the same thing here with the Delta wave and we see again here because that Delta wave was just so virulent we see it exactly popping up two weeks later because it takes about two weeks for people to die once they get infected from Stars Kobe 2. the Omicron wave once again so we see here that the Peaks completely line up superimposed on top of that and reversed for ease of looking at here is the number of vaccinations whereas we had about 300 000 Stars Kobe 2 cases here in a single day we vaccinated three and a half million people over 10 times the number of people got a spike protein from the vaccine then the people that got a spike protein from the first wave of SARS Kobe 2. and so if this is what we're seeing as a result of excess deaths from the first wave we should see something approximately three weeks later down approximately right here as a result of vaccination with an mRNA vaccine I'm not saying that it doesn't happen as I said I would be very surprised if there was absolutely no risk associated with a intervention there's risk associated with every intervention but what I am saying is that whatever the magnitude of that risk is has to fit underneath this curve at that point if we're talking about an immediate effect from SARS cov2 vaccinations If This Were happening I would have expected depending on the magnitude I would have expected something to look like this you know be a little bit delayed or I would expect it's something to look like this or if it was less in magnitude or even less in magnitude something that would look like that when this is the number of I have it upside down here right so that's the peak this here is the peak of all vaccinations in the United States we vaccinated in one day on this day three and a half million people doesn't mean that there's not long-term effects but I'm not seeing an acute Association here at least on this curve going back to the publication that I was involved with we have to realize that there is always going to be side effects and we can see that here that as time goes on regardless of if you're on the anticoagulation or not on the anticoagulation there are going to be people who have major bleeding events but the key to understanding whether or not and how you can prevent those is not to compare somebody who would never have an event with someone who did have an event you have to compare someone who did have an event with someone who didn't get the intervention and that's where it's important to be able to look at things epidemiologically and with studies and with data the other thing that this shows is that sometimes things may seem logical but this is the reason we press for evidence-based medicine even though something may seem logical or it may seem like it makes sense like in this case it would seem logical that if you see the spike protein without the nucleocapsid that it would make sense that since the vaccine only makes the spike protein without the nucleocapsid this would implement Kate the vaccine however there could be other factors that are preventing that nucleocapsid protein from getting out of the respiratory tissue and into non-respiratory tissue organs the second paper highlights that even though this thing made sense it may not be the case and without my condolences to all of these people that had perished from one reason or another that were used in these studies and with the families as well I know all too well the impacts here we talk about statistics and numbers but each one of these people have families loved ones and again my condolences I am a Frontline doctor that works in the Intensive Care Unit so I understand the actual reality of all of these issues and with that this concludes I just wanted to remind you to subscribe turn on notifications and leave a comment below about what you think and I also invite you to watch this video on the ability of near infrared light to neutralize toxicity from Spike protein regardless of its source in this video we talk about the toll-like receptor 4 dependent hyperinflammation and how near infrared light can actually ameliorate this toxicity and don't

42,noNa3WUGpC8,Disease X,"Vaccine and drug inquire … postponed

https://covid19.public-inquiry.uk/news/update-on-the-inquirys-investigation-into-vaccines-and-therapeutics/

Public hearings for the Inquiry’s fourth investigation, into vaccines and therapeutics (Module 4), will be rescheduled.

The hearings were provisionally scheduled to take place in the summer of 2024. They will now take place at a later date,

to enable organisations to prioritise providing evidence for the Inquiry’s third investigation on the impact of the pandemic on healthcare (Module 3).

There will be no preliminary hearing for Module 4 on 8 February.

Covid Inquiry's probe into vaccines is delayed indefinitely as chair admits postponement will be 'disappointing for some'

Hearings for fourth module of the official inquiry were set to begin this summer

A long-awaited probe into the development of Covid vaccines and drugs was today postponed indefinitely.

Baroness Heather Hallett

'I know the postponement of these hearings will be disappointing for some’

'I wish to reassure you that we will hold these hearings as soon as possible.'

Baroness Hallett, to ensure the inquiry doesn't run beyond summer 2026.

Thought to have cost taxpayers £145million already

Disease X is looming

https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/07/diseasex-pandemic-preparedness-cepi/

The world needs to be better prepared to tackle a future pandemic,

By mapping viruses with the potential to become the next “Disease X”, the global health community and governments can be more responsive the next time a pandemic looms

Global collaboration and adequate funding are needed to improve pandemic preparedness and ensure fast action to keep a viral outbreak at bay

“You can get a long way towards being able to produce something that will target a novel virus before that virus even emerges.”

“It’s a virus that we don't know yet, but we do know is out there, and we do know has the potential to spill over from an animal population potentially into humans, perhaps mutate or adapt itself and then begin spreading and killing people faster than we can contain it.”

… carrying out research and vaccine development for known viral “families” that could impact humans – of which there are 25 – would give humanity a decided advantage over the next Disease X.",2024-01-13,2431481,98742,16147,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg, hello warm welcome to this talk Saturday the 13th of January now I want to be talking about disease X in a minute from a small radio station in Switzerland called radio Davos I think it was more on that shortly but a bit of a disappointment first this is from the UK Co inquiry and unfortunately the uh public hearings for the inquiry fourth investigation into vaccines and therapeutic module will be rescheduled the hearings were provisionally scheduled to take place in the summer of 2024 they will now take place at a later date and then there's some rationale given there which you may choose to accept or not to enable organizations to prioritize providing evidence for the inquirer's third investigation into the impact of the pandemic on healthare well I would have thought um they knew what order this was in before they did this but never mind that's what they've said this is from the site here um this is from baroness Hallet who's the chair of the inquiry I know that the postponement of these hearings will be a disappointment for some yes it will and I think there's a degree of urgency as I'll point out um I want to ensure our hearings of uh in 2024 are as effective as possible well yes and I recognize the increasing pressure on organizations to respond to requests and provide information to the inquiry now I would have thought they'd known that when they scheduled the inquiry at the first place um maybe um they've had to reschedule this because there was some new information came to light we we we're basically not told which is disappointing but we are assured it's going to be finished by the summer of 2026 so let's hope there is time to squeeze in this rather important module because it's not on as scheduled unfortunately so I had been genuinely looking forward to that and it's pretty disappointing that that is now being delayed now I want to give you something from the mail online now that I'm just hoping they don't know more than we do about it because they actually say uh Co inquirers probing to vaccines is delayed indefinitely indefinitely they're saying well let's hope that's not the case uh as chair admits postponement will be a disappointment for some yes um hearing for the fourth module of this is from the from the mail online now hearing of the fourth module of the official inquiry to be what what it was set of the official inquiry were set to begin this summer a long awaited probe into the development of covid vaccines and drugs was today postponed and again they say indefinitely here so let's hope this is not the case baroness Hallet says I know the postponement will be a disappointment I wish to reassure you that we will hold these hearings as soon as possible good we'll look out for it uh but we're still going to be finished by the summer of 2026 so let's hope it's time now this inquiry has cost you and me the plait Ariat the pans so far it's cost us 145 million um quite incredible now um I'm going to talk about disease X in a minute but just before we do that um this is just a completely unrelated uh article I was reading in the Guardian newspaper from November 2022 this is Paul Burl who was a royal Butler and Paul borrow reported a conversation with her majesty the queen prior to her sad recent uh departure uh and Paul Bor reports that the queen said this Queen Elizabeth said this there are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge so uh it looks like uh there are powers at work uh but we don't know what they are so in Donald Rumsfeld terms this would be a known unknowns I guess now I want to talk now about disease X which is on this website here this is the uh World economic Forum site as far as I can uh derive disease X this is how we should prepare for the next big virus wow so uh this you can listen to it here or you can um read it there it's all very easy to understand while being rather uh difficult to understand now disease X um I've been teaching this sort of thing pretty well fulltime since 1990 I know I've been a clinical nurse since 1975 when I was a first year student and um I'd never heard of this disease X so I looked at some of my books because when I wrote my book I couldn't remember putting it in so it wasn't in there but I could easily miss it couldn't I so I did check in uh Reuben's pathology these are the definitive texts see it in there either uh so I checked in G and Hall superb physiology book not in there either um uh porth's pathophysiology um not in there either it's fairly thick book you think it could be in there somewhere um you get the idea not in that one can hardly pick this one up path physiology all these standard textbooks um not in there so it must be a new disease can't say I like the sound of a new disease we've had a new disease already haven't we anyway um this is just I want to give you some highlights from the um the radio Davos uh talk disease X is looming the world needs to be better prepared to tackle a future pandemic and you'll see here that the text is from the world economic Forum site um they go on to say uh by mapping viruses with the potential to become the next disease X the global Health Community and governments uh the governments and governments can be more responsive the next time a pandemic looms looks like they're anticipating another pandemic here Global collaboration and adequate funding are needed to improve pandemic preparedness and ensure fast action to keep a viral outbreak at Bay uh it says you can get a long way being able to produce something not quite sure what's being produced but you can produce something or other something or other that will Target a novel virus before that virus even emerges I assume here they're referring to repurpose drugs which could be rolled out very quickly and uh very cheaply and may be efficacious against a range of conditions maybe that's what they mean but anyway they're going to produce something um can't read too much into that all they say is something could even mean a vaccine I don't know whatever they mean there um anyway that will Target a novel virus before that that virus even emerges um it's a virus we don't know yet but we do know it's out there uh do we but we do know it's out there now unfortunately much to my annoyance and your annoyance I felt um compelled to delete yesterday's um video my apologies the the the trick is to live to fight another day um that's what we aim for but the video I was doing yesterday was examining a particular virus uh that was uh experimentally used to infect mice caused a disease of the brain and on at the end of the study none of the mice at the end of of the study were alive anymore none of them were alive anymore um because a certain event had happened to them that made them not alive um and that virus my understanding from reading of the paper was it had been it evolved in cell cultures in a laboratory so as a result of going through cell coaches in a laboratory the function of the virus had been uh had been increased it would appear it became a more functional virus there was a function and uh there was potentially um an increase uh maybe even a gain uh anyway but but um we know it's out there so they know it's out there uh obviously they don't know a precise geographical location but they know it's out there uh and we know it has the potential to spill over from animal populations potentially into humans well yeah there can be natural spill over vents of course there can also be other origins of viruses perhaps mutate or adapt itself and then begin spreading and killing people faster than we can contain it um carrying out research and oh and vaccine development carrying out research and vaccine development for no own viral families could impact humans of which there are 25 viral families they're saying uh would give Humanity a decided advantage over the next disease X so who who knows maybe the world economic Forum will be good enough to uh develop a vaccine for as great unwashed so it's all ready for us um I'll leave it with you read the article for yourself it's all there um it's all there yep from Radio Davos quite concerning really a disease X they seem to think it's coming um that's hope they don't know too much more than us we'll leave it there thank you for watching

COVID-19 mRNA vaccines deliver directions, in the form of messenger RNA, or mRNA, so cells make the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This protein educates our immune system, so it produces antibodies that can neutralize similar versions of this coronavirus during future encounters. The mRNA-containing lipid particles are taken up by specialized immune system cells. See more: http://COVIDVaccineAnswers.org

Book club: http://www.lifeslibrarybookclub.com/",2021-04-23,217439,17686,3062,UCGaVdbSav8xWuFWTadK6loA," Good morning John, here in the
US the moment has arrived. Everyone over the age of 16
can get the COVID vaccine. Over 200 million doses have been
administered, and around 40% of people have gotten at
least one dose. And yet. The graph of people
getting vaccinated everyday, it’s starting to stop do this,
where it’s going higher every day, it’s starting to go less and less
everyday. And the reason for this is largely younger people,
by which I mean people under the age of 50 not getting their
vaccine immediately. It could be that you, watching this video
right now are one of those people, or maybe you know one of those
people and you want to send them this video. So I’m going to go,
very quickly, through a few of the reasons why I’ve heard young
people specifically say they haven’t gotten vaccinated yet. And first, I think tremendously under examined, is just that like, it’s a slightly
unpleasant task that I don’t want to add to my list of
things to do. And since now you can do it at any time, people
are putting it off. Schedules are busy, and you know
that the day after your second dose you might feel pretty crummy,
I certainly did. So why not put it off to a more convenient time? But as with all procrastinations, look there’s not really a better time than now. But you also have to look at what the trade off is, like we’re
dealing with mild inconvenience that is scheduled versus unscheduled
major inconvenience and maybe worse. The symptoms of COVID suck
no matter how old you are. COVID does kill young people, it just
doesn’t kill very many of them. The hospitalization rates are pretty high,
and spending a bunch of time at the hospital is so bad. It’s also like a burden on healthcare workers who are
overburdened enough right now. There are also a bunch of long
term side effects from getting COVID that we don’t understand super well
right now, and those sometimes also happen when people
get very mild cases. But even if you get none of that,
it’s still really inconvenient to get COVID. You feel like crap, you
have to quarantine. It’s inconvenient for you and everyone else
in your world. So why not decrease the odds 
of that happening by 95%? But maybe you’re not worried about yourself at all. It’s still really
important to recognize that every person except like the first
person who gets COVID, gets it from somebody else. And it’s very
easy to not know when you are the person who got someone sick
because a lot of people get sick by being exposed to people who
are infected but don’t even know that they are. If you’re
vaccinated, the odds of you getting another person sick
go way, way, way down. And then much more unlikely,
but even scarier. Every one of the new COVID variants that we’re talking
about right now, every one of them evolved inside of a person. And we will never know who that person was. But I think we all can agree that
we don’t want to be that person. Nobody wants to be the breeding ground
from which a new variant of COVID emerges. You can prevent yourself
from being that person by getting a vaccine. Now finally I’ve also heard some people saying that, you know,
I got COVID, or I think I got COVID, or I might as well just get COVID
and I can get immunity that way. Leaving aside the fact that it is a big deal  and you might infect someone 
for who it is an even bigger deal, immunity from getting COVID is 
much less effective at preventing future COVID infections than the vaccines are. So if you’ve
had COVID or you think you might have, or if you think, I’ll just
get it and get immune that way, none of that works. You need a vaccine. I understand that every person is
experiencing this differently, and also that it’s frustrating. And annoying. Like this things has been in charge of our lives for too long. And for many people, a vaccine feels like a way of taking back
control. And for others, it feels like more control that they’re
giving up. For me, it felt like taking back control. And I think to some extent, because the vaccines are a
really big deal, and they are such a triumph of hard work
and human ingenuity, that it’s easy to think, like, I have to
think really hard about this. It’s something to worry about,
and to fret over. But my friends, it’s really not. The decision here
is simple, it is both a big deal but also not a big deal. It’s just not a
big deal. So if you need one final reason to go get a vaccine,
hi I’m Hank Green. I make science videos. I’ve been making
educational videos for people for free on the internet for over 10 years,
and maybe you want to do me a favor! It’s super easy,
there’s a link in the description you can click on it, put in your
zip code, and make your appointment for getting your COVID vaccine. Put it in your phone, then go do it. And get a free donut. John, I’ll see you
on Tuesday."

According to the CDC, all COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States are effective at preventing COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can offer some protection from future illness, sometimes called “natural immunity,” but the level of protection people get from having COVID-19 may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age.  

Getting a COVID-19 vaccination is also a safer way to build protection than getting sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without you having to experience sickness. Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can cause severe illness or death, and we can’t reliably predict who will have mild or severe illness. 

If you get sick, you can spread COVID-19 to others. You can also continue to have long-term health issues after COVID-19 infection.  While COVID-19 vaccines are effective, studies have shown some declines in vaccine effectiveness against infections over time, especially when the Delta variant was circulating widely.  

The mRNA vaccines do not contain any live virus. Instead, they work by teaching our cells to make a harmless piece of a “spike protein,” which is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. After making the protein piece, cells display it on their surface. Our immune system then recognizes that it does not belong there and responds to get rid of it. When an immune response begins, antibodies are produced, creating the same response that happens in a natural infection.  

In contrast to mRNA vaccines, many other vaccines use a piece of, or weakened version of, the germ that the vaccine protects against. This is how the measles and flu vaccines work. When a weakened or small part of the virus is introduced to your body, you make antibodies to help protect against future infection.

While COVID-19 vaccines are effective, studies have shown some declines in vaccine effectiveness against infections over time, especially when the Delta variant was circulating widely. According to the CDC layered prevention strategies — like staying up to date on vaccines and wearing masks — can help prevent severe illness and reduce the potential for strain on the healthcare system. 

Wear a mask with the best fit, protection, and comfort for you.  If you are in an area with a high COVID-19 Community Level and are ages 2 or older, wear a well-fitting mask indoors in public.  

If you are sick and need to be around others, or are caring for someone who has COVID-19, wear a mask. 

If you are at increased risk for severe illness, or live with or spend time with someone at higher risk, speak to your healthcare provider about wearing a mask at medium COVID-19 Community Levels. 

In April 2021, increased cases of myocarditis and pericarditis were reported in the United States after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna). Data from multiple studies show a rare risk for myocarditis and/or pericarditis following receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. These rare cases of myocarditis or pericarditis have occurred most frequently in adolescent and young adult males, ages 16 years and older, within 7 days after receiving the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna). 

There has not been a similar reporting pattern observed after receipt of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (Johnson & Johnson). CDC continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination for everyone 6 months of age and older. 

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and CDC have determined that the benefits (such as prevention of COVID-19 cases and its severe outcomes) outweigh the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis after receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

covid-19 varied by the number of covid-19 vaccine doses previously received and the higher the number of vaccines previously received the higher the risk of Contracting covid-19 popular YouTuber and comedian who has been a prominent skeptic over vaccines and mandates throughout the pandemic Jimmy Dore tweeted FYI it's not a vaccine it's a failed experiment we are the guinea pigs all right take these findings with a grain of salt but this is interesting because the first this first came out earlier this year I think around February and there was a lot of pushback at that time part of the pushback was that it was not a peer-reviewed study it was just what's known as a preprint now we're talking about this again because it has been peer reviewed and the parts of the study that raised a red flag to some vaccine Skeptics are still there in the study yeah yeah go ahead yeah so the the the authors of the study note that this is unexpected like I don't think these are people who were these are not like anti-vaccine people who are setting out to disprove the efficacy of vaccines and so so they're saying there was an association of increased risk of covid-19 with higher number of Prior vaccine doses importantly and it was not because so you could rationalize why that might be the case well maybe people who are getting the most um Jabs the most doses of vaccine are people who are older and higher at risk anyway so then yes they're more likely to get coveted because they're higher risk so it would just be incidental that they're more likely to get a lot of vaccines and they're more likely to get covered but that's not one doesn't have anything to do with the other however that is not the case here as they lay out of the Cleveland Clinic they're like okay we see why you might think that but the um the yeah that most of the people in this study were young people some young people can be at a high risk of covet if you have a pre-existing condition but you would not expect that to be most of the people and so they're saying that that really makes this finding um unexpected um yeah the risk yeah the people despite this their risk of acquiring covid-19 the people who had fewer injections was lower than those who'd received a larger number of Prior vaccine doses so it's worth noting that the overall conclusions of the study is that the vaccines do work to buy valence specific valent vaccine work to lower the incidence of covid right they work that this is not a the study is not saying that in that ultimate conclusion should be taken into account the question is whether at a certain point requiring or suggesting that people get multiple vaccines at a certain point that they're whether there is diminishing returns so there's we should distinguish between getting a vaccine or incrementally boosted versus a certain volume that seems to have an unexpected effect the paper also notes that this is not the only study to find a possible association with more prior vaccine Doses and higher risk of covet 19. during an Omicron wave in Iceland individuals who had previously received two or more doses were found to have a higher odds of reinfection than those who had received fewer than two doses of vaccine and an unadjusted analysis and it goes through some um kind of technical scientific reasons why this might be happening something called immune imprinting and some stuff with the spike protein that I think is beyond the technical uh know how of us here but it is being interpreted as validating some concerns and some anecdotal evidence that people have had that folks in their lives who got more vaccinations and more boosts seem to have succumbed to the virus more frequently than those people who only maybe got the first round or what have you again I could see for a very at-risk population or the elderly you might say well even if this is increasing the chance you get coveted honestly the odds of getting you know when a wave comes through you have good odds of getting it anyway you want if you're an elderly person or immuno compromised person the protection from the dose is more important than some slightly increased odds that you would get it in the first place the odds being that you were going to get it anyway however to you know to repeatedly boost younger people who are healthy otherwise over and over again they might be saying well you know if I get it I get it but I'd rather not I'd rather not increase my risk of getting it because if I get it I'm probably gonna not have such a bad time with it and maybe I was you know you were maybe you were vaccinated originally and we're just talking about subsequent doses or maybe you had it before they're actually in this paper it does say that um the multivariate analysis also found the more recent the last prior covet episode the lower risk of covid saying again that's the you know some kind of enduring natural immunity um and I just keep thinking how you know the the places in our society that are still trying to take this decision away from individuals like University campuses where the bivalent some of them is going to be required still in the fall uh that that can like how how naive and and and and unscientific it is to take that decision out of out of people and their doctors and then also the kind of the attempts to suppress um criticism of vaccines you know calling it all misinformation that has occurred online and and Elsewhere for the last three years so short-sighted so a couple of things first it should be noted that this was an unexpected observation in this study and they in the study say that the it needs to be steady further uh so that is you know it's we We I Wouldn't draw too many hard and fast conclusions though I take Jimmy Dora's point that it does feel like if there is in fact a negative result like making people more vulnerable to getting covered and they're just saying well we should have studied this more I can understand people feeling like they are guinea pigs in this situation right that there there should have been more of this kind of research that happened earlier but there was a real hesitancy to do so when we were in the throes of the pandemic but it's also worth noting that the objective or the biggest gain of getting vaccinated we've now known for a long time is preventing hospitalization so this study is talking about whether or not people are more susceptible to access coming to the virus but there's a whole separate conversation about whether or not it's preventing you from having the worst outcomes here so for young people who already tend not to have the worst outcomes I think that's a really interesting question that you're raising about college campuses and the like for even older people there could be a calculation that says sure you might be this percent more likely to catch covid than you might not if you had gotten multiple boosters but if you hadn't gotten boosted you might end up in the hospital or be more likely to die so it's better just to basically like take on more softer waves than to wait for the one big one to take this is yet more or this is another point of data in the column of the group of people for which it is least justifiable if you think it's justifiable at all to require them to get vaccinated is actually the population where the the requirements were most likely school-aged populations sure yeah and I that's just that's so people are going to feel I think so gaslit about all this stuff saying again the the initial promise may be implicitly I guess but a lot of people in the media reported it was that everybody has to get vaccinated we're really encouraging it where we're not requiring it outright we're encouraging it because this is how we're going to stop the spread and we're going to you know get rid of covid because when we have her immunity because you're no longer going to be able to transmit it or get it when you're vaccinated that didn't pan out and like on and on and on and on and on yeah that I I you know not under selling the vaccines I understand that they are the findings are still that they're very protective against severe decent disease and death for at-risk populations but the the logic of the requirements was really for the public health rationale was really on stopping cases yeah I totally get get that and I agree that that was the rationale but it hasn't been out for some time yeah and so I just think from a public health perspective as people are considering these kind of studies it's important to really emphasize that the goal the stated goal for some time now has been to prevent hospitalization and death and that vaccines including this study show that there is a significant benefit when the vaccine is correlated to the stream that's happening it does effectively lower hospitalization uh in depth here right but again you could have a more targeted even based on this study you could say are you in this risk category yeah look at this study you would benefit from vaccination on net you would benefit because even if you're increasing your likelihood of getting covid the protection is is important for severe indices and death you are in this this categorization you're a healthy young person and really all you're doing by getting you know your fifth or something dose is making it a slightly more likely you're going to get covered or whatever it is and that doesn't make as much sense for you and and we and we have not had that Approach at all and people are going to feel anything just valuably outraged and I think that people like Jimmy Dore who are saying well where was all this research why hasn't there been more research about what's going on with covid I think are completely right and I think there also needs to be a sensitivity to and frustration about the lack of research with respect to Long covet as well whatever you think about it the or whether or not it's credible or whether you're skeptical about how how real it is as a phenomenon the reality is that we are out of ignorance about what's going on allowing the government to basically ratchet back any protections any long-term health care support for people with long covet any way to protect protect themselves against it and also insulating the manufacturers of vaccines from any liability there's a whole mixed bag of shielding that's happening for people who are going to have outcomes one way or the other and I do think that before we are overly interested in saying well I don't think that long covet is a thing because it's being used as a pretext for the government to have overreach also downplaying the possibility of long covet having this effect that's being used as an excuse for the government to not have any responsibility for policies that may have set up a significant portion of the American public to be dealing with a crisis a Health crisis where we don't have Universal Health Care long after the government has washed its hands of all of it well I mean as you know I remain um extremely skeptical of a lot of long-covered claims however if and I I don't know what should be studied I mean it should be studied and I don't really know what people who are very worried about law and covid I'm not sure what the state of their claims are with respect to like is it worse if you've gotten a more coveted more times or is it is it correlated with the severity of the infection severity of so if you've gotten it if you get covered a bunch of times but none of them were severe you're not going to get it's no it's also correlated with a number so that's what I'm getting at so so a vaccine that makes you if you're again in a population where you're not at severe risk of it's going to make you more likely to get it maybe from a long coveted perspective that is I mean that kind of cuts both ways but that's why I agree with everyone who's looking for profound scripture more more more research and more studies and I do think there is a real issue with there being so much delay here in getting some of this kind of information out well we'll have more Rising right after this foreign [Music]

But for some people, life has changed dramatically following their COVID-19 vaccination. 

The German biotech firm BioNTech is facing compensation claims for alleged side effects from its Comirnaty vaccine. Millions of people in Germany received the jab, which authorities say saved many lives in the pandemic.

The plaintiff, who is not being publicly named under German privacy laws, alleges that the vaccine caused her to suffer upper-body pain, swollen extremities, fatigue and sleeping disorder. She is suing BioNTech for at least €150,000 ($161,500) in damages for bodily harm as well as compensation for unspecified material damage, according to the court. A lawyer representing her, Tobias Ulbrich, told Reuters news agency that he would challenge assessments made by EU and German health regulators that the Comirnaty jab had a positive risk-benefit profile.

The rare events — identified early in the pandemic — included a higher risk of heart-related inflammation from mRNA shots made by Pfizer Inc., BioNTech SE, and Moderna Inc., and an increased risk of a type of blood clot in the brain after immunization with viral-vector vaccines such as the one developed by the University of Oxford and made by AstraZeneca Plc.

The viral-vector jabs were also tied to an increased risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome, a neurological disorder in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nervous system.

than those who had received fewer than two doses of vaccine and an unadjusted analysis and it goes through some um kind of technical scientific reasons why this might be happening something called immune imprinting and some stuff with the spike protein that I think is beyond the technical uh know how of us here but it is being interpreted as validating some concerns and some anecdotal evidence that people have had that folks in their lives who got more vaccinations and more boosts seem to have succumbed to the virus more frequently than those people who only maybe got the first round or what have you again I could see for a very at-risk population or the elderly you might say well even if this is increasing the chance you get coveted honestly the odds of getting you know when a wave comes through you have good odds of getting it anyway you want if you're an elderly person or immuno compromised person the protection from the dose is more important than some slightly increased odds that you would get it in the first place the odds being that you were going to get it anyway however to you know to repeatedly boost younger people who are healthy otherwise over and over again they might be saying well you know if I get it I get it but I'd rather not I'd rather not increase my risk of getting it because if I get it I'm probably gonna not have such a bad time with it and maybe I was you know you were maybe you were vaccinated originally and we're just talking about subsequent doses or maybe you had it before they're actually in this paper it does say that um the multivariate analysis also found the more recent the last prior covet episode the lower risk of covid saying again that's the you know some kind of enduring natural immunity um and I just keep thinking how you know the the places in our society that are still trying to take this decision away from individuals like University campuses where the bivalent some of them is going to be required still in the fall uh that that can like how how naive and and and and unscientific it is to take that decision out of out of people and their doctors and then also the kind of the attempts to suppress um criticism of vaccines you know calling it all misinformation that has occurred online and and Elsewhere for the last three years so short-sighted so a couple of things first it should be noted that this was an unexpected observation in this study and they in the study say that the it needs to be steady further uh so that is you know it's we We I Wouldn't draw too many hard and fast conclusions though I take Jimmy Dora's point that it does feel like if there is in fact a negative result like making people more vulnerable to getting covered and they're just saying well we should have studied this more I can understand people feeling like they are guinea pigs in this situation right that there there should have been more of this kind of research that happened earlier but there was a real hesitancy to do so when we were in the throes of the pandemic but it's also worth noting that the objective or the biggest gain of getting vaccinated we've now known for a long time is preventing hospitalization so this study is talking about whether or not people are more susceptible to access coming to the virus but there's a whole separate conversation about whether or not it's preventing you from having the worst outcomes here so for young people who already tend not to have the worst outcomes I think that's a really interesting question that you're raising about college campuses and the like for even older people there could be a calculation that says sure you might be this percent more likely to catch covid than you might not if you had gotten multiple boosters but if you hadn't gotten boosted you might end up in the hospital or be more likely to die so it's better just to basically like take on more softer waves than to wait for the one big one to take this is yet more or this is another point of data in the column of the group of people for which it is least justifiable if you think it's justifiable at all to require them to get vaccinated is actually the population where the the requirements were most likely school-aged populations sure yeah and I that's just that's so people are going to feel I think so gaslit about all this stuff saying again the the initial promise may be implicitly I guess but a lot of people in the media reported it was that everybody has to get vaccinated we're really encouraging it where we're not requiring it outright we're encouraging it because this is how we're going to stop the spread and we're going to you know get rid of covid because when we have her immunity because you're no longer going to be able to transmit it or get it when you're vaccinated that didn't pan out and like on and on and on and on and on yeah that I I you know not under selling the vaccines I understand that they are the findings are still that they're very protective against severe decent disease and death for at-risk populations but the the logic of the requirements was really for the public health rationale was really on stopping cases yeah I totally get get that and I agree that that was the rationale but it hasn't been out for some time yeah and so I just think from a public health perspective as people are considering these kind of studies it's important to really emphasize that the goal the stated goal for some time now has been to prevent hospitalization and death and that vaccines including this study show that there is a significant benefit when the vaccine is correlated to the stream that's happening it does effectively lower hospitalization uh in depth here right but again you could have a more targeted even based on this study you could say are you in this risk category yeah look at this study you would benefit from vaccination on net you would benefit because even if you're increasing your likelihood of getting covid the protection is is important for severe indices and death you are in this this categorization you're a healthy young person and really all you're doing by getting you know your fifth or something dose is making it a slightly more likely you're going to get covered or whatever it is and that doesn't make as much sense for you and and we and we have not had that Approach at all and people are going to feel anything just valuably outraged and I think that people like Jimmy Dore who are saying well where was all this research why hasn't there been more research about what's going on with covid I think are completely right and I think there also needs to be a sensitivity to and frustration about the lack of research with respect to Long covet as well whatever you think about it the or whether or not it's credible or whether you're skeptical about how how real it is as a phenomenon the reality is that we are out of ignorance about what's going on allowing the government to basically ratchet back any protections any long-term health care support for people with long covet any way to protect protect themselves against it and also insulating the manufacturers of vaccines from any liability there's a whole mixed bag of shielding that's happening for people who are going to have outcomes one way or the other and I do think that before we are overly interested in saying well I don't think that long covet is a thing because it's being used as a pretext for the government to have overreach also downplaying the possibility of long covet having this effect that's being used as an excuse for the government to not have any responsibility for policies that may have set up a significant portion of the American public to be dealing with a crisis a Health crisis where we don't have Universal Health Care long after the government has washed its hands of all of it well I mean as you know I remain um extremely skeptical of a lot of long-covered claims however if and I I don't know what should be studied I mean it should be studied and I don't really know what people who are very worried about law and covid I'm not sure what the state of their claims are with respect to like is it worse if you've gotten a more coveted more times or is it is it correlated with the severity of the infection severity of so if you've gotten it if you get covered a bunch of times but none of them were severe you're not going to get it's no it's also correlated with a number so that's what I'm getting at so so a vaccine that makes you if you're again in a population where you're not at severe risk of it's going to make you more likely to get it maybe from a long coveted perspective that is I mean that kind of cuts both ways but that's why I agree with everyone who's looking for profound scripture more more more research and more studies and I do think there is a real issue with there being so much delay here in getting some of this kind of information out well we'll have more Rising right after this foreign [Music]

Andrew Bridgen 
(North West Leicestershire) (Ind) 

Q3. More than two decades ago, the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, misled this House by promoting and endorsing the Post Office Horizon IT system as perfect, protecting the large corporation that created it and causing untold harm, damage and misery to innocent people. Can the current Prime Minister think of anything he has promoted, in partnership with huge businesses, as safe and effective that has ultimately harmed the British people? Will he use this opportunity to correct that safe and effective statement, or will he choose the same line as Tony Blair and sit back, do nothing and let the misery continue to pile up?

The Prime Minister 

We have been clear that the Horizon scandal is a terrible miscarriage of justice, and we are doing everything we can to make it right. To what the hon. Member was more broadly insinuating, let me be unequivocal from this Dispatch Box that covid vaccines are safe.

Apologies and correction from John
In this video I wrongly say the scabies mites (Sarcoptes scabiei) are insects, they are not and are correctly classified as Arachnida. This is because the adult mites have 8 legs, so are in the same group as spiders. Insects of course have 6 legs.

They are 0.2 to 0.45 mm in size, not 10 times bigger as I said, always important to put the decimal point in the correct place.

I hope to resume normal service in the next video.",2024-02-04,661019,53665,9686,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg, well welcome to today's talk it's Sunday the 4th of February 2024 now in my country we have something called prime minister's question time where members of parliament can ask the Prime Minister questions now this was the British prime minister last Wednesday the 31st of January not 2021 but 2024 just a few days ago prime minister let me be unequivocal from this dispatch box that Co vaccines are safe Mr speaker now I know that you'll be struggling with credulity at this point so I don't want to quote the Prime Minister out of context so let's look at the context now Mr Andrew bridgen asks the question and Richie sunak the Prime Minister answers the question let's just watch the whole exchange only lasts for a couple of minutes brid thank you Mr Speaker more than two decades ago the then prime minister Tony Blair misled this house by promoting and endorsing the post office Horizon it system as perfect protecting the large corporation that created it and causing Untold harm and damage and misery to innocent people can the current prime minister think of anything he has promoted in partnership with huge businesses as safe and effective which has ultimately harmed the British people and will he use this opportunity to correct that safe and effective statement or will he choose the same line as Tony Blair sit back do nothing and let the misery just continue to pile up Prim Minister Mr Speaker as we've been clear the Horizon Scandal is a terrible miscarriage of justice and we're doing everything that we can to make it right and to what he was more broadly insinuating let me be unequivocal from this dispatch box that covid vaccines are safe Mr speaker now your Member of Parliament May well have been if you live live in the UK one of those that was poo pooing Mr bridgen when he said safe and effective and he may your elected member May well have been one of the ones that were cheering when Mr Richie sunak said the vaccines are safe notice he didn't say they were effective this time but he did say they were safe now let's just look at some more information on this here now this is the uh the channel where you can watch that that's the official UK uh Parliament Channel where it's all available check out the link for yourself and we also have this document called Hansard which records everything and that's the link for that check it out for yourself can the current uh prime minister think of anything he has promoted in partnership with huge business as safe and effective but has ultimately harmed the British people so clearly Mr bridgen there is talking about the vaccines and gives the Prime Minister an opportunity to uh correct previous errors now the Prime Minister here is talking about the Horizon now this Horizon Scandal there was this terrible thing where postmasters were accused of theft and it wasn't it was the computer system goes way back to Tony blle you might have heard of him something to do with was it an invasion of Iraq or something like that something like that anyway um sticking to the point um this Horizon was uh Scandal was ignored but recently Von clean and the these poor innocent people who suffered uh greatly have been completely exonerated although not adequately compensated yet the analogies are there Mr bridon of course did advocate for the Horizon victims in his own constituency quite strongly at the time but again was poo pooed as he is now so he was drawing this kind of analogy there so the Prime Minister had this opportunity to say just a minute but he actually said this let me be unequivocal so let me be une equivocal and is I think when he said unequivocal is that the point where he banged his hand down and said this is unequivocal and this is from the dispatch box now in the UK that means it's it's this dispatch box that the Prime Minister talks from in Parliament basically is saying by the authority vested in me as the British prime minister uh covid vaccines are safe and effective sry that are cross out safe there my mistake um so there you go now I'm not just blaming I am cont CRI critiquing Mr sunak of course unequivocally I am um I think he's wrong but we have a we have his Majesty's opposition in this country that are supposed to say just a minute government let me get you in check here so Richie sunak says something K starm with the leader of the opposition should be on his feet in second saying just a minute what about way back to the Joseph frayman paper what about the yellow card data what about all the international data that shows unequivocal evidence of vaccine harms no nothing Ju Ju Just huray and they went on to the next point so there we have it that was the uh they were the exchanges in the British Parliament British prime minister 31st of January 2024 let me be unequivocal from this dispatch box that covid vaccines are safe unbelievable but at least it didn't say effective now just a couple of uh lighter points now to finish off with we did a video a few days ago I know quite a of you saw it on icin use in Africa and those patients that were treated with icin in Africa for the scab bees are just virtually cured I'm going to be showing some videos that I've just been sent a couple of days ago I might do them tomorrow don't think we' got time today um but um I made an error in the video so as always I'll come back to apology olog um so apologies and correction from from John about a mistake I made in that video in this video I wrongly say that the scabies might are insects they are not they are correctly classified as a Radia uh this is because the adult might have eight legs as spiders do so they're in the same group as spiders not insects and of course even someone who's done school biology knows that spy all insects have six legs uh and the might are actually 0.2 to 0.4 5 mm not 10 times bigger as I said sorry I simply put the decimal point in the wrong place so my apologies for that and um hopefully normal service will be resumed so my mistake sorry if I've misled anyone but the content of the video uh and the videoos of course absolutely valid totally valid IV mein uh in combination with hygiene and cleaning the clothes basically eradicated The Wretched curse of gab is from that family and with many others that's just one we chose to video from our community health project in in Africa now I'm going to read a couple of the comments from that video now as we've said before there's a whole qualitative research project in looking at these video comments if anyone bothered to do it but I'm just going to read out a couple of comments on the uh from the Iva meon and scab's video now this says um um I'm not going to read out the names of the commentators but you can look at it they're all there they're in the public domain during the pandemic I caught the Delta version of the size Corona virus to and was very sick Strangely I contacted scab the same week not wanting to infect my doctor I phon my doctor and managed to get a prescription of icin a day later I was better so excellent glad to hear that very strange coincidence getting skabes and Delta variant all at the same time although I must say personally I do keep Ivon in the house just in case I get scabies another one here um my brother Dr William Colby started the icton distribution program in the Congo Basin in the 1980s 1 billion Doses and not one complaint now this is doses given to human beings not to horses not to cows to human beings a billion Doses and not one complaint according to this comment I have noticed that there is absolutely no Co in the covid base and not even in the G refugee camp where there is TB and starvation nothing to see here can't possibly comment of course but um congratulations to Dr William Kobe for starting the Ivon distrib distribution program in Congo in the 1980s and there's many other comments I'm just going to give you the gist of one of them again I'm not just I'm just reporting what's been commented don't know if they're true or not can't tell it's just comments but they're in the public domain you can read them for yourself um I've had long covid and I've been on oxygen at 5 liters for 2 years 247 um and at some point this commentator says I found some 12 12 milligram tablets of irtin in 24 hours my oxygen saturation levels Rose to prec covid level my mind cleared overnight from the fog my ears are ringing and improving my eyesight is improved today I went to my old doctor to show him your video he already was ahead of me he prescribed 40 milligrams a day for two weeks but I told him I would like to try 20 milligrams per day because 12 migam rocked my world and increased the level if needed um a little more detail about the individual there this has been a miracle in my life no machine day or night and I assum he was referring to the oxygen concentration machine um and he also refers to some personal tragedy so they're they're in the comments there now of course I have no idea whether they're correct or not they're just comments and whatever you do do not take medicines based on what we say on this um Channel we do not prescribe you need to go to your doctor for that but interesting that those things are in the comments and again congratulations to Dr William kobby for His Brilliant work in the Congo eradicating things like river blindness and uh uh elephantiasis the massive swelling of the limbs the terrible blindness and of course huge range of other parasitic diseases and now almost certainly IA Ian eradicating um scab as well although scab Beast keeps cropping up because people keep getting reinfected so there we go uh let me know what you think of the British prime minister's comments and um we'll leave it there thank you for watching

Here we are, just a year after the first news of the coronavirus we now call SARS-CoV-2 and the global pandemic known as COVID-19… and scientists have already developed more than one safe & effective vaccine. How did they do that so quickly? I visited the lab whose work directly led to these first COVID vaccines, so you can learn how basic research connects to life-saving medicine. This is how to make a COVID-19 vaccine.

their locks, and hijacking your body. But there IS one way to prevent this. By using one of the virus’s weapons on itself…  Hey smart people, Joe here. Right now, there’s about 7 billion 
people all waiting for the same thing:   A vaccine that will protect us 
from the virus causing COVID-19. And if you’re like me you want to know 
what’s in it…  what makes it work?    Making a vaccine and getting it out to the 
public is a long process with a lot of steps,   so we can make sure the 
vaccine is safe and effective.  And it’s pretty typical for 
that to take ten years or more, In an emergency, like this pandemic, 
well… we can’t skip any of those steps,   but we can speed this up by 
doing some at the same time But none of that can happen until 
you figure out the first step:   What do you put in your vaccine 
that will make it protect people. …and it’s what we’re going to talk about today. We’re gonna visit a lab and meet some 
scientists who study the coronavirus.   We’re also gonna meet a really big Awesome 
Science Machine, and learn how they used   it to design this: the key ingredient 
inside the very first COVID-19 vaccines. Here’s my goal with this video: To show you 
what exactly is in the new COVID vaccines   that makes them work—and how they got 
made faster than any vaccine in history.   My hope is that you’ll be better 
informed when you get your shot,   and you’ll have a new appreciation for 
why science like this is so important. This is how to make a COVID-19 vaccine. It turns out that some of the most 
important research for making the   COVID-19 vaccine is happening 
right down the road from me… …at the University of Texas—which is pretty 
cool. Because I did my PhD right *here*,   and in *here* is the lab of… Dr. Jason McLellan. He studies how pathogens 
like the coronavirus cause disease… There are four human coronaviruses that occur seasonally and generally cause the common cold.   And then there've been three coronaviruses that have caused pandemics.   And that's the first SARS 
coronavirus back in 2002,   the MERS coronavirus in 2012. And now 
SARS-CoV-2, which emerged earlier this year. So at the end of December, 2019, it was on the 
news that there’s these pneumonia clusters in   China. Uh, in the scientific community, we thought 
maybe a new flu virus or possibly a coronavirus.  I was actually snowboarding with my family and 
my collaborator, Barney Graham at the vaccine   research center at the NIH called. And he 
said, he's been in contact with US CDC,   Chinese CDC. Uh, it looks like it's a 
betacoronavirus similar to SARS coronavirus, and   they want it to move rapidly, try and make a 
vaccine. And I said, we're definitely in… So you're just like scrolling 
through your phone. in this ski   lodge, and you're 
like we gotta get to work! So while the rest of us were 
focused on royal family drama   and just hearing the first mentions of 
“coronavirus” for the very first time,   scientists like Jason knew this was serious, 
and they were already getting to work. As soon as researchers in China decoded 
the virus’ genome and published it online,   Jason’s lab could start designing a vaccine…
I texted Daniel Wrapp my graduate student   and let them know be on high alert 
because as soon as we get the sequence,   we're going to race on this thing 
and move as quickly as we can. Jason was on that winter vacation and texted 
me that it was a CoronavirusAnd eventually   in early January, the sequence 
was released online publicly. That's when the clock started ticking because we   knew a bunch of people were 
going to be working on this. Uh, and then things started moving pretty quickly… Let’s step back for a minute. 
What does a vaccine do?   It trains your immune system to 
know what a germ, like a virus,   looks like. So it can recognize the germ, fight it 
off, and keep you safe, without you getting sick. This is the virus that causes COVID-19. 
The outer shell is made of a few different   kinds of proteins, butthese proteins 
sticking off the side are the most   important part. The spike.These spikes are 
what give this family of viruses their name:   The coronaviruses, because 
they look kinda like a crown. The coronavirus uses that spike to sneak 
into our cells. The 3-dimensional shape of   that spike is super important, because that 
exact shape is what lets the virus latch on   to receptors on the outside of our cells … almost 
like picking a lock. And then, it sneaks inside. Those shapes sticking out on the outside of 
a virus are also what your immune system is   feeling for, to figure out if this is a 
foreign invader, if it should attack or not. The problem is, the first time your body sees a 
virus, your immune system responds so slowly that   the virus has time to make gazillions of copies 
of itself, and you can still get very, very sick. That’s what’s great about a vaccine. It 
trains your immune system what to look for,   so when the real virus shows up,   your body can respond super fast—and destroy the 
virus before it has a chance to hijack your cells. So what’s actually in a vaccine? Sometimes, 
a vaccine has a weakened or dead virus.   That’s how polio and measles and 
mumps and some other vaccines work.  But these days, a vaccine usually just 
contains a little piece of the virus. The newest COVID-19 vaccines? 
They’re just the spike. But for that spike to work as a vaccine, to train 
your immune system to recognize the actual virus,   it has to have the same 3-dimensional shape 
as the spike on the whole, complete virus. But making the spike all by itself,   not attached to the rest of the 
virus, turns out to be really hard. Because the spike is actually pretty 
floppy just floating around on its own. It doesn’t look much like the 
spike on the actual virus. And this is the key thing Jason’s lab figured 
out how to make.  For years they’d studied SARS   and MERS viruses, which are really closely 
related to the virus that causes COVID.  So they already knew what tiny tweaks 
to make to freeze coronavirus spikes   in the perfect shape. Um, so we got to work 
designing our stabilizing mutations into the   new spike sequence. There was just two amino acids 
that we knew would, uh, if we mutated them that   would stabilize the spike protein and make it a lot easier to work with in the laboratory. A protein, like the coronavirus spike…  ...is a long, folded string of 
individual units called amino acids. And these strings of amino acids are built 
using code written in RNA, and stored in DNA*. By changing, or “mutuating” the letters of 
DNA code, we can change the amino acids in   our protein string. So that's cool. You're like 
building scaffolding into the protein, to be like   “freeze in this shape.”
   Yeah, that's a good way to put it.  How do you get from there to 
making the actual spike protein? I can show you…  Scientists are able to grow special immortal 
human cells outside the body which they use as   factories. They put a modified gene for something 
like their spike protein, into those cells… …and then they'll start spitting out this protein So they're just pumping it 
out into the liquid, right? Yeah, that's right. They take that liquid, run it through 
special purification machines,   and are able to isolate a pure 
sample of their spike protein. But how do they know for sure 
that this special spike protein   looks like the real thing, 3-D shape 
and all? They take pictures of it… …using a big Awesome Science Machine. (VO) This is a cryo-electron microscope.  This machine took a 3D picture 
of the coronavirus spike,   and helped design the first COVID-19 vaccines Check out the big science machine! It looks like a giant microwave Am I ok to walk up here? Yeah, it’s ok. I mean the room is a million 
dollars, and the microscope is another million.  So you’re saying don’t touch 
this screen right here. You can see the floor is separate 
from the instrument, it’s on its   own, free-floating. So vibrations are bad.
These are wall panels that contain water   running behind them to keep the 
temperature constant in the room. Oh wow, that’s… Then it also has to be 
electromagnetically shielded too.  That is nuts. Look at this beefy cable over here. That’s the high-tension, that’s the 
200,000 volts comin in over here Oh ok, so don’t lick that one! Oh this is… Sciencey! Look at all that science happening in there.  It’s kind of a marvel of physics and engineering. Joe N (OS): Can you play Doom on this thing?  Um, some of our computers you 
can play Far Cry at max settings. So maybe this sounds like a super stupid question,   but why can't you just use a regular light 
microscope to take a picture of a protein? Well, the wavelength of visible light is 
on the order of hundreds of nanometers. And that means the smallest things 
you can see with visible light are   also on the scale of hundreds of nanometers. But what we want to see—the atoms in a 
protein molecule—they’re angstroms apart,   tenths of a nanometer, so 
we can’t use visible light.  We have to use a special electron microscope.
So super high energy electrons make very   tiny wavelengths, which lets you see 
very, very small resolution things. Okay. I want a camera like that. That's 
better than 4k. We can go angstrom-K.  So, to take a 3D picture of a protein 
with a cryo-electron microscope,   first you put a drop of protein 
onto a special metal grid.  Then you freeze it in place with liquid ethane. 
When we shoot a beam of electrons at it,those   proteins will be in all kinds of random 
orientations, some like this, some like that. Each orientation leaves a particular “shadow”. Powerful computers look at all those 2D 
images, and combine them into a final 3D shape. It’s kind of like using a bunch of 2D 
photos of someone’s head to make a 3D model. And when Jason and Daniel and their team 
looked at the spike they made, with their   tiny little tweaks and mutations, their spike has 
the same 3D shape as the spike on the whole virus. Now we can put that spike into people, and see if 
it trains their immune system, and protects them   from the real virus. And? It works. This protects 
people from COVID-19. The research you just saw,   from those scientists, is literally what’s 
being used in the very first COVID-19 vaccines. And some of those vaccines work in a 
really cool way. Instead of having to   make the actual spike protein, in big factories, 
with huge tanks of cells like the ones we saw…   some of these new vaccines, the genetic 
instructions for making the spike is   all that’s in the shot, on a molecule called mRNA. Your body uses those instructions to 
make the spike. YOU are the factory.  That’s awesome. This is a really incredible piece 
of science. A year ago, no one had ever seen this   virus before, and thanks to these scientists 
and thousands of others around the world,   now we have vaccines that work. It’s gonna take months, maybe years to get these 
vaccines, and the dozens of others still being   worked on, to the billions of people that need 
them, and that is a huge challenge on its own. But this is a really hopeful story. No 
vaccine in history has ever been invented   this fast, and we were able to do it safely.  And we were able to do this so quickly 
because scientists like Jason and his lab   and others, they were ready. Because they 
were studying basic scientific questions about   other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, they’ve 
spent years trying to figure out their secrets,   so when this one showed up, they were 
already ten steps ahead. And to me,   that’s why work like this—supporting basic 
research—is so important, and why we need it. Stay curious…"

fumble him a little bit was on the vaccine issue hi I've got so much to say but such little time my name is John W and I'm one of the covid vaccine injured in this country I want you to look into my eyes R soon I and I want you to look at the pain the trauma and the regret I have in my eyes we have been left with no help at all not only am I in here that vaccin there's another man over there whose life's been ruined by That covid-19 vaccine I know people who have lost legs amputations I know people with heart conditions like myself RI sunak why have I had to set up a support group in Scotland to look after the people that have been affected by That covid-19 vaccine why are the people who are in charge who told us all to do the right thing have left us all to ro and left me and the thousands and the tens of thousands in this country to ro R soon look me in the eye when are you going to start to do the right thing the vaccine damage payment scheme is not fit for purpose in Scotland right now according to the yellow card system there are over 30,000 people have had an adverse reaction to That vaccine and deaths John thank you very much indeed for your question for you to start doing the right thing and you you you've made really strong point John prime minister yeah John well I'm very sorry to hear about your personal circumstances and you said someone over here also seems to have suffered by the similar by a similar thing now obviously I I don't know about the individual situation that you're in we're silenced social media and everything we are silenced we are the most silenced people in this country Sil the Press because my story in the press okay had to go to the government for comment and they made take all the stuff out forgive me forgive me both no one no one no one is saying no yeah okay I've lost my house my wife successful career and Sir You Raised some very valid points I'm sure what I've got to say is though we haven't got you on microphone and as you know we've got to get through this I'm sure we can we can raise your points with the prime minister at a later date but in the mean time Prim Min if you cover I'm I'm very happy to so there is a vaccine compensation scheme that in place as you alluded to in the NHS obviously everyone individually will work through their cases it's difficult for me to comment on anyone's individual case I'm sure you'll appreciate that I'm very happy to go and look at the cases and I'm sure you'll get them to the team here I mean I'm I'm very saddened and shocked to hear that you've been silenced by anybody that is surprising to me so please do get your details to Stephen and the team and I will happily take that away of course you should be able to speak about your experience what's happened to you and as I said we have a compensation scheme in place for that and I'll make sure that we're working through that obviously I think you'll appreciate it's hard for me to comment on your specific circumstances just not knowing them and those things forgive me sir we haven't got a microphone on you so our viewers and listeners won't be able to hear I the the last thing I'd say is you know we went through a pandemic like everyone else at the points when it came to the vaccine those decisions were always taken on the basis of medical advice from our medical experts to tell us as politicians who are obviously not doctors about how best to roll out the vaccine what was in the public health interest the priority order how that should be done who should be eligible that was something that the doctors recommended on and that's something that we followed now obviously if there are individual circumstances which haven't worked out then that's why we have the compensation scheme in place and I'll make sure that we follow up on your cases okay prime minister thank you jents both of you do give us your details we will get that to the Prime Minister and as he said he will I'm sure look at that for you now that is an issue that's haed you a little bit because you were quite Pro vaccine weren't you AB I'm sorry uh what I said was I was Pro the choice it's an individual choice we were the first people to say you shouldn't be vaccinating young people or children and here's the point I commit and I don't think any other party will I commit we need an inquiry into the vaccine in vaccine injuries and that is my commitment here this evening for the first time to you that will be in our contract with the people there has to be an inquiry you heard it from those gentlemen I'm hearing up and down the country Ser so okay let's just have this rise so reform UK If voted will immediately have an inquest into the vaccine injured I'm absolutely right we need that and it needs to happen quickly and there need to be proper interim payments made to those who have been injured"

Both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines have been linked to rare, but potentially serious, neurological complications.
Following research from the University of Oxford on more than 32 million people in England,... analysts found 38 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome per 10 million people given the AstraZeneca vaccine,... which can result in numbness, tingling and muscle weakness.
There were around 60 cases of hemorrhagic stroke per 10 million given the Pfizer vaccine.
However, experts pointed out that not getting vaccinated is still more dangerous.

#davidpakmanshow #bretweinstein #tuckercarlson",2024-01-08,190640,5236,5604,UCvixJtaXuNdMPUGdOPcY8Ag, let's do a couple of covid related stories Brett Weinstein evolutionary biologist and podcast host of the Darkhorse podcast was recently interviewed by former Fox News propagandist Tucker Carlson and Brett told Tucker something that sounds shocking because it is and it's wrong which is that 17 million people have died from the covid vaccine that is quite a claim let's take a listen to what Brett had to say gauge Tucker's reaction and more generally we will discuss it there was uh a press I was recently at a conference uh in Romania on the covid crisis and so there was a lot of work trying to unpack what we actually understand and I saw a credible estimate of something like 17 million deaths globally from this technology so 17 million deaths from the coac well when you know when you scale up to billions uh it's not hard to reach a number like that with the technology that's dangerous now to your deeper question I think let's and by the way these are not our subtitles they're a mess but I just want to make clear these are not our subtitles Steelman so just for perspective I mean that's like the death toll of a global war yes absolutely it is this is a a a great tragedy of History so that proportion um and amazingly there is no way in which it's over I mean we are still apparently recommending these things for healthy children never stood any chance of getting any benefit from every chance of suffering harms that are uh not only serious but tragic on the basis that children have long lives ahead of them so listen uh let's start anecdotally okay okay the claim is 17 million people have been killed by the covid vaccine and it's continuing let's start anecdotally which is not the way we do things but sometimes it's useful to start with an anecdote just as a sniff test and then we'll go further okay first of all does anybody in my audience know a single person who had a serious vaccine complication maybe there's a couple of you okay sometimes that happens extremely rare we have an audience in the millions C L it's possible that someone in the audience not not you but knows someone who had a serious vaccine complication maybe there's a few of you okay does anyone in my audience know of anybody personally right who died from the covid vaccine I assume the answer is zero since almost no one okay almost no one has died from vaccine complications so does anyone in my audience then know anybody who has died from covid or covid complications just about everybody I know says the answer is yes I assume the answer is yes both personally and certainly obviously we know of people through through the media my aunt died of complications from covid she was imuno compromised had a number of health issues got covid never recovered passed away an uncle of mine died from Co pneumonia now let's go beyond anecdote okay the global death toll of covid about six million closer to seven depending on whether we talk recorded deaths or an excess death model OKAY somewhere between six and7 million Deb of covid and 17 million dead of the vaccine now you can go and watch the presentation that Brett saw in Romania okay it's a Canadian scientist Dennis rancour uh here's just like a few seconds of it this is all available online it's 26 minutes scene that is explained by the magic of mathematical models written by bought out scientists working for bought out politicians so it is not true the vaccine did not save lives okay you can go and watch this entire thing and then you will have the information that that uh Brett has and then you can also find the 130 page so-called analysis of this on which that presentation is based we're not going to link to it we're putting up a screenshot but we're not going to link to it since I don't know we could be banned or something who knows and here's what this quote analysis did the analysis looked at all cause mortality in 17 countries and the analysis claims that all cause mortality data shows there was no benefit from a covid vaccine now all it does is it looks at population data doesn't confirm whether anybody who died was even vaccinated and it makes it an impossibility to draw any kind of conclusion about the relationship between vaccination and morality like at the top level it's bogus we don't even need to go further but we can the analysis also ignes really good evidence that we have that when we see a spike in excess mortality in a country it aligned with a covid surge not a vaccination surge if you look and you say okay we know there was a covid surge in this country at this time and then you see excess mortality go up that's really good data about what might be going on on the other hand and if you look at a country like Peru when you saw the excess deaths Spike uh did not coincide with when the vaccination rates went up we know when the vaccination rates went way up in Peru and you didn't see excess deaths so the studies that we have show all cause mortality is uh higher in the states with lower vaccination rates and all cause mortality was lower in states with higher vaccination R so it is truly dangerous listen do I think Bret Weinstein really believes this I genuinely do not know I do not know whether Brett Weinstein believes this stuff five years ago four or five years ago I would have said Brett Weinstein is too smart to fall for this crap it's just what my view would have been and I don't know what the answer is because unfortunately if he doesn't believe it then he's deliberately spreading misinformation which I mean what's worse being a liar being misinformed being a deliberate liar seems worse to me it's really sad what's happened to Brett Weinstein and of course opportunist Tucker Carlson loves the ability to just promote the hell out of this crap for clicks and is he even getting clicks I don't know something that's been in the news a lot lately is data Brokers collecting vast amounts of data about everything you do on your phone and computer where you go what you look at they identify patterns in your behavior and it's really quite disturbing how much data Brokers know about us even our health information and then we found out that sometimes government agencies like the FBI will buy that information from data Brokers to spy on Americans without warrants ad companies buy the data to serve you ads financial institutions can use the information the information can even end up on public search sites where anybody can see it but there is a way to stop it our sponsor incog is an affordable service service that sends automatic data removal requests to data brokers who are required by law to comply incog even follows up with the data Brokers to ensure your data is permanently gone and incog keeps you updated every step of the way I use incog myself it is remarkable what they will accomplish for you

authorities about myocarditis and other complications relating to the covid vaccine but for reasons unknown did not send it now this email that the news Outlet obtained allegedly from Dimitri desalis the cdc's top official for equity in covid-19 data and engagement to to two other CDC officials Bears the subject line draft alert on myocarditis and mRNA vaccines desalis adds that this is the most recent draft of an alert as discussed happy to discuss further the email is stated May 21st 2021 3 days later the CDC acknowledged for the first time that reported cases of myocarditis uh existed after receiving a covid-19 vaccination that there were those levels were higher than expected however the agency still recommended that most Americans 12 and older get vac vacinated here to discuss is RAV Aurora an independent journalist at the illusion of consensus podcast welcome back to Rising hey guys great to be here yes thank you for joining us again I turn to you uh whenever there's news on the vaccine and myocarditis front um specifically how significant is this um development that there was this draft email um concerning this issue which you have talked about so much yeah yeah I think there there should have definitely been an alert and some kind of public engagement on this topic and um you saw there was some early reporting just a couple days prior in The Epic Times as well that Zachary styberg great credit to him for this fantastic reporting um about how in in in April um the CDC I believe April 27th the CDC said um relle binsky in this uh White House Press briefing that they had deliberately looked in over 200 doses uh given to the American public of the MRNA vaccines and they could not find a myocarditis signal when in fact uh there were hundreds of reports and vs already on myocarditis up until that point uh they had already consulted with the Israeli Ministry of Health with the Department of Defense um and uh there was also the the US military as well that reported on uh cases of vaccine myocarditis in the military which is kind of unsurprising because that's a kind of concentrated group of uh younger males um who are incredibly fit and healthy which uh where myocarditis cases are particularly concentrated yet days later in late April the Public Announcement by the CDC was that there's no signal here and then when you fast forward to may you have this alert that's drafted um and it's it's not clear what the alert was going to say this is very vague um but days later they do acknowledge that there is a vaccine myocarditis issue um but then it's they say that well the cost benefit analysis for teenagers and young adults is still to get vaccinated so they later do acknowledge it but they don't actually change their tune and they continue recommending it which I I think is particularly egregious when at that particular point and afterwards as well we knew the infection fatality rates we knew who was at risk from covid we knew this was primarily concentrated among elderly individuals with comorbidities people who are obese so for the CDC to have all this data already in vs Israeli Ministry of Health Etc um and to have this this proposal for this draft not being shared to the public and instead um days later it being promoted uh to uh Young Americans without any clear evidence of benefit um I think is completely wrong and just shows just how captured these regulatory agencies are uh help me understand Rob because my understanding was that although the there's an argument to be made about the diminishing or marginal benefits of the covid vaccine for younger people without coor comorbidities as you've described there are also when you look when you compare the risks of having heart uh disease as a consequence of covid versus the risk of having heart disease as a consequence of the uh covid vaccine myocarditis as a consequence of the covid vaccine it's still even if you think that all being a wash you shouldn't get the vaccine the the balance comes out in favor of uh being vaccinated in terms of having a lower uh incidence of heart rate at least within every population except for the narrow band of men within a certain age bracket so was it inaccurate for the CDC to advise that there was still some benefit even if it is marginal to Young people getting the vaccine especially given that many young people do in fact have comorbid comorbidities R obes these are not um rare uh rare quantities to have and unfortunately in our population yeah yeah no it was it was completely inaccurate and this particular comparison between hard complications from the vaccine versus covid you know I'm not a cardiologist so initially for me I was looking at this topic um and I was wondering like what's going on here CU you read mainstream media and you read you listen to Peter hotz they're all talking about how the cardiac risks from uh covid are far greater than the vaccine then I interviewed this guy Dr Anish Koka who distributed uh covid vaccines at his own clinic in Philadelphia Koka Cardiology um I highly recommend you check out his stuff I interviewed him and that interview is actually going to be coming out soon there was an earlier article that I did with him and we went over this for like three hours um and I I fact checked him and we did rigorous research and he's still operating the clinic and he explained to me and this really Bears out in the data is that Co viroc caritis from covid is fundamentally different from myocarditis from the vaccine because myocarditis from the vaccine particularly affects younger and healthier people and more importantly than that you can still see myocarditis in people in their 40s and 50s but myocarditis from covid is not the same thing it's not myocarditis in any traditional sense it's more like individuals who are in the hospital who are having multiple complications they're being pushed over the edge uh they have they're having lung issues Brea you know breathing issues uh they might not potentially make it and they're also having cardiac issues and when you test them you find elevated cardiac levels so it's labeled as myocarditis whereas with vaccine myocarditis it's just myocarditis it's not 10 other different things going on and the individual um struggling in the hospital uh with with every last breath it's individuals who otherwise would have been uh healthy so those two groups are very very different so that's actually an apples and oranges comparison which is something that I didn't know initially thankfully now I'm educated on this topic so that comparison doesn't really work when it comes to younger healthier people now Brianna you're absolutely right and this is something um that I've I've debated with some people and talked about is that in the United States comorbidities are real it's not just you know 0.00 something percent of the population there are significant rates um of obesity but when it came to the vaccine discussion the CDC just refused and just were not doing an honest conversation about risks and benefits there was just always this very strange from the outside and to many other scientists very strange like dogmatic approval um and promotion of these covid vaccines in younger Americans when they hadn't done that proper risk benefit analysis right how much are we actually lowering mortality you know what are the risk of myocarditis versus uh you know preventing um hospitalization from covid I mean these kind of conversations were not actually uh being had um you know very clearly and instead they were pushing it uh kind of zealously and then it was left to other uh research agencies like around the world like studies in Thailand and Hong Kong um which I don't know why they had to do those studies and we couldn't do those studies but a lot of those countries actually did the myocarditis studies the rigorous myocarditis studies like subclinical myocarditis and they ended up finding like 1 to 2% of uh young uh adolescents uh young teens uh had gotten some form of subclinical or clinical myocarditis and those rates are absolutely terrifying if if if those rates actually apply some of those studies are very small they're in one 100 or 200 people um but there again we weren't clear on the risk benefit analysis the CDC seem to be clear absent the requisite evidence and instead of being cautious about this and instead of when we're talking in April and May when they had gotten all these reports in v and Israeli Ministry of Health and Department of Defense instead of being like Oh let's let's be careful here let's maybe recommend this to elderly people or to people who are vulnerable the CDC never did that they never did what European countries like Denmark and Sweden and certain Asian countries that here we had this potentially predictably very zealous pharmaceutical traditional American approach where it's all about medication vaccination just you got to take these products by fiser and madna and if you question it then suddenly you're antiva that's not how science should be done and the CDC completely failed in my opinion RAV Aurora thank you so much for joining us today we appreciate it [Music] thanks
66,UijQ-6jhVuc,Doctor Dies After Getting COVID Vaccine? Post Vaccine Deaths,"Doctor Dies After Getting COVID Vaccine? Post Vaccine Deaths

An Obstetrician / Gynecologist | Dr. Gregory Michael in Miami, Florida, received the 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Dec.18th. Shortly after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, he reportedly developed acute immune thrombocytopenia. Unfortunately, he died 16 days after getting the covid vaccine. Dr. Gregory Michael's cause of death results from a brain hemorrhage. Obviously, this is horrible. It's tragic, and you feel for his family.

---------------------------------------------------------

But it makes you wonder, was his death a result of the covid vaccine? 
And if it resulted from the covid vaccine, should that change your perspective on the covid vaccines? 
So I'm going to tell you my thoughts on this, but first, let's learn a little more about what happened. 
Pfizer is actively investigating the case.

Over 10 million people in the United States have received at least one shot of either the Pfizer Covid Vaccine or Moderna Covid Vaccine, the two authorized in the United States. Me personally, I received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, there have been about 40 cases of anaphylaxis, meaning a severe allergic reaction. Many people have had other side effects like sore arms, fatigue, headache, or fever, which typically last a day or so.

The Miami-Dade County medical examiner's office is investigating Dr. Gregory Michael's death, and as of right now, there is no official autopsy report. But based on the reports, let's see what we can make of his case.

Dr. Gregory Michael was healthy. He did not smoke. Did not take any medications. Never had any reaction to any medication nor vaccines. Then, supposedly three days after he gets the 1st dose of the covid vaccine, he developed tiny reddish spots, or petechiae, caused by bleeding under the skin of his hands and feet.

This prompted him to go to the ER. He gets blood work done, and his platelet levels are low, which is something called thrombocytopenia. Platelets are one of the components of blood clotting. If platelets are too low, it makes people more prone to bleeding. Normal platelet counts range from anywhere from 150 000 to 400 000 or so. People can have spontaneous bleeding, including internal bleeding, but that doesn't typically happen unless the platelet levels are less than ten thousand. His levels were reportedly zero, and because they're so low or absent, he gets admitted to the intensive care unit for two weeks. 

Doctors tried to get his platelet count higher as he had experts from all over the country involved in his care. Presumably, they tried several different treatments. Typically we give platelet transfusions, which is really a blood product that we're transfusing. But also give steroids, specifically glucocorticoids, such as salmeterol or methylprednisolone. If that doesn't work, we try other drugs like Ramaplastum or eltrombopag to stimulate the bone marrow to make more platelets. 

Sometimes we give immunoglobulins, sometimes we give a drug called rituximab, which is a monoclonal antibody. If all else fails, the last resort is to take out the spleen because sometimes a spleen plays a role in sequestering and destroying platelets. So they were actually planning on doing a splenectomy, meaning removing his spleen. Still, shortly before that, he ended up developing a hemorrhagic stroke that took his life in a matter of minutes. In other words, he bled into his brain. 

A sudden get severe thrombocytopenia to the point of bleeding to death because no matter what the cause is, this kind of thing is incredibly rare. I've never had a similar case like this in the intensive care unit. Some cases like this are reported with certain drugs medications that can lead to thrombocytopenia. As a result of drug-induced antibodies being made by the immune system, they attack the body's platelets.

thoughts about getting the covid vaccine   she also asked me if i heard about the doctor 
in florida who died after getting the first   pfizer vaccination so this is something i want 
to talk about so there was an obstetrician   gynecologist in miami who received the first 
dose of the pfizer vaccine on december 18th   and shortly after receiving the vaccine he 
reportedly developed acute immune thrombocytopenia   he died 16 days after getting the vaccine his 
cause of death being a result of brain hemorrhage   or bleeding into the brain obviously 
this is horrible it's tragic and you   have to feel for his family but it makes you 
wonder was his death a result of the vaccine   and if it was a result of the vaccine should that 
change your perspective on getting the vaccine   so i'm going to tell you my thoughts on this but 
first let's learn a little bit more about what   happened pfizer is actively investigating the case 
but they don't seem to think that the vaccine is   the cause of this so far over 10 million people in 
the united states have received at least one shot   of either the pfizer or the moderna covid
vaccine these are the two authorized in the   united states as of right now me personally 
i received both doses of the pfizer vaccine   which overall went very smoothly now so far 
there have been about 40 cases of anaphylaxis   as a result of these vaccines meaning a severe 
allergic reaction none of which were reported   as being fatal now many people have had other 
side effects that are very common after the   vaccine like having a sore arm having some fatigue 
headache or fever and this typically lasts a day   or two the miami-dade county medical examiner's 
office is investigating this death as well   and as of right now there is no official autopsy 
report but based off the reports let's see what   we can make of this case so this man was healthy 
he did not smoke he did not take any medications   never had any reaction to any medication or 
vaccines supposedly three days after he gets   the first dose of the pfizer covid vaccination 
he gets tiny reddish spots or petechiae caused   by bleeding under the skin of his hands and feet 
this prompted him to go to the er he gets blood   work done and his platelet levels are low and this 
is something called thrombocytopenia platelets are   one of the components of blood clotting if 
platelets are too low it makes people more   prone to bleeding normal platelet counts range 
from anywhere from 150 000 to 400 000 or so   people can have spontaneous bleeding including 
internal bleeding but that doesn't typically   happen unless the platelet levels are less than 
ten thousand his levels were reportedly zero   and because they're so low or absent really 
he gets admitted to the intensive care unit   for two weeks doctors tried to get his platelet 
count higher as he had experts from all over the   country involved in his care now presumably 
they tried a number of different treatments   typically we give platelet transfusions which is 
really a blood product that we're transfusing but   also we give steroids specifically glucocorticoids 
such as salimetrol or methylprednisolone if that   doesn't work we try other drugs like ramiplostim 
or eltrombopag to try to stimulate the bone   marrow to make more platelets sometimes we give 
immunoglobulins sometimes we give a drug called   rituximab which is a monoclonal antibody if 
all else fails the last resort is to take out   the spleen because sometimes a spleen plays a 
role in sequestering and destroying platelets   so they were actually planning on doing 
a splenectomy meaning removing his spleen   but shortly before that he ends up developing a 
hemorrhagic stroke that took his life in a matter   of minutes in other words he bled into his brain 
now just because someone bleeds into their brain   it doesn't necessarily mean that they die but 
what happens is if the bleeding is severe enough   the pressure starts building up inside the skull 
and this is known as raised intracranial pressure   and this compresses the brain and eventually the 
pressure forces the brain down through the base   of the skull that big hole at the bottom 
of the skull known as the foramen magnum   when this happens the only life-saving option is 
emergent brain surgery where a neurosurgeon does a   craniotomy to relieve the intracranial pressure 
but his bleeding was so severe and happened so   quickly it took his life and his thrombocytopenia 
was not only severe but it wasn't getting better   despite all the treatments that they tried and 
this leads to the question why does a healthy   guy all of a sudden get severe thrombocytopenia 
to the point of bleeding to death because no   matter what the cause is this kind of thing is 
incredibly rare i've never had a similar case   like this in the intensive care unit now there are 
some cases like this reported with certain drugs   medications can lead to thrombocytopenia 
as a result of drug-induced antibodies   being made by the immune system that 
end up attacking the body's platelets   so drug-induced thrombocytopenia refers to 
acute immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and   it should be suspected when someone has a sudden 
severe thrombocytopenia so ditp or drug-induced   thrombocytopenia is even more strongly suspected 
when a patient has repeated episodes of a sudden   severe drop in the platelet count by far the 
most common drugs that cause this are things like   quinidine the blood thinner heparin and then also 
sulfonylureas like trimethoprim saltomethoxazole   aka bactrim and also there's other antibiotics 
that are fairly common that cause this as well   so it's not just drugs that can cause this 
but also certain foods herbal remedies and one   vaccine the mmr vaccine the risk of itp occurring 
within six weeks after getting the mmr vaccination   is increased however the attributable risk of 
thrombocytopenia within six weeks after mmr   vaccination remains overall low at one in 25 000 
vaccinated children now complications or long-term   consequences of itp in this age group are rare 
for the majority of children less than six years   of age the illness is self-limiting vaccines 
stimulate the immune system and in theory could   in rare cases cause it to mistakenly identify some 
of a patient's own cells as enemy invaders that   should be destroyed but with that said millions 
of various vaccinations are given every year   and clusters of thrombocytopenia don't occur and 
regarding the covid vaccine millions of doses   have been given and so far there are no other 
reports or associations with low platelet counts   so did the pfizer vaccine cause this based on the 
timing of things it seems like it but it's too   early to come to a conclusion one way or another 
we have to know all the facts and understand the   autopsy report but even then it's still not a 
guarantee that we come to a solid conclusion   although this is an incredibly sad story and even 
if it does prove that the vaccine did cause this   i hope people aren't dissuaded from getting 
the vaccine because this type of thing is still   very incredibly rare every decision we make 
in medicine is based on risk versus benefit   and when you compare the risks of covid 
and the risks and benefits of the vaccine   the benefits outweigh the risks for the vast 
majority of people in fact there are lots of   covet patients in the intensive care unit that 
have thrombocytopenia so that is something   else to put in perspective knowing more details 
about this case might help us to better devise   treatment plans in case this happens again and 
other people after they get the vaccine but   i doubt we're going to hear many more cases like 
this anyway that's all i have for this video   thanks for watching and i'll 
see you in the next one you"
67,3rIQHrbDguM,COVID at SEAL Team - Refusing Coronavirus with Chris Cappa | Mike Drop Clips - Ep. #174,"Since COVID-19 vaccines became available in late 2020, the Navy's stated policy has always been to achieve a fully vaccinated force to ensure the service's readiness. Of course, it's not all that simple - at least not for the warriors over at SEAL Team Seven. Canine Handler Chris Cappa digs into his stance, and why he ultimately ended up leaving deployment in the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic, in this exclusive clip from Episode #174 of The Mike Drop Podcast.

alive so the contractor training company was there and hands down and me and the kennel master we do have a kennel master there he's an MA like most most at least most places in the Navy have him and we had to run a blue gold schedule because they didn't want us all there um and training you know we were kind of Off the Grid so no one knew we really existed kind of so we got away with you know doing what we wanted to do wasn't too bad to me it's fascinating and alarming that uh the whole Co experience had the impact that it had on our military well it got me out yeah forced me out really yeah I didn't take it no [ __ ] I I refused it in my uh EOS lined up and it was a complete and utter abortion and Alleyway for me because I had to put a religious R waiver in like most guys Kick the Can down the road long enough until it was my time to go and I literally made the choice I think I got out in like 61 days wow no plan no job no nothing no doubt no kids or two kids in a family just said nope this doesn't feel right guys I'm sorry it just doesn't feel right and uh and unfortunately it wasn't what the brochur said the experience anymore so it was taking my smile so it was time for me not good for you I I I applaud that I think uh how do you how does it sit with you now looking back and seeing the military saying hey if you want to come back in cuz you didn't do it you know you're welcome like how many of those guys are like [ __ ] you I'm not coming back in do you know anybody that's come back in no and all the guys were already at that point of [ __ ] you yeah because of how they were being treated the guys that were saying hey this doesn't feel right I don't think I agree with this I mean they got railroaded oh man I mean I know I know on the I know on the west coast they were pretty powerful movement over there and on the East Coast they just coralled these dudes in an office and said check in every day we don't care you know like it was you're black bald man like it was yeah they wanted you under ma supervision I mean it was what dude guys were for not getting the shot guys were fighting for their lives man dude what fighting for their lives dude it was crazy um dude that's that's embarrassing it's very embarrassing and uh it got to the point with me my wife and I were you know holding tight saying hey well we feel this way then we're being told it's time to get to leave yeah wow um but I I I feel like you like you to answer your question I feel like it's complete UT dog [ __ ] that they're going welcome people back they kicked out yeah I mean there's no way I would do it absolutely not matter of fact I'm going to come after you and probably sue you to be honest with you yeah I think I think they should yep uh do you know about how many guys ref like how many no [ __ ] active duty seals refused the shot and were forced out of the military I don't have that number ballpark dozens hundreds I would say dozens because I know in the West CO I think the the group in the west coast that kind of started it like Hey we're going to lawyer up this doesn't feel right it was a pretty big group of dudes I don't think it I think it was somewhere 10 or more and I know in the on the East Coast it was guys were on a daily mission like well if I don't do this and I got you know and that was another dozen two dozen dudes that were in a holding pattern of what their future was going to be and these weren't all like new guys This Is War you know veterans that were like this does not feel right that's absurd yep absolutely absurd yep um so all right so you play that game long enough to at least get out without having to kicked out got my got my honorable which was good did the the were the guys that were forced out for not getting the shot did they get other thanor I believe so or they're getting threatened with that I believe if not dishonorable because you were getting hit by you were not you were disobeying a direct order to me this sucks for two reasons right uh actually more than two reasons but the primary two are that I get the hey when you sign up like you can't refuse all the other inoculations and you can't be like no I don't want that like this is what you're getting you signed up that's part of the deal I get that where this is different is is that you know that's not one that you signed up to get number one and number two it's like you know I mean you can argue till we're all blue in the face about the efficacy or the lack of efficacy of it but the fact that it was you know essentially experimental it was rushed through it wasn't part of the program when you signed up you know it's it's kind of an oddball you know to me from a legality standpoint it's kind of a weird grade area that way like you know where I think it's the most disheartening is that you know to take guys say look like I could understand if the Navy said we would like everybody to get it but we're not going to force you to get it you know um you can suggest of sell to me all day long yeah but I have to have a choice yeah to to me that that is how they should have handled it to to legitimately like slap your dick on the counter and say if you don't get this we're we're kicking qualified combat veteran active duty Navy Seals out of the military because you won't take this [ __ ] shot to me says so much more about what what I've been bitching about since you you and I have have come in contact with each other since last night and just just the lack of overall quality leadership and the higher you go the worse it gets you know and to me this is as clear-cut of an example that exists uh you know of that um from morale standpoint from a an overall Community Vibe if you will you know you've you've gotten now how the [ __ ] is there a fly flying around in here especially in this weather Bryce handle that will you um the uh from your perspective having gotten out fairly recently um how would you characterize the overall morale of of the seal Community right now I have more conversations on a weekly basis with the guys that are so lost because they lost what they feel as a part of of them when they had to inevitably leave the sealed teams before they wanted to yeah um I was one of them and I think between that instance the situation we're talking about now and then everything else because the op Tempo isn't where it was and now everyone's so focused on I hate to say but like haircuts and shaves and stuff that I understand we join the military and there has to be some bearing there I'm not going to say we're special so we should get special but we should be focused on our priority and that's defending this country at the highest level yeah and I don't think that that's necessarily the priority all the time and I think from the the mafia you know the little E5 E6 Mafia it's um they're still going to be pipe hitters and they're still going to get after it but I think that a lot of guys are really looking at it like man it's not what the brochure said yeah and I think that it's it's heartbreaking it was for me it was really difficult to to make that transition out when I wasn't done I had plenty of left in me to give to the Navy um and uh yeah like I said a lot of my buddies it's a weekly conversation on what's next what do we do next how how do we navigate this space that we didn't anticipate being in and I found my you know found my silver lining s my found my light through helping others get out with what they're entitled you know to get out with so yeah it's it's low morale is low my friend let's just to put it in nutshell very low and I'm talking with guys coming off you know coming off the birds now from deployment and you know on my Coast it's we we got to get across the street we got to get over to the command like we're trying to we want we want them to take the next step forward you know yeah I mean I think from a from a again from a big picture standpoint I you know would would beg to differ a little bit in that uh you know it's called Naval special Warfare called Special Operations know you know so so to me you know whether you're shaved or not or you're uniform looks a certain way it's like yeah you're in the military but Special Operations are unconventional unconventional by Design correct and I I think you should you should always look at like I was saying last night you know to me the the simplest question that you should always ask yourself when you're deciding whether or not to do something is does it make us a more effective War fighting force the answer is yes do it to me if if you're expecting guys to be uh as Blended in and and as um kind of autonomous as possible within the military to go execute anti terrorism and and quick strike raids and unconventional warfare to me the smart answer is will let them from a uniform and and code standpoint let them be however they need to be to be good at that you know um I think being clean shaven with a high and tight has no bearing on that and and if anything you know the amount of time that you spend going through training and getting to that point is something that very few people uh obtain and and if something as simple as letting guys have beards and out of rgg tattoos and [ __ ] ponytails or Top Knots they look like Vikings or or whatever if that helps them feel more like a a Band of Brothers if it raises morale why not do it you know it's not hurting anything we need you back man we need you back bro

69,K3odScka55A,Why you can&#39;t compare Covid-19 vaccines,"What a vaccine's ""efficacy rate"" actually means.

Sign up for our newsletter: http://www.vox.com/video-newsletter

In the US, the first two available Covid-19 vaccines were the ones from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. Both vaccines have very high ""efficacy rates,"" of around 95%. But the third vaccine introduced in the US, from Johnson & Johnson, has a considerably lower efficacy rate: just 66%.

Look at those numbers next to each other, and it's natural to conclude that one of them is considerably worse. Why settle for 66% when you can have 95%? But that isn't the right way to understand a vaccine's efficacy rate, or even to understand what a vaccine does. And public health experts say that if you really want to know which vaccine is the best one, efficacy isn't actually the most important number at all.

Before now, we were buying time for some eventual moment that we didn't even know would come. Now we are buying time for a goal we can actually see...and a goal that isn't far off.

--

In the 20th century, most vaccines took over a decade to research, test, and produce. But the vaccines for COVID-19 were cleared for emergency use in less than 11 months. The secret behind this speed is a medical technology that’s been developing for decades: the mRNA vaccine. So how do these revolutionary vaccines work? Kaitlyn Sadtler and Elizabeth Wayne dig into the science of mRNA technology.

well over a decade to research, test, and produce. But the vaccines for COVID-19 cleared 
the threshold for emergency use in less than 11 months. The secret behind this speed 
is a medical technology that’s been developing for decades: the mRNA vaccine. This new treatment uses our body’s 
existing cellular machinery to trigger an immune response, protecting us from viruses without
ever experiencing an infection. And in the future, this approach might
be able to treat new diseases almost as quickly as they emerge. So how do these 
revolutionary vaccines work? The key ingredient is in the name. mRNA, or messenger ribonucleic acid,
is a naturally occurring molecule that encodes the instructions 
for producing proteins. When our cells process mRNA, 
a part of the cell called the ribosome translates and follows these instructions
to build the encoded protein. The mRNA in these vaccines works
in exactly the same way, but scientists use the molecule to safely
introduce our body to a virus. First, researchers encode trillions 
of mRNA molecules with the instructions for a specific viral protein. This part of the virus is
harmless by itself, but helpful for training 
our body’s immune response. Then, they inject those molecules 
into a nanoparticle roughly 1,000 times smaller 
than the average cell. This nanoparticle is made of lipids, the same type of fatty material that forms
the membrane around our cells. But these lipids have been 
specially engineered to protect the mRNA on its journey 
through the body and assist its entry into the cell. Lastly, the final ingredients are added:
sugars and salt to help keep the nanoparticles intact 
until they reach their destination. Before use, the vaccine is kept at a 
temperature of -20 to -80 degrees Celsius to ensure none of the components
break down. Once injected, the nanoparticles
disperse and encounter cells. The lipid coating on each nanoparticle
fuses with the lipid membrane of a cell and releases the mRNA to do its work. At this point, we should note 
that while the vaccine is delivering viral genetic material into our cells, it’s impossible for this material 
to alter our DNA. mRNA is a short-lived molecule that would need additional enzymes and 
chemical signals to even access our DNA, let alone change it. And none of these DNA altering components
are present in mRNA vaccines. Once inside the cell, the ribosome
translates the mRNA’s instructions and begins assembling the viral protein. In COVID-19 vaccines, that protein 
is one of the spikes typically found on the virus’s surface. Without the rest of the virus 
this lone spike is not infectious, but it does trigger our immune response. Activating the immune system
can be taxing on the body, resulting in brief fatigue, fever, 
and muscle soreness in some people. But this doesn’t mean 
the recipient is sick— it means the vaccine is working. The body is producing antibodies to fight
that viral protein, that will then stick around to defend 
against future COVID-19 infections. And since this particular protein is
likely to be found in most COVID variants, these antibodies should reduce 
the threat of catching new strains. This approach offers significant
advantages over previous vaccines. Traditional vaccines contain 
weakened versions of live viruses or amputated sections of a virus, both of which required time intensive
research to prepare and unique chemical treatments
to safely inject. But mRNA vaccines don’t actually
contain any viral particles, so they don’t have to be built 
from scratch to safely adjust each virus. In fact, every mRNA vaccine could have
roughly the same list of ingredients. Imagine a reliable, robustly tested
vaccine that can treat any disease by swapping out a single component. To treat a new illness, researchers would 
identify the right viral protein, encode it into mRNA, and then swap that mRNA 
into the existing vaccine platform. This could make it possible to develop
new vaccines in weeks, giving humanity a flexible new tool 
in the never-ending fight against disease."

reportedly weighing dropping the 5-day isolation recommendation for covid positive patients experts and health officials told the Washington Post that the quote new reality with most people having developed a level of immunity to the virus because of Prior infection or vaccination warrant a shift to a more practical approach for the post the cdc's new plans are recommended are to recommend people stay home as long as they've been fever free for 24 hours and are experiencing mild and improving symptoms meanwhile new studies found that millions of people are reporting long covid symptoms after their initial infection one study on pregnant women found that one in 10 who were infected while carrying have experienced long covid symptoms uh that's those are really high numbers I know that um I had friends who were pregnant during covid and they were very worried about a lot of different things they were worried about the implications of the vaccine they were worried about what it would mean if they caught covid while they were pregnant they were worried when their babies were born about how vulnerable they would be and obviously some of those concerns have been Allied but there is just so much Unknown about it and to discover that one in 10 women who were pregnant and contracted covid seem to be still dealing with symptoms is is a disturbing is a disturbing figure what what do you make about sorry I didn't mean to interrupt right I mean say they are suffering symptoms I mean the problem with long covid is a lot of the ascribed symptoms have a somewhat vague um aspect of the brain fog fatigue anxiety Etc which I separate a little bit from the last you know lasting respiratory complications that kind of thing which which does happen in in many cases and has a more is more concrete um you know I've been skeptical in the past and continue to be skeptical given that people the disproportionately people who are already in high anxiety groups or hypochondriacs are more likely to report suffering from what is a disease that like defies explanation brain fog tiredness so I have a lot of underlying skepticism of these so when doctors diagnosed long covid are you saying they diagnos You by saying but they just ask you no you're that's not true we've talked about well we haven't talked about this very much on this show but outside of this show where there's more of an audience for this sort of thing there's a lot research around the medical the medical community I'm talking about doctors reporting on brain scans of people who have had long Co that are demonstrably different these AR brain what you just cited with pregnant people is them saying I'm do I read the same read that you saw doctors diagnosed women one in 10 women with who had contracted Co during their pregnancy have long by scan their brains I don't know but a doctor's diagnosis it's not something that I'm going to throw out the window because it's politically inconvenient for me what I will say is that's concerning and that obviously should be more in investigation into that to that end there was the first ever long covid hearing that actually happened yesterday we're now four years into this um and this is the first time that there's been apparently some Congressional inquiry into what's going on here we have a clip of that let's take a look it now you should be asking me now how do we prevent long covid well the best way to prevent long covid is to prevent covid in the first place there is actually no long covid without covid you know if you go back to 2019 you go back to 2018 none of us have heard of long covid have you you haven't it didn't exist there is no long Co without covid we need a sustainable multi-prong approach to prevent repeated infections that would be embraced by the public this requires accelerating the development of oral intranasal vaccines that block infections this is very very very important ventilation and air filtration systems are also very important they can play a major role role in reducing the risk of transmission of Airborne pathogens we also need variant proof vaccines what the virus is doing is really continuing to mutate on us you know every few months you're going to see a new variant we need a variant proof vaccine that lasts for a long time that is durable that has dur that offers durable immunity people are sick and tired of having to have boosters every few months we need vaccines that last for five years or so so they can get it done and get it over with for five years we must also understand vaccine side effects this is must be acknowledged and understood very very deeply this is very very important now you should be asking me also like how do we so thought there's a lot of compelling in there really recognizing that the vaccine side effect issue which has gotten really short shrift um that he's talking about another concern of the kind of vaccines kep the community which is that the vaccines weren't sterilizing vaccines that W vaccines that actually prevented you from getting covid in the first instance so he's emphasizing that they've got to keep working to develop vaccines that do that that the vaccines have to be more durable than they've been so far that so that they can protect you for five years or more instead of uh being vaccines that one don't prevent you from getting covid and two you have to go get boosters to get and then three that rolls into the concerns about the side effects of vaccines so all of these things are really related and then talking about things that are much less invasive like ensuring that there's good air quality and that people have access to other kinds of interventions that do can prevent um uh the spread of covid I follow an epidemiologist who really has opened my my eyes to the extent to which a lot of more affluent people in particular and folks that are in professions where there's a lot of high risk um and money on the table if they get sick athletes and the like uh to use uh nasal sprays and the like that are are that have shown a lot of Promise in preventing people from Contracting covid but again those are resources that aren't broadly talked about anymore obviously the Biden Administration has said Co is over you have the CDC polic policy which is Shifting not seemingly on the basis of any new information about whether or not Co is contagious at that stage but simply for quote practical concern saying that people should no longer quarantine not saying that they should stop quarantining because they're no longer coughing or sneezing or sniffling or you know riping their their mucus on things but simply when they have no fever for 24 hours well said improving symptoms I don't I don't think you should have to wait I mean people are the reality is people are doing they're not following this guy people now are well sure but people have adapted to frankly people don't stay home enough when they're sick I agree if you are sick and symptomatic you should stay home and if you have to go out in those circumstances you have to travel in those circumstances um like if you're coughing and sneezing I think that's a perfectly good idea to wear a mask um if you're but if you're ill and you've recovered and you're no longer symptomatic I I don't just like any other illness most people would not stay home from work an additional three days or or quarantine themselves in additional three days if they were no longer sick with the flu they got over real quickly or if they had some other respiratory issue and it had been like a 24-hour thing they wouldn't just sit it so why treat it different I agree that people don't but I think that they should I think that we should live in a society where one people do masks when they're sick like many places in East Asia there's an expectation that it's common courtesy not to come into public coughing and sniffling the way boy oh boy you walk into an airport around the holidays and it sounds like you're in a hospital Ward the way that people are hacking and coughing knowing that they're about to be in tight quarters with a bunch of other people on the plane and there's Nar a mask to be seen and two I wish this is my obviously my perspective as a leftist that the reason that people are forced so often to go to sick to go to work sick to go to work nine months pregnant to go to work in all of these conditions that are not necessarily advisable from a medical perspective is because we don't have sufficient paid sick leave and there are so many people in this country that cannot afford to take a day off work even if they technically get permission to do so and so I do think this is a systemic social problem we should not put the be putting the burden on individuals who might not have the money and resources to stay home to be forced in that situation which is why these guidelines can provide some kind of insulation for folks who are trying to advocate for their employer hey I want to be able to take this time but if even the CDC says get back to work you know who's really being advantaged by that I and I have to I mean forgive my skepticism on the whole idea that will develop look I would love to develop I was for I was supportive of the vaccines initially because I wanted to be done with the pandemic I didn't want I hate wearing masks and I wanted it to be the case that it was going to stop you from getting covid entirely um working more like a vaccine for you know measles or MPS or whatever instead it works like a vaccine for the flu in which while it's an advisable thing for particularly for atrisk people because it reduces your severity of symptoms and you're risk of being hospitalized or suffering death um it it it does not might might make you symptomatic for less Long so less likely to pass it on again I've gotten vaccinated I've gotten boosted people should make this decision for themselves it should never be forced on them but it it works like the flu vaccine which we've had for a long time and we've not managed to improve into a version that actually prevents you from getting the flu altogether I think that would be great if they can do that but he's talking about that I like I don't know how realistic that's ever going to be given we were not able to do that for related illnesses the pessim I don't think that's an a a fair and accurate analogy and what is this nasal spray that stops from getting it what are you talking about it's a it's it's exactly what it sounds like what's the confusion no I've never heard of this well maybe we should do a segment or two about all the other kinds of Co research and interventions that have been going on instead of having a kind of narrow political view on covering this particular issue um so uh gosh I'm trying to find the name of it I think there's one that's called um in innovid spray uh it creates Nitric nitric oxide when the spray is released from the tip of the bottle it's when formulated oh I don't know I'm now I'm just reading stuff does it stop you from getting Co or prevents it blocks it in your nasal passage like the thing they take in in um what is that the second um Knives Out movie they um they during the pic spr with something yeah sort of I guess but it's more like of a barrier than a neutralizing agent in your body or anything like that um all right well we'll do more research there yeah we we'll get we'll get back to you on that stick with us we're Rising after this [Music]

Vaccines prepare the immune system, getting it ready to fight disease-causing organisms, called pathogens. A vaccine is introduced to the body to mimic infection, triggering the body to produce antibodies against the pathogen, but without causing the illness. Conventional vaccines usually contain a weakened or inactivated pathogen; or a piece of a protein produced by the pathogen, called an antigen. 
RNA vaccines are a new generation of vaccines. Instead of the antigen itself, RNA vaccines contain a messenger RNA – mRNA - that encodes for the antigen. Once inside the body’s cells, the mRNA is translated into protein, the antigen, by the same process the cells use to make their own proteins. The antigen is then displayed on the cell surface where it is recognized by the immune system. From here, the sequence of events is similar to that of a conventional vaccine.
Some RNA vaccines also contain additional mRNA coding for an enzyme, which, after being translated in host cells, can generate multiple copies of the antigen-encoding mRNA. This essentially amplifies the production of antigen from a small amount of vaccine, making the vaccine more effective. These are called self-amplifying RNA vaccines. 
RNA vaccines are easier and safer to produce than conventional vaccines. This is because mRNA molecules can be synthesized in a cell-free system using a DNA template with a sequence of the pathogen; while conventional vaccines usually require a more complicated and risk-prone process of growing large amounts of infectious pathogens in chicken eggs or other mammalian cells. Without the risks of being contaminated by infectious elements or allergens from egg cultures, RNA vaccines are also safer for patients.
Because protein synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm, RNA molecules do not need to enter the nucleus, so the possibility of them integrating into the host cell genome is low. RNA strands are usually degraded by cellular enzymes once the protein is made.
The relative simplicity of the production process makes it easier to standardize and scale, enabling rapid responses to emerging pandemics. Other advantages include lower production costs, and the ease of tweaking RNA sequences to adapt to rapidly-mutating pathogens.
On the minus side, it can be challenging to deliver mRNA effectively to the cells, since RNA sequences and secondary structures may be recognized and destroyed by the innate immune system as soon as they are administered intravenously. These limitations can be overcome by optimizing codons, using modified nucleosides to avoid recognition, and packaging RNA into protective nanoparticles. 
Another disadvantage is that most RNA vaccines require uninterrupted refrigeration for transportation and storage, which can be a hurdle for vaccine distribution. Research is ongoing to engineer thermostable vaccines.",2020-11-18,1226790,10048,1707,UCiTGKA9W0G0TL8Hm7Uf_u9A," Vaccines prepare the immune system, getting

vaccines usually require a more complicated and risk-prone process of growing large amounts
of infectious pathogens in chicken eggs or other mammalian cells. Without the risks of being contaminated by
infectious elements or allergens from egg cultures, RNA vaccines are also safer for
patients. Because protein synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm,
RNA molecules do not need to enter the nucleus, so the possibility of them integrating into
the host cell genome is low. RNA strands are usually degraded by cellular
enzymes once the protein is made. The relative simplicity of the production
process makes it easier to standardize and scale, enabling rapid responses to emerging
pandemics. Other advantages include lower production
costs, and the ease of tweaking RNA sequences to adapt to rapidly-mutating pathogens. On the minus side, it can be challenging to
deliver mRNA effectively to the cells, since RNA sequences and secondary structures may
be recognized and destroyed by the innate immune system as soon as they are administered
intravenously. These limitations can be overcome by optimizing
codons, using modified nucleosides to avoid recognition, and packaging RNA into protective
nanoparticles. Another disadvantage is that most RNA vaccines
require uninterrupted refrigeration for transportation and storage, which can be a hurdle for vaccine
distribution. Research is ongoing to engineer thermostable
vaccines."
80,iMx7kmld9sk,Idaho lawmakers introduce legislation to criminalize those who administer COVID vaccines,The bill would make administering an mRNA vaccine -- a COVID vaccine -- a misdemeanor.,2023-02-17,14297,577,529,UCVKYCeuR3OyO-M2rfUXHDyg," A bill has been introduced in the Idaho legislature that would charge people who administer M RNA vaccines with a misdemeanor. Republican Senator Tammy Nichols and Republican Representative Judy Boyle introduced that bill in the House Health and Welfare Committee yesterday. Johns Hopkins Medicine says M RNA, that's a molecule that assists in making proteins, and some, if not most, of the COVID-19 vaccines are known as M RNA vaccines, and they help your body make proteins that mimic the COVID virus to help fight the infection. This bill obviously still needs a vote in the committee before it moves onto the House floor."

कोरोना वैक्सीन का सच में बुरा असर पड़ रहा ! || Covid Vaccine Impact on Heart
There are multiple reviews on cardiovascular aspects of COVID-19 disease on cardiovascular system in different population but there is lack of evidence about cardiovascular adverse effects of COVID vaccines.
Myocarditis (with overall rate around 1.62%) was shown to be the most common post-COVID19 immunization cardiac event. More than 90% of post-COVID19 vaccination myocarditis occurred after receiving mRNA vaccines (Moderna & Pfizer-BioNTech), but the report of this event was less in the case of vector-based vaccinations and/or inactivated vaccines. Myocarditis was reported more commonly in men and following the second dose of the immunization. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) was reported after mRNA (more commonly) and vector-based vaccinations, with no case report after inactivated vaccines. When mRNA and vector-based vaccinations were used instead of inactivated vaccines, a greater frequency of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) and pulmonary emboli (PE) was reported. Myocardial infarction/cardiac arrest was recorded in those beyond the age of 75 years.

Conclusion
The personal and public health benefits of COVID-19 vaccination much outweigh the minor cardiac risks. Reporting bias, regarding more available mRNA vaccines in developed countries, may conflict these results.

you're putting into your bodies it has been 2 years since coid vaccines were first introduced yet we continue to gain new insights into their impact on our bodies especially on women's reproductive Health now over the past two years there's no denying that these vaccines have prevented millions of hospitalizations and deaths so before I proceed let me be clear vaccines are the best protection against several life-threatening diseases is but do we know enough about them new studies have also highlighted the hidden risks of coid vaccines specifically for Women's Health ranging from irregular menstrual cycles to miscarriages and even reduced milk supply in breastfeeding mothers it begs the question what potentially harmful elements are we injecting into our bodies are we unknowingly endangering our health in the pursuit of immunity we know that coid 19 vac vaccines have different effects on women when compared to men so we must consider whether the Pharma industry is giving sufficient and equal thought to the impact of their products on women's health the question is is there adequate research to address the gender gap in medical studies in the latest development a new study has discovered the presence of mRNA from coid vaccines what is mRNA it stands for Messenger ribonucleic acid and it is a single stranded molecule that carries the instructions to make proteins it has a fundamental and essential role that makes our bodies function so an mRNA vaccine tricks the body into producing some of the viral proteins itself they work by using this mRNA which is a molecule that essentially puts DNA instructions into action that's how the vaccine works now a new study has found that in the breast milk of breastfeeding mothers for up to 45 hours after receiving this vaccine MRN na is still present the study has been published in the journal Lancet 70% of the breast milk samples analyzed in the study were found to contain mRNA from the vaccines although the detected amount was largely fragmented it retained 12% to 25% of its original Integrity the researchers suggest that more studies needed to determine the minimum amount of mRNA that could potentially trigger an immune response in newborn babies the samples were collected from 13 healthy postpartum women both before and after vaccination in total there were 20 vaccine exposures and 154 breast milk samples considered now full disclosure the 13 lactating women had received either the modna or fisa vaccine what the study found was Trace Amounts of mRNA were present in 10 to 20 exposures up to 45 hours after vaccination the study noted that the SAS cov2 Spike protein was not expressed all participating women tested negative for coid before the collection of milk samples the samples collected before vaccination tested negative now this finding is significant in its scope extending Beyond mRNA coid vaccines the study offers valuable insights into the transport and presence of vaccine mRNA and breast milk which can be relevant for assessing the safety and efficacy of future therapies which are given to pregnant women and lactating women in particular it is important to note that in 2021 study showed that no traces of mRNA vaccines ended up in mother's breast milk at the time it was suggested that such vaccines are safe during lactation and lactating women were encouraged to take them without stopping breastfeeding however when the vaccines became available changes in women's menstrual cycles were reported While most women showed no evidence of menstrual alteration some indicated either an increase or a delayed cycle a Saudi Arabian study evaluated the impact of ID 19 vaccines on all aspects of the menstrual cycle including cycle length amount of bleeding and pain the study included a total of 673 women 46% of them reported changes in their cycle after both coid 19 vaccine doses the study was conducted from May to September last year and the report concluded by promoting the co 19 vaccine stating that there is no statistically significant association between the vaccine and the many issues that the women in the study based however this raises important questions were there temporary issues factored into research did we know beforehand what effects these vaccines might have on women's health because when you experience late periods abnormal bleeding or increased pain it can cause panic and anxiety if these effects had been discussed earlier women might have been better prepared to handle them almost all research on Co 19 and clinical trials of vaccines do not include data sufficient data on women how can we combat the pandemic if half of the human population is left out of Co 19 research the lifelong consequences of this neglect could be severe for women globally particularly as new V variants and other viruses emerge and potentially exacerbate the differences even more take this study for example it was published last year and proves the exclusion of women from studies it demonstrates how this exclusion harms Women's Health in the long run and slows our response to the pandemic it highlights that studies still neglect to include enough women in clinical trials despite big differences pandemic research and medical research in general could be transformed by focusing more on gender specific effects of disease and treatment it is crucial to include women in research to assess the short and long-term benefits and effects remember in a pandemic only when we save one section of the society women in this case can we save everyone we on world

jump on in like one minute. - I know, he's almost here. I have the participant window open, and I get to allow him to enter. - It's weird, I'm gonna be smiling, 'cause I'm just excited to see him. - Some nervous energy. - He's a busy man. He's doing lots of world saving. - We were 45 minutes early. - Okay. Ready? He's here, I'm admitting him right now. Here we go. (dramatic music) (bell ringing) - Hey, hey, hi guys, how you doing? - [All] Hi, Dr. Fauci! (upbeat music) (light music) - [Zach] On December 14th,
the first vaccine for COVID-19 in the U.S. was administered, beginning our nationwide rollout. - Now there are a lot of questions and misinformation out there, and today, we are having the one
person who can debunk all of the conspiracy theories joining us. - Although there's a lot of
misinformation out there, today, we're talking to Mr. Information. - Today, we're speaking
with Dr. Anthony Fauci, a physician and immunologist. I certainly have a crush on him. (Zach laughs) - He's the most important
man of the last year. - The Beyonce of medicine. - Right? - He is the Beyonce of medicine. - [Narrator] Immunologist,
Dr. Anthony Fauci. - Dr. Fauci. - Dr. Fauci. - There's nothing more important
than him doing his job. - I'm Dr. Anthony Fauci. - My name is Dr. Tony Fauci. - During the course of the
pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci has been the physician most
Americans have relied upon for their information. - [Narrator] Fauci
graduated first in his class at Cornell Medical College. His career spans six presidents and over 30 years of research. - [Narrator] Not only
did Dr. Fauci foresee this kind of pandemic,
scientists at the NIH have spent years preparing for it. - We're gonna use public health measures to help us safely get
to where we want to go. - Hey.
- Hi, Dr. Fauci. - Hello.
- Hi, everybody. Hi, guys, how you doing? - We're so good.
- Wonderful. - Doing well, thank you.
- Good. - We love you. - So Dr. Fauci, this
is the fastest vaccine in human history. People wanna know, did
we undermine the safety of the vaccine because it was done so fast and without long-term studies? - Okay, so that's a great question. It's the most commonly asked question. There was no cutting corners. Safety was not compromised. Scientific integrity was not compromised, and I think people need to
understand that the speed was related completely to the breathtaking scientific advances that had been made over the previous 10 or more years, where you can get the genetic
sequence of the virus, which then take that sequence and insert the appropriate gene into these very new and unbelievably efficient
vaccine platforms, and that didn't sacrifice
any safety at all. That was purely a technological advance. Then the Moderna trial was 30,000 people. The Pfizer trial was 44,000 people, and it happened to be
taking place in the middle of a ferocious outbreak. So when you're trying to
prove a vaccine works, and there are just a few infections here and there in society, it could take seven
years to get a vaccine. There was so many infections
that we went from sequence to getting the vaccine in
people's arms in less than a year. That is historic, but it's historic from a scientific standpoint. There was absolutely no
cutting of corners at all. - So you're saying that there's no chance that there's some weird side
effects that are gonna pop up three years down the road? - The chance of that happening
is spectacularly low, and let me tell you why. If you look at the history
of all vaccinology, and you say when did these so-called longer term effects occur? The overwhelming majority,
90 plus percent of them occur between 30 and 45 days after
the vaccine trial ends. That is the reason why the FDA said that in order to make an
emergency use authorization, you had to wait 60 days from the time 50% of the people in the
trial got their last dose. So if you wait 60 days,
you're already beyond when essentially all of the
long-term effects occur. I've never seen one, where
I get vaccinated in 1982, and I get a toxic effect in 1986. I mean, it just, I've
never seen that happen with any vaccine. - Mm, mm-hmm. - Wow, that's amazing. Okay, I'm gonna ask you a question here. Can I still infect someone
else after I get the vaccine and do I have to keep wearing
a mask after I get it? - The answer is yes, and I'll explain why. It is still conceivable
that you could get infected and be asymptomatic, and
even though the vaccine protected you from getting sick, it didn't protect you
from getting infected. So you may not even know
that you're infected and be completely asymptomatic, and then spread it to somebody else. - I think that's been the scariest part of this whole pandemic, is
that I could totally have it and not know, and that terrifies me. - We can pull back on masks when we get such an overwhelming proportion of the population is vaccinated that there's herd immunity,
which means that the level of virus is so low that it's not a threat. - What percentage of people
need to get the vaccine for us to achieve that? - You know, we don't
know the exact number, but we can make a back of
the envelope calculation that it's somewhere between
70 and 85% of the population needs to be vaccinated
to get herd immunity. - Here's, you know, some
people, there's a lot of people talking about things out there. Some people think maybe it'd be easier to just achieve herd
immunity by letting the virus spread rampantly through the population. What do you think about that? - Okay, well that's maybe the worst idea. (both laughing) - [Keith] Okay. - I don't want to compare it to anything. I don't want to insult anybody. - It's not my question. It's just a question that I have read, and I'm relaying to you
because you're the expert. - Did you read it on Facebook, Keith? - I did read it on Facebook.
(Fauci laughs) - The general level of
herd immunity right now in the country, the last
time the CDC looked at it, was like 10%, 12%. Some cities like New York, it was 22%, because New York got hit
so badly in the beginning. So let's say that the
level in the country today, let's say is 20%. So with 20% of the people infected, we've already had 352,000 deaths. To get to 80, you'd have to
have four times as many people. So are you willing to
accept 1.2 million deaths in order to get to herd immunity? I don't think so. So the road to herd immunity is a vaccine, not just letting people get infected. - And how soon after getting
the vaccine would I be immune? - So let's say you get
vaccinated, and then 21 to 28 days later, you get a boost, anywhere from 10 to 14
days following the boost, you can consider yourself protected. - Dr. Fauci, a new COVID
variant has been reported in over 40 countries and is
said to be more transmittable. Will that make the vaccine irrelevant? - That has a mutation,
which is causing the virus to be much more easily
transmissible from person to person. According to the Brits, who've
looked at it very carefully, and we will also be doing the same thing, they find that the mutation
does not make people sicker or even more people
dying, nor does it seem to interfere with the protection that's afforded by the vaccine. So the only thing that's
functionally different, it appears to spread more easily. - My fiancee, Maggie, she actually got the
vaccine already at work. They've been prioritizing nurses. For me, there's like a lot of contrasting information out there. Like I'm immunosuppressed,
and I don't know, am I supposed to get it? - You can take a vaccine. The only time an immunocompromised person should not take a vaccine is when it's a live attenuated vaccine, because the virus can then
replicate a lot in you, and not stop replicating the way a person who has a normal immune system would be. But you should get vaccinated, because even though the immune compromise may not get you to have
as robust a response, a less than robust response
is better than no response. So go get vaccinated. - Some protection is better
than no protection, yes. - I learned that in college. (group laughing) - Stop guys, stop, stop.
(Keith laughs) - I have a newborn child. We just got his two months' vaccines for all of the other stuff, but I've been really worried about COVID. When can my kids get the vaccine? Do they need to get it? - They do, but let me tell
you what the strategy has been for decades and decades
and decades with vaccines. Children and pregnant
women are vulnerable. So the general policy has been
you do not vaccinate children or pregnant women until
you've proven that the vaccine induces the same sort of
response that it induces in normal adults and protects them. And you do what's called a bridge. You bridge the immunogenicity
study in the children and the pregnant women
with the efficacy study that you've already completed, and you make a determination that it's okay to give it to children. We're gonna start that likely
towards the end of January, we'll be doing that in children. - Oh, that's soon. - So Dr. Fauci, we know that the vaccine doesn't instantly make everything better. So what can you tell us about what the next few months look like? - By the time we get to April, I think it would be open season. Namely, anybody can get vaccinated. There's no restrictions on it at all, because all the priority
people have been vaccinated. If we then vaccinate at a very good rate, President Biden has made the announcement that he's gonna try and
get 1 million doses a day, so that a hundred million
in the first hundred days. If we do 1 million a day, by the time we get to
the end of the summer, we will have reached that a
percentage of herd immunity. So that in the fall, if
everybody gets vaccinated that should get vaccinated, we can start approaching
a degree of normality. That doesn't mean nobody wears a mask, but that does mean kids
can feel secure at school, you can go to a sporting event, you can go to a restaurant
and have dinner, you can go to the
theater, things like that. The critical issue is that
we wanna really make sure that this vaccine hesitancy
that we see around gets overcome by the truth, that the vaccine is safe
and it's efficacious, and it will protect you, your family, and ultimately all of society. So go out there and beat the bushes. Tell your friends to get vaccinated. - Dr. Fauci, you've been
interviewed by the best of the best the world has to offer, but
never by four idiots at once. Next up, we have a lightning round. Are you ready? (dramatic music) - [Announcer] Lightning Round - These are some of the
most widely believed COVID vaccine conspiracy
theories on the internet. - Okay, Dr. Fauci, are
you lying when you said you got the vaccine? - No. (laughs) Right here. - [Announcer] Lightning Round. - Does the COVID vaccine cause COVID? - Absolutely impossible. - [Announcer] Lightning Round. - Are the vaccine ingredients more toxic than COVID-19 itself? - Absolutely not. - [Announcer] Lightning Round. - Will the vaccine change my DNA? - Absolutely impossible. - [Announcer] Lightning Round. - Well, do the vaccines
deliver a microchip barcode into my arm to keep a
track of me wherever I go? - (chuckles) No, it doesn't.
(both laugh) - [Announcer] Lightning Round. - And Dr. Fauci, one final question. Will coupons that are redeemable for one vaccine shot be called Faucers? - (laughs) I hope not. - Think about it.
- That's a good idea. You know? You can run with that. - Dr. Fauci, we wanna thank
you so much for your time. Is there any one last thing
you would say to people who do not want to get the vaccine? - Yeah, I think they really
need to examine carefully in their mind the reasons for that. If it's really based on a lot
of people talking about hoaxes and things like that, you
really gotta take a look at the risk that we're going through. We're going through a
real historic challenge, the likes of which we
haven't seen in 102 years and all of this nonsense
about fake news and hoax and all that, I mean, that just results in more people dying. - We wanna thank you so much- - Thank you so much.
- For everything you do. - Yes, it's been a real pleasure. - [Ned] Go get vaccinated, everybody. - You bet! Do it. - [All] Bye, Dr. Fauci! - I love you. Oh, he hung up. - Guys, thanks so much for watching. We hope you are taking this as seriously as we need to take it. When you can get vaccinated,
you should get vaccinated. There's gonna be some links
in the description below with more information and
thanks again, Dr. Fauci. What an amazing experience
for us and for you. We all basically got to hang

87,RaLxhFiOBYk,Covid-19: Researcher blows the whistle on data integrity issues in Pfizer’s vaccine trial,"For researchers who were testing Pfizer’s vaccine at several sites in Texas during that autumn, speed may have come at the cost of data integrity and patient safety. 

A regional director who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has told The BMJ that the company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events reported in Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial. 
Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by the volume of problems they were finding. 

After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the regional director, Brook Jackson , emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Jackson has provided The BMJ with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails.

https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635",2022-03-16,3757749,69404,9725,UCrkhryqZABVzsGvfeAp0uIw, my name is Brooke Jackson I was fired in September of 2020 for being a whistleblower I was working on Pfizer's phase three pivotal trial on their covid-19 vaccine my first day on the job was the 8th of September and from the very beginning I noticed irregularities things that were questionable I would I would bring up the concerns to my managers and it was always or understaffed we're really trying hard to you know make this work you know at one point when I was going through emails there were emails from icon begging ventavia to follow up on severe Adverse Events that had been reported there were several emails about mislabeled specimens blood specimens and the nasal swabs there were specimens that were labeled with another participants information it was a nightmare and on the 16th of September I stayed late in clinic one evening and I was the only one in the clinic I walked into an area where the vaccines were refrigerated or frozen rather and when I walked in I saw a biohazard bag the plastic biohazard bag contained used needles and I realized how unorganized and sloppy ventavia was was handling everything in that same room where they uh where they kept the vaccine the vaccine was just left out and the boxes that the vaccine came in the containers they had written the subject information on these containers so right there you know me working on the study it unblinded me to the the randomization of these patients I made note of that I took pictures I took pictures to just to document what I'd seen to show my managers it was also discovered that ventavia was unblinding participants in the study based on a directive from our CEO which was to print out the randomization scheme and put that drug assignment in everybody's chart per Pfizer's protocol we should have immediately stopped enrolling but they never they never told Pfizer instead they wanted us to go through each of the charts and actually take out the randomization scheme that was printed so that coupled with everything else I made the recommendation for um been talking at a stop enrolling clinical trial participants in the study until we were able to let Pfizer know you sent me the photos thank you and I didn't I didn't pull them up I mean no granted that's I mean so I might should I not have taken the pictures the problem is is the breach of confidentiality and it was a personal thing because there's uh sponsor information on those boxes at that point it was clear to me that I I wasn't fitting in I decided that that next morning I was gonna gonna report my company to the FDA and so I did that about nine o'clock in the morning on the 25th of September and about six hours later I got a call from ventavia and was fired on the spot and told that I was not a good fit I remember investigator Cannon called me and we spoke for an hour and 16 minutes to be precise I can tell you everything that we talked about it mirrored what was typed in my formal complaint to them the unblinding the safety of the clinical trial participants not monitoring them for adverse reactions they were late to report Adverse Events again the untrained staff the oversight by the principal investigators specifically at the Fort Worth location the targeting of the employees for coming forward I thought that the FDA was going to swoop in and and and take care of everything what I was reporting was so important [Music]

themselves according to Daily Mail Chinese scientists have reportedly developed a mutant coronavirus strain that attacks the brain and has a 100% kill rate in mice worse they admit there's a risk it could spill over to humans the virus is a modified version of a Str found in Pengalin and was tested on mice expressing a protein found in humans to test that the disease might impact people reportedly all mice infected with the virus died between 7 and 8 days after being infected with symptoms including their eyes turning completely white rapid weight loss and fatigue researchers additionally found significant viral load in the mice's brains lungs noses eyes and wind pipes while the potential for a new pandemic could be rising here at home pandemic prev measures have done a full 180 Oakland's new covid policy is allowing even students who test positive for the Corona virus to attend classes as long as a child is asymptomatic they can go to school though they are encouraged to wear a mask here to discuss cor the Corona virus and this potential new mystery disease out of China is Alina Chan scientific adviser at the broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and co-author of viral to search for the origins of covid-19 welcome back to Rising Alina thank for having me so if it is possible to uh to calm us down to make our us less fearful please do so but I I know you'll be as honest and blunt as necessary what is this is this study not somehow not as bad as it seems what's going on yes the the wording in this study is a bit unfortunate because the pandemic virus SAS Co 2 also causes 100% of humaniz mice to to die so it it's not clear based on this new letter whether or not the the Pengalin virus is is more concerning than the pandemic virus but it is yet another example where the public is only learning about risky virus research once it once it is done once it is done and published that's when the public finds out so people don't don't get to find out before the work is done that is apparently no consultation and what this means is that if these viruses had not been published and if they unfortunately leaked from a lab there would be no way for the public to tell if this was from nature or if it came from a lab if it had been Genetically Enhanced so this is a real concern for for the world what do we know about the safety protocol in effect at the lab where this study was done as I understand it a big part of the negligence with respect to covid-19 was that the kind of equipment being used at the lab was insufficient for the uh virality of the um the virus that was being created so just to clarify this this wasn't the uhan lab this was a separate lamp in the different part of China uh but typically these types of viruses had been handled at pretty low bios safety at bsl2 so at this level there's almost no tracking of lab escapes so if you had been infected by a virus like SAS k 2 that has only mouth symptoms there's no way you would have caught that and traced it back to the lab and had an investigation so uh this this letter that came out about the pangalan virus actually did not state at what level bio safety the experiments were done so it could have been low it could have been high there's no way to tell so I think this is yet another reminder that we can't let scientists self-regulate on these sort of experiments you know because the the benefits are unclear of the study but the risk are real so the risk could impact billions of people around the world so a scientist might act on a dangerous idea at inappropriate bios safety and unfortunately billions of people pay the price so this is yet another reminder that we can't just let scientists do whatever they want and uh as a reminder for viewers uh the difference uh in the kind of lab safety protocols between the US and some labs in China what has actually been revealed to be uh a a selling has been a selling point for doing the research um you we we've covered on the show from us right to know doing this reporting showing that some of the one of the grants um that uh that Eco Health Alliance was trying to get you know specifically was was persuading the the oversight officials that it would be done the research would be done in the US but there's that note where they're saying but once we get it approved we can actually do it in China where there's less to worry about in terms of oversight yes so the the jump in cost is is is very dramatic between a low bios safety level to a higher bios safety level it can mean millions of dollars of difference and and also in Personnel training so for unfortunately a lot of research programs nowadays uh trying to do as much as possible with as little money as possible so some sometimes this means that bios safety costs are cut so people make estimates of how risky is this work can I get away with doing at the bio lower bios safety level and I think that after the pandemic happen clearly this is no longer acceptable I think most biologists even would look at this and think no we we can't be cutting cost on biosafety yeah most most virologists and probably like I I haven't taken a poll but I bet 80 90% of people read a headline like this uh that this experiment was done is say what we're still doing this kind of thing and and we're not doing it under the you know the be one thing to do it in Antarctica or on the moon or something but we're just we're doing this in the the same kind of potentially at least the same kind of circumstances yes that's right so these Lads no matter what the BIOS safety level is they tend to be located right smack in the middle of a city so if a scientist unfortunately gets exposed to a virus gets infected he doesn't even know that they've been infected they walk out to like the nearest Starbucks or something and boom like the whole city is infected within like a month or two right so this this could have been what happened in uhan in 2019 unfortunately is that working with these viruses with unknown pandemic potential you don't know what symptoms they cause you don't work with them at the highest bios safety level and there's no way to track incidents of exposure and someone just walks out in the middle of the city and boom you know all the hospitals the local market the train stations that just covered in virus so I I think that we we can't keep having coming back to this ation every time there's a new concerning paper there should be more proactive action being taken to to increase oversight globally on this type of research can you speak to what kind of oversight mechanisms are possible here the article references Chinese scientists are they Chinese scientists under the opes of the Chinese government are they American Affiliated scientists in a lab uh the way we had with the last pandemic and what are the implications with respect to oversight if it's one or the other So currently I think I think that the norm is that each institute decides for themselves really what what is what is appropriate or not and they also self-govern their own bios safety levels so there there's some responsibility to tell the funders so people who give them money to do this work what the safety level is but at the end of the day there's no mechanism to enforce like handing over all your lab records and biosafety incident records should an accident happened so I to say that unfortunately it it is kind of like the Wild West so this is what some of the top research funding agency leaders in the UK and US said that it it is like the wild west you don't know what's happening you don't know what biosafety level at V this work is happening you only find out later when there might have been a potential mishap Lena Chan thank you so much for joining us I remain very fearful but we appreciate your expertise thank you

#mRNAvaccine   #COVID19Vaccine   #COVID19

mRNA Vaccines for COVID-19. Vaccines are substances that protect you from harmful diseases. Most vaccines contain parts of weakened or dead germs that trigger your immune system to fight the disease. But mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 are different. They contain a substance, called mRNA, that teaches your cells how to make a protein that triggers an immune response. In order to understand how these vaccines work, it’s important to know what mRNA is and how it normally makes proteins your body needs. Most cells in your body have a “command center” inside them, called the nucleus. It contains genetic material, called DNA, that consists of instructions for building and maintaining your body. Proteins are one of the building blocks of your body. When a new body protein needs to be built, instructions for building it are copied from your cell’s DNA and converted into a “message,” called messenger RNA, or mRNA. Then, the mRNA travels out of the nucleus to a protein-building machine in your cell, called a ribosome. As the ribosome “reads” the “message” from the mRNA, it builds the protein your body needs. mRNA vaccines take advantage of this process to help give you immunity to COVID-19. Each vaccine contains special mRNA that provides instructions for your cells to build a harmless piece of the virus, called the spike protein. The spike protein is found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Each piece of the mRNA from the vaccine is wrapped in a protective coating. The vaccine is given as a shot in the upper arm. In the body, the mRNA particles enter your cells. Once inside the cell, the mRNA travels to a ribosome. Using the mRNA from the vaccine, the ribosome makes only a piece of the spike protein from the virus. After making the piece of the spike protein, your cell destroys the mRNA from the vaccine. It’s important to know that the mRNA from the vaccine never enters the cell’s nucleus or changes its DNA in any way. Next, your cell presents the piece of the spike protein on its surface. This allows your immune cells to detect the protein and recognize that it doesn’t belong there. As a result, your immune cells begin making antibodies as part of an immune response to the virus. In the future, if you catch the virus, the antibodies recognize and attach to the spike protein pieces on infected cells and the spike proteins on the virus. This marks them for immediate destruction by other immune cells. Like all vaccines, the benefit of these mRNA vaccines is that they give vaccinated people protection from the virus without having to get sick with COVID-19. Most mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 require you to get a second shot within a few weeks. Sometime after getting the vaccine, you may have symptoms, such as a fever. This is normal. It means the vaccine is working to make you immune to the virus. Vaccines protect you, your family, and your community from diseases that can be dangerous, or even deadly. For up to date information about vaccines for COVID-19 visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website at CDC.gov.

This video explains what happens in your body when you get the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, including how the vaccine helps your immune system recognize and fight the COVID-19 virus, possible side effects from the vaccine, and how long before you are fully-vaccinated against the virus after receiving the vaccine.

Hash tags: #CoronavirusVaccine #COVID19Vaccine #Coronavirus",2021-08-03,1353908,16194,4420,UC85VW73bQLEjs_taFKP7TwQ," Have you been able to get  your COVID-19 jab yet? Many countries are rolling out the COVID-19 vaccines so that the pandemic will be over  and we can get back to normal. If you’ve never had COVID-19,  your body doesn’t know  how to fight it off. Vaccines help train  your immune system to recognize the virus  and be ready to attack. But as we all have  different immune systems,  we respond differently to the vaccine and the virus. Having side effects has nothing to do  with the effectiveness of the vaccine.   So let's see what's going on  once you get the jab. Congratulations! You’ve just had your first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.  For this episode, we'll be focusing on messenger RNA, or mRNA vaccines. Once it enters your body, the mRNA vaccine instructs your cells  to create a spike protein. This simulates part of the SARS-CoV-2 viral structure  and tricks your body  into believing that it's been infected. The spike proteins will then head to the surface of your cell. Your immune cells will detect these proteins that don't belong  and begin making antibodies. If you happen to catch the virus  in the future, these antibodies will attach  to the spike proteins on both  your infected cells and the coronavirus. This will mark them  for immediate termination by your immune cells. To be clear,  the mRNA does not change your DNA  in any way.  Hear what I say? Once the spike proteins are made,  your body destroys the mRNA.  Five minutes after your vaccine shot,  you'll feel some soreness in your arm. To be safe, the Centers for Disease Control recommends you stay at the vaccination site  for at least 15 minutes in case of a severe reaction. While it's rare, you could have anaphylaxis, which is an immediate allergic response. It causes a series of symptoms such as hives or swelling. Thankfully,  trained healthcare personnel will be available at every vaccination site to treat you immediately with epinephrine. And according to the CDC, you have a greater chance of being struck by lighting, around one in 500,000, than having an allergic reaction. Four hours after your vaccine, you could feel nothing at all. Lucky you. But you could also get a slight headache or a low-grade fever and feel tired. This is perfectly normal and is a sign that your immune system has kicked into action. At this point, you may experience mild symptoms as your body acclimatizes to the vaccine. You might feel tired and feverish. Be sure to get some rest and take the day off work if you need to. After about 48 hours, you should start to feel normal again. So let’s keep going. Okay, if you got the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, you’d need to get your second booster shot three to four weeks after the first dose. Your immune system would be stronger than the first time.  But let’s see how it goes next.  After your second dose, you might feel crummy again.  You could feel tired feverish and you might get the chills.   These reactions are more common after the second dose of the vaccine.  But they’re mainly mild to moderate and usually go away in a day or two. And two weeks after your second shot, you’d be fully vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus. So far, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 illness.  In either case, the vaccine can prevent hospitalization and death in people who have gotten sick. So getting a vaccine is your safest path to protect yourself, your family  and your community against this virus.  It could also help reach herd immunity by having vaccinated people act as a barrier between non-vaccinated people and those who have been infected.

93,I3kd5SyYHEE,Myocarditis and coronavirus vaccines: Explaining the rare side effect,"Myocarditis can be a side effect of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines, but studies show that rare heart complications are more likely to occur as a result of coronavirus infections than as a vaccine side effect. In fact, coronavirus patients have 16 times the risk for developing myocarditis, compared to people who are uninfected, according to CDC data released in September.

The Food and Drug Administration authorized booster shots of Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccines for 16- and 17-year-olds on Dec. 9, after analyzing data that shows a link between myocarditis and the mRNA vaccines for male adolescents and young men.

Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at the Yale School of Medicine, said that in addition to the vaccines being highly effective at preventing coronavirus infections, they also provide protection from illnesses linked to the virus, including myocarditis.

“These are highly effective vaccines in preventing covid itself, and that provides a lot of offsetting benefits,” Krumholz said. Read more: https://wapo.st/3GIH4P2. Subscribe to The Washington Post on YouTube: https://wapo.st/2QOdcqK

Kassidi Kurill, a 39-year-old Single Mom. Her family describes her as healthy, happy, and ""having more energy"" than most. She had no known health problems. Unless you count Trigeminal Neuralgia. She took Botox for that. She also took Birth Control. She worked as a surgical tech for local plastic surgeons. She gets the Moderna Covid vaccine. Her first covid shot goes without incident. Other than a sore arm. Second dose of covid vaccine Moderna - not so much. She gets her 2nd Covid shot on Feb. 1 Monday. Later that evening, she had a sore arm, nausea, and fever. That's not unheard of after someone gets the covid vaccine. Some people get a sore arm, fatigue, body aches, slight fever, and chills. Especially after the second covid shot. Especially for younger people. When this happens, people can take Tylenol or ibuprofen.

No big deal, right? Unless they take too much.  
She did take Tylenol, aka Acetaminophen, but we don't know how much. She felt a little better the next day. By Wednesday, she could not pee despite drinking lots of fluids. She says it's the worst she ever felt. Thursday, 6 am, she tells her parents she needs to go to the hospital. In the ER, she immediately starts throwing up. Doctors say, ""she was very, very sick, and her liver was not functioning."" Blood tests show that her liver is not working. The doctors give her IV fluids. They also give her a drug to counteract the effects of Tylenol on the liver. It's called NAC, or n-acetylcysteine. But the damage was already done. Around this time, she becomes incoherent. Acute liver failure causes the brain to swell, called cerebral edema. If severe enough, it can result in a coma. At this point, her only chance of survival is with a liver transplant.

So she was flown to a transplant hospital. But when the liver completely fails, it causes other organs to follow suit. Especially the kidneys and brain, and soon after heart and lungs. She's put on full life support, including a breathing tube. Even if there was a match for a new liver, she is too unstable to undergo that operation. She dies. About 30 hours after she first arrived at the ER. She leaves behind a young daughter who wants people to hear her story. 

A lot of people will conclude that the covid vaccine caused her death. 
But timing by itself does not prove causation. 
And many people want to know, did the covid vaccine cause her death? 
And if not, then what? 
A Utah medical examiner completed a full autopsy...but the results remain private. The Medical Examiner said the autopsy did not show a link between the covid vaccine and death. 

Which is hardly surprising. If a covid vaccine caused someone to die shortly after receiving it, how would it do so? The only medical explanation would be an immunological reaction. Meaning an allergic reaction. So far in the US, there have been over 200 million covid vaccine doses given. No one has died from a severe allergic reaction as a result of the COVID vaccine. 

And in her case, it's obvious that she did not have an allergic reaction. For example, there was no swelling in the face or tongue or tightening of the throat. Deaths after COVID vaccinations are reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.

Between Dec. 14 and mid-March, over 109 million covid vaccine doses in the US. 
Of those, there have been less than 2,000 reports of death on the VAERS system, which is 0.0018%. A reported death in the VAERS system doesn't mean the covid vaccine caused it.

So the big question in Kassidi Kurill's case is…what caused her acute liver failure?
In the US, Acetaminophen accounts for 40% of cases. 
In 18% of cases, there is no identifiable cause. However, 13% are due to idiosyncratic drug reactions. 
The general recommended dose for Acetaminophen in healthy people is no more than 4 grams per day. However, sometimes people end up taking more than they should. This accounts for almost half of the cases of acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure.

sooner it's given the better the outcome if   it's given within 10 hours of ingestion there's a 
95% chance of survival acetaminophen levels can be   checked in the blood work increased levels help 
make the diagnosis but even if they're normal   it doesn't rule out the possibility of toxicity 
why because it's possible that the liver already   metabolized the acetaminophen in fact it's not 
the actual acetaminophen that destroys the liver   instead it's one of its breakdown products it's a 
metabolite called napqi which turns the liver into   mush here's a picture of what i'm talking about 
this is liver necrosis and this is what a healthy   liver looks like when you look at it underneath 
the microscope this is what you get napqi it also   damages the kidney and when the kidneys aren't 
working people stop peeing this is why it's so   important that people make sure they're not taking 
too much acetaminophen this drug is often combined   with other drugs and toxic levels can sneak up 
on people for example over-the-counter cough   medications percocet vicodin they all have 
acetaminophen in them medicine is complex it   always comes down to risk versus benefit whether 
that be tylenol or other medications the risks   of the virus versus the vaccine that's why it's 
important to stay in the know thanks for watching you"

#COVID19 #Deltavariant #Coronavirus",2021-09-17,1313542,16239,887,UCG-iSMVtWbbwDDXgXXypARQ," [Kyle]: Welcome to this deep dive discussion 
about COVID-19 vaccines. I'm Kyle Allred,   and I'm excited to be here with Dr. Rhonda 
Patrick, who has a PhD in Biomedical Science, is   published in a variety of reputable journals, and 
is the founder of the popular website and YouTube   channel, FoundMyFitness. And Dr. Roger Seheult, 
who is a quadruple board certified physician, has   teaching appointments at University of California, 
Riverside and Loma Linda University School of   Medicine, and is the co-founder of MedCram. And on 
both our channels, we've been gathering the most   popular questions and beliefs about COVID-19 
vaccines, safety questions, efficacy questions,   potential risk versus benefit questions. And I'm 
really looking forward to both of your responses   because, since the beginning of the pandemic, 
you've been outstanding communicators about the   science and the data as it becomes available. 
You critically read COVID studies, you confer   with expert colleagues, and then you help break 
down what do people really need to know. And   you've also really focused on ways that people can 
optimize their own health and immunity throughout   your discussions. I think this is going to be a 
lengthy discussion and geared towards people that   want to better understand the data and some of 
the important nuances related to these questions.   So thank you both for being here today. Dr. 
Seheult, I'm going to send the first question   your way. I've heard some people say that COVID 
vaccines aren't necessary for relatively young   people who are in good shape and don't have 
medical problems. What are your thoughts on this? [Dr. Seheult]: Well, Kyle, as you may know, 
I'm a critical care intensivist, and I take   care of patients in the hospital. I work in a 
one ICU hospital in a one hospital town. So,   anything bad that happens, it comes to me in 
the intensive care unit. I'm the one that is   there when they put the endotracheal tube in. I 
put the chest tubes in, the central lines, and   holding the patient's hands. And so for me, in 
the last couple of weeks, this has become really   personal for me because what I've seen in the last 
couple of weeks in our hospital is like nothing   else that I've seen even with the prior wave 
going back to February and January of this year.   So, what is it that I'm seeing? 
I'm seeing patients in their 30s,   patients even in their 20s coming in with very few 
comorbidities, maybe just a little bit overweight,   and they are ending up on the ventilator. I've 
seen fathers in their 60s coming in crying,   asking me to do everything that we can 
for their sons who are in their 30s,   newly married with small children. We didn't 
see that back in February. And so, to get to the   root of your question, is what do people who are 
younger have to be concerned about? I think it's   a very good question because all of the things 
that we have learned about COVID-19 in the past   is now being rewritten by the Delta variant. So, 
if you look at some of this data, this is data   from Virginia, and you can see here on the left 
hand side of the screen in January is a graph that   we're all very familiar with. This is basically 
the monthly hospitalization rate by age group.   And what you can see there is on the right side 
of that first graph is it's a very high number for   the elderly, and it goes down very precipitously 
for the young. And that's because the young were   not being hospitalized. But as we go across 
this screen, you can see here that when we end   up in August, a very ominous sign is occurring. 
What we're seeing is that the younger population   are being hospitalized at almost the same rate. 
Maybe, instead of, you know, a 20th or a 10th,   it's maybe half of the rate of the elderly. 
And so why is that happening? Well, we know   that there's a very high vaccination rate in the 
elderly and a relatively low vaccination rate in   the young. Even look at the...you can barely see 
it, but the yellow boxes are describing what's   happening to pediatric cases. Pediatric cases, 
of course, those less than 12 years of age who   can't get vaccinated are skyrocketing. 
And so this is the concern that I have. We look at some of these other issues. For 
instance, this idea of the 99% survival rate.   That's something that they say. Hey, 99% survival, 
and I really don't need to be concerned about it.   So if you look at this data, and we compare it 
to something that we know very well like the flu   virus, you'll see here that the hospitalization 
rate for the flu virus in young people is about   0.01%. If you look at the pre-Delta COVID-19 data, 
it's about 0.2%. It's almost 20-fold higher for   COVID-19 in the young than it is for the flu. Now, 
if you think about the 1% number, you'll start to   see very clearly that if you start to think about 
there's only the 1% that are going to be affected,   that won't affect me, what we are seeing right 
now in this country, especially in states like   Florida and Texas and specifically Idaho, is 
an overwhelming of the critical care hospital   health care delivery system. Think about this. 
The population of the United States is 331 million   people. If just 1% are going to die, that's 3.3 
million people, and that's just the people who are   dying. Let's talk about the people who are sick 
and need to be hospitalized because they can't   breathe because of oxygenation. We only have under 
a million acute care beds in the United States,   and so as a result of that, you are 
going to quickly overwhelm the healthcare   system if you have a problem with an overwhelming 
infection. Let's take the state of Idaho. It has a   39.7% fully vaccinated rate, and what we're seeing 
there, as of yesterday, the governor has declared   that hospitals now because they're overwhelmed are 
going to start to deliver basically rationed care.   You should not expect the same standards of care 
that you're used to expecting in the health care   delivery system because they're just not able to 
give it. Let me give you some specific examples.   Instead of having one intensive care nurse for 
two patients, it's now going to be one intensive   care nurse for six patients with some help from 
non-ICU nurses. Because they're overwhelmed,   you cannot transfer patients to higher level of 
care for things that they need to get done if   they have very advanced cancers, for instance, 
because those hospitals don't have room. If you   need elective surgery, their elective surgeries 
are being canceled. Traumas are still happening.   Babies are still being born. These are the 
problems that we're having in a situation where   you may think that because you're healthy and 
strong and young, you're not going to be affected.   But if you were to get into a car accident, or 
you wanted...know somebody that wants to deliver   a baby and has a complication, it's going to be 
difficult for those things to happen. And so this   is the thing that's occurring. And going back 
to my experience in the last couple of weeks,   every single one of those patients in the 
hospital that were there in their 30s,   their 40s were not vaccinated. And it's 
based on information that's coming out   that you're making decisions based on whether 
or not you should get the vaccine because   you hear about side effects, or you hear 
about things, for instance, about myocarditis.   Well, here's an article from the new England 
journal of medicine, peer reviewed published   September 16th, 2001 looking at the Israeli 
data with almost a million subjects in each arm.   So what we have here plotted in yellow is the 
risk difference per a hundred thousand persons   infected with SARS-CoV-2, and in blue is the 
risk difference per hundred thousand persons who   received the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. First, 
let's take a look at SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19.   We see big risks here for acute kidney injury, 
for arrhythmia, for deep venous thrombosis, for   pulmonary embolism, and for myocardial infarction. 
And again, notice that there is a small signal   here in terms of COVID-19 for myocarditis 
and pericarditis. Clearly, there is a small   signal there with post vaccination myocarditis, 
and pericarditis, but actually the data here   on these from Israel is showing that it's more 
likely to get myocarditis and pericarditis   post SARS-CoV-2 infection. But in terms of the 
relative risks for the vaccine, which is in blue,   notice that the biggest one here at 78 is 
lymphadenopathy, which is a normal response   to the vaccine. Now there's been a couple of 
papers that are in the peer review process,   but have been published to a medical archive 
server. And again, the peer review process is   where the paper is submitted to experts in the 
field that review it looking for possible bias   or things that were not taken into consideration. 
And this pre-print non-peer reviewed article using   electronic records in the United States, also 
agreed with the Israeli data that was published   in the new England journal of medicine and came to 
the conclusion that young males infected with the   virus are up to six times more likely to develop 
myocarditis as those who received the vaccine.   Another pre-print, which is still currently 
in the process of being peer reviewed, made   headlines in a number of papers in the UK and also 
in the United States. And it showed the opposite   that the incidents of post-vaccine myocarditis 
had a higher incidents than hospitalization in   pediatric patients from COVID-19. However, the 
article glean most of its data from the VAERS,   which as you know, is a reporting system and 
raw data based on reports that could be made by   anyone and often contain incomplete 
descriptions and chart notes that require   additional investigation, removal of confounding 
variables and comparison to background levels of   medical problems to become useful. Now, we'll talk 
about the VAERS here just a bit, but as you'll see   various data, doesn't allow you to really conclude 
anything. VAERS can use to generate hypotheses,   but not to test them directly. So in summary, 
I think it's good for researchers to generate   hypothesis from VAERS data, but it's a problem 
when newspapers turn hypotheses of observational   data that haven't been peer reviewed yet and 
turn them into headlines. So it'll be interesting   to see what issues the peer review process 
points out in these papers and if they go on   to be published. So to answer your question Kyle 
it's, it's, there's a lot of information there.   Um, but for a young person now, today facing 
the Delta variant and maybe future variants,   it's not the same type of virus that we were 
dealing with back earlier in 2021. Yes. Now they   are more susceptible to getting the infection and 
now the risk of them being hospitalized is higher. [Kyle]: Dr. Patrick, what are 
your thoughts on this question? [Dr. Patrick]: Well, I think in addition to 
hospitalization, there's also the risk of people   who have mild symptoms who don't have to go to the 
hospital, they stay at home during the duration of   their illness, are coming down with post-acute 
COVID syndrome, which is popularly known as   the long-haul COVID. The symptoms range 
from brain fog to racing heart problems   to lethargy. And there's been a variety of 
studies that have come out that have looked at   what long-haul COVID is and what population 
it seems to be affecting. And interestingly,   you'd think, well, people having these long-term 
effects would be the ones that were, you know,   on the ventilator. Well, of course, people on 
ventilators do have long-term effects. But you'd   think people that are hospitalized would be the 
ones mostly having these long-haul COVID effects,   and it turns out younger people, people under 
the age of 50, teenagers even, people in their   20s are the ones that are really, you know, 
coming down with this long-haul COVID syndrome. There's a pre-print that has not been 
peer-reviewed yet, and it's a big study that   was done out of the U.K. It's part of this ongoing 
study called the Biobank Study. They get large   population sample sizes. In this case, it was 
close to 800 people. It was 780 or something like   that people before the pandemic came in and had 
MRI brain scans. Researchers have all this data   on individuals', you know, brain structure 
and volume. And so once the pandemic hit,   many people came down with COVID-19, some mild 
cases, some more severe, some were hospitalized.   And a few months, you know, into the pandemic, 
researchers doing this Biobank study thought,   ""Hey, we should bring these people back in and get 
a brain scan and see if there's any changes."" And   so that's what they did. Just, you know, months 
after their first scan, they brought them back   in for another scan. And what the preliminary 
findings, again, that are not peer-reviewed yet,   showed is that there are major differences in gray 
matter regions of the brain. Gray matter atrophy   is occurring in several different regions of the 
brain, very prominently in the olfactory region,   which makes sense because, you know, one of the 
telltale symptoms of COVID-19 at least pre-Delta   was loss of smell, loss of taste. And also 
there's atrophy in other brain regions   involved in memory and learning. People that had 
severe COVID do have worse atrophy compared to   the people that only had mild cases, did not 
need to be hospitalized, but they themselves   were also experiencing brain atrophy. These are 
people that did not have to go to the hospital.   And, of course, people were matched for the 
same age, the same gender, the same ethnicity,   and the same time in between scans, so 
trying to keep everything, you know,   as comparable as possible to compare apples to 
apples. To me, that was quite frightening because   it really suggests that there are 
complications, and there are, you know,   long-term effects of this virus that we don't 
quite understand and that are affecting,   you know, hundreds of thousands of 
people. I personally know quite a few. [Kyle]: Dr. Seheult, anything 
to add on the long COVID   front because I know...that's a concern that 
I have. At my age, if I got COVID-19, would I   have lingering symptoms? What are you seeing 
on your end clinically with regards to that? [Dr. Seheult]: Oh, yeah. So, in addition to me 
working in the intensive care unit, I also have   an outpatient pulmonary clinic. I've diagnosed at 
least three or four, just off the top of my head,   blood clots in patients who went 
to the hospital, had COVID-19,   survived, got better, so they weren't part of 
the 1%, but then they had persistent shortness   of breath, leg swelling. We immediately made the 
diagnosis and put them on blood thinners. And so   that's just a small slice of what we're seeing   in terms of comorbidity. So the 1% is death, but 
there's a lot worse that can happen up to that   point than death. There's a lot of bad things 
that can occur. So, totally agree. Absolutely. [Dr. Patrick]: To add on to the blood clots and 
strokes, there was this study...multiple studies,   one out of Israel, and a couple out of the United 
States, showing that people under the age of 50   were coming in to the emergency room for strokes. 
And one of the studies out of Israel found,   because they test everyone for COVID-19, 
a high percentage of the people that were   coming in for these strokes, these young 
people under 50, had COVID-19 and didn't   even know they had had it. So, I mean, we're 
talking obviously mild, mild cases, potentially,   even asymptomatic if they didn't even know they 
had COVID-19 and they're coming in with strokes. [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah, absolutely. And so this is 
the thing is that COVID-19 has many different ways   of affecting the body. The one that we 
all know about is the lungs, of course,   because it can cause inflammation in the lungs. 
But as Dr. Patrick points out, there are blood   clot issues. So blood clots to the lungs can 
also occur, but also blood clots to the brain,   which manifest the strokes. [Kyle]: Dr. Seheult, could you also speak 
to this question that some people have,   or really the interpretation of 
something that's on the CDC website   about death certificates and how only...at one 
point, only 5% of death certificates had only   COVID-19 on the certificate. I know you fill 
out quite a few death certificates in the ICU.   What are your thoughts on this idea? 
What can we really interpret from that? [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. So it really boils down to 
how the death certificate is filled out. Generally   speaking, the way the death certificate should be 
filled out when somebody dies is you have the most   proximal thing occur at the top line, and that 
would be...let's say there was a car accident.   Okay. You were in a motor vehicle accident, and as 
a result of the motor vehicle accident, there was   a rupture of one of the internal blood vessels, 
and then you bled out. So, you wouldn't just put   at the top of that death certificate motor vehicle 
accident. That's not what the bureau of statistics   of your state wants to see. They want to see 
ruptured, you know, pulmonary artery, and then   under that, they want to have the reason for the 
ruptured pulmonary artery. That would be motor   vehicle accident. So, when you are describing 
someone with COVID-19, COVID-19...you don't   die from COVID-19, right? COVID-19 is not 
a final cause of death. It may be the thing   that set things in motion, and so you would have 
COVID-19 caused pneumonia, and then that caused   something like adult respiratory distress 
syndrome or acute respiratory distress syndrome,   and that was the cause of death. Because, as we've 
just mentioned, COVID-19 can cause death in many   different ways. COVID-19 could cause you to die 
by a pulmonary embolism or a stroke in the brain.   Unfortunately, some physicians are 
just putting COVID-19 at the top. So I think, Kyle, what you're referring to is this 
statement that we see here on the CDC website,   and they say here that ""The number 
of deaths that mention one or more   of the conditions indicated is shown for all 
deaths involving COVID-19 and by age groups.""   ""For over 5% of these deaths, COVID-19 was the 
only cause mentioned on the death certificate.""   So people have taken that to mean that really 
COVID-19 only caused 5% of the 600,000-plus   people that have died in this country, and all 
the other things were just comorbidities. But if   you actually look at the CDC's website, you'll 
see what some of these ""comorbidities"" are,   and as we've just discussed the actual way 
that COVID-19 kills people. So, for instance,   the number one comorbidity was pneumonia. 
Influenza and pneumonia are grouped together.   Well, the pneumonia was caused by COVID-19. 
It wasn't a comorbidity. Another one that's   very common is respiratory failure. Yeah, it's not 
like people are coming with respiratory failure,   and they also happen to have COVID-19. No, 
COVID-19 causes respiratory failure. And another   one of these ones that was on there was adult 
respiratory distress syndrome. That's actually   what they mean to say there's acute respiratory 
distress syndrome. Again, another thing that's   caused by COVID-19. And so what's happening here 
is that, you know, these physicians are very busy.   They're being handed death certificates. They 
need to fill these things out. They think, ""Oh,   yeah, that guy, he died of COVID-19. That's 
right."" And they just write COVID-19 at the   top. That's the incorrect way of filling those 
out, and that's the reason why, fortunately,   only 5% of those death certificates are being 
incorrectly filled out with just COVID-19. [Kyle]: Just to clarify, using 
that data to make a case that   really COVID-19 is only killing people with 
multiple comorbidities is not accurate. [Dr. Seheult]: Not at all. [Kyle]: Okay. Well, Dr. Patrick, this next 
question's for you, and it's about spike   protein. We know that the spike protein can be 
dangerous and cause a significant immune response,   and there's this idea floating around that because 
spike protein is dangerous from the SARS-CoV-2   virus, therefore, the COVID-19 vaccines must be as 
dangerous as well. What are your thoughts on that? [Dr. Patrick]: Well, I have a lot of thoughts on 
that, Kyle. I've thought long and hard about it.   But sort of before I get into some of the details, 
I think, the spike protein has really become a   common household name. At this point, most 
people around the world know what the spike   protein is mostly because it's the entry point 
for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to get into our cells.   There are about 26 different spike proteins. 
I shouldn't say different. There are about 26   spike proteins that line the surface 
of a SARS-CoV-2 viral particle,   and these spike proteins will bind to a receptor 
on many different cell types we have in our body   that have a receptor called ACE2. And when the 
spike protein then binds to the ACE2 receptor,   it undergoes a conformational change that 
essentially refers to the structure of it changes.   So it binds on to this receptor, and it then 
elongates, and sort of twists and turns around,   and then it fuses with the cell membrane and 
is, you know, engulfed inside of the cell.   Another way it happens is through 
endocytosis. But essentially,   the point I want to make here is that 
conformational change happens because   when the spike protein initially binds to the 
ACE2 receptor, it's in a conformation called   the pre-fusion conformation. You can think of 
it more like a closed type of conformation.   Once it binds, this triggers a conformational 
change for it to, again, like I said, elongate   and sort of twist around. When it does that, that 
is referred to as the post-fusion conformation.   And the reason that's really important is 
because all of the vaccines that are available   in the United States under either emergency 
use authorization or under FDA authorization   or up and coming vaccines, so that includes the 
Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines,   the Johnson & Johnson adenoviral vaccine, as 
well as the Novavax vaccine, they all contain an   insertion of two proline amino acids into the 
spike protein to lock it into the pre-fusion   conformation. And this was brilliant work done 
by the structural biologist, Dr. Jason McLellan.   He's at the University of Texas in Austin. And he 
thankfully had figured out this way to lock viral   proteins into the pre-fusion conformation. First 
it was with the respiratory syncytial virus, RSV,   and then later, he had figured out for the 
other beta coronavirus, the MERS coronavirus.   And so he really had a running start there. 
And the reason that is so important is because,   when you're comparing the spike protein 
from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as I mentioned,   there's 26 of them on every viral particle, 
to the spike protein that is in the vaccines,   including the mRNA vaccines and the vaccines in 
the United States, it's a different spike protein.   It's a spike protein that cannot undergo 
that structural change. It does not elongate   and, you know, dig into the cell membrane and fuse 
with it. It's a different spike protein because of   those two proline amino acids that were inserted 
to lock it into the pre-fusion conformation. And one of the first things you learn as a 
scientist, as a budding young scientist is that   you can't compare apples to oranges. You can't 
compare two different things. You have to compare   apples to apples or oranges to oranges. And 
so when you're talking about a different spike   protein, structurally, it's different, right? You 
can't take a study that's looking at the spike   protein that is from the surface of SARS-CoV-2 
and say everything that that spike protein is   doing applies to the spike protein in the vaccines 
that are available in the United States because   it's different. And so, I think, that's a really, 
really upfront important thing to understand. And   the burden of proof is on, you know, people making 
the claim that the spike protein from the mRNA   vaccines is dangerous because some studies have 
shown that the spike protein from the SARS-CoV-2   by itself can be dangerous. You have to show that, 
and it has not been shown. So, what these studies   that have shown that the spike protein from 
SARS-CoV-2 virus, how it can be dangerous, there's   been some in vitro studies, which means cells in 
culture in a dish. When you dump spike protein   on them, it can cause the activation of cell 
signaling pathways that could lead to cell death.   This is often referred to as cytotoxicity. There's 
also been some animal studies shown where either   recombinant protein, which is just basically 
made in a lab, so they make the spike protein,   or what's called pseudovirus expressing the spike 
protein, so this is not the SARS-CoV-2 virus,   but it sort of acts like a virus 
to allow it to get into cells,   if you directly inject the pseudovirus with 
a spike protein into the trachea of hamsters,   it causes severe lung damage and also 
gets into the circulation and causes   circulatory damage and vascular 
damage to the vascular system. And so these studies, and there's been, you know, 
a few of those, have really spurred this idea   that the spike protein from the vaccines must 
be dangerous because these studies showing the   spike protein that's found on the surface of 
SARS-CoV-2 is. And again, you can't compare.   You can't make that comparison, and that's 
really just one aspect of, you know, this story.   The other aspect has to do with where the spike 
protein goes in the body. And, you know, I think,   first and foremost, anyone that's concerned about 
these studies showing that the spike protein   by itself is dangerous should be terrified 
about getting SARS-CoV-2 because, for one,   you're getting, as I mentioned, 26 of those spike 
proteins on one viral particle. How many viral   particles are replicating inside of your cells 
at any given moment? You know, thousands of them.   And on top of that, there have been studies that 
have shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus is detected in   multiple organs. You know, this isn't just in the 
nose and in the trachea and in the lungs, which   in and of itself is bad. I mean, the damage 
to your lungs is, you know, one major concern.   But the SARS-CoV-2 virus, again, with spike 
protein has been detected in the heart   in humans. It's been detected in the brain. It's 
been detected in cerebrospinal fluid. It's been   detected in kidneys. It's been detected in the GI 
tract. It's been detected in the testes. It's in   many different tissues in humans. Oh, and it's 
been detected in plasma in the circulatory system.   So, again, you know, the concern should 
be amplified for actually contracting the   SARS-CoV-2 virus if you are concerned about 
the study showing spike protein itself is   dangerous. And that sort of leads me into 
the vaccines. And generally speaking,   I'm going to talk a little bit more about 
mRNA vaccines because there's been some more   concern about that, and there's 
been some more data on that. But people are concerned that these mRNA 
vaccines are getting into multiple organs,   and therefore the spike protein is getting into 
these other organs and causing damage, again,   different spike protein. So, that needs to be 
considered. But a lot of this data stems from...a   lot of this concern stems from some data that was 
generated by Pfizer and BioNTech when they were   doing a bunch of safety studies looking at, 
you know, what happens when you inject really   high concentrations of the mRNA vaccine 
by Pfizer into rodents. And so, I think,   the first thing to keep in mind...and I know 
that at MedCram, you guys have had people on   like Dr. Shane Crotty who's explained how the mRNA 
vaccines work, how you have, you know, the mRNA   inside of a lipid nanoparticle along with some 
other factors like polyethylene glycol, and that   is injected into the deltoid muscle tissue, and 
that basically, after that injection into the   tissue happens, you have the lipid nanoparticle 
with the mRNA vaccine now getting inside of muscle   cells using your own cell machinery, the ribosome, 
to actually make the spike protein, which itself   has been shown to peak after 24 hours, and then 
after 48 hours, the spike protein, half-life of   the protein that's made is degraded. It's not very 
long-lasting. The mRNA itself also has a half-life   somewhere between, you know, 48 to 72 hours, and 
the lipid nanoparticle has a very short...like   within hours. It really only lasts long enough to 
protect the mRNA from being degraded. But once you   actually do make the spike protein, the spike 
protein itself is...it is expressed on the cell   surface, what's called the plasma membrane of 
the cell. And the spike protein itself has a   region on it called a transmembrane domain that 
sticks it. It's like an anchored...anchors into   that plasma membrane, so it is not freely floating 
out into your circulation. It is stuck there.   And at that point, you have other immune cells 
that recognize this foreign protein and begin   the process of, you know, making antibodies, and 
you have that whole, you know, immunity effect. But the concern was from this Pfizer study where 
rats were given a dose that is 10 times the amount   of what humans are given. So humans are given 
30 micrograms of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine   for one dose. The rat was given 50 
micrograms of the Pfizer-BioNTech   vaccine. So, if you were to do the calculation 
for a rat equivalent dose, so if you want to   give the rat what humans actually get, an 
equivalent dose based on their body mass,   it would be more like 4.86 micrograms. So they got 
50. That's essentially 10 times. Okay. And this   was done for a reason of, ""Okay, what happens when 
we give them a huge amount of the vaccine?"" Well,   what was found...the lipid nanoparticle 
that contains the mRNA was radio-labeled.   It's like a tag that you can visualize things. 
And that radio-labeled tag was found in other   organs. It was, you know, found in a variety of 
organs. Again, it was to a very small degree,   but it was found in other organs. And so people 
got really concerned that these mRNA vaccines were   traveling to other organs and causing damage. And 
a few things to keep in mind there. One, the dose   was super high, and, in fact, within the same 
document, the same Pfizer study, they gave a   more equivalent dose to mice. In this case, they 
give mice 2 micrograms of the mRNA vaccine, and   that vaccine did not go to all these other organs. 
In fact, the only organ that was shown to have any   amount of this radio-labeled tag was the liver, 
and it was completely gone after 48 hours.   And so, I think, that's really good news 
because it suggests, yeah, when you give,   you know, a rat 10 times the amount of what the 
humans are getting, you might have some spillover.   But on top of that, again, the radio-labeled tag 
that we're looking at is the lipid nanoparticle,   and if there is some spillover, you know, in 
the muscle tissue, what surrounds the muscle   tissue is your lymphatic system, lymph, where 
all the immune cells are. So you essentially   have your immune cells like dendritic cells 
recognizing something foreign, in this case,   a radio-labeled lipid nanoparticle with some 
mRNA in it, and they basically chop it up, and,   you know, it undergoes phagocytosis and is taken 
to other tissues for recycling. And so, whatever   we're seeing in those other organs, we don't even 
actually know if that's, you know, the intact mRNA   vaccine lipid nanoparticles. It's probably just 
remnants of it because that's what your body does. So, I think, all of those factors in combination 
give some reassurance that people should not be   so concerned about the spike protein from mRNA 
vaccines or from the Johnson & Johnson vaccine   getting to other organs and causing...you 
know, wreaking havoc essentially. And I will just add one more thing to that, and 
that is another study, and this is something   that I've seen concern about on the internet. 
This study was done in humans. It was a very,   very small sample size. It was 13 people, and 
they were given the Moderna mRNA vaccine. What   was found in that study is that 11 out of 13 
people, the S1 subunit of the spike protein   was detected in their plasma. Three out of the 13 
had the entire spike protein detectable. However,   the assay that was used to detect this S1 subunit 
and the spike protein itself in these 13 people   has a false positivity rate of 25%. That's one 
in four people, showing they have spike protein.   This was another study done, 
they took samples pre-pandemic,   there should be no people with spike protein 
pre-pandemic, and they were showing that they   had spike protein. So with a sample size 
of 13 and a false positivity rate of 25%,   you can't make any conclusions from 
that small study showing, you know,   that 11 out of 13 people had, you know, S1 
subunit of spike protein showing up in the plasma.   It just doesn't make any sense to make any strong 
conclusions from that. So, I guess that, you know,   the bottom line is that, you know, as Roger 
mentioned, we've had over 177 million people   fully vaccinated in the United States. You know, 
if this thing was causing severe damage in people,   we would know about it. And, you know, we do know 
about the adverse effects that are occurring like   the myocarditis that is happening, you know, 
in some young people. It's still quite rare.   It does occur. And, again, as Roger mentioned, 
it's happening six-fold higher in younger healthy   individuals than it is in the same individuals 
that are being exposed to the COVID-19 vaccines. [Kyle]: Well, that is a perfect segue to a 
discussion about adverse events and deaths   reported from the COVID-19 
vaccine. And, Dr. Seheult,   could you explain what VAERS or the 
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System   that we use in the United States is and 
how that data should be interpreted? [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. Thanks, Kyle. So, 
to back up a little bit, let's talk about   a six-month period of time here. So, if 
we look at December, January, and February   of just a few months ago, that was a period 
of time at least where I'm working in Southern   California where there was a lot of COVID. 
In fact, we had to build an entire new ICU   with isolation precautions. We had to have 
nurses trained. We basically used a lot of   resources because surgeries weren't happening at 
the time. And compare that with the next three   months after that, which would be March, April, 
and May. So, the reason why those two groups of   three months are very different is the first 
group of three months had a lot of COVID-19   patients coming in. We were very full. And 
then after that wave went away, we basically   disbanded the second intensive care unit. We 
were able to contract back to what we were   doing before, and this despite the fact that in 
March, April, and May of 2021, we were vaccinating   millions of people a day. And so, again, I just 
want to underline what Dr. Patrick was saying   there. If the spike protein from the vaccine was 
so dangerous, how were we able to contract down   our hospital ICU intensive care services during 
that period of time? However, what did happen   during that time was that there was a huge spike 
of...so the argument may be made, for instance,   that maybe the spike protein is not causing 
disease or conditions that would get people into   the intensive care unit, but it might be causing 
more mild symptoms or more mild problems. And   that might show up in something called the 
VAERS systems. Let's talk about the VAERS. So, as you can see here on the screen, there's 
this chart that has made the rounds on the   internet, and what it does is it shows the 
total reported deaths post-vaccine. And you   can see obviously not post-COVID vaccine because 
the COVID vaccine didn't exist back during these   years. And we're going back way back into 
the early 2000s. And then all of a sudden,   there's this huge spike here in 2000, and these, 
again, are reported deaths. So this is evidence,   some say, that these patients that are receiving 
the COVID-19 vaccine are dying. So, again,   I don't know how they could be dying without 
going through the intensive care unit. I guess   it's possible they could be dying at home 
and never making it to the hospital. So let's   investigate exactly what it is that's going on 
here. The thing that you've got to understand   about this reporting system is that...first 
of all, a couple of things. Number one,   you have to understand that because the vaccines 
that were given emergency use authorization   in the late 2020, because of this, they 
expanded the reporting requirements   for the VAERS. In other words, before a physician 
would make a report to the VAERS if he suspected   that a vaccination led to a death, and they were 
under suspicion that something was connected.   Now that was completely eliminated. Now, no 
matter what happens, if a patient gets a vaccine,   and anything happens, hospitalization, death, 
anything, it should be reported under law. So, I wanted to take a look at this a little 
bit more, and what I did was I looked at this   paper that was published back in 2016, 
so pretty early. And it was looking at   the flu vaccine because a lot of people 
say that this has never happened before.   This huge increase in reporting 
from the vaccine has never happened.   But yet there is a situation that occurred, and 
it was published here in December of 2016 titled,   ""Surveillance of Adverse Events After Seasonal 
Influenza Vaccination in Pregnant Women   and Their Infants in the Vaccine Adverse Event 
Reporting system, July 2010 to May 2016."" So,   as you may recall, in 2009, we had a flu epidemic 
called the swine flu epidemic, and in that year,   there was a huge amount of H1N1 influenza. And you 
can see that here on the screen with that red bar.   So you can see the blue is sort of the endemic 
influenza, and then in 2009, this massive   increase in H1N1 reports. And so what you also 
see here is that purple line is the amount of   vaccinations that happened. So because there 
was a lot of influenza that was going around,   a lot of people were being vaccinated. So what 
you're actually seeing here, these bar graphs,   is the number of reports of adverse events. 
Okay. So that's key to understand that. Even   though the vaccine had not changed, the makeup 
of the vaccine had not changed, what we saw was   because there was more vaccinations being 
given, there were more reports being given.   But there's something actually more to it than 
that even still, and that is that there was more   understanding and more awareness of influenza. 
So what I've done here is I've superimposed   Google trends. So how often somebody would 
get on the internet and search for influenza,   you can see clearly there at the same point in 
time that we're seeing increased reported spikes,   we're seeing an increased interest in influenza in 
general. In fact, the highest that there ever was   during that time because it was a very 
important news item at that time. Now,   again, this was under strict reporting system. 
So, they only could report whether they felt   that there was a connection. But even that after 
they looked at it, and published this paper, this   is the conclusion that they came to. Despite the 
increase in reporting events, they said that the   peak in the number of pregnancy reports observed 
during 2009 to 2010 followed by a decrease in   reporting suggest that the 2009 spike in pregnancy 
reports after 2009 H1N1 inactivated vaccines   may have been due to stimulated reporting. 
In other words, the vaccine hadn't changed,   the side effects hadn't changed, and so their 
conclusion was is that as in 2000 and 2009-2010,   no new or unexpected patterns in maternal or 
fetal outcomes were observed during 2010 and 2016. So, if we take the same kind of methodology that 
we've done, we've looked at this huge spike here   with COVID-19, and this is supposed to be evidence 
that people are dying from the COVID vaccine, we   see a very interesting pattern because, if we look 
at Google trends, and we type in COVID vaccine,   obviously, there's a massive spike at the same 
time, the same kind of recipe that we would see   with the influenza. And then also, again, just 
to make sure that we understand here, this is the   deputy director for the Centers for Disease 
Control, and this is what he says. He says,   ""Health care providers' reporting requirements 
are much broader than for other vaccines.   After someone receives the COVID-19 vaccine, their 
health care provider is required by law to report   all serious adverse health events, that would 
include death, even if the provider does not   think the vaccine caused that event. These events 
can include death, inpatient hospitalization,   or a serious case of COVID-19. That 
reporting protocol is due to the fact   that the FDA authorized the COVID-19 vaccines 
for emergency use."" So you can see that the   rules have changed in the middle of the game, 
and so we have to look at that. If we were to   give a placebo injection, the question is 
is we would still see deaths associated with   the vaccine. Why? Because we're vaccinating 
so many people and because of just chance. I did a little bit of an epidemiological exercise. 
So bear with me. If you look at the U.S. death   rate per 100,000 population per year, it's around 
870 deaths. So, in other words, if you were to   take at random 100,000 people in the United States 
and follow them for a year, you would find at the   end of that year that about 870 people would 
have died. Obviously, as the age goes up, that   can go up to as high as 4,000. Here in the 75 to 
84-year-old age group that's much higher. So let's   just take the average. We'll be conservative. And 
also if you were to look over the period of the   last seven months, going from January this year 
to August, seven or eight months, you'll see that   there's a fairly linear...if you want to take that 
approach, fairly linear increase in the amount of   vaccinations over that seven month period of time. 
And in fact, over that 7 month period of time,   there's been about 166 million people that 
have been vaccinated. So, if that's over a   seven month period of time, the average period of 
time that someone's been vaccinated is about three   and a half months. And over that period of time, 
which started in January, that's when we have the   highest death rates, but then as we go through 
the year, it comes down to the lowest death   rate. So that's over that period of time, there's 
about an average death rate in the United States. So let's do a little bit of calculating. If there 
is 870 dead people per 100,000 people per year,   and we adjust that for the 166 million people 
that we've vaccinated in 1 campaign, and then   we adjust that for instead of 12 months just 3 and 
a half months, which is the average period of time   that people have been on average vaccinated, 
we come to this number of about 421,000   people that should be dead just by chance 
from getting the vaccine. And clearly,   that's not the number of people that we're 
seeing. The reports show maybe 10,000 or   15,000. So, clearly, there is a huge amount of 
underreporting occurring. Now, realize that,   again, most of the people who are being vaccinated 
at least in the country are actually much older.   So this number should actually be higher. And 
number two, that most of the people that were   vaccinated very early on and therefore have a 
longer range of vaccination were the older group   as well. And so when you look at that, you can 
see here that the reported deaths totaling about   5,000 or 6,000 is a huge underreporting of the 
number of deaths that we should have if we just   put a little red dot on their shoulder or gave 
them a placebo injection. That's very important   to understand because some people...some 
disingenuous people will show this and say,   ""Look, the vaccine is causing these deaths,"" and 
that cannot be gotten from that type of data. The other graph that you might see is this graph, 
which shows the number of days after vaccination   that deaths are reported. So, based on our 400,000 
number that we've come up with, if we were to   prorate that on a daily basis, we would come up 
with about 4,000 people dying on a daily basis   on average. Obviously, that gets bigger as more 
and more people get vaccinated. But what we're   seeing here after a vaccination is only 600 to 700 
deaths per day. Again, huge underreporting here at   this point. And again, so because there's huge 
underreporting occurring, one might think that   what would be the most likely reporting situation, 
someone who got a vaccine and died the next day,   or someone who died maybe a month later? 
Obviously, when you have a death occurring close   to an event that has to be reported, the reporting 
is going to happen more likely in that situation,   and you're going to have underreporting occurring 
much more likely a month later. And that's exactly   what is demonstrated here with this graph. We see 
that the most reporting occurs within one or two   days, and then it goes down precipitously 
consistent with that type of pattern. The other last thing I'll leave you with here as 
well is that with the mRNA vaccines, with Moderna,   for instance, it's a four-week interval between 
shots, and for Pfizer, it's a three-week interval.   If, in fact, that second shot is causing 
the problems that we see with myocarditis,   myocardial infarction that's been proposed or been 
suggested, I would expect to see another peak here   about three to four weeks out, but, 
in fact, we don't see any such peak.   And so that, again, lends me to believe that 
this graph is the result of reporting events   and human psychology rather than an actual spike 
protein that's causing deaths in these patients.   I agree that we should look for this stuff. 
This stuff needs to be taken seriously,   and that is exactly the purpose of the 
VAERS system is to look to see if there   are patterns. But to go out and say that simply 
because there are deaths, that that must mean   that the vaccine is causing deaths. I think that 
is disingenuous and not supported by the data. [Kyle]: Dr. Patrick, anything to add to that? [Dr. Patrick]: Yes. I do agree 100% with that 
last statement that Dr. Seheult just said because   people are taking this data that is, 
you know, accessible to the public   from the VAERS system, and they're 
trying to make sense of that data. But   scientists from the CDC and from the FDA analyze 
that data. They have to, you know, stratify it   by age, by gender, by ethnicity, and see how many 
people die of X, Y, or Z in that age range of that   gender, of that ethnic group without a vaccine, 
just what's the normal background death rate. You   need to do that comparison. Otherwise, this is 
like the worst epidemiology data you could ever   imagine without any correction for confounding 
factors. You know, it would be like one year,   you know, there was 200,000 births in the city 
of San Bernardino, and at the same time, we had,   you know, 10,000 storks that flew by, therefore, 
storks have to be causing...delivering   the babies, I mean, you know...or 
causing the births basically. So,   you know, epidemiology is a big mess, and so 
you can't just take that data and make these   correlations. And I think to sort of add 
to what Dr. Seheult's kind of brilliant   epidemiology experiment that he just explained, 
to add to that, in the United States alone,   every 30 seconds, someone dies of cardiovascular 
disease, every 30 seconds. Now, generally   speaking, most of those people are going to be 50 
or older because cardiovascular disease doesn't   usually, you know, affect people in their 20s 
or 30s. It can, but generally speaking, it's   an age-related disease more or less. And so, you 
know, if you look at the reported VAERS deaths,   more than half of them are in a population of 
people that are 50 and older. So, it's like,   what are the chances that some of those people are 
probably just dying from a heart attack or from   cardiovascular disease? Stroke, every 40 seconds, 
someone has a stroke in the United States. They   die from it every about four minutes or so. Like 
Dr. Seheult said, there are a lot of people dying   every day in the United States 
completely independent of COVID-19,   completely independent of vaccines. It's not 
accurate to try to interpret the VAERS data   yourself without stratifying it and looking at 
all the other factors that I just mentioned. But even on top of that, last time I did a VAERS 
report actually was probably close to a month ago,   maybe three weeks ago, and at that time, I was 
stratifying the data by age and looking at the   reported deaths. Over 584,000 people of the age 
of 50 and over have died from COVID-19. And last   time I looked at the VAERS, which is about a month 
ago or so, about 5,000 people over the age of 50   had reported, you know, VAERS deaths. And so even 
if you were to take that 5,000 and triple it,   you're still 40 times more likely to die from 
COVID-19 than you are from a vaccine if you're   over the age of 50. People aged 40 to 49, about 
20,000 people have died from COVID-19, according   to the CDC website. If you look at the VAERS, it's 
much lower than that, about 200 people. And if   again triple that number, even after tripling 
it, you're 33 times more likely to die from   COVID-19 than from a vaccine if you are age 40 to 
49. Bring that age group down even further, 18 to   39-year-olds, about 10,000 people have died from 
COVID-19 in that age range. And if you look at   the VAERS data, it's somewhere around 200, let's 
triple it 600 people, you're still 17 times more   likely to die from COVID-19 than from a COVID-19 
vaccine if you are in the age range of 18 to 39.   So, again, at every age group, you're much, 
much more likely to die from COVID-19 than   you are from a vaccine. We're just directly 
taking the VAERS reporting. And as I said,   you can't do that. We don't even know if 
those deaths are actually causally linked,   right? It's correlation. I think when you look 
at it like that, it makes a lot more sense that   everyone's going to be exposed to 
the SARS-CoV-2 virus at some point,   do you want to be vaccinated when 
you're exposed to it? I do personally. [Kyle]: Okay. Let me summarize my understanding of 
this, and correct me if any of this sounds wrong.   In our country of over 300 million people, there 
is a background number, an expected number of   deaths and other medical problems that are going 
to happen on a daily basis or an annual basis on   average. And then we have this reporting system, 
the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, where   medical professionals are not only encouraged, but 
they're actually required to report any medical   problem or death that happens after someone 
gets a COVID-19 vaccine, whether or not they   think the vaccine caused it or not. So it's 
an epidemiologist and other scientists' job to   look at the number of reports that come into the 
VAERS and compare that with the background numbers   for each age group and other demographics 
and assess, does the number of reports   actually rise above what we would expect for 
that age group and other demographics? And   listening to you, Dr. Seheult, it sounds like 
for deaths reported from the COVID-19 vaccine,   the number of deaths actually falls far below 
the background level that we would expect,   which suggests that there's underreporting. 
But it also suggests it's very unlikely that   a significant number of deaths are happening 
from the COVID-19 vaccine. Do I have that right? [Dr. Seheult]: Yep. [Dr. Patrick]: Absolutely. And I think 
just to kind of even add to that, you know,   the myocarditis link that we now know about 
linked to the mRNA vaccine specifically came   out of the VAERS data, and after the scientists, 
epidemiologists analyzed the data, they found   myocarditis was above that background noise. 
It was higher. So there was something there.   I've heard so many conspiracy theories that, 
you know, the government agencies don't want us   to know about it, don't want us to know about the 
adverse effects. Then I just don't understand why   we would know about myocarditis being linked to 
the mRNA vaccines, or why we would know about rare   blood clots in some cases with Johnson & Johnson, 
very, very rare. If there was some big conspiracy,   why would we know about some of the 
potential rare adverse events but not others? [Kyle]: It's always powerful when someone knows 
someone who got a COVID-19 vaccine and then had   a death afterwards, or, you know, some 
new onset of symptoms. So what would you   both say succinctly to someone who says, you 
know, ""My parent, or grandparent, or whoever,   got the COVID-19 vaccine, and then 3 weeks later, 
they died of a heart attack. I think that those   are links""? What would you say to that person? 
I'll start with you Dr. Seheult on this one. [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. I mean, this is really what 
makes us human beings. We have to put on our   scientific hats when we talk about numbers because 
we can't be attached to it, and on the other hand,   we're also human beings, and we live with it. So, 
it's hard to do that. I can tell you that when   I'm in the hospital, if I give a blood thinner to 
somebody because they have a condition, and they   bleed out and die, and the next person that comes 
in with that same condition, I'll have to tell you   as a human being, I'm a little bit less gung-ho 
about giving that person a blood thinner even   though it's indicated, and it's the right thing 
for that person. In other words, what happened   before doesn't necessarily tell me what's going to 
happen again. It's statistics that tells us that.   That's actually one of the fallacies of medicine. 
So, when you're making medical decisions,   there's always going to be risks. It's 
always going to happen. I can tell you that.   Don't let anybody tell you that we don't do harm 
in medicine. We try to do more benefit than harm.   We give aspirin to people who have heart 
attacks. We give blood thinners to people   with atrial fibrillation. Are you telling 
me that we've never had a situation where   someone has bled on a blood thinner, or someone 
has gotten an ulcer from aspirin? It happens,   but we have to look at the 
benefits versus the risks. So,   in that situation, I would tell them that, you 
know, it's possible that whatever they had could   be linked to the vaccine, that we have to look at 
epidemiological studies to see whether that's the   case. And I would understand if they were hesitant 
to get the vaccine in that situation. I would   completely understand as a human being because 
that's the same struggles that I have as well. But if we want to make policies going forward, 
we always have to realize that no matter how many   times you've rolled the dice, and it's come up six 
every time, that the next time you roll the dice,   there's still a one in six chance 
that it's going to be a six despite   the previous rolls. And unfortunately, that's what 
we have to deal with when we're looking at risk   to benefit ratio. Maybe one day in the future 
we'll be able to do a better job at predicting   who will benefit and who won't, but 
right now we do the best that we can. [Kyle]: Dr. Patrick? [Dr. Patrick]: I think just to add... Sorry. [Kyle]: Yeah. Go ahead. [Dr. Patrick]: Just to add to that, I think, you 
know, the fact of the matter is that in the United   States alone, over 177 million people are fully 
vaccinated, over a billion people worldwide. And,   you know, as Dr. Seheult point out, people 
respond to things differently, to drugs, to   different...the foods that we eat every day, you 
know, if we were to give peanuts to 177 million   people in the United States, a good size of people 
would have a pretty serious adverse reaction.   Same goes for shellfish. You know, it's a really 
big world out there, and there are individual   differences in the way we respond to foods, to 
medications, to vaccines but it does not mean...   So, you know, in other words, it's not 
a zero risk as Dr. Seheult was saying,   but 100% of the population is not 
responding that way. It's not because   there's something inherently... For the 
most part, you can have a medication that   is dangerous, but, you know, we would know 
that by now with 177 million people fully   vaccinated in the United States and over 
a billion people worldwide. We would know. [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. And, Kyle, this is all 
be...probably a good time to also say that,   you know, the purpose for Dr. Patrick and myself 
being on here is really to educate people on   what are the risks and the benefits and the 
relative risks so that they can make a decision.   And the reason why we want to arm them with that 
information is so that they can make a decision.   We're not for forcing people to get vaccines. 
We're not for the purpose of saying it's okay   to be forced to get these vaccines. We're not 
really for mandates. We're really here to educate.   And I think that's an important distinction, 
but Dr. Patrick can speak for herself. [Dr. Patrick]: Yeah. I 100% agree. I would never 
want to force anyone to do anything they're scared   of. I certainly wouldn't want to force a parent 
to do something to their child that they were   scared of. And I think that the purpose of this 
podcast and in general speaking about what the   data shows about vaccines and COVID-19 is 
to really help people that don't have the   capacity to interpret the scientific literature 
to help them have a more...a well-informed,   you know, basically background so that they 
can make a good decision on whether or not   they want to get or choose to get vaccinated. And 
I think that there are people out there that are   not giving good information for whatever 
reason. To be honest, there's a lot to gain from   making sensationalistic claims that something 
you think is good for you is actually not. So   we think vaccines are good for us, but they're 
not. And you can gain a large following,   and there can be a little bit of a 
perverse incentive in some instances   for people that are technically versed in the 
scientific literature that may have a degree,   higher education and yet are cherry-picking 
and misleading people. That does happen, and   in order to counter that, I think it's important 
to put an unbiased approach. Try to, you know,   interpret the data for what it is and 
also put that information out there. [Kyle]: Right. Dr. Patrick, this next question 
is for you. It's about antibody-dependent   enhancement. Can you explain what that is and if 
you think it's relevant or applies to COVID-19? [Dr. Patrick]: Sure. So, antibody-dependent 
enhancement refers to when your immune system   makes antibodies against a pathogen that is...it's 
non-functional. So the antibodies can bind to the   pathogen, for example, in our interest here, 
a virus. They can bind to it, but they don't   neutralize the virus. And, in fact, not only 
do they not neutralize it, they can activate   other immune cells to become more aggressive 
and cause more damage. So, in the end,   the immune system can end up being more 
damaging after being exposed to a virus   than if it hadn't previously had those antibodies. 
And so when I say previously had those antibodies,   most often I'm referring to vaccine-induced 
antibodies. I would say that in the United States,   we really became aware of this phenomenon back 
in the 1960s. So this was when the respiratory   syncytial virus vaccine...one of the vaccines 
was made, and it was being clinically tested   in infants and toddlers. Half of the infants 
and toddlers in the treatment group were given   the vaccine, and the other half were given the 
placebo. And then the infants were then, you know,   going to be exposed to the RSV virus, which as all 
of us parents know like every child gets, and it's   a respiratory virus. They end up having a cough 
that can oftentimes linger for quite a while. So, what was terribly tragic about this vaccine 
story is that the infants and toddlers that   had received the RSV vaccine, about 80% of them 
were hospitalized after being exposed to the RSV   virus naturally versus the infants and toddlers 
that had placebo, only 5% of those infants and   toddlers actually ended up in the hospital after 
being exposed to the RSV vaccine. So this was   terrifying, and, of course, the vaccine never 
made it past this original clinical trial. But,   you know, what was happening is antibody-dependent 
enhancement wasn't quite known at the time,   but you know, much research has...you know, 
decades of research since then have been done,   and it's now known that antibody-dependent 
enhancement occurred. So the antibodies that   were generated from the RSV vaccine were binding 
to the virus. They were not neutralizing it,   and, in fact, they were making the immune system 
worse. They're making the immune system act worse   in response to the virus and become more 
damaging. And so what was figured out by   many scientists, and including some of the work 
of Dr. Jason McLellan who I mentioned earlier,   is that the antibodies that are generated   that play a major role in antibody-dependent 
enhancement are called post-fusion antibodies.   And you probably can guess it. We talked about how 
viral proteins go from a...they make a structural   conformation change. They go from a pre-fusion 
conformation to a post-fusion conformation.   Well, guess what. Your immune system is making 
antibodies to both of those different types of   viral proteins. And so what the brilliant 
work of Jason McLellan showed is that   you could basically lock a viral protein into the 
pre-fusion complex, and when you then, you know,   use that pre-fusion viral protein in a vaccine, 
you don't make post-fusion antibodies because   you don't...your body isn't exposed to that 
structure of the viral protein. That's what we   have in all of our U.S. vaccines, the pre-fusion 
viral protein, the pre-fusion spike protein. We are not making post-fusion antibodies against 
the spike protein, which is so reassuring that   antibody-dependent enhancement is so...it's so 
unlikely to happen because we don't make those   antibodies. And, of course, on top of that, what 
we would see in the hospitals as I mentioned with   RSVs is that if you take an unvaccinated versus a 
vaccinated person and, you know, randomly choose   them at any point, then the vaccinated person 
would always have the most severe disease.   They would be the one that are most likely 
to be hospitalized compared to unvaccinated.   They would be the most likely to die. And I'm not 
talking about, you know, if you have all of your   population vaccinated. Well, of course, you're 
going to end up having some people in the   hospital that have been vaccinated. I'm talking 
about comparing the unvaccinated to vaccinated.   What you would see is that unvaccinated people 
would be less likely to have a severe disease, and   that is not what we've seen at any point during 
this pandemic at all. So, that's also reassuring. I think a lot of concern for antibody-dependent 
enhancement came out of both in vitro studies,   again, those are studies done in cultured 
cells in like a petri dish as well as in   vivo studies. These refer to animal studies, 
it can be, you know, a rodent or a hamster.   Pick your animal. These studies were done 
with the original SARS virus back in 2003   or 2002, what we now call 
SARS-CoV-1. When vaccines were made   for that virus and injected into some animals, 
they did cause antibody-dependent enhancement.   That was not the case with all studies and all 
vaccines for the SARS-CoV-1. So it was sort of an   inconsistent data. But that's really what 
started the initial concern. I myself was   concerned. I was reading this data, and I thought, 
""Oh, geez, well, that's scary."" So, at the time,   I didn't know anything about the post-fusion 
antibodies that were involved in that and how,   you know, Dr. Jason McLellan and his collaborators 
had figured out a way to bypass that,   to lock that viral protein in the pre-fusion 
complex so we don't make those antibodies.   So that is really...at the end of the day gives 
me a lot of peace of mind that antibody-dependent   enhancement is not likely to ever happen with 
our current vaccines in the United States. [Kyle]: Dr. Seheult, anything to add to that? [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. As Dr. Patrick was saying, if 
we look at Israel, which has been vaccinating with   the Pfizer vaccine the longest out of any of the 
countries on the planet, and we look here at the   Delta variant, which is what we're interested 
in, we really need to make sure that we're   concentrating on the Delta variant because that's 
the current variant here in the United States,   there was a study that was released. And 
you can see here on the graph we've got   red as those who are unvaccinated in Israel, 
and green, those who are fully vaccinated in   Israel. And you can see here that over the months 
of July and August, which were just pure Delta   at the time, clearly, you can see that 
it was the unvaccinated that were having   the most severe cases. And that would not be the 
case if we had antibody-dependent enhancement with   the Delta variant. That's clearly not the case. If 
you break it down in the next graph even by age,   you'll see that the same relationship occurs with 
age. But again, in each of these age categories,   if you age stratify them, you will see 
that is the unvaccinated in these that are   leading the severe cases. So this goes against the 
grain of what you may hear that Israel is telling   us that the Pfizer vaccine is just breaking 
down, it's useless, it's not working. That's   just totally not the case in terms of preventing 
severe cases, which is an important endpoint. [Kyle]: Dr. Seheult, this next question's 
for you, and it's about the vaccines and   human fertility. There's an idea that's been 
floating around that the COVID-19 vaccines   somehow impact human fertility. 
What are your thoughts on that? [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. So it's come from many 
places. One place in particular was this idea   that the antibodies made against the vaccine 
would crossreact with proteins in the placenta.   So, let's go back and look at some of the data 
to see if actually this is happening or not.   And you can see here I've got a table of the phase 
three trials in the four different major vaccines   that are available. We have Pfizer, 
Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Janssen,   which is the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. So, in the 
phase three trials, one of the specific exclusions   for entering into the trial was the fact that you 
might be pregnant. So those were excluded, but,   of course, you know, accidents happen. And so what 
we have here is a number of subjects in the phase   three trials that became pregnant after enrolling 
in the study. And so while these aren't huge   numbers, they just sort of give us a little bit 
of an insight. What you can see here is you've got   the control group on the left, the vaccinated 
group on the right, and in all of these cases,   the amount in the vaccinated group and the control 
group were the same. So if you look in the Pfizer   vaccine, we had 12 pregnancies that occurred in 
the control group, 11 in the vaccinated group.   We had seven pregnancies in the control group in 
Moderna and six. We had 9 in AstraZeneca and 12.   Four in the Johnson & Johnson, and four in the 
vaccinated group. So, in terms of miscarriages,   that was also looked at, and as you can see there, 
there was no statistical significant difference   between either pregnancies or miscarriages 
at least in the phase three trials. Well,   that's not where we have to leave 
it because we've looked at this now   after the marketing, of course, so post-marketing, 
and there was a very good trial data that was   published in the ""New England Journal of 
Medicine"" entitled ""Preliminary Findings of   Messenger RNA COVID-19 Vaccine Safety in Pregnant 
Persons."" And what they looked at was a number of   areas. They looked at pregnancy loss, spontaneous 
abortions, stillbirth, neonatal outcomes, preterm   births, small size for gestational age, congenital 
abnormalities, and even neonatal death. And they   compared the rates of people who have gotten the 
vaccine and were pregnant to the registry, so the   V-safe pregnancy registry data, to see...which 
is what they got the data from and compared it   to the published incidents of these occurrences. 
And what they found in every one of these cases   is that there was no statistical significant 
difference in terms of what they saw in   the pregnancy data versus what they 
should see in the regular population. Finally, what I would say from my aspect or 
from my standpoint is to direct you to Dr.   Viki Male who we've had here on MedCram and has a 
Twitter account who's actually updating this. She   is a reproductive immunologist that has found it 
her duty to always constantly being updated in   terms of data in terms of not just pregnancy, but 
also breastfeeding, in terms of getting pregnant,   in terms of all of those risk factors. And I 
would highly recommend that you check her out   on Twitter. But I'll be interested 
to hear what Dr. Patrick has to say. [Dr. Seheult]: I'm just sort of adding on to 
the ""New England Journal of Medicine"" paper   that you just referred to. There was a follow-up 
study. It's still a pre-print to my knowledge.   And this study was done in around 2,500 people, 
and they were women specifically. They were given   a COVID-19 vaccine before 20 weeks of pregnancy, 
and much like you mentioned with the study in the   ""New England Journal of Medicine,"" the miscarriage 
rate was on the low...within the normal range,   and it was actually on the low end. So it was 
about 12.8% of miscarriages that occurred, and   the normal range is between 12.5% to 18.7%. So, 
again, it was on the low end of the normal range. There was another study that was published 
last June, and it was in the American Society   for Reproductive Medicine. And that study 
found that neither having...previously   had a SARS-CoV-2 infection or having had a 
COVID-19 vaccine affected embryo implantation. So,   there was no effect on the ability of the embryo 
to implant into the uterus. On top of that,   there was a very small study looking at fertility 
in men, and this study found that there was no   effect of COVID-19 vaccines on any of the normal 
sperm parameters that are measured like motility,   etc. Like there was no 
effect on that. So, I think,   generally speaking, it seems as all 
the data so far points to no effect   of COVID-19 vaccines on...no real, you know, 
large effect of COVID-19 vaccines on fertility. [Kyle]: Okay. Dr. Patrick, this next question 
is for you. This is in your wheelhouse,   and it's about the mRNA vaccine specifically.   And since this is for a lot of people new 
technology, technology they haven't heard about,   and there are rumors that this is somehow gene 
therapy, and it's going to be impacting our own   DNA within ourselves, can you speak to that, 
and what are your thoughts about those rumors? [Dr. Patrick]: Well, sure. I think it's 
understandable for most people to be a little   concerned because they've never heard of this 
mRNA technology. The word RNA is in it. It's just   overwhelming in a sense. And, I think, as I 
mentioned earlier when I was talking about...you   know, from a thousand foot high...mile high, you 
know, viewpoint, how these mRNA vaccines work,   and how there's, you know, a sequence of the 
messenger RNA inside of a lipid nanoparticle   and along with some other factors that essentially 
when that lipid nanoparticle with the mRNA gets   inside of your cells, your cells themselves, our 
ribosomes translate that mRNA into actual protein.   And so really, it's more accurate to be a protein 
making technology in a way. But nonetheless,   there's been a lot of fear that mRNA vaccines are 
gene therapy that are altering our DNA. And so to   understand that, you need to understand...I mean, 
I think first and foremost, if someone says that   to you, you might want to ask them, ""Where inside 
the cell does DNA reside?"" And if they don't know   the answer to that question, then they probably 
don't understand what they're saying. So our DNA   resides in a part of our cell called the nucleus. 
It's inside of a nucleus. Things don't just freely   pass into the nucleus of the cell. In order to 
get inside of the nucleus of the cell, you have   to have what's called a nuclear localization 
sequence. This is a very specific sequence   that allows something to get inside of the 
nucleus. And so there's no nuclear localization   sequence anywhere in this mRNA, anywhere, you 
know, inside of the lipid nanoparticle. It's   not present. It's not there. There's no way for 
it to get inside of the nucleus of the cell. If   somehow it did somehow miraculously get inside 
of the nucleus of our cell where our DNA resides,   in order for it to alter our DNA, the mRNA would 
first have to become DNA. And in order for that to   happen, you would need an enzyme called reverse 
transcriptase. There's no reverse transcriptase   inside of our nucleus, inside of the, you 
know, lipid nanoparticle with our mRNA. It's   not present. So, that is not likely to happen. 
But if all those things were to happen somehow,   then in order for the DNA...so if you somehow 
got inside the nucleus, turn the mRNA into DNA,   and then in order for it to alter our DNA, 
you'd have to have something called an   integrase enzyme, it would have to integrate 
into our DNA to get in there to change it.   And again, no integrase enzyme present 
there. It's not going to happen. So, the chances of the mRNA 
vaccines actually changing our DNA   are so small. I mean, it would just take 
some sort of grand conspiracy where,   you know, we're somehow getting these enzymes into 
this mRNA, and it's doing all this stuff. I mean,   like it's just not going to happen. 
It's not biologically plausible. [Kyle]: Dr. Seheult, anything to add to that? [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. I mean, the central dogma 
of molecular biology is that DNA goes to RNA,   RNA goes to protein. And what we're doing with the 
vaccine is we're simply instructing the ribosomes,   which reside in the outer portion of the cell, 
to make the protein. This, by the way, is exactly   what the virus does. And so if you're a little 
bit freaked out or creeped out by the fact that   your cell machinery is being taken over to 
make something that it shouldn't be making,   well, let me introduce you to COVID-19 
because that's exactly what's happening   in the viral infection. And instead 
of it happening just in one or two   cells, it's happening in millions of cells. In 
fact, there's billions to trillions of copies   of the virus that's being made in one individual, 
and it goes all throughout the body. So,   what's happening here with the vaccine is that 
it's simply using the ribosomes to make proteins.   There's no aspect of the messenger RNA vaccines 
that do anything with the nucleus. And it's the   nucleus that holds the DNA, and that's where your 
genome is. So, that's basically it in a nutshell. [Dr. Patrick]: Well, just to add 
to that, Dr. Seheult, you know,   speaking of viruses and what viruses do, we know 
some viruses actually can change back into DNA   and affect our DNA. So, HIV is one, 
some of the herpes viruses as well.   If there's anything to be worried about changing 
our DNA, it's actually viruses themselves. [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. [Kyle]: Dr. Seheult, working in the ICU, I know 
you've been following any potential treatment for   COVID-19 very closely throughout the pandemic, and 
you've featured a number of potentially promising   treatments in your COVID-19 update videos. And I 
want to ask your thoughts on this idea that, you   know, viable treatments currently exist or viable 
options exist if one were to get COVID-19 or even   potentially to prevent them from getting COVID-19, 
and therefore they don't need the vaccine because   they can just treat it effectively if they 
get it. What are your thoughts on that? [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. So that's a very interesting 
philosophy. I follow the philosophy of the Swiss   cheese model. Let me explain what that is a little 
bit. Imagine you've got a block of Swiss cheese,   and you've sliced it up all throughout. And if you 
were to pull out one of those slices, you would   see that there may be some Swiss cheese holes 
in there, and each slice would have the holes   in different places. Maybe some slices would have 
more holes than other slices. Maybe some slices   would have very little holes. Maybe others have 
a lot of holes. But the bottom line is, is that   the more slices of Swiss cheese you put in there, 
the less likely you're going to be able to find   a hole that's going to get through all of those 
slices. And that's kind of the general principle   here that we see with the Swiss cheese model of 
making sure that we have the best protection we   have to avoid the outcomes that we don't want to 
have. Let me put it in a different perspective.   In the operating room, we want to make sure 
that we have no post-operative infections,   and we have a lot of layers that we put into 
that. For instance, the surgeon wears a mask.   They sterilize the instruments. They 
put a solution, a sterilizing solution   over the area of the skin that they're going to 
make the incision. I mean, this goes on and on,   positive pressure ventilation in the room, a scrub 
nurse, adjusting the humidity in the room just   right, adjusting the temperature in the room just 
right. So we don't say that because sterilizing   the equipment works, then therefore the mask 
doesn't work, or say the fact that we have to   put sterilization solution on the skin that 
therefore we don't have to humidify the room.   That's foreign to medical thinking. I mean, if 
we even think about it in the general practice,   right, we do crash tests on vehicles, not 
because we don't think seat belts work.   We don't put airbags into vehicles because we 
don't think crashed...I mean, what we're doing   is we're doing multiple layers because the more 
layers we have, the better protection we're going   to have in the end to avoid the undesired outcome 
at the end. So, to hear this about saying that   people are getting vaccinated, but because 
we're making everyone wear masks, that must   mean that the vaccines don't work. Completely, 
I'm lost on that. That's not the way we think   in medicine. We try to avoid these things. And so 
the Swiss cheese model is how we think about this. So one of the things that's come up is the idea of   ivermectin. Ivermectin is this medication that 
was initially studied. This came out in June   of 2020. And what they found was that in high 
enough concentrations in vitro in a test tube,   when they went to something 
called 5 micromolar concentration,   they were able to completely shut down and reduce 
by about 5,000-fold the ability of the SARS-CoV-2   virus to reproduce. And so obviously, there was a 
lot of excitement because perhaps we might be able   to use a repurposed medication like ivermectin, 
which has been around for years and is used as an   anti-parasitic or anthelmintic medication, 
especially in South America and Africa.   Perhaps this could be used to treat COVID-19. And 
so this paper, which was an in vitro paper looking   at 5 micromolar concentration that was required to 
shut down, was one of the things that were looked   at. The problem was is that when you look at the 
actual dosing of ivermectin in a human being,   you only get about 0.28 micromolar. So that's 
a number of orders of magnitude, if you will,   reduced than the concentration that you would 
need to have in the cell to get that. And so this   paper here that was published in the ""British 
Journal of Clinical Pharmacology"" said that   ""The free plasma concentration of ivermectin 
would need to be 250 times lower,"" was actually   250 times lower than the concentration required 
to reduce viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 in   vitro. And so that was one of the things. But 
again, this is all in vitro, and so we look at   actual randomized controlled data and 
meta-analyses. And there was a meta-analysis that   came out in June of 2021 titled ""Ivermectin for 
Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 Infection:   A Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, and 
Trial Sequential Analysis to Inform Clinical   Guidelines."" And what they did was they looked at 
a number of different studies, up to 25 different   studies that were...some of them were randomized, 
some of them were not as well randomized. Some of   them had bias. And they analyzed all of those 
things, and they came up with the conclusion   that there was moderate certainty of 
evidence that there was a reduction   in death compared with no ivermectin. But the 
rest of the conclusions had a very low certainty   evidence. Now, this meta-analysis included 
a randomized controlled trial that was later   retracted because there was basically fraud going 
on in the study. Although that hasn't been fully   investigated yet, but it seems as though there 
were some problems in that study. The authors   of the meta-analysis say that it wouldn't have 
changed the overall conclusion, but you can kind   of see that there are some questions. And a lot of 
these studies were done in patients that were in   basically outside of the United States. And why 
would that be an issue? If you think about this,   ivermectin is a medication that kills off 
parasites. And if you look at some of the data,   for instance, in Egypt, and in the Middle 
East, South America, the amount of clinically   silent parasitic infections in the population 
approaches in some studies 50% to 60%. So you   can imagine, if you take these patients who 
then come down with COVID-19, put them in   the hospital, and apply to them large doses of 
dexamethasone, which is an immunosuppressant,   it's possible...we don't know for sure, but it's 
possible that some of these parasitic infections   may be coming less silent and becoming activated 
with the suppression of the immune system.   And so it makes sense that in those types 
of situations, that adding ivermectin   may be beneficial, not because it's helping 
out COVID-19 specifically, but because it's   suppressing these concomitant infections that 
are going on. That is a potential possibility. And so, if you're asking about 
whether or not ivermectin should be   used in the United States, what you really need is 
randomized controlled trials in the United States,   looking at the United States population. And right 
now I'm happy to say that there are a number of   studies that are undergoing, not only in the 
United States, specifically at Temple University   in Philadelphia, but also there's a trial data 
that's looking at McMaster University and also   in Brazil called the Together Trial. And 
what they've done is they've actually made   this platform where they can rapidly assess the 
efficacy of repurposed medication. So things like   hydroxychloroquine was looked at. That didn't find 
any improvements, so they stopped that study. They   looked at lopinavir-ritonavir, and they stopped 
that study because there wasn't improvement. They   stopped the metformin study because there wasn't 
improvement. But there are two medications that   they're currently looking at. They're looking 
at the ivermectin single dose to see if that   is causing any improvements. They've now gone to 
three doses to see whether or not they are. There   is some evidence that they're seeing some signal 
that may be appropriate, but the one that they're   noticing actually has an even better signal that 
they're studying more is fluvoxamine, which is an   antidepressant medication. It has some claims 
that it may be an anti-inflammatory medication,   antioxidant. The point is, is that we should be 
looking at these medications. It should be done   in a randomized controlled trial under a specific 
study platform, and we shouldn't be writing these   things off. So, the question is, is whether or not 
we should be requiring the high level of evidence   that we normally would have in a pandemic or not. 
And I think that's a reasonable question to have.   But these things do need to be studied. 
They do need to be looked at. But realize,   at the end of the day, this is just one slice in 
the large slices of cheese. We can't all depend   on that one slice because every slice has holes 
in it, and the more slices we have, the better.   And so as part of my philosophy, if there is 
something that works, great, that's a slice,   but it doesn't mean that we don't do the other 
things that are important because nothing is 100%. [Kyle]: Dr. Patrick, what are 
your thoughts on this question? [Dr. Patrick]: Well, I do have many 
thoughts particularly with the ivermectin   being as good as vaccines statement that is very 
sensationalized and I think is doing a lot of harm   because, as Dr. Seheult pointed out, you 
know, we should study any type of therapeutic   that is repurposed, anything we know is 
safe in humans, and anything that could have   even the slightest positive effect on the 
SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 illness because   we need everything that we can to fight this. We 
need multiple therapeutics. We need vaccines. We   need everything. And so, I think, when you 
sensationalize something more than the data   suggests it deserves, then you have a couple 
of problems. One, you're misleading people,   and that's a big problem. And two, you're getting 
a sort of knee-jerk reaction from researchers,   scientists, from physicians that are going, 
""Whoa, wait a minute. Something feels a little,   you know, off."" And so you kind of put off 
those people that otherwise may be more open   to looking at that therapeutic if they otherwise 
didn't hear a very sensationalistic claim   like ivermectin is just as good as vaccines 
at protecting against COVID-19. And so   meta-analysis, Dr. Seheult mentioned a very 
popular one that was a systematic review   and did show some conclusions that 
were positive generally speaking.   But when you actually go down and look at the 
individual studies within that meta-analysis and   other types of analysis that are aggregating 
a bunch of data, what you'll often find is a   common set of problems. And these problems are 
manifold. One, they include the co-treatments,   and the treatments are very different with 
each of these studies. So, for example,   sometimes you'll have ivermectin alone. Sometimes 
you'll have ivermectin plus azithromycin.   Sometimes you'll have ivermectin plus some kind 
of nose spray. Sometimes you'll have ivermectin   plus vitamin C and zinc and blood thinners and 
azithromycin in the kitchen sink basically.   Then you'll compare that to sometimes 
placebo, sometimes hydroxychloroquine,   sometimes hydroxychloroquine and 
azithromycin, sometimes doxycycline.   There's so many variables here that you can't look 
at just one of the variables and say ivermectin   is doing this when you have ivermectin plus 
the kitchen sink, or you have ivermectin   plus something else compared to the kitchen 
sink or compared to...you know, so there's   a lot of variables that are just being 
aggregated together that are very different. The second major problem with a lot of these 
studies is that they are small sample sizes, and   so at the end of the day, when you're looking at 
a clinical endpoint, for example, hospitalization,   when you have 50 people in a group, you know, 
then if 2 people end up in the hospital, so you   have 2 people in the control group end up in the 
hospital, but out of the other 50 people, you have   zero end up in the hospital, so let's say in the 
ivermectin group because you'll find studies like   this, it's such a low sample size that the risk of 
that event happening, the certainty of that event   happening being actually, you know, causal 
by that treatment is so low. Like you can't   make a definitive statement about that. And so 
what you'll see happening is that more and more   studies will be pulled together so that you now 
have larger sample sizes when you pull them all   together, and then your certainty becomes a little 
bit better. But then you have to ask yourself,   well, is that really true? When you have such 
a low sample size within that individual study,   pulling them together is kind of a statistical 
way of manipulating the data in a way saying,   well, look, there's statistical significance when 
you pull it all together. I think that's really   important to keep in mind when you're looking 
at some of these meta-analysis with ivermectin. And then you also have the clinical 
endpoints varying. So you have people looking   at hospitalization. You'll have research 
groups looking at deaths. You'll have   research groups looking at viral clearance 
time to a negative PCR. And in some cases,   they're all being aggregated together, 
and it's like clinical benefit is the   end point. And it's like, well, geez, these 
are vastly different clinical endpoints. So,   you really need to be careful when 
looking at aggregated data. Certainly,   there's a number of websites out there that 
are doing this. And I can tell you that I've   looked at these individual studies, and in many 
cases, I mean, it's everything I just mentioned   and worse. It's where you can't even find 
the numbers that they're coming up with. But sticking to just the scientific literature, 
you know, even that systematic meta-analysis   that Dr. Seheult mentioned, you know, if 
you look at all the different studies,   and a lot of them were pre-prints that they 
included, the only real consistent finding   that was found, consistent meaning every study 
showed it, was basically time to a negative PCR,   in other words, an ivermectin plus the 
kitchen sink or ivermectin plus whatever,   it seemed to lead to a faster viral clearance 
to some degree. And again, it might be that it   takes ivermectin plus the kitchen sink to do it, 
but that ivermectin plays a small role. We don't   really know. And when you take ivermectin plus the 
kitchen sink, you can't pinpoint it and say it's   ivermectin doing it. You just can't do that unless 
you give the kitchen sink without ivermectin to   the control group. And then you can say, well, 
look, they were given the exact other, you know,   array of therapeutics, and they didn't have the 
same improvement as the other group with the array   of therapeutic treatments plus the ivermectin. 
So, there's a lot of nuance to this. And I think   that at the end of the day, there is a little 
bit of a signal. There is something that seems   to be going on with ivermectin, whether or not 
it's in combination with all these other things   or by itself. It's unclear. What is clear is that 
we definitely do need more data. We need more high   quality data. We need more data from, you know, 
states that...or from countries that don't have a   really high background of parasitic disease as Dr. 
Seheult pointed out. It's a very big confounding   factor. But also we need to not sensationalize 
something and, you know, speak about things that   are not true. Like there's just no evidence 
that ivermectin is going to protect you from   infection and from severe disease as well as a 
vaccine. There's no evidence of that, and so don't   make that claim. Make the claim for what the data 
speaks to. There may be an effect. There may be an   effect particularly on viral clearance. If people 
would tone it down and not make these grandiose   claims, there would be a lot more interest 
in ivermectin and studying ivermectin. And, you know, the other thing to keep in mind is 
that there's been a lot of people that have now   sought out a veterinary form of it because it is 
something that in addition to being used in humans   for parasitic diseases and helminths and 
also scabies and lice and things like that,   it's also used in like...you know, 
people are calling it horse dewormer,   which, you know, it's just...it's not a good idea 
to go and get a veterinary type of medication and   try to treat yourself because there's vastly, 
you know, different doses involved. I mean,   you know, horses are much larger than humans. 
It's very dangerous to do something like that.   And I think people have sort of heard these 
sensational claims and sort of taking their   own action trying to get some form of ivermectin, 
and really, that could be quite dangerous.   I agree with Dr. Seheult that we should 
be studying these repurposed therapeutics.   There is a potential for ivermectin. At 
least in my opinion at the very least,   it seems as though it's pretty consistently 
involved in speeding up the viral clearance   to some degree. It's not like a huge, huge effect, 
but there is an effect, and it's consistent with   pretty much all the studies that I've personally 
looked at. So, I think that, you know, we should   really go after that and try to see if 
that's real. That's pretty much my thought. [Kyle]: Excellent. And speaking 
of those studies that you both   talked about and these meta-analyses, one 
argument I've heard for ivermectin is some of   these population-based studies where certain 
countries have decided to give ivermectin   on a large scale. And you can understand, you 
know, potentially their motivation. They want to   protect their population and prevent COVID-19 
if they can, and they're going to use whatever   resources they think they have to do that. What 
are some problems with these population-based   studies for people who aren't 
familiar with what those are? [Dr. Patrick]: So basically, they're known as 
ecological studies. They're great to look at.   They're hypothesis generating. You don't rely on 
hypothesis generating studies to determine whether   or not somebody gets a medication. So first off, 
you know, all the disclaimers, don't take this   as medical advice, talk to your doctor, see if 
it's right for you, and don't get your ivermectin   from the feed store are some reasonable advice to 
take. But in terms of the studies, what you need   to be able to reach the point where you're able 
to prescribe someone something is what the FDA   requires, which is a randomized placebo-controlled 
trial that's usually multi-centered,   and it's very large. And that's what you have 
to do to be able to say this is the medicine   that's indicated for this condition. And we just 
haven't had that yet here in the United States. [Dr. Patrick]: And to sort of add to 
that, Dr. Seheult, I mean, you know,   even going back to the original clinical trials 
with our mRNA vaccines, there were 75,000 people   originally in that randomized controlled trial 
where, you know, half the population was getting   the treatment, which were the vaccines, and 
the other half was getting the placebo. And   then on top of that...so that's a large number of 
people. The sample sizes with this ivermectin is   a fraction of that, I mean, a fraction. And on 
top of that, we now have all this real world data   where we've got billions of people worldwide 
who have had a COVID-19 vaccine, and they are   protecting from severe disease, and to some degree 
they're also protecting against even getting   infected depending on which, you know, vaccine 
a person has gotten. So, we know they're   effective. We know from large, large, large 
numbers. And to sort of even add on to that,   everything has changed since the 
Delta variant. We have had to sort of   start again and look at...aggregate new 
data because this is a new variant where   our vaccines are not as effective at preventing 
infection. And, you know, the reality is, is   all these meta-analysis and all this data 
we just talked about with ivermectin,   this was not when Delta was the dominant variant. 
We don't really know what ivermectin even does   with, you know, the Delta variant. I haven't 
seen data really showing how ivermectin,   you know, affects Delta variant. So I think 
that's also something to consider as well. [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. That's a great point. And, 
you know, FoundMyFitness even more than MedCram,   we've been talking about things that you can do, 
things that are easy for you to do like sleep.   We talked about vitamin D. We're not opposed...I 
mean, look at our video histories, our respective   video histories, we are all in for trying to take 
control of your health care, take control of your   life, and to do this. So let's just take the 3,000 
foot level here or the 30,000 foot level. This   vaccine is indicated for this particular virus. 
I mean, I'm not naive to believe that this is   the only pandemic that we're ever going to see in 
our lifetime. It's not the only illness that we're   ever going to have to deal with. Some of those 
other things that we talked about with vitamin D,   with sleep, with exercise, stress reduction, 
fresh air, sunlight, these things have enormous   benefits, not just with COVID-19, but 
every other aspect of our life. And so   again, it's the Swiss cheese model. The 
more slices you have in there, the better. [Dr. Patrick]: 100%. I mean, the low hanging 
fruit is obviously the things that you can do   to improve your lifestyle, making sure your 
vitamin D levels are high enough, you know,   trying to be metabolically healthy, you know, 
eating the best diet or losing weight if   you're overweight or obese, getting good enough 
sleep. All these things are hugely important for   overall health and certainly for immunity. So, 
again, thank you for pointing that out because   it really...at the end of the day, there are so 
many factors that do need to be optimized as well. [Kyle]: Dr. Patrick, this question's for you, 
and it's about transmission. And we know that   the Delta variant has been a game-changer, and 
we've seen the efficacy of vaccines drop to some   degree with regards to do they prevent symptomatic 
COVID-19. And we're also aware that transmission   of the Delta variant may be happening 
among...well, is happening among   fully vaccinated people. So, what are 
your thoughts on this? Should this   shake people's confidence in 
getting a COVID-19 vaccine? [Dr. Patrick]: Well, I think people 
have...it's always easy to make   generalized statements when you see a little 
piece of data coming in, which, by the way,   new data every day, things are changing 
constantly, hard to keep up with. I think   people have made this overarching statement 
that vaccines do not prevent the transmission   of SARS-CoV-2 virus. In other words, they do not 
prevent people from contracting COVID-19. And,   I think, to understand why that is not true, 
we need to start with the word transmission   because there are two major types of transmission 
when we're talking about a viral illness here.   First is called onward transmission, 
and this is the type of transmission   that is more at the individual level. So 
a person becomes infected with a virus.   They have viral particles in their nose, and, you 
know, they're basically shedding viral particles.   And this can be transmitted through aerosols and 
large respiratory droplets to other individuals,   right? So this is the transmission of 
the virus that most people think about.   But there's also what's called its overall 
transmission, and that is the transmission   in an overall population. This is the 
population level. So if we have a treatment   or a vaccine that is able to prevent even a 
small percentage of people from becoming ill,   then it still reduces overall transmission because 
fewer people are actually getting the illness. And so as you mentioned, the Delta variant 
has sort of changed everything because, when,   you know, we had the Alpha variant and even the 
Beta variant, we know that the vaccines in the   United States were largely effective still 
and, you know, in many cases still 90%, 95%   effective at preventing people from even getting 
COVID-19 symptomatic and seeking out health   care. We know that in addition, people that did 
become...that did get infected with SARS-CoV-2   virus, they actually had fewer viral particles. 
They were not transmitting the virus like an   unvaccinated person was. That's all changed with 
Delta. Now we have to aggregate new data, see,   you know, what the data shows. And, I think, 
I would say that the data shows that in about   July of 2021 is when the Delta variant in the 
United States really started to become dominant,   sort of took over. And so there was a large 
study that was done out of the Mayo Clinic.   Many states were involved in terms of like the 
sample population from many different states in   the United States. And this was like 25,000 
people that were vaccinated versus 25,000   people that were unvaccinated. What the 
Mayo Clinic study was looking at first was   vaccine efficacy, like the ability to, you 
know, prevent people from getting COVID-19   and also looked at the efficacy of preventing 
hospitalization. So that's also very important. And so when the Delta variant became dominant, it 
was clear that efficacy for preventing infection   went down. So people that were fully vaccinated 
with the Pfizer vaccine went from an efficacy of   like 88% to 93% or something like that down 
to 41%. So, there was still some efficacy.   In other words, you know, 41% of people that 
were fully vaccinated were still not getting   COVID-19, which means that the Pfizer vaccine 
still reducing overall transmission. And   on a similar level, the Moderna mRNA vaccine 
also had reduced efficacy in terms of   preventing infections, although it wasn't quite 
as dramatic. So the Moderna vaccine is about twice   as protective as the Pfizer vaccine in getting 
a SARS-CoV-2 infection. So that was about 77%   effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. So, 
again, overall transmission is reduced because,   you know, a large percent of people 
that are fully vaccinated with Moderna   are still not getting even infected. That was good 
news. Both vaccines were still quite effective   anywhere from 80% to 97% effective at 
preventing hospitalizations, which is ultimately   the most important thing. As Dr. Seheult pointed 
out earlier in this discussion, you don't want   your hospitals overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients 
because, when your parents have a heart attack,   or if you get in a car accident, or your 
child comes down with a severe form of RSV,   you know, or fill in the blank, you're not going 
to get the care that you need and you deserve.   So it's good to prevent hospitalizations 
because that protects our health care   system from being overwhelmed, 
which is important for all of us. The other thing that was found was that...not 
with the Mayo Clinic study, but there was another   study, a large study that was done out of the 
U.K. and this study showed that this was...the   most interesting thing in my opinion in this 
study, this also included AstraZeneca vaccine   because AstraZeneca has largely been used 
in some European countries like in the U.K.,   that people that were fully vaccinated 
were still...you know, there was still some   efficacy in terms of protecting against, you 
know, getting the virus as I just mentioned   with the Mayo Clinic study something similar was 
found. But when you looked at peak viral load,   in other words, when the virus is at its peak 
for replicating, the peak viral load was similar   in a breakthrough infection from a vaccinated 
person versus a unvaccinated person that had   contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus. And so that 
sort of caused a media frenzy, you know,   to sort of make this general statement 
that vaccines don't prevent transmission.   And it's just not accurate to say that. 
For one, they're still preventing overall   transmission as we just discussed. But two, you 
need to look at overall viral replication. So,   you know, it's not just peak transmission 
that's important. You're transmitting this   virus to other people at many different stages of 
being infected. And so that's exactly what this   pre-print study out of Singapore, which was 
with the Delta variant showed that while initial   viral loads were similar between a breakthrough 
vaccinated case and an unvaccinated person that   had SARS-CoV-2 virus...infected with SARS-CoV-2 
virus, those initial viral levels were the   same. If you followed those individuals over 
time, the vaccinated people cleared the virus   faster than the unvaccinated. So they actually 
had a shorter negative PCR time. If this was true,   you would have the hypothesis that at any given 
time, if you were to take a random person out of   the population and sample their viral load, then 
you would see vaccinated people at any point in   time should have a smaller viral load because 
they're clearing the virus faster. And that's   exactly what this real-time data that's being 
aggregated out of the U.K., it's called REACT   Study, that study found that if you were to take 
a random sampling of people at any point in time,   vaccinated breakthrough cases, they had 
a lower viral load than unvaccinated. So,   I think, with this data, it suggests 
that not only do the vaccines still   prevent...sorry, still reduce overall 
transmission, they also still reduce onward   transmission. They're still affecting transmission 
on multiple levels. And so, I think, that's really   important to keep in mind. In addition to that, 
understanding who gets the breakthrough infection.   Why are 41% of people vaccinated with Pfizer 
still protected from even getting, you know,   SARS-CoV-2 virus? And why are 77% of people fully 
vaccinated with Moderna not getting infected? There was a big study that came out of Israel 
looking at breakthrough infections. Now,   this wasn't necessarily when Delta 
was dominant, but I think it still   is important to keep in mind that what's 
causing these breakthrough infections.   We don't know exactly everything, 
but if you look at this Israel study,   they were looking at health care workers. 
And there was about 15,000 of them basically.   These health care workers, they took blood 
samples, and they could look at their antibody   levels against...these were vaccinated health care 
workers. They could look at their IgG antibodies,   and I'm not sure what other antibodies they looked 
at, but they could look at the levels of them and   quantitate them. And then if they came down with 
a breakthrough infection, they could sort of use   that data and go, ""Oh, could we predict whether 
or not this person came down with a breakthrough   infection based on their antibody levels?"" And 
that's exactly what was found. People that had   lower antibody titers were much more likely to 
get a breakthrough infection than people that   had higher antibody titers. And there was another 
great study that came...it was a Miles Davenport   group, and it published in ""Nature Medicine."" 
And he did this mathematical modeling to predict   breakthrough infections. And what he found was 
that it seems as though, according to his model,   people need a six-fold higher antibody titer level 
to be protected from contracting SARS-CoV-2 virus.   Then they need to be protected from being 
hospitalized from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In other   words, you need a much lower antibody level or 
titer to prevent yourself from being hospitalized,   but you need a higher level to prevent yourself 
from actually contracting the virus itself. [Dr. Seheult]: So what Dr. Patrick has told us 
is that there is a difference that you have to   look a little bit deeper. I was able to find 
a pre-print of an article that just came out   a couple of weeks ago that looked at the quality 
of those viral particles that are shed from those   that have breakthrough infections. So in other 
words, is it possible that the shedding of the   virus that comes from unvaccinated are the same 
as vaccinated. And what this pre-print showed   very interestingly if you look at this graph, 
here we have the amount of viral load being   shed on the X-axis, and on the Y-axis, what they 
did was they tried to see what was the chances   of these viral particles of actually growing in a 
viral culture, kind of a surrogate to successfully   infecting the next person. What you can see here 
is the dark blue are those that are unvaccinated,   and the light blue are those that are vaccinated. 
You can clearly see here that at any given viral   load, the vaccinated health care worker in this 
study from the Netherlands was shown to have a   less likelihood of infecting somebody based 
on viral culture. So, not only do we see with   the vaccinated less breakthrough infections, 
and when there are breakthrough infections,   they are cleared faster. But we're also seeing 
that the viral particles that come out of   vaccinated people are less likely to infect. 
And that's important because there has been   some talk going around that it's the vaccinated 
people that are transmitting the virus more   and causing these outbreaks to those that 
are unvaccinated, and those are the ones   that are showing up to the hospital. But clearly, 
here, the data is showing that is not the fact. [Dr. Patrick]: Oh, just to 
add to that, Dr. Seheult,   that is very interesting...that the study 
is very interesting because the way that   researchers are measuring, you know, 
peak viral load is through real-time PCR,   and real-time PCR can actually be detecting 
dead viral particles. That makes a hypothesis   even quite likely that there are some dead viral 
particles, which you would even...you'd sort of,   you know, theorize would be true because, if you 
do have antibodies against the spike protein, that   your immune system would start to kill or to, you 
know, clear the virus that you're being exposed to   since you have some antibodies, you'd think there 
would be some effect. So that's very interesting. [Dr. Seheult]: Right. It boils down to the 
thing that I've heard that explains this as PCR   is a way of looking...it's kind 
of like looking at dead body parts   and assuming that those dead body parts are 
alive. All it's looking for is parts of the virus,   and parts of viruses don't infect. 
They just make PCR positive. [Dr. Patrick]: Right. Exactly. The question is, 
is like how many of those viral particles are   actually even alive. If they were alive, you 
would imagine that when you put them in culture   that they would replicate. 
So, very interesting study. [Kyle]: Dr. Patrick, I've heard some people 
say that the vaccines themselves might be   contributing to putting certain pressures on the 
SARS-CoV-2 virus, specifically this idea that the   vaccines can make the virus actually more deadly 
or more virulent. What are your thoughts on that? [Dr. Patrick]: I certainly like coming into   hearing these statements, which I've heard 
and it's proliferated on many different   areas of the blogosphere and people that...you 
know, friends of friends, you know, etc.   My first thought was, well, if this is...we need 
to know whether or not this is true because,   if it is, it changes everything in a way, 
right? You don't want to make a virus,   you know, more deadly to the unvaccinated. And 
that's kind of what the general statement is,   is that vaccines are causing selective pressure 
for the virus to mutate into a more virulent form,   which is more dangerous and deadly to the 
unvaccinated. Nobody wants that. Like if that   were the case, I mean, all of our children are 
unvaccinated. So, you know, as a parent, to me,   I wanted to get to the bottom of this and 
understand, is this something to be concerned   about because, if it is, it's a game changer in 
my mind. So, as a non-evolutionary biologist,   I went on a path to trying to understand to the 
best of my knowledge, you know, the literature and   what the literature out there says on how viruses 
evolve and what the selective pressure is and,   you know, what that typically, you know, entails. 
And so from all of my reading and understanding,   again, I'm not an evolutionary biologist, to 
me, I came out of it with the understanding that   viruses...the selective pressure on viruses 
is to evolve to become more transmissible.   They are not under a selection pressure 
to become more virulent. In other words,   it's not in their best interest to kill 
their host because, if they kill their host,   then their host can't incubate the virus and allow 
them to reproduce and infect more people. And so   all the studies that I've read outlined that 
there's these factors and that virulence isn't   something that's selected for. It is something 
that happens incidentally to transmission. In   other words, it sort of hitchhikes alongside. 
So, a virus evolves to become more transmissible,   like that is its major purpose. And in some 
cases, if it becomes more transmissible,   sometimes it can also become more virulent. It 
can be more, you know, dangerous to its host. So many of the different studies have outlined 
that there are factors that limit transmission.   So, if something limits the transmission, 
then it's also going to limit the potential   of the virus to become more virulent. And the 
factors that limit transmission are, one, physical   constraints. So, the virus infects human cells, 
and the human cells then make viral proteins,   and, you know, are basically allowing the virus 
to replicate. So, our own cellular machinery,   the ability of our cells to assemble viral 
proteins, the ability of ourselves metabolically   to do it quick enough, like there's a limit 
to that. Like we can only do that so quickly.   So once that happens, then, you know, a virus has 
sort of reached its peak transmissibility in a way   because our cells physically can't do it quicker 
than it's already doing it, if that makes sense.   And so with the Delta variant right now, we 
may be at a peak transmissible...you know,   we may be at the point where our cells can't 
assemble all the viral proteins quick enough   for it to become even more transmissible. We 
don't know. Maybe we're not there yet, but   maybe we are. We have no idea. It's definitely a 
much more transmissible variant. So that's the one   thing that limits the ability of a virus to become 
more virulent is the limitation on transmission. The other thing is host mortality. If a virus 
is killing the host within a certain time frame   before transmission ends, then, you know, you 
start to like not be able to transmit the virus   more, and you're not going to have more variants 
crop up because the host is dying. And so this   is something people have been very concerned 
about with vaccines because the argument is that   vaccines are preventing more...they're preventing 
people from dying from COVID-19, and therefore,   they're going to allow the virus to have a chance 
to mutate into something that is more virulent.   Again, it has to mutate into something that's more 
transmissible, virulent hitchhikers alongside of   that. But if you look at the deaths in COVID-19, 
people that are unvaccinated, or just generally   speaking, people usually die much later than the 
transmission phase. They die, you know, days and   days and days after actually becoming infected 
with SARS-CoV-2. And so the transmission phase   is well over before people are even dying. The 
reality is, is that people that are unvaccinated   have...they're creating these mutations and 
allowing variants to evolve even at a greater rate   because, not only are they, you know, able to do 
it even before they potentially succumb to death,   but, you know, the fact that we just talked about 
overall transmission reduced by vaccine, so,   people that are vaccinated are 
less likely to even get infected,   and we talked about onward transmission reduced, 
in other words, people are clearing the virus   faster that are vaccinated than unvaccinated. 
In every sense, people that are unvaccinated,   there's more chances for the virus to replicate 
and to potentially mutate and form another variant   that could become more transmissible, 
and that's potentially more virulent. Now, people are also conflating the vaccine 
escaped immunity. That is a completely different   thing. That is not something that is relevant 
to virulence, if you look at the large body of   scientific literature covering this topic. I 
shouldn't say large body. It's actually quite   limited. So there's no example of human 
vaccines causing a more virulent strain.   There are examples of vaccine escape. So in other 
words, variants crop up that are no longer...that   can evade the antibodies produced by vaccines. 
That's a different thing. That isn't something   that's more virulent. That's something that's 
going to affect people that are vaccinated   because now they're going to be more likely to 
be infected, and their vaccine is less effective.   That's a very different thing than what we're 
talking about, which is the evolution, the   selective pressure on viruses to transmit, become 
more transmissible. And that is the selective   pressure that exists, not virulence. Virulence 
hitchhikes alongside the transmission aspect of   why viruses, you know, mutate basically in the 
selective pressure that's on them to do that. [Kyle]: Dr. Seheult, I want to hear your thoughts 
on that. And also Dr. Patrick mentioned how,   you know, with Delta variant and other variants,   and in the past with vaccines, how 
sometimes a variant can crop up that escapes   vaccine antibodies. Can you talk a little about 
the other big aspect of the immune system,   and that's the T cell response, and how that can 
still offer us a lot of protection potentially? [Dr. Seheult]: Sure. Yeah. So first of 
all, in order for you to have variants,   you have to have replication because it's the 
errors in replication that cause variance.   And so the only way you can have 
replication is if you have viruses   in hosts. So, if you look at the examples that 
we have, whether it's Alpha, Beta Gamma, Delta,   most of these variants, if not all of them, came 
from populations that were not vaccinated. Now,   India's done a great job at producing vaccines, 
and they're well on their way to vaccinating   their population, fortunately. But 
the Delta variant came out early on   when they were not having a lot of people 
vaccinated. Same thing with the South African   variant, and the P1 that came out of Brazil. This 
was during a time where there was not vaccinated.   If it was vaccination that caused variance, then 
we should be seeing variants coming out of Israel,   in the United States. These are probably the two 
most vaccinated countries in the world. And that's   just certainly not the case. Now, in terms of 
B cell, or I should say antibodies, antibodies   are very important when it comes to neutralizing a 
virus that is outside of your cells predominantly.   So, neutralizing it before they become inside 
your cells, before they infect the cells,   that's very, very important. But there's 
a whole another aspect to the immunity   that help in terms of hospitalization, 
in terms of those memory T cells,   and that is what we just mentioned was the T 
cells, the cytotoxic T cells and the rest of it. What's interesting that I found about 
T cells is that when they reproduce,   they also reproduce in a way where they put 
errors in there so that as the virus may mutate,   there seems to be some evidence that the T 
cell response may be able to anticipate and   mutate along with it. Now, that's not 100% science 
yet, but there seems to be some evidence of that   at least in the research articles that I've read. 
And if you look at what's happening right now with   the Delta variant in Israel, in the United States, 
we see a reduction in the ability of the vaccines   to reduce transmission, right? So with the Delta 
variant, instead of the 80% to 90% that we enjoyed   early on in the pandemic, it's been knocked down 
somewhat. But we really haven't seen an erosion   to that extent in prevention of hospitalization 
and severe disease. That has more to do with T   cell responses in cytotoxic because by this point, 
the virus is inside the body already inside the   cells. And antibodies have very limited ability 
to take care of those types of situations. So,   the immune system is very complex, and I 
think we need to just sort of look back and   always couple our in vitro hypotheses with 
real-world data. And so far the real-world data   is still holding up in terms of 
prevention of severe disease. And I'd also like to add, there's been some 
sort of a false equivalence, if you will,   that is made in terms of what we know that 
overuse of antibiotics can cause bacterial   resistance to those antibiotics. And there's 
no question about that. That's a whole other   topic of discussion, the overuse of antibiotics 
in humans and in animals especially. And that   gives rise to these superbugs that emerge that are 
no longer susceptible to the antibiotics that we   have, but that's a different situation. That's 
where the antibiotics that are being used are   basically selectively killing out 
all of these susceptible bacteria   and only leaving those that are resistant. So in 
other words, the resistant bacteria already exist,   but we're knocking out the bacteria that are 
susceptible and allowing the resistant forms   to produce. That's very different than what 
we're talking about with vaccines because,   in the terms of vaccines and viruses, the 
resistant viruses don't exist. What allows them to   be created is the ability to replicate. Okay. And 
that's very different with bacteria. In bacteria,   very few resistant bacteria are occurring 
because they're being allowed to replicate.   The only way that they can become resistant 
is if they acquire DNA that gives them,   they're called plasmids or vectors that allow 
antibiotic resistance to then be incorporated in   their DNA. That's not the case with viruses. 
Viruses and bacteria are very different. [Kyle]: Dr. Seheult, I think the most 
common reason I've heard for people   choosing not to get the vaccine is that they 
feel like the process may have been rushed,   that there isn't enough long-term data yet. They 
may be willing to get the vaccine at some point,   but they will, you know, look at the 
historical timelines for vaccines   and realize that it takes often 10 years, you 
know, maybe the average for a vaccine to actually   be manufactured and go through the 
authorization and approval process.   What are your thoughts about this sentiment? And, 
you know, do you feel like the vaccine was rushed?   Do you feel like we can trust the process in 
this case with this particular technology? [Dr. Seheult]: That's a great question. So there's 
no question in my mind and anyone else's that this   process was accelerated. No question about it. 
The question is, is was the quality of the product   compromised by the acceleration of the process? 
And here you can see on the screen a typical   vaccine timeline. If this was done under normal 
situations, we would have started in 2020,   and we wouldn't have had a product until 2034. 
And the reason for that is because there is risk   in making these vaccines, but there's also 
processes that they have to go through.   So there is the research that has to happen. 
Then there's the pre-clinical trials, the bench   top trials, and then phase one, to figure out the 
right dose, phase two, to do the small randomized   controlled trials to see if there are problems, 
then finally, the big phase three trials,   leading up to building the factories to make 
these vaccines, and then the manufacturing,   and then the approval process, and then finally, 
the distribution. So what you can see in the   lower portion of that screen is everything got 
compressed. Now, notice that nothing got skipped.   So we still had the phase one trials, and the 
phase two, and the phase three. Some of these   were being run concomitantly, which means at the 
same time. But notice something very interesting.   The factories were being built at the same time 
that the phase one and two trials were being done.   Why is that? Why were they able to do that? 
Because what the government did by stepping   in and providing them money and resources and 
providing those barriers is they're saying, ""Look,   we'll give you the money to build the factories,"" 
realizing that if these phase one, two,   and three trials are a bust, you're 
not going to be held liable for the   amount of money that you've spent in building 
these factories that aren't going to do anything.   And so that was one of the major barriers to 
getting this thing done was the risk that the   companies would not normally be willing to take 
on these vaccines. But the government was saying,   ""We don't want you to take that risk. We 
want you to get those things started."" Now, this sort of thing has happened 
before. If we go back to World War II,   and we talk about the Nazis and World War II 
and the tremendous machinery that they had   and the amazing amount of the war machine of 
the Nazis, what happened was Franklin Delano   Roosevelt sat down with a guy by the name of 
William Knudsen, who was basically the most   powerful man in terms of...in Detroit and the auto 
manufacturing process. And he basically offered   him a salary of $1 to basically coordinate the 
infrastructure plan to build the war machine that   would be able to go against Hitler. This is what 
William Knudsen, the president of General Motors,   said in a meeting of the executives. 
Basically, the first half of 1941 is crucial.   He said, ""Gentlemen, we must outbuild Hitler,"" 
and that's exactly what he did. There was a point   in time in Detroit where they were at the Ford 
manufacturing plant putting out a B-24 Liberator,   which is a large plane with four engines, at the 
rate of one per hour. That was because the entire   infrastructure of the United 
States was turned towards one goal,   and that was defeating Hitler in World War II. And 
the same thing happened with the implementation   of the project of coming forth with a vaccine. 
Now, some of the vaccine companies took advantage   of the funds. Others did not. But the bottom line 
is, is that those barriers that created a lag   time because of risk, because of money, those 
sorts of things were completely eliminated,   and they were able to speed up the production 
of the vaccine. Now, the phase one trial still   happened. The animal studies still happened. No, 
the animals did not die in the production. In   fact, it was because the animals did so well that 
they were able to go to phase one, two, and three. The other aspect of this that is tossed 
around is that this is new technology.   Now, I know that Dr. Patrick knows more 
about the technology in terms of the history,   but I will just give you a very short timeline. 
Back in the 1990s, we injected for the first time   mRNA into the muscle cells of a mouse, for the 
very first time. By 2005, we had modified the   nucleotides, which are the signaling in that 
mRNA vaccine to get around early destruction.   So the problem early on was that we couldn't 
allow these messenger RNA molecules to last   long enough to make the protein product. 
The problem wasn't that they lasted forever.   It was that they didn't last long enough, but they 
were able to finally figure out how to do that.   And by 2013, they started working on medications 
that were based on mRNA. And then finally,   we have the vaccines. Here is a paper that 
was published in 1990, so over 30 years ago,   that was for the first time showing that this 
technology actually had viability. And so this   technology is not new. It's been around for 30 
years, and it's been looked at. And with that,   I'll turn it over to Dr. Patrick. I 
think she has some more details on this. [Dr. Patrick]: Yes. I do. You know, in 
addition to this technology not being   new in the sense that everyone...most people think 
this is the first time it's actually been used   in humans, just to kind of speak to your point 
about the acceleration of the process of getting   this vaccine into people, and you were talking 
about all the money that's available for building   the factories, I think another really important 
thing to point out is the difference between   this vaccine and our history of vaccines in 
terms of how we make them. For the mRNA vaccines,   all you need is the sequence. That's all you need 
to make it. And it's so easy to make in mass,   mass, mass quantities versus having to actually 
grow vaccine in some kind of animal cell type. And   like, I mean, you're limited. There's a limitation 
in how much of it you can make, physically,   limitation. So, just going back to the actual 
history of mRNA vaccines and this mRNA technology   in humans. In 2001, we have the first clinical 
trial of this mRNA technology that was made. It   was mRNA-induced dendritic cells. In 2009, we have 
another clinical trial where mRNA was used as a   therapeutic. In 2014, there's the first mRNA 
vaccine in terms of immunotherapy for cancer, so   trying to treat cancer with mRNA vaccines. These 
are all in humans. In 2017, there were 2 clinical   trials, one for mRNA-based vaccine for influenza, 
and another one for mRNA technology used to treat   patients with heart...basically had 
heart failure, and they were injecting   mRNA vaccines into their heart. So, we've got a 
lot of clinical data dating back to 2001 where   we've been using this technology in humans, you 
know. So this is not the new technology that   people in their minds they think that this is the 
first time it's ever been used in humans and how   scary that is. It dates back to decades, well, you 
know, a couple of decades being used in humans. To kind of add to that, I really...moving forward, 
it's amazing how this field has exploded in terms   of all the clinical trials now being started 
and planned for this mRNA technology. There is   so much interest, and there's a lot of funding 
now to understand this technology as a therapeutic   for infectious diseases in addition to the 
SARS-CoV-2 virus for other ones. There are   now clinical studies that are now starting to look 
at this technology to treat genetic disorders like   muscular dystrophy where there's no treatment 
that exists. Can you imagine being the parent   of a son that has muscular dystrophy and knowing 
there is no treatment and having to watch your son   degenerate and die? I mean, we may see a 
treatment for muscular dystrophy in our   lifetime because of this. It's accelerated and 
exploded this clinical arena where now we're   seeing tons and tons of trials for mRNA vaccines 
as immunotherapy for cancers where they're going   to be injecting this mRNA technology into a 
variety of different types of solid tumors.   And again, we may very well in our lifetime now 
see a cure for different types of solid tumors.   Solid tumors are the type of cancers that are 
hardest to treat with chemotherapy because   they often grow far away from blood vessels. 
And so blood vessels, you need them to be close   to the cancer site because that's how the 
chemotherapeutic gets, you know, delivered   to the tumor site. And so you'll get these tumors 
growing far away from them. They're what's called   hypoxic. They're growing far away from blood 
vessels. And so it's one of the reasons why many   different solid tumors are resistant to many types 
of chemotherapeutic treatments. So imagine being   able to directly inject the tumor with this mRNA 
technology where we're going to, you know, test a   variety of different immune generating, you know, 
molecules and things that are going to activate   the immune system to go right directly to that 
tumor and kill it. It's a very exciting time, and   I understand that people are scared because it's 
new to them. And it's always scary when something,   you know, is new, and there's change. But there's 
a bright side, and that bright side is, is that   science is moving forward at an accelerated rate. 
And we are witnessing something that would have   not have happened otherwise without this terrible 
pandemic that obviously a lot of bad has come out   of. But, you know, to try to see the silver lining 
here, the good out of it is that the science   has really catapulted forward, and there's some 
exciting stuff going on with the mRNA technology. [Kyle]: Thank you for that. Definitely 
good to have some silver linings right now.   And before we sign off, any items 
that we didn't cover that you want to? [Dr. Seheult]: I was just going to say 
this, Kyle, is to keep in mind this   image in your mind that I've got here on the 
screen, and that is the U.K.'s second wave,   which was non-Delta, and then the third 
wave, which was Delta. I want the audience   to sort of keep this in mind when it comes to 
the vaccines and what they can potentially do.   In the second wave, which is in red, the left 
half of that shows how quickly the infections   rose as time went on. And concomitantly, on the 
other side of it, on the right side, you can see   how quickly deaths unfortunately also 
rose in that second wave. And that's   without the vaccine. That's without the vaccines 
that we currently have now. And then the third   wave came, which was Delta wave, and what 
you can see there, which is a stark departure   from the wave on the left, is that while you 
have the increasing amount of infections,   which are basically positive PCRs as we've talked 
about, what's missing there from that is the   increased amount of deaths in that third wave. And 
that is with the vaccine, and that's something to   keep in mind that I really want to make sure 
the audience understands is when you hear   news stories talking about the decreased 
effectiveness of the vaccine, make sure that   you understand that they're talking about their 
ability to prevent infections. What they're not   talking about at least up to this point 
in time and with the Delta variant   is that we're still holding on its ability 
to prevent hospitalizations and deaths. Now, there is some data 
that is coming out of Israel   where at least some experts believe that that 
ability to hold may be waning in the most   elderly and in those that have been vaccinated 
the longest. And that's where we're talking   about booster shots and things of that nature. 
I think that data as we're talking right now   at the beginning of September is still needing to 
be settled. The FDA is still looking at that and   deciding whether or not booster shots are 
going to be offered and to whom and when.   And so we don't have the science on 
that settled as yet. But I still want to   at least make sure that people understand, that's 
an issue for people that have been vaccinated for   six to eight months already. That's not an issue 
for those that have not yet been vaccinated   and are concerned about where the Delta variant is 
especially in those states right now where Delta   is raging. So, I just wanted to leave that as a 
general point and as really the motivation for   me and I'm sure for many others in making these 
kinds of videos so people can understand that. [Kyle]: Well, thank you both so much for your time 
and all the information today and throughout this   pandemic. Thank you for empowering people to 
better understand the data and the science of   this pandemic and also ways that they can optimize 
their own health and immunity. And I want to thank   everyone who tuned in for this discussion and made

sued in the high court for a lawsuit that claims its coid 19 vaccine was defective but many people are not aware that there is already a scheme in the UK for compensation payments if you've been injured as a result of taking a vaccine those who are severely disabled as a result of taking the co 19 vaccine may be eligible and qualify for a single lumpsum tax-free payment of £120,000 a piece many people are not aware of this but to the extent that some people over on my other channel black belt Secrets make sure you go and subscribe there as well called this out as being conspiracy theorists going after cash now I've done a couple of videos on this now here on black belt bar I'm going to go into a little bit more of the law and over on black belt secrets you can see a more General summary if you want to go there as well I'll link that below but co9 vaccines are not the only thing that people can be eligible for these payouts if they are severely injured disabled as a result of a vaccine in fact the vaccine damage payment scheme covers things including Corona virus which was added as it was reported as a precaution along with uh dip theia influenza misol the mumps all sorts of other different things that are on this list which are will link below so you can go and read that as well for yourself and there's a number of different bits of legisl all around surrounding vaccines about the pre-approval the post authorization and all of these kind of things about how they are tested how they are supposed to be uh vigorously tested before they're safe and released and so on now on the 3rd of December 2020 the UK Department of Health and Social care issued a press release announcing that the co 19 vaccines will generally be added to the vaccine damage payment scheme this announcement made the day after after the fiser vaccine was granted temporary authorization this press release stated that there were no safety concerns identified during the clinical trials of the fiser vaccine however as a precautionary step it was said that this was added to this scheme to provide financial assistance in the extremely rare circumstances where somebody might be severely disabled as a result of taking the coid 19 vaccine now according to official data released under an foi request to the NHS open data portal the following statistics are quite interesting the numbers in terms of people are indeed very low which fits the categorization of extremely rare circumstances however there have been a number of payouts across various different age groups so I'll go through those statistics and then address why it might therefore be that there are two cases coming to the high court against astroica let's look at the statistics first of all in the age bracket of 0 to 17 29 people made a claim of which zero received a payment in the age bracket of 18 to 29 556 people made a claim but only eight people were paid out to the tune of 96,000 in the age bracket of 30 to39 1,171 people made a claim of which 16 people were paid out to the tune of1 1.9 million pounds in the age bracket of 40 to 49 1,499 people made a claim and 37 received a payment in the age bracket of 50 to 59 1,871 people made a claim of whom 44 people received a payout in the age bracket of 60 to 65 a shorter age bracket this time 885 people made a claim uh 24 people received a payout and 66 onwards 1,350 4 people made a claim and 19 people received a payout a grand total payout under this scheme of 17.7 million for severe disabilities or injuries caused by the coid 19 vaccine now this of course is not conspiracy theorist discussion these are actual statistics from NHS open data portal as to those that have been paid out under this scheme so why is it then that there are two cases going against astrazenica to the high court and why are ministers calling for change to say that this scheme is no longer adequate well according to court filings which have recently been revealed the claim suggest that these vaccines were defective in some way and resulting in very serious injuries including speech difficulties reduced cognition memory and processing and accordingly the claimants are seeking damages from astroica it has to be said that in April 2021 the medicines and healthc care products regulatory agency issued an updated information to say that there were possible risks of extremely rare and unlikely to occur specific types of blood clots following the vaccination with the astrazenica jab this regulator also said that the benefits of vaccination continue to outweigh any risks but advised careful consideration given to people who are at higher risk of specific types of blood clots all because of their medical condition so on the one hand we do have this vaccine damage payment scheme under which eligible people will receive a tax-free oneoff payment of £120,000 on the other hand many people are claiming that this is not sufficient for the injuries that they claim to have sustained after taking a vaccine such as the Oxford astrazenica Co 19 vaccine so whil you're at an early stage and this case has obviously not gone to court yet it's not going to be in court for around a year or so it is going to come to the Forefront and the high court is going to have to rule on the evidence before it as to First ly whether or not the severity of these injuries were directly resultant from the coid vaccine and secondly I presume whether the provisions under the vaccine damage payment scheme are already sufficient but either way as you might remember that I've said in previous videos this whole pandemic is likely to result and has resulted in a great number of different cases for many years to come I've experienced many contractual claims whereby parties have either been unwilling or unable to fulfill their obligations under the contract and those cases have gone to court there have been a great deal of employment cases discrimination cases and of course there will be a whole catalog of medical injury claims for many years to come but as always I will keep you updated on any of these if you have specific questions do leave them in the comment section below please do go over to Black Belt Secrets check out my video there where I talk a little bit more about those statistics and just while I was putting this video together uh partly as a bit of a caveat and disclaimer and partly just because I thought it was entirely uncanny somebody sent me an email from the NHS to say that they are a priority for seasonal flu and coid 19 vaccinations having both vaccinations will reduce the risk of serious illness and help to recover more quickly if they catch the flu or Co 19 and then details about how to book it to go book online by going to nhs.uk Booky coid so all of those details are available on the NHS website I know many of you are supportive of the coid vaccines and I know many of you are against them my videos here as the caveat are in no way to provide you medical advice they are in no way to encourage or discourage you from having the coid vaccine this is entirely at your discretion and which should be entirely at the advice and direction of your own person personal medical practitioner so if you see this video or you see any other video about the coid vaccine and any other vaccine for that matter you should not rely on those as a replacement for your medical advice any more than you would rely on my videos as a replacement for legal advice you shouldn't and you should always seek formal advice in each of those situations so please do speak to your own doctor if you have questions if you have concerns and seek their personal views some doctors will give you their personal views as part of their Professional Service to you and with that once more I thank you for watching"

https://www.gbnews.com/watch/how-to-watch",2024-02-13,199379,8965,4360,UC0vn8ISa4LKMunLbzaXLnOQ," last night at GB news's people's Forum with the Prime Minister there was one standout viral moment my name is John W and I'm one of the covid vaccine injured in this country I want you to look into my eyes soon I and I want you to look at the pain the trauma and the regret I have in my eyes we have been left with no help at all why are the people who are in charge who told us all to do the right thing have left us all to ro so there is a vaccine compensation scheme that's in place as you alluded to in the NHS obviously everyone individually will work through their cases it's difficult for me to comment on anyone's individual case I'm sure well John's comments actually got a round of applause from the audience and a massive reaction online so that man is John wat who had I believe three vaccines and developed a heart condition that nearly killed him before I was fit and healthy and used to do boxing H would do CrossFit you know do a lot of weight weight training and you know keep myself in good shape when I had my fight that's my world just toally crumbled yeah I mean he ended up in a wheelchair it it nearly killed it okay he is a voice for the vaccine injured and those who are sadly no longer here to make their voice heard he thinks people have been lied to and betrayed over vaccine safety and he wants the government to take responsibil I'm very pleased to say that he joins us now to tell us his story John thank you very much I know we've spoken a couple of times today and it's taken it out of you especially considering your condition could you just explain to our viewers and listeners exactly what went on with you then in terms of the vaccine please man I'd be here all night if I was to tell you what's happened to me but um just like you said I was bed ring for 14 months in a wheelchair um had numerous conditions um poorts poort orthostatic tardia syndrome H stomach issues NE I've got neurological issues now so people may have seen me moving back and forth in the video and they think you know that unfortunately that's my problem now when I'm when I stand up I feel like I'm dizzy and I'm off balance so if you see me moving about or anything like that unfortunately it's how I cope with things now for me doing that last night it's adrenaline and a heart issue does not go well Patrick and it took a lot out me to do that and drive down there and I seen an opportunity and unfortunately I had to take it Well you certainly did and you were still being demonized okay and earlier on today uh Kevin Maguire is a journalist well he he said this we'll play the clip I think he would but didn't you watch the the bit where some antia went on and on and on that's I think the two of them I think why would K starm subject himself to that yeah John I mean how does that make you feel being called an antivaxer first of all who is that guy I don't know who he is but anyway what is an antivaxer Patrick can somebody tell me can somebody elaborate what an antix us because I I took three of them I took three of these Vine so does that man have any idea how how stupid he sounds at this point in time by saying that it's you know this is the the terminology the language people are using just now saying Ana and all this nonsense to be completely honest with you the narrative is safe and effective in my opinion is no longer because to be honest with you Patrick I ask anyone and I call anybody in this matter someone show me the data to show that this saved one single life I'm asking anybody because since the roll out there has been a massive increase in people dying and one of the reasons I spoke out Patrick is because I'm not going to be a died suddenly statistic and that's the honest answer and these debates and everything need to be spoke about and the vaccine injured and bed need to be heard and I just can't believe that that's where we at you know you call me a antiva honestly I don't want to use the wrong language here you know but yeah okay well look as you know you the government goes well it's it saved many lives Etc but can I get your views on the compensation scheme and where you're at with it because that was one of the things you were really trying to hammer home to the Prime Minister wasn't it because you feel completely left behind and completely forgotten about and that it's been left to you actually really and and other people like you to really Bang the Drum to try to get Justice yeah I mean where I'm with it I've recently just got my doctor's notes it's taking about six months to get those doctor's notes but I know certain people who have you know I speak to all the vaccine injured in the UK there's only been a very very small percentage that have had a payout and I'm talking about people that have had spinal Strokes you know people who got heart conditions now what is 60% look we're no further for we're no further forward wew a year ago we're EXA we're in the exact same position where we were a year ago Patrick and it's it's ridiculous and when I stood there in front of him yesterday and I told him look me in the eye you you know Rich you've never been notified that we exist it's not the first time mate and see to be honest with you this goes to all the politicians because this is a political issue this is this is a message to you all because the long as you leave you B your head in the sand this isn't gone away you want to talk about the post office Scandal this is bigger this is global it's getting bigger and bigger you know it's getting worse and to be honest with you you can't run away from it any longer yes all right and look meanwhile the Department of Health and Social care has previously said more than 144 million covid vaccines have been given in England which has helped the country treat to live with covid and save thousands of lives all vaccines being used in the UK of under gone robust clinical trials and have met the medicines and Health Products regulatory agency strict standards of safety Effectiveness and quality we reached out to the NHS Business Services Authority for comment but are yet to get a response however previously they have said We are continuing to work with Healthcare Providers to assess the remaining records as a priority and to highlight that any delay in receiving medical records impacts the progress of vaccine damage payment scheme claims to the independent medical assessment stage right okay let's get the thoughts of my panels GS presented and qu Ser of MP for sto on Trent North Jonathan gullis an author and broadcaster am Niel Turner Jonathan I've got to ask you you know why is your government so slow to give these people payouts then look I think John gave a very moving account and I'm very sorry to hear the situation that he's found himself in that I was one of those who proudly promoted the vaccine because ultimately we were told by the scientists that this was going to help stopping the spread and ultimately build our resilience to the fact that if we did Catch Co that it would prevent ending up in hospital I think that was entirely the right thing to do and as you heard that 144 million of those have gone out to date but I don't deny the fact that there's huge frustration I think John was right fair in pointing out that with the post office Scandal and the payment scheme that's meant to be happening there that clearly bureaucracy is getting in the way I'm more than happy to sit down with people like John to hear firsthand about why payments aren't happening quick enough because ultimately it's about up to 12,000 that people are entitled to if they're entitled to it they should be getting it I mean people like John are demonized they're called antivaxers which ridiculous because they three of the things for stars he's obviously not an antivaxer yeah um people like him are are demonized and and they will feel I mean shunned from society laughed at scoffed by people who maybe have had a vaccine and are fine and that's not the case for everybody no they they absolutely shouldn't vaccine injured are very real they're very much there but in the same way nothing is risk-free planes crash those people are real that have been involved in that plane accident but we still see flying is safe the vaccine is still safe compensation or insurance I think the problem with the compensation is probably because it's extremely difficult to prove that the vaccine um caused that stroke that came five years later it's probably extremely difficult to prove that and I imagine in the cases where it's cut and dry like in John's case it he will get and he deserves every single penny he gets um but we can't get away from the fact that vaccine hesitancy is far more dangerous than getting the vaccine of course it mil doses there going to few that had but the thing is we were told we were we were told oh if you if you if you get this vaccine it's going to stop transmission uh you're not going to be able to give it to anyone it's going to stop you from getting Co and to be fair that wasn't true well you see that's the thing so I was like Jonathan I was you know an advocate for the vaccine I encourage people to get vaccinated because I thought you'd be protecting others and and yourself and so on and so forth and I do feel a bit duped at that point because I was working helping the government out and everything else like that and the reason I feel duped isn't because I know obvious see terribly and tragically some people died and some people got injured but I feel do because it wasn't true it didn't prevent transmission at all we learned that it doesn't so one of the main premises of me ensuring that others around me were vaccinated was that and seeing as that didn't turn out to be true it kind of It kind of irritated me a little bit but I do admit vaccines are good but you just have to look Patrick these type of topics are the things that the co inquiry should be focusing on and sadly at the start we to focus on personalities when actually I'm far more interested in understanding the science and decisions behind that science okay all right all of you thank you very much and thank you to John as well for coming on there and getting his story out there"

#Cancer #Covid19 #mRNA",2023-02-04,135254,2530,880,UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg, the International Community is marking World Cancer Day cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide but now thanks to a Cutting Edge covered vaccine technology we might just might be closer to stopping cancer Germany's biotech is launching a trial in the United Kingdom of personalized cancer vaccines this Autumn more on the technology in this upcoming report during the covid-19 pandemic vaccines were rolled out within a year faster than most experts believed possible and messenger RNA vaccines were among the first to gain approvals they work by giving the body's immune system a preview of potentially dangerous Invaders a dose contains many copies of a short stretch of precise genetic information the messenger RNA it induces cells to start making proteins that are otherwise only found on a specific pathogen like the proteins that stud the surface of sarsko V2 the virus that causes covid-19 then when the immune system encounters the virus it quickly recognizes the Invader and wipes it out categorically messenger RNA vaccines have proven to be exceptionally effective they have proven to be able to protect people against severe and life-threatening disease and consequently saved millions of lives there are different types of RNA but all of them are coding molecules and that code can be Rewritten that's why many drug developers describe RNA as medicinal software vaccines that use this software have a major advantage over other platforms their codes can be easily altered to also make other proteins found on other disease-causing microbes teaching the immune system how to fight them as well and RNA can encode for proteins found not just in infectious diseases but also for instance in cancers in addition to messenger RNA a range of other rnas play key roles in metabolism and health so they also have potential as medicines cancer application is quite interesting because it is not a vaccine that will prevent cancer but rather it is a therapeutic vaccine it is a vaccine directed custom tailored to the cancer of the of the patient which enhances and directs the immune response to more efficiently clear the tumor around 20 RNA treatments have been approved so far globally and dozens more are in trials in a wide range of diseases and for more on this we are joined Now by Dan Milner the executive director of access to oncology medicine's coalition thank you for joining us sir there's been as we've been hearing high hopes for this mRNA cancer treatment how different just to begin would it be from the Technologies we now use to cure cancer so great question so currently the technologies that we use are largely directed at killing the tumor using you know either General targets which is classical chemotherapy or targeted therapies which we have for example for lung cancer but in those targeted therapies these are still molecules or antibodies that are manufactured and don't use the body's own immune system naturally our bodies can fight cancer many cancers off and we never develop those cancers because our immune systems take care of them so we're moving away from the traditional approach of attacking the cancer with something exogenous to moving to an RNA or an internal approach where we actually use the body's own immune system to attack those Cancers and Destroy them uh Mr Miller we saw of course uh how during the coveted pandemic how quickly vaccines could be ruled out once they were discovered can we hope for similar speed with cancer I I think so but I think there is a major barrier which we did not do not have with infectious disease and that's choosing the target for an individual patient as you have was described in the piece before this the ability to Target an infectious disease is quite easy because it's a foreign molecule it's a foreign piece of material that's not naturally in the human body but when we talk about cancer and personalizing the vaccine what we're talking about is finding some piece of the tumor that's been mutated or changed enough that we can then Target that protein or that molecule with the vaccine and destroy it and so we have to pick through all of the bits of the tumor using sequencing or other very robust processes to find the target pull it out and say yes this is the best one for this patient and then use it and that process at the moment is still rather tedious and difficult and expensive to do for each patient and again our concept is personalized so we want to do it for each patient so that's the bear really have to overcome is rapid Target selection for patients with cancer and just if we put the cost in the individualized treatment challenges Assad for a moment uh how long you think we'll have to wait for a wide scale rollout well I think that you know the agreement that the British government just signed with bioin tech for 10 000 patients by 2030 is very promising there was also the agreement personality signed with moderna using their sequencing platform I think these are signals that this is coming much more quickly than it would have you know we've been working on these vaccines for more than a decade for cancer with very little progress but now that we've sort of gotten through all the hard Parts with covid we've taken the vaccine to scale we've distributed Etc now we can focus in on what is the one last barrier and I think these kinds of Agreements are going to speed this process up I would say that there are four trials reporting this year one on melanoma two on influenza and one on herpes and that melanoma trial will be really crucial to see the results because I think if that is a positive trial we'll start to see more trials on the back end and we'll see more results coming out that are moving this forward for patients okay thanks for that good news to Ann Milner from the medicines Coalition thanks so much

THAT'S DOWN 58 FROM THE WEEK BEFORE AND THE STATE ADDED 83 MORE DEATHS LAST WEEK. THERE'S A NEW CHART MAKING THE ROUNDS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND IT'S EASY TO MISINTERPRET WHAT IT'S TELLING.

PEOPLE NOW OUTNUMBER THOSE AMONG THE UNVACCINATED, BUT AN EXPERT TELLS ME IT LEAVES OUT A VERY IMPORTANT DETAIL. HOW OLD THOSE PEOPLE ARE. LOOK CLOSER AT THIS CHART. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN ONLINE AT SOME POINT AFTER FEBRUARY WEEKLY DEATHS IN VACCINATED. PEOPLE SURPASSED THOSE WHO DIDN'T GET A VACCINE. THAT'S THE BLACK LINE. MOVING OVER THE BLUE ONE. BUT UNC DOCTOR DAVID WEBER SAYS WHAT IT'S MISSING IS AGE MOST. THE CASES WE'RE SEEING NOW OF DEATH. SO MANY OF THEM ARE OLDER PEOPLE MUCH LIKE WE SAW 2 YEARS AGO. THE MAJORITY OF OLDER PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE IF THEIR RISK FOR COVID ARE VACCINATED.

114,j6Sn07fQeYM,"Latest research on vaccine side effects, immune reaction and thrombosis risks | COVID-19 Special","The risk of dying from COVID is much higher than getting a blood clot from a vaccine. But even more concerning is a new report from Oxford University that shows catching the coronavirus puts you at even more risk of a deadly blood clot. Each delay puts more lives at risk, as the coronavirus spreads. It's a balancing act between speed and caution in the fight against COVID-19.

#Vaccine #BloodClots #SideEffects",2021-04-15,2864587,16040,8633,UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg, [Music] vaccines are turning the tide but they're not without risks especially for women they've been rare cases of blood clotting even fatal ones leading some governments to slow down vaccinations we have now today chosen to continue our vaccine rollout without estracinica but each delay puts more lives at risk as the coronavirus spreads it's a balancing act between speed and caution in the fight against covert 19. the risk of dying from covert is much higher than getting a blood clot from a vaccine but even more concerning is a new report from oxford university that shows catching the coronavirus puts you at even more risk of a deadly blood clot in a moment we'll talk to a vaccine scientist at johns hopkins university first this report astrazeneca's covid19 vector vaccine has hardly been out of the headline since last december until now it's been instrumental in the success of the uk's vaccination program but from now on its use there will be restricted to those over 30 years of age there have been worries in the european union about its effectiveness and potential side effects germany initially restricted its use to under 65s now berlin is recommending it purely for over 60s those worries were compounded by several cases of a rare thrombosis type following astrazeneca vaccinations some of them fatal the european medicines agency in amsterdam felt it was time to take a stance on the jab it's director stressing that the benefits of the anti-viral agent far outweigh any risks this vaccine has proven to be highly effective it prevents severe disease and hospitalization and it is saving lives vaccination is extremely important in helping us in the fight against covet 19 and we need to use the vaccines we have to protect us from the devastating effects scientists have been investigating the reports and circumstances of the thrombosis britain's medicines and health care regulator agency says 20 million doses of the astrazeneca vaccine had been administered by the end of march with 79 cases of thrombosis later reported 19 of which were fatal the cause is thought to be a rare immune reaction most of them presented some two weeks after inoculation there are no apparent risk groups such as age or sex several countries like germany france and canada have tightened restrictions on the use of astrazeneca's covid19 vaccine others have suspended it totally waiting for the ema's verdict it has now recommended the continued unrestricted use of the astrazeneca jab regardless of any rare cases of thrombosis so mixed messages there about vaccine safety to unpack this let's bring in corso talacci's a vaccine scientist and infectious disease physician at johns hopkins university in baltimore maryland so let's start with astrazeneca as as we heard that's been given to more than half the adults in britain and is credited with saving tens of thousands of lives i'd gladly take it but authorities here in germany and other countries are blocking its use and offering no timely alternative isn't that in itself putting people's lives in danger so when you have a pandemic that's out of control like we have with the kovic 19 pandemic then any facts then you have to weigh the risks and benefits of any available preventive such as a vaccine or treatment and for the astrazeneca vaccine it has been shown to have saved millions of lives already and so the the potential benefits might outweigh any risks now there are some very serious risks associated with it in very very rare circumstances and i think i think each country but also each individual needs to be able to weigh that risk benefit equation for themselves to decide whether or not they're willing to take that risk for the potential for the protection against the virus when you have a vaccine that's available and that's not being used people can die and that's something that each each government and each person needs to weigh and this isn't only a problem with astrazeneca we've now got johnson johnson six million immunized in the united states and yet it's on hold because six people may have had side effects isn't one in a million an acceptable risk level during times like these so i think that the equation in the united states is a little bit different because we've vaccinated so many of our high-risk individuals already and we have two other approved vaccines that are that are more available than the johnson johnson vaccine even is um and i and i think whereas europe has been gathering information about the astrazeneca vaccine for several weeks we are just starting to learn about the any potential risk associated with the johnson and johnson vaccine and so i think the pause is to gather that information to truly understand what that risk is is it one in a million or is there something higher is it even um associ is the the clots that we saw with with in those unfortunate women associated with it and so i think the um the the pause is appropriate while we gather that information and make a decision about the risk benefits but i think in places where there's the virus is increasing in terms of the transmission and there is no alternative vaccine that it should be seriously considered to use this vaccine while that data is being gathered in the u.s the calculus is a little bit different because we do have two alternative vaccines that don't seem to have that same risk the strange thing though is that and this is what will get many people especially women worried about this is that those people affected by clotting were women in a certain age group and it's been a similar profile for astrazeneca as well so why is it being blocked for everyone or everyone under 60 or so i am that is probably uh due to logistics and programmatic issues but also because while we're gathering that information we need to understand better what that risk is and who truly is at risk while the majority people who have been affected so far seem to be women there were men in europe who have had this unusual rare blood clot happen um there was one man in the trial in the united states who had this unusual blood clot occur and so we need to gather that information and understand the process better and who truly is at risk to be able to maybe target the vaccines at people who are at lower risk but you know it's interesting that you say that because there's a lot of adverse events from vaccines that seem to particularly affect women and especially women in their reproductive years um and that's probably because our hormones are different than in the pre and post-reproductive period and also from men um and that may put us at um that may give us an advantage or a benefit but they may also put us at um some increased risk from the adverse events if you look at the anaphylaxis cases that are happening after the mrna vaccines in the united states the vast majority of them are happening in women as well so there's just there's a difference in the biology between men and women that we're just starting to understand can we go as far as saying that vector vaccines could be the problem in terms of the the clotting that's been seen exactly yeah in terms of adverse events in terms of clotting and or adverse events so each vaccine is going to have its different adverse events each vaccine platform has different kinds of adverse events that happen um and so for the vectored vaccines um especially for astrazeneca potentially for for johnson and johnson as well it looks like clotting may be an increased risk factor um that we didn't see with the mrna vaccines and in the united states over 100 million people have now been vaccinated with one of the two mrna vaccines without the same sort of signal that we've seen with the um with the with the with the antivirus vaccines but this hasn't necessarily been seen with other adenovirus vaccines in the past so we need to better understand what is happening and i think that this pause allows scientists and researchers to really dig deep into each of these cases to better understand what's happening and also to understand the mechanisms a little bit better and it's been fantastic having you on the show explaining to us what all this means kosovo talat of johns hopkins university thank you very much for being on the show today thank you very much take care whatever the risks vaccines are here to stay for now more on that from derek williams will we only have to be vaccinated once or will we need regular booster shots once again the straightforward answer is we don't know yet but a lot of experts do think it's very likely that even fully vaccinated people will need booster shots in the future there are a couple of different reasons why that might become necessary the first involves the fact that the vaccines we're using now have been approved for emergency use because they were safe in the vast majority of people who've gotten them and also extremely effective at least in the short term but we still don't know how long that effectiveness on average will last don't forget it's been under a year since the very first subjects and trials received their first shots but based on what we know about naturally acquired immunity to the disease and what we know about other coronaviruses the general expectation among immunologists appears to be that most vaccinated people will remain largely immune to covet 19 for at least six months and likely retain at least some immunity for a year or two assuming the virus doesn't mutate faster than we think however nearly all the experts i've read now also think that down the line variants of sars cov2 will change enough that we'll have to modify current vaccines at some point so the companies that make them are already in trials looking at possible ways to prolong vaccine-induced immunity and a lot of those trials will involve giving test subjects booster shots of tweaked vaccines you heard it from derrick williams i'm ben fosulin thanks for watching stay safe and see you again soon [Music] you

This is an example of a 20 year old, healthy woman. Who you know, Now, her life is changed forever. This is Claire Bridges. A bubbly cava tender at the grassroots cava house in St Pete. She's sitting in a hospital room right now facing the unthinkable reality that she's going to have to have both legs amputated after getting sick with Covid. Clear was vaccinated. She wasn't getting circulation to her legs. And because of that there was a lot of muscle damage. She was born with a serious heart condition, which led to multiple complications after contracting the virus. He nearly died multiple times, yet still somehow has kept her spirits up . There's just such a positive ray of light, and she's just such a wonderful woman when she woke up in a told her about it. She was very calm and very peaceful and she just looked at them and said, I want bionic legs, and that's kind of the attitude that Claire's held the whole time. Friends and family have raised tens of thousands of dollars through multiple online fundraisers for her medical bills and future expenses. They're also showing love in the form of notes compiled together in a book, letting her know She's not alone. Everybody wants their to know how much she means to them and let her know how loved she is. And how supported she is. Her prognosis is dire. Her best friend and roommate, bright, even if it seems dark in the moment. I think she's going to make the best out of this and have many opportunities to come in her life.

123,g_8N3CczKEg,An update on neurological adverse events from COVID-19 vaccines,"Jennifer Frontera, MD, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, discusses a review of data in the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System) relating to vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. This is a robust, publicly available dataset, reliant on passive reporting by anyone on adverse events (AEs). Limitations of the database include that there is no policing and clean-up of the data. Looking at 314,000 AEs reported over a six-month period following the administration of FDA-approved vaccines, it was found that neurological events were, overall, very uncommon post-vaccination. AEs already identified by CDC as having a relationship with the vaccines, including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and Guillain-Barré syndrome, happened at a higher frequency than expected in the baseline population. Seizures were also shown to occur more frequently following certain vaccinations. Prof. Frontera reminds us that serious AEs happen in less than one in a million people, with most AEs not exceeding a frequency expected in the general population. This interview took place at the American Academy of Neurology 2022 Congress in Seattle, WA.",2022-07-11,36616,269,0,UC5UlvCrYsS8axWEQ9Kd1sAg, [Music] we took a look at the vares data set which is the vaccine adverse event reporting system it's co-managed by the fda and the cdc and it's just publicly available data so you could go to the cdc website and just download this gigantic data set for you know hundreds of thousands of adverse event reports it's a passive reporting system which means that um you know anybody can put put their reports in so it could be the average person on the street entering an adverse event it could be a nurse it could be a doctor etc and there's nobody policing this site right i mean there's consequences you can't go file a false report it's technically punishable by law um but it's not uh it's it's not uh the data's not re reviewed and cleaned there are certain things that people have to report there's certain adverse events that clinicians must report and industry who has uh you know produced these vaccines is required to report their adverse events into the system also so there's limitations to the system but it's also robust because it has a high number of of patients uh and adverse events reported so we looked at this um there were 314 000 adverse events that we looked at over about a six and a half month period from january 2021 to june mid-june of 2021 so when the vaccines first were rolled out in the united states and we only looked at fda approved vaccines so that would be the you know um mrna vaccines of pfizer and moderna and then the johnson janssen jnj vaccine as the adenovirus vector vaccine that we have that's approved here and so what we found overall is that neurological events are very uncommon post-vaccination the things that had already been identified by the cdc as possible relationships between the vaccine and adverse event namely cerebral sinus thrombosis and guillain-barre syndrome were happened at higher frequency than what you would expect in the baseline population following the jansen vaccination what we also did find was that there was a higher frequency of seizures happening after the jansen or jngi vaccine than what you would normally expect in the population in terms of baseline seizure rates um you know that was novel kind of thing that we reported but if you look at the original trials that led to the approval of the j j vaccine there was a higher risk of seizure in the patients that received the vaccine compared to the placebo group and that sort of did bear out in this kind of you know quaternary type of study or real world study um but overall most serious events happen in less than one in a million people so very very uncommon um and most of them besides the three i mentioned related to the jansen vaccine did not happen at a higher frequency than what you would just generally expect to occur in the population when we looked at you know covet itself the neurological events related to covet itself occur 500 times more often than they after a vaccine for example so you're much higher risk if you get covert of having a neurological event than after a vaccine

But what does the law say and how does an employer decide? ABC 10s Kurt Rivera explains in tonight's cover story at Destiny Christian Church in Rockland, and so on the form. All the scripture references a pastor signs exemption forms, citing religious beliefs as protection from the need for a COVID-19 vaccine for us who choose not. 2. We put our faith in the Lord, but how does that hold up in the workplace? According to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, employers must provide quote reasonable accommodations for workers who have quote sincerely held religious beliefs. It doesn't mean that they have to grant all exemption requests. Michelle Mello is a Stanford law School and health policy professor for the University School of Medicine. She says in the past, employers have granted a quote fairly large birth for religious exemptions. But with Kovid that has changed in this context, there are some distinct challenges because many of the people who are filing religious exemption requests have never refused vaccines before. This is the only vaccine that they object to, and the nature of their objection isn't truly religious. It's more of a personal belief exemption that they're trying to shoehorn into their religious exemption channel, and she says under the law employers are allowed to question the employee about their exemption. That doesn't require that you've tide to a recognized denomination or that you have a letter from your clergyperson It does require that you articulate an argument that is religious in nature and not more generally just about your personal beliefs. And then there's a portion that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says gives the employer the right to deny a religious exemption on what's called undue hardship that's defined as quote more than a de minimis or minimal burden or cost to run an employers business. It could lead to an employee getting fired for certain industries. There isn't a reasonable accommodation in the employee is going to be faced with a hard choice. And health care is certainly one of those industries. Education is probably another where you know remote work is not really feasible and some of the other accommodations that the employer might think about just aren't going to do the trick in terms of reassuring everyone that they can operate a safe workplace. San Joaquin County Public health officer Dr Maggie Park says, quote, the California Department of Public Health guidelines stress religious exemptions should be based on sincerely held religious beliefs. San Joaquin County Public Health Services continues to reach out to our faith based. Organizations to help answer questions about the COVID-19 vaccine and making the shots readily available to the community and the Federal Labor Code also allows an employer to grant a different religious accommodation than what the employee is asking for if it poses undue hardship to the business."

129,2Ruq3o7iZho,Doctor Addresses Your COVID Vaccine Concerns | Pregnancy? Infertility? Miscarriage?,"Today we're reviewing updates regarding safety and recommendations about the COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy. If you missed my last video on COVID-19 infection in pregnancy, you may not know that pregnant people are at significantly higher risk of pregnancy complications, ICU admission, and death when infected with COVID-19 and that the delta variant is proving even worse. Vaccination is safe and effective for drastically lowering the risk of getting COVID-19 and for reducing these risks even if you have a breakthrough infection. 

This update answers the following questions & is up-to-date as of 8/31/21:

00:55 Is vaccination SAFE in pregnancy?
01:42 Is vaccination EFFECTIVE in pregnancy?
01:56 Does it cause MISCARRIAGE or STILLBIRTH?
03:24 Does it cause INFERTILITY?
07:12 What about the ""unknown long-term effects?""
09:21 Do antibodies transfer through the placenta or breastmilk?

update on COVID vaccination as it relates to pregnancy and fertility. I recently made an
update video on COVID-19 and its effects in pregnancy, If you'd like to check that out I will link it in the iCard, or in the description box below. This information is up to
date to the best of my ability as of the day of filming, which is August 31st, 2021. In this video we're covering are COVID-19 vaccination
safe in pregnancy? Do the COVID-19 vaccinations
cause infertility? Does COVID-19 vaccination lead your body to attack placentas? Aren't you concerned about
the long-term effects of the vaccine? And whether antibodies are transferred through the placenta and
through the breast milk to the baby. If you're new here and you'd like to subscribe, we would love to have you. I talk about all things, periods, pregnancy, period
products, gynecology, and everything in between. Hit that subscribe button, turn on notifications so
you never miss an upload. I promise you'll leave with
things to tell your friends. (energetic music) Are COVID-19 vaccination
safe in pregnancy? We now have sufficient data to say that COVID-19 vaccinations are safe to be given during pregnancy. This means the outcomes
and people who are pregnant and not vaccinated, are similar to people who are pregnant and they get vaccinated. And people who are pregnant and get vaccinated have better outcomes if they contract COVID-19
during the pregnancy, than people who get
COVID-19 during pregnancy and are not vaccinated. Please, please, please get vaccinated, even if you are pregnant. The recommendation to get
vaccinated during pregnancy, if you have not already been vaccinated, is not just coming from me. This is from every major
medical organization and expert that is tasked with taking care of people who are pregnant, or who have recently had a baby. Please, please, please consider this, and if you have any questions bring them up with your doctor or midwife. Does the COVID-19 vaccination
even work in pregnant people? Yes, we have very good data now to indicate that COVID-19
vaccination is not only safe, but also effective if you are getting it during pregnancy. It does decrease the risk
of COVID-19 infection. Does COVID-19 vaccination cause
miscarriage or stillbirth? There is absolutely zero evidence to indicate there's an association here. I know this is one of the
things that goes around on the internet as disinformation,
and it is not true. JAMA recently released
a review of V-safe data that indicated that these risk rates fall within the expected range
for the baseline population, and are not increased in
people who are vaccinated. In fact, the rate of pregnancy loss in the largest data review that we have on people who are vaccinated for COVID-19 during pregnancy, indicates that their pregnancy loss rates rank at the lower side
of the range that we see in people in the general
population for pregnancy loss. Based on this data we can say there does not appear
to be any increased risk in miscarriage, stillbirth,
pregnancy complications, growth restriction, congenital anomalies, or neonatal death or complications in people who were vaccinated
for COVID-19 during pregnancy. As always, I've linked these sources
in the description box below if you'd like to check out the data. I will, once again, here repeat. Many of these things are
significantly increased in people who have COVID-19, especially severe
COVID-19 during pregnancy. The vaccine reduces the risk
of COVID-19 in pregnancy, as well as severe infection in pregnancy, and thus reduces your risk if
you are to contract COVID-19, even if you have a breakthrough infection. Please, please, please understand that this can be very dangerous
and devastating at baseline, but especially if you are pregnant. Does COVID-19 vaccination
cause infertility? This is another one that
is spread over and over as misinformation on the internet. Why? Because it's effective
and it scares people. So, what do we know? Earlier this year I did a video about where this idea originated and why it was biologically
completely implausible. The idea that these two
proteins are so similar that your antibodies could
mount an immune response is a bit of a extremist claim. They do have some similarities, a lot of viruses have similarities. They would need to be extremely similar, and we're just not finding that when you actually look
at the genetic sequencing of the spike protein and
the syncytin-1 protein that they're talking about. I also discussed in that video that the person who is
spreading the information has no expertise in pregnancy or birth, and has no understanding of
basic pregnancy physiology based on the fact that they presumed that COVID-19 antibodies
would attack the placenta and that this would cause infertility. I probably have a very large
viewership right now going, ""That doesn't make any sense because if it attacks the placenta, that wouldn't cause infertility it would cause pregnancy loss."" And you're right. Why? The placenta is not even functioning until nine weeks into the pregnancy, so if this theory was true, it's not, it would actually cause
miscarriage not infertility. But there is no evidence
that COVID-19 vaccination causes either of those. Despite the lack of biologic plausibility we studied it anyway, and this study revealed that if you compared people
going through IVF treatments and having an embryo transfer, and you looked at a group of
people with no antibodies, natural antibodies from a
previous COVID infection, and antibodies from a vaccination, there were no difference
in pregnancy rates across these three groups. Meaning, neither COVID
infection in the past nor vaccination in the past, decreases your chances of
pregnancy in the future. Additionally, we also can review the data
from the original studies on the vaccination, the number of unplanned
pregnancies did not differ between the patients who
had received the placebo and the patients who had
received the COVID vaccine. There was no difference. If these vaccinations
were affecting fertility you would expect to see a far lower number of accidental pregnancies, and a far lower number of
pregnancies in the IVF study in the people who had been vaccinated. So, we've established that theory has no biologic plausibility, no data, and sufficient data to say it is nonsense. Of course, once this
person was proven wrong by my biologic possibility
information in the original video several months ago, and now with hard data, they decided that they would
change their tune and say, ""Well, it may not cause infertility but COVID vaccine antibodies definitely cause placental attack, which could lead to
pregnancy complications and miscarriage."" Fortunately, we expected this, people who spread misinformation
when they're proven wrong they switch and they spread
it in a different way, especially if the campaign
was effective the first time. So, we studied this and
even almost before it could come out of this person's
mouth, we proved it wrong. Now we have a study that looks specifically at
the histology of placentas and compares placentas from
people who were vaccinated to people who were unvaccinated
at the time of delivery. And what that study found, based on four histological
markers of placental damage, is that there was no difference between histological
indicators of placental damage in the group which was vaccinated and the group which was not. Interestingly, there was actually an
increased risk of inflammation in the placentas which came
from unvaccinated people. However, the relevance of
that information at this point is completely unclear, so we're not going to
talk about it at length. As I said earlier, we've
already figured out that based on the data we have there is also no increased
risk of miscarriage or pregnancy loss, based on a huge review of the
currently given vaccinations in people who get the
vaccine while pregnant. All of these studies are linked
in the description box below if you would like to review them. What do I have to say
to the people who say, ""We don't know the long-term
effects of the vaccination. You can't say this until
we have three years of data or five years of data.""? This is arbitrary. You can't just come up with
an arbitrary amount of time for long-term complications. We need to look at this from
a historical perspective, as well as an absolute and
relative risk perspective. Never in the history of vaccinations has there been a vaccine which was safe and effective early on, and then three years later we found a random severe side effect that just suddenly popped up, MRNA, specifically, is what
people seem to be worried about. MRNA is degraded in your
body within hours to days, and certainly is gone
within a couple of weeks. And all that remains is
your body's response, meaning antibodies to
protect you against COVID-19. Vaccine side effects are known to occur mostly in the first few days but maybe up to a couple of months after you get the vaccine. So, no, we do not have to wait
three years or five years, or some other arbitrary number that someone who has no idea
what they're talking about comes up with, to decide that COVID-19 vaccinations do not cause infertility. We have the data, we have historical precedence for this. And even if we didn't, I think it is extremely
important to look at this from a relative and
absolute risk standpoint. In the short-term COVID-19 is dangerous, it can cause extreme illness and death in higher amounts, by far, than any vaccine side
effects that we are seeing. In the short term vaccines are known to be
both safe and effective at preventing these problems. In the long-term we know that a history of COVID infection can cause major issues, we also know that historically many viruses have complications which go on long-term or
pop up later on in life. Vaccinations have never done that, and there is absolutely no data to indicate that that will be different with this vaccination. When you are weighing the
relative risk and benefit for somebody who is either
wanting to be pregnant, currently pregnant,
might ever be pregnant, or even doesn't even wanna get pregnant but just is concerned about the things that people are saying, the vaccine outweighs
the virus by magnitudes as far as safety goes. Please, please, please protect yourself and protect your fertility by staying alive and getting vaccinated. Are antibodies transferred to the baby through breast milk or the placenta? We now have really good data to say that, yes, antibodies do go through
the placenta to the baby and through breast milk to the baby. As far as how much protection
this actually provides, we aren't sure yet. Step one is figuring out if it happens, which we know it does. Step two is figuring out what the level is that is needed for protection, and if this antibody transfer actually conveys that
amount and protects the baby after birth, either through transfer
through the placenta or breastfeeding. We are working on that. Step three is figuring out
how long this protection lasts and the optimum time for a
baby or child to be vaccinated, and that's something that
we're working on as well. I do think it is incredibly encouraging that we are seeing the
antibodies transferred through the placenta and
through the breast milk to the baby. I hope that you learned something today. If you did, please leave a like, send this to a friend, give a comment, anything to help it get out to more people and combat the misinformation
that we are seeing everywhere on the internet. Thank you for being here today. If you're new and you'd like to subscribe, we'd love to have, you

publication so one Z that I'm going to be reporting on in terms of presenting development of these unusual antibodies postm vaccination only and uh before I give you a quick summary because I'm gonna start the with video with the summary first let me introduce myself my name is Dr Mich rashik of marog genomics and I've been for any of you who have been following me obviously you would know that I'm following the IGG for development story religiously I've been presenting every single Paper I I've been able to find on this topic so far and as I mentioned this is now the 10th one and this quick summary the and this is the first paper um that was the first paper I came across and that presented information post four mRNA vaccinations so two boosters now there's I can tell you there's one more paper that I'll be presenting on in another video that claims they thought they were the first ones but this is the first one I came across so I'm filming on it first but there's at least one more video coming up and uh basically the summary is is that these ig4 bodies remain elevated as individuals continue to be boosted with with the MRNA vaccines this paper also showed is now the third paper to show that people who are nonvaccinated but who had covid-19 so they were infected by the virus they do not present these antibodies at all and what's also very neat about this paper that the authors because of the amount of data they were able to have they were able to also were the first ones to make a statement that they don't believe that formation of these antibodies leads to increases the likelihood of breakthrough infection so the the authors did not think that these antibodies can provoke those who have them of being more likely to be infected so that's very positive news obviously behind me you see this cool waterfall never climbed it I don't think but behind it behind the waterfall is a big lake and behind the lake is a giant Glacier that leads to icefield I tried to film there before but it was too windy and I decided to stop filming in glaciers and Glaciers areas that are so windy I have couple videos you can check out what I mean when it comes to windiness factor and a couple videos on around glaciers that are non- windy so check those out if you're interested what glaciers look like up close I suppose and uh but hopefully I'll I'll be able to get up there one day and film when it's non windy not today because the the party we're with is not not up to the task obviously I don't mean myself huh wink wink you can't see the wink but there was a wink all right let's continue with with the with the science uh and uh what's also neat about this paper is that this is second one that had a very large group of people they they studed about 370 individuals and by the way this paper is from Japan so we're seeing we're seeing now this documented all over the world basically so basically the the take message is that if you are mRNA vaccinated and unless there's some other incidents taking place it appears that everyone seems to be developing this unusual IGG for antibodies so basically what did they do is they collected the blood samples of these individuals after second third fourth vaccination and they a one month after three months after and approximately six months after third and fourth vaccination so then you they had a very nice time spread that allowed them to study this and they looked for all IGG sub types so that's one two three and four and and basically we're going to focus on on number four and you can see basically and what's really cool is that they they measured the serotype um seropositivity which basically means how many of those individuals that they were testing were were showing up with these ig4 antibodies and uh what's interesting that prior to vaccine they they were able to detect ig4 antibodies and about 4% of the population they did not of the cohort that they studied they did not mention whether any of the those individuals were um Afflicted with igg4 related disease there's bunch of skiers behind me coming coming right up uh so uh but these are very low levels they just simply this is what the test allowed them to detect now they were able to show that very soon after second second shot so after two shots of the MRNA vaccines um and I believe that the primary vaccines were were fiser and boosters were either fizer or or modna and uh basically let's go for a little walk and basically after this one month after the second shot there was already starting an increase in ig4 antibodies so about 6 point almost 7% of the population were now showing ig4 antibodies this increased to about 50% of the population that they were studying with were showing ig4 antibodies after the second shot 6 months later so it only takes two mRNA shots for these igg4 antibodies to start showing up and they just simply take time and then after third shot after one month after third shot pretty much everyone is showing it 97 to 98% of the population is showing it and that remains elevated at around these levels uh after third and fourth shot as well so that's the data so you can see the trend as the antibodies are slowly Rising after the second shot and after the third shot they they're slowly decrease but it's still highly increase and then that's that gets reboosted with the fourth shot and then they remain elevated they don't have long-term data after four shots as well and this brings me to another paper because this this uh increase post after one month after the second shot that has actually been reported before but I've never actually reported myself so there was one paper from 2021 that actually looked at the um IG subp types and they reported on all four subp types as well except it was a very short duration study it was only five weeks long and from the PRI the first shot to um to when they were measuring it and so basically they had data only two weeks after the second mRNA shot I believe it was also fiser uh and even after two weeks that paper reported a small increase in igg4 levels in their study group so I never reported it uh until now because here now we have a second paper showing that this increase in igg4 antibodies can be can happen really quick maybe not in many people but it can happen immediately post second shot and then increases much more rapidly after third shot so now this is how we make get now 10 papers in total reporting on IGG IG for increased postm vaccines uh if you're following my table because I'm obviously showing you table of how I'm stacking evidence based on published information in previous video I have I probably had eight Publications this how we're going to get to 10 today all right so so that's the take on message now they uh they did some U bit of extra work as well and it's that they presented in supplementary information that I found really interesting as well so the first one which I thought was very important is that and the good news in a way is that they took the 10 people who show the largest increase in their antibodies in their igg4 antibodies and they measured they measured all of their ig4 antibodies by the way I should have mentioned this early on all of these ig4 antibodies that that we're talking about thus far is against the spike protein right the basically the antigen with which uh that you're presenting with the vaccine with the MRNA vaccine obviously the MRNA vaccine brings the genetic information to our cells to produce the spike protein which is the antigen that stimulates our immune system right so so everything we've been talking about they've been looking at at um igg4 antibodies against the spike protein but in these 10 individuals they looked at total igg4 antibodies against anything so they didn't care about what these antib ig4 antibodies Target they just wanted to measure what they are and their conclusion is that there there is no overall increase in igg4 I don't know statistically there might not be although I thought when they presented the data there is might be might be some statistical difference between the second and third shot and you can see somewhat of a trend going upwards but most of it indeed is can remain flat I find it curious as to uh wh why does it happen when you have increase against in igg4 antibodies against say spike protein but the total amounts remain the same so what else does it decrease against in your body H it would be interesting to know but why is this a good news is the reason why this is good news is because I've been telling you in previous videos that one of some of the worries against um about this particular event this increase in ig4 antibodies is in relation to what it might do in terms of surveillance against cancer and the reason why is because ig4 antibodies prevent whatever they might prevent proper recognition of cancer development by igg1 antibodies so it's the change in ratio between ig4 and igg1 that we need to worry about whether this might actually have an effect or not so um if the ig4 levels remain constant that's good because that means we would not be potentially affecting this ratio between igg1 and igg4 and the reason why we don't want to affect that ratio is because the higher the the ratio between ig4 and ig1 the greater the risk that we might be affecting proper cancer recognition by igg1 cells okay oh I wonder if that's St Nick behind me that might be um there is a St Nicholas Mountain my name's sake it's crooked so I'm I'm not sure if that's the one right behind me but I hope so and uh because it's cool mountain and um so that's basically really good news uh but we would need to see it corroborated with additional studies but I really like that result because obviously we don't want to encounter problems uh I haven't presented um this information on cancer in detail we've produced a paper with number of scientists but we're just waiting for for an online uh availability before I make a video so stay tuned uh but that's that's the reason why why uh I was excited about this result they also measured the levels of these igg4 antibodies post uh vaccination and the data they showed that they showed that um these levels are extremely small after um I think it was second shot and then you see an increase in the igg4 levels after third and fourth shot and it only goes up to several perent under 10% total of igg4 of all of the subtypes now that seems low in comparison to some of the other studies I've been addressing and mentioning because I even told you in the past that these I4 antibodies targeting Spike protein can even become the main antibod targeting Spike protein versus in this data that's not the case that I'm talking about today that's not the case it didn't even reach 10% of total value after fourth vaccination so what is going on and the reason why is because in their study they were only targeting receptor binding binding domain of the spike protein so that's the very tip of the spike protein if you look at the structure of the spike protein is on the very top and that that tip is involved in interacting with the a receptor on our human cells and that's how virus gains entry into our cells now in order to DET determine proper amounts they should have also looked at igg4 antibodies against Spike spike protein itself anywhere so not just receptor binding domain itself why is that because why is that in a previous video related to this topic on igg4 antibodies I told you that what might what might be happening is that we could be experiencing um uh immune refocusing steric immune refocusing there is some evidence showing that indeed what's happening over time with these mRNA vaccines what we are achieving is we are switching what are what the antibodies are targeting so the antibodies are no longer targeting a receptor binding domain but they could be targeting other areas of the spike protein and we presented evidence against that so this might be a reason why they're showing low amounts of igg4 antibodies against receptor binding domain because as these ig4 antibodies are being formed with each vaccination they might be switched to Target other areas of the spike protein from so that means receptor binding domain would be like a dominant Target and it goes to less dominant targets meaning other areas of the spike protein so future studies ideally should be looking at both receptor binding domain of the spike protein as well as all other areas of the spike protein as well so that might explain why in this particular study these levels are lower than what I've discussed be before now they also did other interesting uh work as well in their supplementary information and uh as I mentioned they had 370 individuals approximately 126 of those were um those who had fourth shots of mRNA vaccine and then the boosters so third and fourth shot were either as I mentioned fiser or modna they didn't separate them unfortunately which would be very valuable because there is some um evidence suggesting that Monna might be causing greater increase in IG for antibody development than fiser because of the increased amount of antigen as a as in comparison to fizer so that would be another very valuable way of future studies if scientists were separating Mna from fiser so we can we can break this down but they had um out of uh those individuals who had fourth shots 26 got breakthrough infections basically they were infected with the virus so they had 101 in 101 individuals in total who uh who had four shots and didn't have any infections and that basically allow them to see what happened in terms of infections breakthrough infections on the effect of these igg4 antibodies and remember I reported previously that breakthrough infections in those who had the MRNA vaccine the Breakthrough infection meaning if you get infected by the virus the virus itself acts as an as if it was another vaccine booster for the production of these igg4 antibodies and they were able to show that data as well they were they were separating um that information in terms of um those who got infected between one and three months after third shot or fourth shot and those who got infected between three and six months after either third or fourth shot and clearly if individuals got infected there was additional rise in those igg4 antibod development so this continues to corroborate that data but because they had all of that information what they were able to do is to look at the statistical information whether whether igg4 antibodies might increase the likelihood of breakthrough infection and the answer was no so that's also very positive news from from from this data and uh basically that's the summary of this particular paper very very interesting very very large data so now we have lots and lots of information showing the R4 antibodies looks like very real deal because basically it looks that if you are mRNA vaccinated and you were not infected first or you were not treated with with anti immunosuppressive drugs I should say then very likely you will have igg4 antibodies produced because of the MRNA vaccine so the evident they now with 10 papers the evidence is quite strong and there likely be more but we still don't know what the clinical consequences of that and the authors did mention listen we need to be observing this uh and they also mention not sure whether we we should be now continuing with boosting until we understand this phenomenal phenomenon better than than what we understand right now they they why is it happening they mentioned that very likely the belief it's because of the continuous presentation of antigen in this case the spike protein to the B cells in the germinal centers so germinal centers are these areas within within your lymphatic system where where the antigen is basically presented to the immune system to the to B cells and determines what what type of antibodies these B cells will be producing in the future and they did mention that it has been observed before that postv and Mna vaccination these germinal centers can persist for a long time up to six months so they think they're saying like look this is probably what's happening you have these germinal centers um an antigen presentation for very long time longer time than anyone anticipated and this is why you might have this might Force the immune system towards that class switch from ig1 all the way to ig4 so that's what they're they're suspecting and we still have to understand what the clinical consequences of that or we don't know this at this point all right I'm going to wrap it up here I hope you enjoy the the spot and uh again thank you for all your support please like please share this how we grow please leave a comment as well YouTube also likes this what you think uh and so on we try to answer a lot of these comments but we can't get to all of them no way it's impossible and um and um thank you for please also check out our patreon account as well we we put other content in there as well and um most importantly please go Outdoors as often uh as much as you can the reason wise because that's one of the ways you can also protect your health via

Information Regarding COVID-19 Vaccine - Everything you need to know about Covaxin and Covishield

Is it mandatory to take the vaccine?
Vaccination for COVID-19 is voluntary. However, it is advisable to receive the complete schedule of COVID-19 vaccine for protecting one-self against this disease and also to limit the spread of this disease to the close contacts including family members, friends, relatives and co-workers.

Will the vaccine be safe as it is being tested and introduced in a short span of time?
Vaccines will be introduced in the country only after the regulatory bodies clear it based on its safety and efficacy.

Is it necessary for a COVID recovered person to take the vaccine?
Yes, it is advisable to receive complete schedule of COVID vaccine irrespective of past history of infection with COVID-19. This will help in developing a strong immune response against the disease.

Out of the multiple vaccines available, how is one or more vaccine chosen for administration?
The safety and efficacy data from clinical trials of vaccine candidates are examined by Drug regulator of our country before granting the license for the same. Hence, all the COVID-19 vaccines that receive license will have comparable safety and efficacy. However, it must be ensured that the entire schedule of vaccination is completed by only one type of vaccine as different COVID-19 vaccines are not interchangeable.

Will the vaccine introduced in India be as effective as the ones introduced in other countries?
Yes. The COVID-19 vaccine introduced in India will be as effective as any vaccine developed by other countries. Various phases of vaccine trials are undertaken to ensure its safety and efficacy.

If one is taking medicines for illnesses like Cancer, Diabetes, Hypertension etc, can s/he take the COVID-19 vaccine?
Yes. Persons with one or more of these comorbid conditions are considered high risk category. They need to get COVID-19 vaccination.

What about the possible side-effects from COVID-19 vaccine?
COVID vaccine will be introduced only when the safety is proven. As is true for other vaccines, the common side effects in some individuals could be mild fever, pain, etc. at the site of injection. States have been asked to start making arrangements to deal with any Covid-19 vaccine-related side-effects as one of the measures towards safe vaccine delivery among masses.

#FOX2Detroit #News #Detroit #MetroDetroit #Michigan",2023-01-28,6017,45,88,UCOGa-48fFt4cW0UnW5WSdRg," choose Ingrid Kelley catches up with the doctor to separate fact from fiction. Census released the Covid vaccine and booster in the medical community and the U. S government as safe and effective. But despite the voice of confidence from the experts, there are those who continue to reject the vaccine and booster shots. I am definitely against it. Me and my family because there's just too many complications with it. They want us to take a vaccine they made in less than three weeks. No it's saying the shots of causing strokes took my third booster side lost my taste and smell. So what's the benefits of me? Keep taking more sets? Cardiologists at core? Well East, formerly Beaumont say they hear the concerns. I believe it's coming from the fact that we know that the vaccination in the booster, especially the Moderna is associated With a very small but real risk of my own card itis, also known as inflammation of wall that can cause heart failure and even cause someone to die. Therefore we have to review the risks of that vaccination. So what I'm hearing from you is that there is a real possible connection between Cardiac arrest and the covid vaccine. Is that correct? Well what I would say is there is a definite association. But doctors still question if other factors could be involved, So could it be from the covid vaccine itself, causing that risk of myocarditis and therefore sudden cardiac arrest? Could it be from the coronavirus? Itself which caused long term effects, or could it be the lack of medical care patients received during the lockdown when people had to stay home? We don't have the full story Let It Rip in the next few months, we will have a better understanding as long as that data is published, So should you get the vaccine and booster shot at this point? I think it's irresponsible to say Don't get it. I think it's irresponsible to say definitely get it Its seek information about the vaccine. Through an Internet search or social media. Talk to your doctor, Talk to your family , and then come up with the night an idea or a treatment plan that works for you and sell field. Ingrid Kelley Fox two news.

#vivekramaswamy #GOP #Covid",2023-09-18,487147,4215,2052,UCeY0bbntWzzVIaj2z3QigXg, so Vivek said that if he knows now if you knew now if you knew then what he knows now about the covid-19 vaccine that he would not have taken the two the two shots that he took if you knew then what you knew now would you take covid-19 vaccine that's a great question and I think the most important thing for me as a surgeon when I think about recommending things to my patients is their autonomy my think of my responsibility is telling them this is what I think are the benefits this is what we know about this this this whatever we're about recommending this is what I think are the benefits and these are what we know are there is this is what we don't know and for every person that's a different decision so for my young healthy husband that's a different decision than for me when I am taking care of patients who are cancer survivors and they trust me to you know be in their Airway every day it's a very different discussion and I think giving people that autonomy is the most important part gotcha so you you would basically I I'm an airway surgeon I so I at that time I think we I had to do what I had to do awesome um you immigrated here to the U.S when you were two four four uh very cool um Vivek has recently said that he would Deport the children and of undocumented uh immigrants who were born in the U.S that's something that you agree with as well I think he has a legal theory that what is defined as a citizen is different when you are born in this country of American citizens or legal immigrants as opposed to a different you know for people who are not undocumented and he had he has his arguments and I leave you to you know talk to him about that but I think there is no one who understands that our immigration system is broken better than someone who has gone through that process and it's definitely things need to be changed and I think he has some bold ideas to do that gotcha um do you think that I guess I kind of want to know like how you feel sorry the tractor pull reverse the dangers of the fair yeah um so like I just I'm just trying to understand what where's where some of the discrepancies are between what he believes and what what you believe so like for example the war in Ukraine do you think that there's a chance that uh the reason we're involved is because of Hunter Biden's barisma deal or like how do you interpret the award I mean to be fair I I have not thought as deeply as Vivek does about these topics but I do know that we as America we Vivek and I both think very deeply and pray for the people of Ukraine we think we they are suffering and they are going through something terrible and I think a fake is the only person who has a vision for how they can actually end this war and the suffering while maintaining Ukrainian autonomy and no other candidate has actually brought up any Vision so I I think we agree on a lot of the important things you know whether or not I agree with his rapping that's that those are those are kind of the level of our disagreements for the most part but about the important things we're we're on the same page thanks for watching stay updated about breaking news and top stories on the NBC News app or follow us on social media

145,o2HLkFi4Qtw,5 things NOT TO DO after getting the COVID-19 vaccine,"COVID-19 vaccines are opening up to more people across the Carolinas, but experts say there are a few things we shouldn't do after getting the shot. 

1. Getting a tattoo or piercing. The CDC says there's a slight chance this could trigger an immune response on top of the vaccine. Your best bet it to wait a few days.

2. Don't book other vaccines. Scientists say there's just not enough evidence right now to know how the vaccines interact with others in a short period of time. They recommend waiting at least two weeks before getting any other vaccination.

3. Don't push yourself too hard exercising. If you feel bad after getting your shot, take the day off instead. Forcing yourself to workout might only make you feel even worse. 

4. Hydrate. All that water you drink helps your body process the immune response. Plus, if you do get a fever, drinking water will help your body fight it. 

5. Don't lose your vaccine card. We don't know exactly where or when we'll need it just yet, but whatever you do, keep your vaccine card in a safe place. #WakeUpCLT #COVID19 #Vaccine",2021-04-01,1630807,9112,1536,UC-RxXi2Xws6Uk22vp-sLbGA," HAPPENING HAPPENING ACROSS HAPPENING ACROSS THE HAPPENING ACROSS THE CAROLINAS HAPPENING ACROSS THE CAROLINAS

148,It7VNzhAqOs,Blood Clots after COVID Vaccine,"There is new research on COVID vaccine and how blood clots form. It is important to clarify the mechanism and so a great deal of research is gone into elucidating the cause. I review this in the video. What is clear is that the COVID vaccine needs to get into the bloodstream in order for this to occur. The research article is listed below.

#MedicinewithDrMoran",2021-12-11,977060,20521,3649,UCretxef46N9r-v0FOlHWIVA," Hello, welcome to my channel Medicine with 
Dr. Moran. I'm Dr. Keith Moran. Today I want   to talk about additional research in regards to 
vaccine-induced thrombosis which has been well   documented with the adenoviral vector vaccines in 
other words the AstraZeneca and J & J. It's highly   likely to be present in the other adenoviral 
vector vaccine such as the Russian vaccine   Sputnik. I have previously talked about the 
possible pathophysiology of how these adenovirus   vector vaccines lead to blood clots and ultimately 
low platelets. Now low platelets occur through a   mechanism where the platelets get consumed in 
the clot so when we measure the platelet values   they're quite low. Now this condition similar 
to what we call heparin-induced blood clots   and low platelets. Heparin is a blood thinner 
that we use to prevent and treat blood clots.   Now this week some new additional information on 
the pathophysiology of vaccine-induced blood clots   was reported in the journal of Science Advances. 
There's a link to the research paper in the   description below. Now understanding how the 
mechanism that is how these vaccines induce   blood clots which can be fatal is important not 
just to prevent the outcome but also to treat it.   We also need to understand this because 
we use adenovirus viral vectors to deliver   treatments. Now just a quick recap on this 
particular condition the frequency is on the   order of one in thirty thousand to about one 
in a hundred thousand. A review at the end   of July in the journal Blood reviewed the 
United Kingdom experience with AstraZeneca   and the U.S. experience with J & J up to 
sometime in July. As you can see on the slide   there are a number of cases of cerebral vein 
thrombosis. This is an unusual kind of blood   clot that we can see involving the veins of 
the brain and these veins drain the brain   and of course if you get blood clots in there 
it will not drain the brain properly. It's an   unusual diagnosis I must say I've only managed a 
couple of people with this in my 30-year career.   Blood clots also were being found in other 
areas which were not usual including the   abdominal blood vessels. The majority of the 
blood clots were seen after the first dose.   18% of people in the Uk group died and 11% in the 
U.S. group so pretty significant mortality. Now   previous studies which I've reported on previously 
highlight the role of platelet factor 4 which we   know is what happens with this heparin-induced 
blood clotting. It can occur in veins as well as   arteries just like the vaccine-induced condition 
I'm talking about. Here's the research paper. The   researchers studied three different adenovirus 
vectors which have been deployed as vaccination   vectors in the different Sars Cov2 vaccines. This 
model of the AstraZeneca viral vector they had to   determine. They had to elucidate where there might 
be binding with platelet factor four and how it   actually would bind and whether it was plausible. 
They ultimately showed that the adenovirus vector   combined with platelet factor four via an 
electrostatic interaction something like   something electrically positive joining was simply 
electrically negative. In other words opposites   attracting. They showed that a stable complex gets 
formed with the vector and platelet factor four.   Now platelet factor four is only present in the 
bloodstream so this kind of interaction does not   occur in muscle cells where the vaccine might 
be. They did look at a common medication called   Fondaparinux which is an anticoagulant that 
I've used many times for both acute coronary   syndromes such as heart attacks as well as 
blood clots in the leg and the lung and they   found that this medication reduces the number of 
binding events with the adenovirus vector surface   from AstraZeneca and platelet factor four. So it 
ablates this electronegative potential between   there and inhibits the binding suggesting 
that this might be a plausible treatment.   Now their study was performed in test tubes 
on the bench in the laboratory not in humans   but they did show that platelet factor four does 
contact the surface of this adenovirus vector   when allowed to freely move around in simulations. 
Vaccine-induced blood clots typically occur 5 to   24 days after vaccination which is the time frame 
where you're going to get an antibody response.   Now complete elucidation of what truly happens 
has not completely been worked out but this   schematic provides the best evidence that we have 
as to what's happening so far. Now first someone   will get vaccinated and somehow the vector enters 
the bloodstream either by an injection that does   not truly go into the muscle in other words 
it goes into a small blood vessel directly   due to injection technique or more specifically 
lack of aspiration and the needle is actually in   the blood vessel when the injection occurs. If 
there's damage to tiny capillary blood vessels   as the needle is inserted where small amounts 
of the vaccine might be able to gain access to   the bloodstream even though the vaccine might 
be placed correctly into the deltoid muscle   this could be the case as well. Perhaps there's 
another mechanism which I haven't thought of where   some vaccine particles can actually access the 
bloodstream. Then in schematic two as you can see   there is that electrostatic positive and negative 
attraction of platelet factor 4 to the vector   and the complex then gets engulfed by other 
cells because they see it as being foreign.   They send it to one of your lymph nodes which 
then stimulates the b cells in the lymph nodes   to generate anti platelet factor four antibodies 
or antibodies against the whole complex. Now these   antibodies then activate platelets and a number of 
factors are released which causes more platelets   to clump together in more platelet factor four 
ultimately it causes clot formation and thus the   syndrome of vaccine-induced blood clots and low 
platelets. Again the platelets are low because   all of the platelets are bound within the clot and 
they're not freely circulating in the bloodstream.   Now this is important research for many reasons 
as I mentioned earlier. This key feature   is that this happens in the bloodstream and while 
we can't definitively say that this happens due to   vaccination technique it could certainly be. It's 
obviously important when injecting the needle into   the deltoid muscle that you deliver the vaccine 
into the muscle and not into a tiny blood vessel.   As I mentioned previously on this particular 
video this does happen based on surveys of nurses   that have given intramuscular injections 
over the years. Many of them have said   that they have aspirated blood just before they're 
about to inject the intramuscular injection and so   they always check before they inject. Now it would 
be terrible to find out down the road that this is   something to do with side effects that's the lack 
of aspiration when it could have been preventable.   Of course we don't know that that's definitely the 
cause there's lots of vaccinations going on and a   randomized trial would be interesting and could 
definitively answer the question. It wouldn't be   that difficult to do. You would obviously need 
a lot of patience given the low frequency of   the side effects involved but of course we 
are vaccinating a lot of people right now.   I have told my patients who have encouraged 
vaccination to make sure that they ask the   person doing the vaccination to aspirate before 
injection. It's such a small accommodation of only   about three seconds. It makes me think about all 
the requests that my patients often ask me for,   reasonable requests. I think of things like 
medications that they may or may not want before   a procedure or at other times sometimes they have 
requests of getting them positioned in a certain   spot for their endoscopy just before I'm about 
to sedate them they might want an extra pillow   or a pillow between their knees to make sure that 
their back is comfortable while they're asleep for   20 minutes. If their accommodations are reasonable 
and not harmful, I always follow their wishes.   Often it doesn't take any additional time 
but it shows that I care. It shows people   that I'm listening to them and it allows for 
shared decision making which is crucial in   the doctor-patient relationship. It ultimately 
means that they will be happy and so will I.   Asking for someone to aspirate before injecting 
as I did before both of my vaccinations is not   much to ask for even if it's not the usual way 
that the vaccinator might perform their task.   Healthcare providers should always be receptive 
to those that they're delivering care to   being inflexible or emphatic in their beliefs 
and deciding that it's their way or the highway   so to speak that has no place in medicine. Thanks 
for joining me today on Medicine with Dr. Moran.   I'm Dr. Keith Moran. Get healthy and stay healthy."

How many people died from the C.O.V.I.D shot? Do vaccines actually cause autism? Steve Kirsch has looked at the data.",2024-02-23,341409,11637,2584,UCxfBw80sGM6KhT6LKh8ioLw," them just two years later but we should because the people who told them are still effectively in charge here's one it's from 2021 this is CDC director relle winsky telling us informing us that anyone who takes the vax and then somehow manages to get infected but that would never happen but if it did happen that person would not be able to spread the virus to anyone else we promise watch can you if you were to get infection with and vaccinated could you give it to somebody else were you silently able to spread it those data were not covered in the clinical trials but now data have emerged again that have demonstrated that even if you were to get uh infected during um post vaccination that you can't give it to anyone else why hasn't she been charged with a crime well she never will be uh and of course just a few years later it turns out the whole thing was a disaster of world historic proportions books will be written about this at some point when we can tell the truth about it a lot of people were killed or permanently disabled by it how many is the question how many people were hurt by the vax how many people were killed by the vax that was mandatory we just spoke to Brett Weinstein on this show Professor Brett Weinstein he told us he's seen research up to 17 million people across the globe may have died from it watch I was recently at a conference uh in Romania on the covid crisis and so there was a lot of work trying to unpack what we actually understand and I saw a credible estimate of something like 17 million deaths globally from this technology so 17 million deaths from the co vax well when you know when you scale up to billions uh it's not hard to reach a number like that with a technology that's dangerous now to your deeper question I think let's Steelman so just for perspective I mean that's like the death toll of a global war yes absolutely it is this is a a a great tragedy of History so that proportion 17 million globally now that's an estimate and the interesting and most shocking fact actually is that we don't really know because no one seems to be keeping track at least in this country which is amazing considering what our government keeps track of the B Administration knows exactly how many transgender heart surgeons there are how many bisexual Simone airline pilots they keep track of it with nazil likee Precision but how many people were killed or disabled by the co vaac they don't care so they're not keeping track of those numbers so it falls to people who don't work for the US government and one of them is a man called Steve kersch who was a MIT trained inventor by the way a longtime donor to the Democratic party not a lifelong rightwing extremist or anything a businessman but he has now dedicated his time and his ample energy to figuring out exactly what the covid vax did to this country and the world he's the founder of the covid-19 early treatment fund Steve first joins us now Steve thanks so much for coming on thank you Tucker it's great to be here so before um you tell us what you found and you've been working on this it seems to me day and night for a couple of years tell us your background because it's it you don't have a background in public health it it's sort of a weird life trajectory that you've had which I think makes a story more compelling how did you get to where you are now to doing this well I as a young uh kid I in uh I had a summer school probability course uh when I was in high school and and that was just really um gamechanging for me I was uh fascinated by math and just really excelled in math and I went to MIT I got a couple of degrees uh from MIT left MIT started about seven different high-tech companies a couple of billion dollar uh uh couple of them had billion dollar market caps and then what happened is covid essentially closed my business and that we couldn't go into work and so I was looking to uh do whatever I could uh to make a difference so that that uh I could go back to work and everybody else could as well and so I I started looking at early treatments and started the covid-19 early treatment fund raised about $5 million and uh we we funded research on on drugs like fluvoxamine which was featured on 60 Minutes and then um uh there was of course this work on the vaccine in the background and we were all very hopeful that uh the vaccine would be successful yes and so it it it came out and the FDA said that they have tested it and it's um it's totally safe and everybody should get it and uses this new novel technology and of course I'm a technologist so I'm always looking for something that's new better uh technology and uh so they said super safe everybody should get it and I said look even though that uh I knew about early treatments and I knew that the fluvoxamine was effective in reducing Long Haul covid and and if you got it early people didn't seem to uh suffer from from covid even though I had that I said ah why don't I get an extra protection So I myself uh was vaccinated in March of uh 2020 1 and I got two shots of madna and then about a month later I started hearing horror stories from my friends I I heard from one person who had three relatives who were perfectly healthy and all three of them died a week after they got the vaccine and I said to her well I I said that's impossible that's statistically like so unlikely that it could never happen if it was caused by the the vaccine and she said yeah but they're dead and then a week later uh the the our carpet cleaner comes uh at our door and he's wearing a mask and I I give him a hard time I say hey don't you know if you take the vaccine you don't have to wear a mask and he said well I wasn't able to take both shots and I said why not he said well after the first shot two minutes after the first shot I he had a heart attack and he was he spent the night in the hospital and he has never been the same since that time and so that was that was the wakeup call for me when I saw it happening in my own personal Circle because I was believing the whole narrative I was selling the whole narrative until this guy shows up at my door um to clean my carpet saying he had a heart attack two minutes after he got the shot and he's never been the same and his wife had symptoms too so that's what led me to start to look and see somebody's lying to me and I don't think it's my friends and so I started looking at the vars data I looked at all sorts of data I looked at every piece of data I could lay my hands on and it was all the same it was all showing that these shots are causing a level of uh Adverse Events as well as death morbidity and mortality uh beyond anything that's ever been seen before wait can I ask you to can I ask you to pause right there so I mean you're describing pure intellectual inquiry motivated by you know curiosity and concern which is great but you're also doing this in a context and the context is the spring of 2021 where you are not allowed to question the vaccine if you want to remain friends with people if you want to be considered a serious person if you don't want to be trashed on Wikipedia as you have been and so you spend your whole life Gathering accolades going to you know impressive schools making a ton of money being celebrated in the press and you must know on some level cuz you're smart that if you start talking about this stuff all of that is over and you're going to be a thought criminal and people are going to look at you sideways did you know that no I had I had no idea I thought that if I told the truth and I let people know about the facts and the data that I had uncovered that people would basically say oh you're right uh this looks like a big problem we need to stop the shots and I told my wife after you know before I did this I said hey this will be over in like two weeks I mean yeah it the data is so clear that this is going to be done in two weeks and I'm uh we're we're we're still at it after all this time so so tell us tell us what you found and what you have found and what your conclusions are well what I found was all the data was consistent with this vaccine being the most dangerous vaccine of all time I mean there there are more reports on this this vaccine in the VAR system which is the the vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System it's the official system um for reporting Adverse Events for a vaccine it's set up by the US government it's run by the US government and there were more reports for the covid vaccine than for all vaccines in history combined and not only that but we found out later that the this this fer system which they set up to monitor for safety had triggered 770 different safety signals now normally a vacine only will trigger zero safety signals it' be really unusual for a vaccine to trigger any safety signals in fairs especially because the way they Define these safety signals makes it almost impossible for a vaccine to trigger a safety signal but this vaccine triggered 770 770 safety signals so what did these CDC do about it they basically told no one the only reason that we even found out about it is because someone issued a Freedom of Information Act request to the CDC requesting could you show me the output of the analysis of the safety signal analysis you're supposed to do and so they got back a spreadsheet showing 770 safety signals were triggered that is mindblowing that is not a three alarm fire that is a 770 alarm fire these are things like sorry myocarditis these are things like pulmonary embolism these are basically 770 unique symptom types that are triggered in the ve system saying we have a problem here you need to investigate this should have been a complete stopping condition for the CDC the CDC should be warning people hey we got 770 safety signals never seen anything like that before in history maybe we might have made a mistake on this vaccine but they said nothing they didn't even let people know that there had been any safety signals that were triggered and so there's no question that the CDC is a very corrupt organization and that these people who are in charge here are burying all the safety signals they will not engage with you they talk about saying hey we want to stop misinformation but you know the way you stop misinformation you know by the way I agree with them you know misinformation is a problem and misinformation kills the only thing that we disagree on is who is telling that information now I think it's them and they think it's me but inless the two of us get together in a dialogue we're not going to be able to figure that out and they seem to not want to engage in dialogue with anybody that they call a misinformation spreader so we never have resolution of this and in fact it's so easy for them to stop the misinformation instantly all they have to do is invite us to a room I don't care whether it's at the CDC or HHS in a room where we go and we say hey let's query the vssd database which is the vaccine safety data link database let's query the Medicare database and let's um query the Medicaid database let's let's query those databases and see what results we get let's give it give us free access to query the data we don't have to do the querying ourselves you can do the querying you just tell us the results we're not looking for any personally identifiable information just statistics let's go give us free access to the data so we can Surface the truth and if we're wrong we we'll back back off no nothing can't can't get that can't get a dialogue with them they won't give us access to the data but the DAT the data that we do have access to that we've been able to get it all shows that the these vaccines are killing people and they're killing the very people that they were meant to protect it's actually increasing your risk of death me I like on what grounds could they refuse to allow an American citizen access to data that he pays for in the country that he owns a a apparently they they're not required by law to respond they're required to respond to the Freedom of Information Act requests now those Freedom of Information Act requests provide a very narrow level of of data transparency we can only get reports that they've produced we can't the under the the Foya laws you're not allowed to request stuff that they don't already have so you they can run a um a s simple record count and say how many records are you know uh how many people died or what have you but you can't do uh you can't get them to create novel records uh under the Freedom of Information Act request so you can't get them to run a query For You especially one that involves um say uh uh you querying two two different databases because that would require work and work is not covered under Foy so they have the option to opt out and whenever you try to request anything like that they always opt out or they don't respond I mean like Aaron Siri's been trying to get lots of data from them for for a very long time and has spent several years in litigation successfully and you know finally gets data but you know this should this should not be like pulling teeth they should be like guys they they should be welcoming us they should be saying come on in we want the truth to be exposed this shouldn't be an adversarial uh uh kind of relationship this should be a very Cooperative relationship we're just scientists we're we're just trying to find out what the data says and you know people like Brian hooker they were granted access to uh to these databases to the vssd databases and when Brian hooker started finding a connection between Autism and vaccines his access to the vssd database was revoked instantly and so this is the way it works once you're on to something they revoke access now when there's no data transparency you have to be very very suspicious of your government so look you know uh uh you know I have an open invitation to the heads of the CDC and the FDA if you want you said that misinformation is a problem you want to stop it all you have to do is invite us in let us do the queries on your database and we'll see what the data says yeah and we'll make all of that information public it's all about transparency of Public Health Information it shouldn't be kept private of course let us see the numbers that we paid for and own as American citizens you disgusting dishonest bureaucrats I agree but you don't have the chance to do that so what data sets are you looking at and what do they tell you well so we I have um some data that we were able to get um from the Medicare database and it shows very conclusively that if you give uh the new Mao vaccine for example in uh March of 2021 it's a flat line in fact it slops downward if you give the covid vaccine to the same group of people effectively it slopes upwards and it's not supposed what is it that's sloping upwards the the deaths the death you kill people okay yeah yeah like you know did did it impact your mortality and so with the covid vaccine your mortality increases every day since you got the shot for a while and so we we we've seen that in the US data in the US Medicare data that's gold standard data that's hard to dispute and you can't say it was oh it's just the timing because we can compare vaccine a with vaccine B and vaccine a goes like like this and vaccine B the safer vaccine is a flat line in fact it slopes downwards the other one slopes upwards and so it's comp it's obvious to anybody looking at that data that the vaccine is increasing mortality and then we got this I was contacted I got the data dump from New Zealand there was a guy Barry young who is a database administrator for the New Zealand Ministry of Health essentially health New Zealand and he was very concerned about what he was seeing in the database because people were getting the shots and dying and so he he released the uh the datab the complete database of the database that he controlled and he released it and I got a copy of the original database I then uh opusc it to make sure that there was no personally identifiable information that was disclosed and I released the the record level data the patient record level data that has never been disclosed for any vaccine in history by any government in the entire world so this is a this is an event this is an unprecedented event never before in world history has anyone ever released this patient level record level data showing when a person was vaccinated and showing when they died and and it's for on it's on on a per person basis we don't need to disclose any names we don't even need to disclose ages we just talk about age ranges and you do this analysis on this data it's called a Time series cohort analysis it's the same analysis that the UK does the UK office of national statistics does when they try to analyze the vaccine in their country and show the vaccine is safe they do what's called a Time series cohort analysis now I did the exactly the same analysis technique on that data and what it shows is very clear it shows that if whatever whatever is happening in the background if the if the background is going uh upwards because you got it like um dose three is given at a time when uh deaths are low and they're going high and it and so you you naturally expect a slope up and we saw a slope up but the slope up went up like this instead of this and for dose number four where the deaths are now falling because it's six months later and it's the completely opposite seasonality deaths are now falling but if you look at the time series cohort analysis deaths are rising so in all cases is the deaths are exceeding what you would expect from background there's no doubt about it I've talked to epidemiologists it's like look it's very very CLE clear it's Crystal Clear we have record level data it's the best data possible and it shows without any doubt whatsoever that the vaccines are killing the very people that they were meant to protect so it's confirmation of what we saw in the Medicare data now I can't have a discussion with any epidemiologist in the world other than people who agree with me like Harvey r is's one of the top epidemiologists in the world and he will say yeah there's there's no way you can explain that and no epidemiologist in the world will come and and chat with me about it and tell me how I got it wrong because this method is very ative there's only one way to do the time series cohort analysis and what it shows is very clear and anybody who claims that it doesn't show anything doesn't really understand how to analyze data properly and so look I have an open invitation to any epidemiologist you know let's have a discussion but nobody wants to talk about it in fact the epidemiologists that agree with me uh tell me hey I can't chat with you and give my support because I will be be fired from my job if I do that and so I can't afford to speak to you because I need to provide for my family if I come and support you I'll be fired and like there's one epidemiologist in in an area of the world where you know he can't get another job so he he's he's like you know totally support what you're doing you're absolutely right but not I'm not really allowed to say a word because as an epidemiologist will be fired it's the same thing happening for doctors doctors are not allowed to speak out if doctors speak out they're going to lose their license to practice medicine they they could lose their job uh they'll be uh uh their family won't talk family members won't talk to them anymore you know the whole thing I mean this is this is just terrible that we can't we have people dying and we can't talk about it what what do you think based on the numbers that you've seen and analyzed the death toll is from the co vac uh worldwide or uh how about worldwide and the us if you have those yeah I mean worldwide it's over 13 uh milon people uh easily uh you know Denny Rancourt uh came up with 17 uh million people and I don't disagree with that uh at all I think that's a that's a fair estimate and that doesn't surprise me at all I know it's at least 13 million um so 17 million isn't uh a far stretch from that and by the way you did an excellent interview with uh Brett Weinstein I I thought it was one of Brett's uh finest interviews ever and and you did a just a spectacular job I agree with everything that Brett said I mean I listened to that interview very carefully everything that Brett said was spoton I mean it it does raise a number a number of questions some of them even philosophical questions like how how can you how can World governments kill more than 10 million people and leave some large undetermined number disabled for life and not say a word about it not apologize not work to fix it not work to make the families whole I mean just leave it by the side of the road like a corpse and keep marching I don't understand that how can that happen um believe me I'm surprised as well you know I can't get an audience with anybody in the United States Congress except for Senator Ron Johnson like I can't have a dialogue they won't talk to me nobody wants to know they don't want to know the truth it's like autism in this country you know autism's been around for a very long time and we've known from this Statistics that vaccines cause autism it's the leading cause of autism now now can we even get a discussion about that may I may I ask you to pause that I mean the statement you just made is verboten I mean no person who wanted to say work at the Atlantic magazine or who takes the New York Times on a daily basis would would ever say something like that because you're not allowed to say that why do you tell us why you say that say it's because it's true yeah I've collected my own data just independently to look at at the connection between vaccines and autism and it's amazing I had I had over uh 10,000 parents uh tell me about their kids and I said hey tell me about your kids tell me how many vaccines they've gotten tell me if they have autism tell me if they have ADHD tell me you know just tell me about your kids tell me about the medical conditions and tell me about how many shots they get and it's a straight line the more shots you get the more likely you are to get autism and it's the same thing for ADHD it's a same thing for panda pans it's the same thing for autoimmune diseases I mean the it is basically the more shots you get the less healthy the kids are and this is very clear from the statistics and then people say oh Steve you know you're your misinformation super spreader and your followers don't believe in vaccines but there's no way that parents could have coordinated their answers to this question to create a straight line for all of these conditions that the more vaccines you get the greater your chance I don't care who my followers are there's no way that you can game a statistical result like that so I know just from my personal uh uh surveys that there's no way you could game something like this that there is a connection but you know we have H lots of data that's in the that is known by other researchers every um that there are lots of these papers the publishing that are published showing the link between uh vaccines and autism I know one uh Doctor Who's she he he um he had like a 150 autism cases and he said 44 of them happened relatively overnight meaning that they happened within either the the child was was normal one day and then severely autistic the next day or it happened over a one or two week period he said in for he had 44 cases where where he had rapid onset autism and in every single one of the 44 cases it happened within two weeks after a vaccine now so that is statistically impossible if vaccines aren't causing autism so what one thing that's always and I I'm I'm willing to believe every single thing you say um and watching the response to Bobby Kennedy's famous Rolling Stone or article almost 20 years ago convinced me they were hiding something because the hysteria was just overwhelming but what's so interesting is there are a couple of big autism advocacy groups well there's one big one and they quote don't take a position on this and how could a group that supposedly Advocates on behalf of children with autism and funds research to prevent autism or to to to alleviate the symptoms of autism how could they ignore this well they shouldn't you know but they do and the reason that they do is because they'll be uh uh they're worried about being uh essentially uh offending their donors right and what they want is they want to have the widest possible donors and uh donor base and I you know I think that's the reason and it's like you know for example there's a guy Richard Fry he's one of the top autism research in the world and he's admitted that hey all of us top autism researchers know that vaccines cause autism but we're just not allowed to talk about it and so Richard Fry will never publicly talk about that vaccine's cause autism because if he did his funding would go away and so it's a matter of self-preservation he basically has to remain silent and he can do his work to combat autism he just isn't allowed to tell the world that vaccines cause autism but you know he makes a decision and his decision is based on a you know sort of a risk benefit if I if I tell the world that if he he says you know the reasoning is if I tell the world that vaccines cause autism basically I'm kaput as a researcher I will never get any dollars of funding again and I can't help my patients they'll take my license away they'll take my funding away they'll destroy me I will not be able to contribute anymore to figure out what the Cure is and so he basically remains silent for self-preservation reasons now if he and all of his peers were to get together and in unison say hey vaccines cause autism we're the 20 top researchers in the world vaccines cause autism we need to stop this we need to let people know of the connection then that could that could possibly change everything or it could result in those 20 researchers essentially being disenfranchised being kicked out of their jobs being um you know not being able to help autistic kids anymore and so it's a risk for them and so they don't play the risk and the problem is that we have so many kids today you know it's the the CDC says it's 1 in35 I think it's much higher than that um because I've talked to to friends and just pulled my friends I said hey do you have an autistic kid in in your household and it's like uh one in four of my friends have an autistic kid in their household and so these numbers are staggering and the way to stop it is is to to realize that the whole vaccination program the whole childhood vaccination program you're better off as a child not getting any vaccines at all than getting the whole uh uh childhood schedule and there have been papers on this that show that kids who got zero shots and and they compare kids that are completely unvaccinated with kids who are fully vaccinated there's no comparison that the kids who are completely unvaccinated are far healthier than their vaccinated peers and you know there's a clinic in in the United States I'm not going to tell you where because otherwise they'll be shut down almost instantly um but this Clinic has been basically not giving kids vaccines and and explaining to parents the risk benefit of vaccines and the parents are deciding not to vaccinate their kids there's not been a single unvaccinated kid in their practice in 25 years and this is tens of thousands of kids in 25 years not a single case of autism when they withhold the vaccines from the kids and the kids are healthier and so there are all of these studies in the peer- reviewed literature comparing a completely unvaccinated kids with completely vaccinated kids and they're all in favor of the unvaccinated kids not a single exception and so they tried to get a the NIH to go and do a study to be the definitive study comparing fully unvaccinated kids with fully vaccinated kids but they couldn't even get the bill out of committee in Congress they had nine co-sponsors it was in in uh 2009 they had nine co-sponsors including I think um uh uh I I think Rand Paul was a was a co-sponsor of this they couldn't get it was killed in committee they couldn't even ask the NIH Force the NIH to do a study between the completely unvaccinated and and the fully vaccinated so this has been going on for a long time that they've been able to hide this stuff they've been able to hide the connection between vaccines and autism they've been able to to hide the connection between vaccines and all of these diseases that kids have the you know the ADHD the peanut allergies the food allergies the um any kind of autoimmune diseases I mean these things are are totally linked with the vaccines and You' see it in the data and of course the CDC knows this like the CDC had a study it was done in in early 2000 and uh William Thompson was one of the authors of that study and he admitted that the CDC basically told him to delete all data that linked vaccines and autism from his study so he can report that there's no link between vaccines and autism He was ordered to destroy data linking vaccines and autism and when they tried to get him to testify in Congress that he was ordered by his CDC superiors to destroy this data uh uh Bill posy Congressman Bill posy was was basically told look you're not going to have this hearing in Congress we're not going to let uh Bill Thompson testify you're not going to have your hearing and if you insist on it we're going to take away all your committee chairmanships so it's basically they don't want to see any of this stuff happening they don't want to exposed in Congress Congress is complicit uh in this it certainly is it's horrible so let me uh I've got two more questions for you um one before I forget if people have made it this far into the interview and want to know more about your research the data you've uncovered where will they find that sure it's uh Steve uh it's it's uh kersch substack uh.com Kirch substack Doc and they can go there you can also go to my Twitter feed and then it'll link you to the uh uh sorry the the X uh my ex uh profile St kersch St ksch on uh on X and you can also go there as well and I've written about 15 probably over 1500 articles on uh vaccines and uh covid mitigations and so forth and there's a lot of material there for people to go through and you know I've I've accumulated uh you know somewhere around a million followers worldwide on the social media platform forms and substack and so forth it it's it's and this leads exactly to my last question which is it it's just an amazing life Arc that you've had you said that uh not even three years ago you you you got vaccinated yourself you were not afraid of vaccines you were kind of hopeful that they would work and now you've produced this enormous Corpus of research um showing just the opposite what has happened to your life you a minute ago talked about researchers you know who won't go public for fear of having their lives destroyed you've moved in the opposite direction at high speed what's happened to your life since you started doing this um we'd lost probably 95% of the friends who used to associate with uh with us normally uh they won't talk to us anymore it's basically we don't want to talk to you you're an evil person personal friends yeah yeah you know it's the same thing with the scientific Advisory Board uh uh members they said um I said look hey if I'm wrong you know please tell me please engage with me and tell me where I got it wrong and they said no you're an evil person we don't want to talk to you you're wrong and we don't want to talk to you you're you're you're a bad person you know I I had a um my wife and I were given a national caring award because of our work with uh philanthropies we're we're a big philanthropist and so we received a national carrying award in Washington DC in a big ceremony and was it the award was personally presented by Hillary Clinton uh in my case uh they had Senator Clinton uh give the award to us in DC and I used to have that on my Wikipedia profile now as soon as I came out and I said that the the data shows that the vaccines are not safe my national caring award was removed from my Wikipedia profile you know and it it it's just an objective um uh showing how wow people are basically trying to position you and to recast you as now this evil person who spreads misinformation when all you're doing is telling the truth so we lost about 95% of our friends and you know but but I look at it and I say look you know I I may have lost um 100 or 200 friends but I now have a million new friends and I get stopped at airport saying hey are you Steve kersch and can I have a selfie with you you know and so I've gone from not being recognized in public to going anywhere in the world and people will stop me and say hey can I take a selfie with you and so that it's a pretty dramatic shift I went from being a top high-tech between I used to be a high-tech executive respected high-tech executive and now I can't talk to my high-tech peers they think I'm nuts and and now you do a Google search uh and you you search for misinformation super spreader I'm the top hit you know I never expected in my life that I would be the the one thing that it would be different about me that the one unique thing that I would be the best in the world at that I would be the number one hit at Google on is misinformation super spreader that is like you know at least but you know I'm grateful at least I found my calling at least I'm good at something and and it is great to be nationally recognized by Google as the top hit when you type in misinformation super spreader but you know all I'm doing is I'm telling the truth yes I've noticed and it is so hard that you know it's just like Peter hotz was offered millions of dollars to have a civil debate with Bobby Kennedy and hotz turned it down who would turn down a million dollars just to have a discussion with someone Bobby Kennedy's been trying to get a debate on autism for 20 years for 20 years he's been trying to get somebody in the medical community to have a debate with in 20 years he's not had a single debate with anyone in the medical community on autism and it's the same thing with Peter Hotes everyone who is a classed as a misinformation spreader or super spreader they all want to have a civil debate and a dialogue to say hey this is what the data shows if we got it wrong please explain it to us but there is nobody who is prominent on the pro vaccine narrative side who will agree to debate anyone on our side yes so everybody challenging The Narrative says please let's have a civil discussion and the people on the other side are saying no we will not have a discussion with you we will not engage with you let's duke it out in the medical literature and that is a copout because we have been duking it out in the medical literature on autism for 20 years there are more papers showing that vaccines cause autism then there are papers showing vaccines don't cause autism now if we haven't resolved that in 20 years in the medical literature why do we think it's suddenly going to happen for autism or for the covid vaccines that's right it's not going to happen the only way it's going to happen is with civil dialogue where we're allowed to say say hey here's the evidence explain it here's the evidence on our side let's have the dialogue but the dialogue has been turned into censorship and Bobby Kennedy made a brilliant observation he says that the history has shown that anyone who uses censorship as a weapon they're always on the wrong side they're committing a crime by definition that's exactly right yeah well I think um I have concluded that you're an amazing person um and that you're telling the truth and I'm grateful that you spent this time with us and I hope good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight here is the main thing you need to know about Joe Biden he is 82 80 years old rather he was born in 1942 in the first half of the last century the year Biden was born only 36% of American households had a telephone nearly half of them did not have indoor plumbing Joe Biden turned 80 last November this fall he will be 81 if Biden were to serve a second fullterm as president president he would be 86 years old in other words 4 years from 90 these are not trivial facts about Joe Biden these are the central facts of Joe Biden's life Joe Biden's age defines him and all of us that's true for every person age is just a number you will hear people say but they are lying to themselves age is more than a number age is an expression of the core biological reality of human existence which is that at some point it comes to a close age is the way that we chart our progression from birth to death as we pass from this world as billions before us have and are replaced by others that used to be called the cycle of life no one has ever changed it no one ever will so our choice is between accepting a reality we cannot alter or denying that reality even exists the Democratic party has chosen the latter tomorrow is March 1st that means a year from today we will be in the middle of presidential primary season Joe Biden has given every indication that he plans to participate in that and that his party is firmly behind him the DNC has already changed the primary calendar to make South Carolina which is a machine state where the outcome can easily be scripted the very first contest and that was not an accident it was done it was changed to help Joe Biden win Biden says he's strongly considering running again Biden's wife of course says she very much hopes he will run and most tellingly of all no mainstream Democrat has announced a run against him so as of tonight Joe Biden is in the race for the Democratic nomination and as of tonight he will get the nomination and that's just amazing if you think about it Joe Biden would be 82 years old on inauguration day that is 8 years older than the average life expectancy for men in this country so virtually everyone in his high school class will be gone by then but Joe Biden will be just beginning his second term as president of the United States would that be healthy for America would it be healthy for Joe Biden of course not it's awful 82-year-old men should not be running countries they are not strong enough mentally or physically everybody knows that very much including any 82-year-old man you ask the people around Joe Biden certainly know that how could they not know that they watch him and you do too here's Joe Biden in Warsaw Poland just last week the questions we faced were as simple as they were profound would we respond or would we look the other way would we be strong or would we be weak would be you we would would we the all of our allies would be United or divided should we play Clips like that a million times for you over the past few years we could play a million more because Joe Biden talks like that every day at this point it's how he talks Joe Biden is losing his ability to speak that's not a secret it's not something you learn from our confidential sources and are bringing to you for the first time tonight exclusively that is obvious to the entire world and you'll probably sound like that too if you make it to Joe Biden's age we will also it's not weird it's natural it's not an attack on Joe Biden hardly it's an observation but because it's natural we have been commanded to ignore it Don Lan got suspended from his show at CNN recently for suggesting that a presidential candidate in her 50s was quote Pastor Prime and that's odd really as a factual matter what Don Lem man said is true people in their 50s are literally certainly physically past their Prime that's a fact take it from someone who's 53 so why was that such a controversial point of all the demented things that Don Lem man has said over the years noticing somebody's age is what blows up his career yes because that simple commonplace observation people weaken with age points to a power that will forever remain Beyond human authority which is the power to control time no matter how rich we are we cannot prevent ourselves from getting older we can buy Botox and hair plugs and facelifts Joe Biden has bought all of that but in the end we degrade anyway because we are not God accepting this fact that we are not God working within the pre-ordained limits of nature is the key to balance and happiness in this human life ignoring that fact leads to insanity or in the case of modern America it leads to the trans agenda and climate theology if you asked a 100 honest people to name the things that human beings cannot control most would list biological sex and the weather you can't decide whether you're a boy or a girl you are what you are born sorry and nobody try as we might can make a sunny day you don't manufacture it you receive it a sunny day either happens or it doesn't it's not up to you at best we can try to predict the weather we cannot determine the weather since the dawn of time that has been so obvious that almost nobody's ever mentioned it but saying it out loud is now heresy and and that's because our leadership class is at open war with nature nature is the final limit to their power and so they hate it they tell us they're in charge of human biology even of DNA trans women are women they Screech meet our lady Admiral they brag about how they now control the weather too hot for you hold on we'll change that with the green New Deal and then they tell us of course that age no longer matters Joe Biden may live forever we've got AI now it's all a ridiculous fantasy they have no such power they can't even keep the electrical grid running in the state of California and on some level they know that they know how limited they are which is why they become so hysterical in the face of physical reality because it's a reminder of their limits do you remember this fall when that NBC reporter a woman called Dasha Burns dared to point out that John fedman stroke had damaged him well of course it had damaged him everyone could see it had damaged him but to fetterman's wife and the rest of the democratic establishment and the rest of the press Corps saying something like that out loud was more offensive than any obscenity here's an outrage Mrs fedman what a disservice that she did to not only my husband but to anyone facing a disability and working through it and I don't know how there were not consequences right I mean there are consequences for folks in these positions who are any of the isms I mean she was ableist well she's an ableist how Gizelle fedman because someone had correctly pointed out that her husband was no longer able because he had a stroke in other words reality intruded on Mrs fed's fantasy and therefore reality itself had to be shouted down and destroyed you're seeing an awful lot of this attitude that exact attitude recently from the people in charge it's not a healthy sign wise leaders recognize the limits the inherent limits of their power they know that they're not in control of much actually because no one is you can decide what to have for breakfast that's up to you but you cannot decide to become a woman you can't choose to live to 100 you can't even choose to think clearly at 80 none of that is your choice even if you're the president life unfortunately is a sexually transmitted invariably fatal condition that's not a bad thing it's just true and when you deny it bad things happen and they are Candace Owens host the cace Owens podcast she joins us now I have to say Candace Owens the one thing I will never attack Joe Biden for his age because it's the one thing he doesn't control and I have absolute sympathy for him I hope to make it to that age so this is not an attack on him for being old I'm just amazed that no one around him feels empowered enough to point out I'm sorry you're too old to be president why is that the one verboten thing why is that the one thing no one can say yeah you know I do feel some sympathy for Joe Biden because obviously he is mentally in incapacitated but it does make you want to question Jill Biden and people like jelle fedman who understand exactly what their husbands are going through understand that they're being mocked on the world stage and understand that they are struggling uh struggling even to form coherent sentences and yet they sit there and they applaud and they think we're just going to keep hiding this from the public all on their quest uh for power and that's really what this comes down to look we can call these people incompetent they are but does incompetency matter no because they're here to serve the party this is all Democrats care about you are here to serve the party and actually if you are incompetent that's even better right because these are puppets these people are on strings these people are to do what they're told and not to think expressly actually they are told not to think individually think only about the party do what we tell you to do and what we want you to do is to further disintegrate these communities is to further denigrate these communities because what we are after for as the party initiative is full omnipotence and what they need to create is a new system of slavery this is why I call it the ultimate thing that they are after is Neo slavery they want to make sure that no individual holds power in this country and so what what you're seeing is something that's very evil you are calling out something correctly and saying that their final war is a war against nature it's a war against sanity it's it makes us question our sanity you would never think that we would be having these debates that we're having today that people would be telling you that it's a wrong thing to say that an 86-year-old is old right so suddenly we're being attacked for this everything is given an ism and the reason is just as you correctly pointed out is because it is the final war and they need to make sure that they control even language well I think language is the key because they've cowed the population even smart people who know better into not saying the obvious things their fear is that people will say the obvious things you're too old to be president your trans Admiral is a dude putting incompetent people in the cockpits of commercial airliners or having them perform heart surgery is insane you're insane like none of this is real you can't allow this to happen and those are the very things that no one is willing to say I don't know why I'm certainly not one of those people I don't struggle to say exactly what needs to be said and this is exactly why because if they win if they win this battle there is nothing left right there is nothing left and so I encourage people I say no you need to say the thing that you know is true because the problem that we're having right now is too many conservatives are acting like cowards right they're saying we need to be nicer it's okay this is how they have gained so much territory this is how we are fighting them in the school systems how we're fighting them in the classrooms how we are fighting them to Simply acknowledge that women can never men and men can never be women these are these are insane arguments but they're able to happen because good people sit by and say absolutely nothing while they run a muck and and so I also want to say this and it's it's very important to point out the Democrats used to be quiet about their corruption right years ago they were quiet about their corruption now they're corrupt openly and they're mocking you and what they're really asking you is and what are you going to do about it so what we knew Federman was mentally incapacitated and we still allowed him to make it all the way to the Senate and what are you going to do about it so what we know that Joe Biden can't can barely walk we can see the early signs of dementia and what are you going to do about it it's a very fair question I I'd ask the same to everybody out there watching this program what are you going to do about it why don't you start saying the truth and Having the courage to say it boldly can I just ask you one one last question as a as a wife and mother which you are so here you have Dr Jill and Jazelle fedman both cheering on their husband's political careers well one is effectively incapacitated by dementia and the other one's literally in a mental hospital wouldn't you think that a woman who loved a spouse who loved her husband say no it's not good for him why is Dr Jill not the villain in this story what is her problem what a ghoulish power seeking creep and the same with jelle fedman her husband's in a mental hospital like what yeah absolutely these women are monsters I'm not going to mince words here these women are absolute monsters if you were in a relationship and you love someone and you've and you've had a family with this individual you would never want to see them suffer period now imagine allowing them to suffer publicly that's exactly what these women are doing they are they are somehow become creatures on their quest for power and they should be ashamed of themselves but I promise you they won't be because it's all about serving the party and if they have to sacrifice their husbands oh well yeah if my wife did that to me because she want to spend the weekend at Camp David I my feelings would be hurt a lot um Ken I I appreciate it great to see you tonight thank you thanks for having me say Louis one of the Great American cities degraded at very high speed under a Soros back da called Kim Gardner now the murder of a homeless man in the middle of the day on the sidewalk caught on tape which really is kind of a metaphor for what's happened to our cities that's straight ahead plus the covid experts told a lot of lies that have now been debunked they're not going to admit that of course they want you to forget we're not in the business of forgetting however we always keep the tape we be be right back the Attorney General of Missouri is now trying to remove the Soros back da in St Louis woman call him Kim Gardner who has done so much to destroy that City we hesitate even to show you this tape but we feel Duty bound to do so because this murder in St Louis says a lot about where our cities are tonight fox say Kevin Cork has it for us Hey Kevin Tucker It's not that crime hasn't always been a real problem in America's Maj cities it has I live here in Washington I can attest to it it's just that there's an increasing scale and scope and frankly the brutal nature that really shocks the censes leaving citizens begging for help in some cases soros's back da are facing increased uh scrutiny an intense scrutiny at that take for example as you point out that disgusting incident that happened in St Louis yesterday outside the globe building in a video posted online you see a guy by the name of Deshawn Thomas he stands behind a homeless man sitting on the sidewalk calmly loads his weapon and shoots him at Point Blank Range Witnesses suggest that the pair may have been fighting outside of a Shell gas station up the block moments earlier Thomas was arrested a short time later at a library though it's unclear if he was out on probation at the time or if he has a long rrap sheet probably but we'll have to wait and see so far there have been 25 murders in the city already in 2023 leading to Growing calls to out soros's backed Attorney Kim Gard in part because of the number of repeat offenders committing violent crimes in the city now you may have heard of this one earlier this month a 21-year-old convicted felon by the name of Danny Daniel Riley struck a young volleyball player with his car pinning her to the ground robbing her of the use of her legs as a result critics say he should never have been out in the first place and they are blaming Gardner for it Tucker man something is wrong for sure Kevin Cork with that thank you so much you bet so the whole covid thing started about 3 years ago and we're finally learning what a lot of people suspected from the beginning which is that the experts either didn't know what they were talking about or they were lying now it's kind of depressing to go through all those lies but it's also necessary if you don't want that to happen again and we definitely don't Dr Marty McCary has been chronicling them keeping track he's a public health expert Professor John's Hopkin school of medicine and he joins us tonight to list some of the things we learned that aren't true doct thank you than you so much for coming thank you for keeping track of this cuz I I think you need an after action report to make you better the next time so what have we learned was untrue well Tucker I just testified before Congress and of course those on the left were asking about misinformation as if that was the big problem and of course microchips in the vaccines as a conspiracy theory came up now I don't know how many people chose not to get the vaccine because of fears of a microchip maybe two people in America or five how about the misin information propagated by public health officials the biggest deliverer of misinformation has been the United States government and the data has caught up with all the lies now and has actually debunked many of these lies for example natural immunity is not protective the Lancet study tore that apart showed it is absolutely as effective uh as vaccination and probably more effective that school closures would reduce transmission the Europe experience proved that wrong the schools were open clear and free throughout with the similar transmission rate so that was wrong that myocarditis is more common after covid infection than it is from the vaccine not true JMA Cardiology showed that it was 4 to 28 times more common after the vaccine in a particular cohort that the lab con leak was a conspiracy theory both Dr farzon and Gary the nation's two top biologists told Dr fouchi in January of 2020 in an emergency meeting that fouchy called that they thought it was the lab leak and yet it was built as a conspiracy and finally that the balent vaccine and the boosters are effective and necessary for young people we've had no randomized control trials Dr jaw at the White House said it's crystal clear to me it's Crystal Clear a young healthy person has does should not get it no one on the Congressional committee or at the CDC has ever been able to tell us if any healthy American child has died of covid it may have been a couple could have been three five 10 over three years that's way below any respiratory pathogen how can you push something so aggressive with such absolutism and Dogma without the the data we don't even know if any healthy child has ever died of covid now public health officials in the CDC are proposing that a 12-year-old healthy girl get 60 mRNA covid vacines in her average lifetime one a year this is where we've got to demand Data before following these recommendations that's what they're demanding right now it's hard even to believe that given everything we know that seems deranged and and scary annual vaccinations for all people that's the Mantra right now and it's All or Nothing is last question doctor is there an organized I mean that's so that's so unwise you got to think there's an organized resistance to that do you think that could actually happen it could become compulsory yeah most of the resistance are practicing Physicians but because anyone who disagrees with the Mantra is dismissed or censored or deleted or excluded from National meetings it appears as if there is a unified consensus of Physicians the cdc's own study found that 40% of Pediatricians do not recommend the covid vaccines for children that should say a lot and when I go to the doctor's meetings none of them have been wearing masks over the entire last year that should say a lot yeah it does say a lot Dr mty McCary a brave and learned man thank you so much thanks so if you work at any kind of big company or apologies but you probably had implicit bias training one physician has enough self-respect to say enough Dr Marilyn Singleton joins us next on that topic this is a Fox News Alert there's a potentially significant hearing underway in the House of Representatives the house select committee on the Communist Chinese party is folding holding its first hearing on the Chinese Communist threat to America you're seeing pictures live right now we're going to monitor what's going on there and if anything happens of course we'll bring it to you right away so this is one of those stories you wonder like how much longer can we ignore this we seem to be getting a lot closer to a major Aviation disaster in this country there are no minor Aviation disasters near misses are now occurring every few days not an overstatement on Wednesday an air traffic controller in Burbank California cleared a Mesa Airlines jet to land on a Runway where a Sky West Jet was in the process of taking off then when the Mesa Airlines jet abandoned The Landing the controller briefly directed the two planes toward each other the controller kept mixing up right and left in her Radio Calls the planes were less than a mile apart at one point and for objects moving as fast as airplanes that's very close now this is similar to another incident that happened earlier this month in Austin Texas in that case a FedEx cargo jet came within a 100 feet of a Southwest Airlines jet after the FedEx jet was cleared to land on a Runway where the Southwest Jet was taking off that shouldn't be allowed that should never happen but it's happening quite a bit on Monday night a Jet Blue flight at Boston's Logan Airport nearly hit a Learjet the Learjet began its takeoff roll without clearance as the JetBlue flight was Landing the Jet Blue flight cleared the Learjet the private aircraft by less than 100 ft this is totally crazy and it's also part of a much larger problem of Transportation in the United States today in manate County Florida a train carrying sheetrock and more than 30,000 gallons of propane fuel derailed Hazmat crews are on the scene at this hour so far no one has been evacuated although officials say that could be coming soon again this keeps happening just a week ago Hazmat teams deployed in gothenberg Nebraska after a Coal Train derailed there and of course as you well know earlier this mon there was a derailment and then a man-made mushroom cloud in East Palestine Ohio so you have to wonder what happened to the trillion doll infrastructure Bill the one that Joe Biden can't stop bragging about the infrastructure bill that was actually an equity Bill the one that put solar panels on government buildings what about our infrastructure what about the airplanes why do they come within 100 ft of each other no one in the Biden Administration appears to care and unless they start to care people are going to die for real so the thing you want to watch is not the periphery but the core that is the critical Industries Aviation Transportation more broadly energy and medicine and there's a problem in the medical profession for some reason medical schools and hospitals have become convinced that the appearance of your doctor is the most important thing you can judge a book by its cover and CNN of course is pushing it hard watch right now fewer than 6% of doctors in the US identify as black or African-American that's despite the fact that the community makes up 12% of the country's total population and that's raising concerns about the impact on public health research shows that when we have a more diverse physician Workforce there's more understanding and more trust between the patient and the doctor if the doctor has an understanding of the patient's cultural experiences cultural background lived experiences especially when it comes to racism or discrimination or other aspects of their life that can help with that physician patient a relationship it's super simple if there was ever a place where we need a pure meritocracy the most qualified people get the jobs it's in medicine most doctors believe that very few are willing to say it Dr Marilyn Singleton is one of them she's got a piece in the Washington Post called I'm a black physician and I'm appalled by mandated implicit bias training and we are happy to have her join us tonight Dr Marland Singleton doctor thank you so much for coming on why you've practiced medicine for a long time thank you for inviting me oh well we're delighted to have you what have you noticed that has changed in your profession in medicine recently and why are you concerned about it well I'm concerned one I grew up in a time when there was segregation and we move from black people having to go to Black universities to where it was completely open and I was was able to go to top tier universities where my parents didn't necessarily do that and then when I went to medical school diversity meant groups of different people all over the country different backgrounds and whatnot all we wanted to do was get good grades and be the best doctor that we possibly could and take the best care of patients suddenly we fast forward now and we don't even hear about getting good grades all we hear about is oh a black patient should have a black doctor well that is so wrong a black patient should have a good doctor and that's what all patients want and certainly black patients don't want that and you believe me if you get rolled into an emergency room you don't want a patient having to look up at that doctor sideways and think hm is this one of those evil white Devils or is this a good doctor who's going to take care of my stab wound to the abdomen and this is so wrong and it's being pushed on people and I don't like the demonization of my colleagues that I've worked with for years save patients lives with have them come to me for advice on how to do something and suddenly I'm not supposed to trust them they're not supposed to trust me am I suddenly a stupid black person it's it's completely flipped on its head there was a time when black people were considered not up to the to the task to the job and couldn't be professionals couldn't be doctors and we are we're smart we're just like anybody else and suddenly white doctors are the ones that have the evil Aura around them and we expect black patients to then want to trust that doctor and it's Hokum that black patient needs a black doctor number one it could never happen there aren't enough doctors how could you match these people up what happens when you go into an emergency and I honestly as an anesthesiologist I've done plenty of emergencies I've been a doctor for hate to say 50 years now and patients look at you and years ago all they wondered are you old enough to know how to do this and they wondered about about your competence and this is wrong having so much focus on race and bringing back the kind of focus that we fought for so many years to be gone to look at people as individuals and their talents their personality their compassion and they're wiping it away and it's just wrong it's criminal why are you one of such a tiny minority of practicing Physicians willing to say that well I think it's like so many times and I'm sure you've been in these meetings where everybody's thinking the same thing but nobody wants to say it out loud and with and part of it is what's happening in medicine all over that we now have private practice only 47% of Physicians and so you're looking at 53% of Physicians are employed or they work for one of these big Health Systems they're afraid how they're afraid to lose their jobs and it's kind of hard to blame them when you're in private practice and you're taking care of your own patience for your own self you know you can say what you want and your patients when they love you they love you and they don't care what color you are they're just glad that you give them good treatment bless you for saying that I mean it it sounds obvious but when you're one of the only people willing to say it we're we're really grateful for for your willingness to do that Dr Marilyn Singleton I appreciate it thank you so if you want to control a country in his people obviously you destroy their history so they don't know what happened before and then the future is yours so now the woke mob is in the Pentagon and they've decided to desecrate Arlington National Cemetery not so fast woke mob at the Pentagon we get to tals next democracy as they say is on the ballot in Chicago tonight where the worst mayor probably in recorded history Lori Lightfoot is up for election she's the one who hired the thousand cats to fight the right Pro rat problem in Chicago Trace Gallagher has been following all of this he joins us with an update hey Trace hey Tucker so the polls are now closed in Chicago and they're now in the process of counting the early ballots we're talking about some 240,000 ballots and so far it appear appears to be a very tough night for the incumbent mayor Lori Lightfoot we now have 73% of the early votes counted and Paul valis this is the former Chicago Public School CEO has 36% of the vote now Valas has been endorsed by the police union he bills himself as the tough on crime candidate in second you have Brandon Johnson he's a current Cook County Commissioner and former school teacher who is supported by the Chicago Teachers Union he's now pulling about 20% of the vote and in third place Lori Lightfoot she's at just under 16% not really doing well in recent weeks Brandon Johnson's surge has made headlines because it was so surprising and so fast but this is primarily about crime because even Chicago is tired of the increase in violent crime all across Chicago land so once the early ballots are counted they'll move on to the rest of the boats but remember it could take a while because if one candidate does not get more than 50% it goes to an April 4th runoff and that means this could last for weeks we should know with 73% of the early ballots counted we can now tell you that Paul valis will be in that runoff whether Lori Lightfoot makes the runoff is yet to be seen so she is known for dancing at awkward times it appears that Lori Lightfoot will likely not be doing any dancing tonight because she may not even make it to the next round we'll keep counting we'll keep tabulating and get back to you with results Tucker Trace Gallagher consistently the bearer of good news there not many of those thank you trace you bet Lor liuck got re-elected you'd really have to rethink the system I mean what would that be terrifying so if you want to control a country obviously you have to erase its history so no one has any idea what went before and then the future is yours and that's why they tear down monuments to our past in New York they tore down the Teddy Roosevelt statue the greatest of all American presence the most popular it stood there for many years and now it's gone rioter have done this all over the country so that wasn't enough so now woke lunatics at the Pentagon have decided to desecrate America's biggest and most significant Cemetery Arlington National red across from Washington DC and tear down a memorial to Civil War dead Chris Bedford is the executive editor of the Common Sense Society just wrote Such a thoughtful and interesting piece on what is happening and what it means he joins us tonight Chris Bedford thank you so I I'm not sure I can in any way improve on what you wrote summarize it for us if you would well right now what they're trying to tear down is the as a monument in Arlington that marks the Confederate War dead and this is not a monument to Victory it's not a monument that says Rise up again this war is coming this is not a this is a Monument to reconciliation it's a ferary monument that stands over the graves of people including the architect and a number of other uh Confederate War Dead uh who who are buried there now in Arlington this is something that symbolizes peace at its Center is a robed woman holding a laurel crowned with uh crowned with branches and also holding the plow share that that stands for beating our swords into a plow share now beneath that is a freeze centered by on Athena a circular freeze that can that shows Southerners answering the call to war and that's something the critics have a problem with it does show a romanticized and idealized version of the South there but it is in its core and a monument to that reconciliation and it came during a very complicated period in time if we think that 2020 was complicated the period after the Civil War where about 2% of the American population gave their lives in battle was extremely tense and complicated for decades afterwards Confederates were not even allowed to T not even the families were allowed to tend the graves of those who were Fallen but America actually got through what most countries never get through they got through a Civil War and 30 years later when they end up fighting side by side in the Spanish American war that Mutual affection was rekindled and there was a softening of hearts and people who had fought on both sides reached out to each other and said we're going to try and come together and build something to reconciliation now the people who built this the daughters of the Confederacy know that this was not a perfect country not a single one of them could vote at that period there were still a lot of problems that we had to get through but coming together in that complicated history is what's essential for us to remember and tearing it down is very simple-minded how how vicious to do this to a graveyard 150 years later is there very quickly is there any way to stop this eraser of American History it's not theirs to erase is it I think there is the Congress has given the Pentagon the ability to erase these things but they're talking about base names and Roads things like an Arlington National Cemetery fall under the US Commission of Fine Arts that's a that's part of the cemetery that's Civic architecture that's something the military though they like to bulldoze over Authority actually has to set maybe take a back seat too yeah you you can't desecrate graveyards sorry I don't care who's buried there Chris Bedford thank you appreciate it thank you so we spent a lot of time beating up in the White House Press cor but there is someone in the White House Press cor is worth knowing amazing man his name is Simon atiba he's covering the White House in American government for an audience in Africa and we thought it'd be great to sit down with him it was better even than we imagined he grew up impoverished in Cameroon before becoming the toughest reporter in Washington we asked him in a long conversation about his life for Tucker Carlson today here's part of it when I thought that everything was great I decided to travel from Cameroon to Nigeria by sea and I was attacked by pirate on the Gulf of K and I'm not going on vacation with you I'm I'm sorry it's not personal yeah and I was like so you were so you finally get out of prison in Northern Cameroon and decid to go back to sary by boat but you get attacked by Pirates I was attacked by pirates on the Gulf of Guinea and they had an AK piracy is rampant around you know between Cameroon and Nigeria and I was almost getting to Nigeria and we saw this boat this speed boat that we to came towards us we're like lie on the ground lie on the ground your money bring everything out and and eventually the you know they had this gun that was the first time in my life that I thought I'm oh my God I'm going to die you know having a gun to your head it was I thought this guy may pull the trigger yeah and but eventually the guy didn't pull the trigger survive and it became too much other things um and I decided to you know um become who I really wanted to be because I I feel like I was given a second chance every time and I decided to really live live life to the fullest and that's I ended up in the US so how do you get from the point where you've got an AK-47 deer head from a pirate in the Gulf of Guinea to how to be in the White House Press Room so so and so I'm back in Nigeria doing my stuff I don't have money life is always tough I'm covering the US Embassy they are giving grants to everybody except Simon they asking Simon every day to come and cover them and I feel like telling them don't you have eyes I've been covering you for five years I'm getting old you guys are not giving me any thing and you're giving things to people who can do anything and and I'm here don't you see they were blind and they were not seeing and and I feel feel like I feel like oh my God all the money that comes from the US to these countries don't actually go to the people who need it to the people who do things that can even benefit the US here I am covering you Ambassador after Ambassador doing every single thing and you give scholarship to every single person around me except the person who has been there for you don't you see and and they didn't do anything and I decided to you know take my life into my own hand and decided to move to the US and work for today news Africa and the reason I decided to cover the Biden Administration was because I knew as I said he was the perfect good guy CNN had told me for years years in that the racist were the conservative the Republicans and those were the bad guys the people um uh who live in the midwest with you know redneck white guys with no college degrees who live in the midwest don't have anything to do with them because those are the racist and you can't have anything to do with them stick with Biden and and so I ended up at the White House with President Biden the good guy and as soon as he got there they refused to talk to him Simon AA one of the great guys on Fox Nation now we'll be right back supposed to be talking about healthc care today but it didn't take long for it to get pretty creepy watch I had a nurse named Pearl Nelson military she'd come in and do things that I don't think you learned in medical school nursing school she'd whisper in my ear I didn't couldn't understand it but she'd whisper she'd leaned down he'd actually breathe on me to make sure that I was there was a connection human connection what welcome to Tucker Carlon sign happy Monday so how would you define the B Administration well really the Hallmark has been an almost otherworldly disconnection from the actual Affairs of the United States if it's really happening in this country the Biden Administration will pretend it's not in fact White House officials seem to have no idea what's going on in our country and no interest in learning about it the weak at train derailment poisoned an entire town in Ohio the transportation secretary the man in charge of preventing train derailments held a press conference attacking white construction workers cuz they're the problem it's 1952 our 80-year-old president meanwhile 80 years old he seems convinced it's 1915 and we're all living in rural Alabama burning crosses in the front yards of terrified sharecroppers to amuse ourselves we don't have TV Biden gave a speech the other day in 2023 to denounce lynching as if lynching is still happening in the United States it all seems a little delusional so it was with genuine relief that we saw today one of Biden's top cabinet officials Janet Yellen who runs the treasury Department sign off her Twitter account finally leave Washington and meet with actual flesh and blood human beings who were suffering and not only did she meet with them to prove her sincerity jenet Yellen brought with her a check for a billion dollars and we'll admit partisans ship as said we were happy to see that finally someone in the bid Administration who actually cares who's getting on an airplane to show concern that's the good news the bad news is Jenny Ellen was not in East Palestine she was in Ukraine watch and today I'm proud to announce the transfer of an additional amount of over $1.2 billion that's the first charge of about $1 billion in direct budget support that the United States will provide in the coming months we love you so much that we will give you whatever you want anything a new bicycle a puppy a pony it's yours we love you billions more for Ukraine your tax dollars but that money is not going to be going to the newly poisoned communities of Eastern Ohio who cares about them it's not going to be earmarked for the hundreds of thousands of American families who have lost loved ones to the opioid epidemic an epidemic that was created by democratic donors at Purdue Pharma no that money is going to zilinsky and his wife in Kiev and that money will complement the more than a 100 billion in tax dollars they've already received from the US Treasury and you've got to think as they watch this tonight assuming there's still TV reception in Palestine the people who are stuck there are kicking themselves If Only They had paid Joe Biden's crackhead son 80 grand a month for a no-show job Jenny Ellen might be visiting them today it seemed like a lot of money at the time but that turned out to be the best investment those Ukrainian oligarch ever made it was like buying Google stock 20 years ago talk about a jackpot and by the way nobody understands the principles of political Venture capitalism better than ironically the Communist Chinese government does they paid Hunter Biden too and this weekend we learned a little bit about what they got in return the Wall Street Journal reported the bid Administration has finally concluded that yes covid was not naturally occurring it didn't emerge organically from a penglin whatever that is at the wet Market whatever that is no the virus came from a Chinese military lab where it was created that's the determination of the Department of energy based on new intelligence that of course everyone already had now we learned this interestingly from a newspaper we did not learn it directly from the bid administration because Joe Biden hasn't said a word about it and that's a little odd a million Americans they tell us died of covid close to 7 million died globally so it's inherently a big story now it is true that the origin of Co is not directly related to anti-trans racism so it's not a natural for Joe Biden he doesn't have his talking points already written but it might still make for a good topic for say a prime time address to the nation he might mention it to us he might answer a few other questions while he's at it for example is Joe Biden still sending money to China for biotech research the administration was actually doing that sending cash to that same Wuhan lab as recently as last year are they still doing that and bigger picture have their views on China changed now they know that China is responsible for the deaths of almost 7 million people now we know China Unleashed Co on the world intentionally or not and then lied about it for sure and then put hid life-saving genetic information about the virus from the scientists were trying to respond to covid now we know all of that does Joe Biden still consider Vladimir Putin he's so bad the greatest threat to world peace and stability it does seem like this story could overturn some of our previous assumptions well Joe Biden's National Security adviser Jake Sullivan went on CNN yesterday to answer precisely none of these questions instead he told us we're still not sure where it came from watch this did the Corona virus pandemic start in the lab is that what you believe now well Dana there is a variety of views in the intelligence Community some elements of the intelligence Community have reached conclusions on one side some on the other a number of them have said they just don't have enough information to be sure and if we gain any further Insight or information we will share it with Congress and we will share it with the American people but right now there is not a definitive answer that has emerged from the intelligence community on this question we just can't say for sure where covid came from there's no consensus we're still debating it well there's never a consensus in Washington about anything particularly now with the Intel agencies they're lying we know perfectly well where covid came from we've known this for years in fact one of one of the very first things we knew about covid was that it was an engineered virus that escaped somehow intentionally or not from a Chinese military biolab in Wuhan it was in early March of 2020 three full years ago at the very beginning that we did a long open on this show about the Chinese research paper whose authors later disappeared now these Chinese scientific researchers scolded the Chinese government for the lack safety standards that they said allowed covid to escape and infect the world this was 3 years ago watch this in fact the outbreak may have begun not in a public Meat Market but in a poorly run Chinese laboratory now that's not our Theory anyone who raises that theory on American television is attacked as a conspiracy Monger but this is the theory from a now censored Chinese paper a draft paper posted in mid-February scientists at the South China University of Technology suggested the virus outbreak coronavirus outbreak began at the Wuhan Center for Disease Control where an animal may have infected a researcher who then spread the disease outside the facility the paper is explicit about this we're going to quote it the killer Corona virus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan end quote so it's not like we did a lot of hard-hitting reporting with our Chinese speaking staff that paper was in English on the internet and anyone who was interested could have found it we were just interested that's why we found it and then we found someone who was there we found a Chinese physician a scientific research who worked for the Chinese government who was in and around Wuhan when covid emerged from that lab her name is liing Yan and we did a bunch of interviews with her here's one from my first report I can present the solid scientific evidence to our audience that this virus covid-19 sasco 2 virus actually is not from nature I work with the top Corona virologist in the world so together with my experience I can tell you this is created in the lab this is from that template owned by China military and also it is spread to the world to make such damage to make such damage do you believe the Chinese government released this intentionally on purpose did they do this yes of course it's intentionally wow now we thought that was a story so there was a physician who worked on Corona viruses for the Chinese military who was in Wuhan telling us in September of 2020 that the Chinese government did this intentionally to wreck the West to kill people and destroy the economies of its Rivals here in the west now if you're a middle class Christian American it's hard to imagine that level of malice EX existing anywhere in the world you just would never consider doing something like that but with the Chinese are they serious enough probably but instead of following up on that people attacked the woman you just saw really attacked her and then attacked us for giving her airtime pants on fire you're lying said the quote fact Checkers but she wasn't lying and Tony fouchy and many others in the US government knew that she wasn't lying in fact they knew the truth about where covid came from long before the rest of us had even heard the term Co in mid November of 2019 a friendly Asian government we have learned sent a cable to American officials warning that there was evidence or something strange going on in Wuhan and it looked like a dangerous leak from a biolab they knew that the origins of covid were never a secret the real story The Great outrage of this story is that the people who knew or should have known the truth lied about the truth why to hide the Chinese government's role in mass murder the killing of almost 7 million people and the destruction of the American economy that's the interesting part looking back 3 years later from the beginning of the outbreak the American Media as one took the side of the Chinese government in this new propaganda War over covid and Trump once again to his credit knew he knew exactly where this came from he didn't say so directly he should have but instead he alluded to it he called Co the China virus and when he did that he was over the target so the Chinese government attacked him they've learned a thing or two from watching American politics as a quote racist one Chinese news Outlet tweeted this quote racism is not the right tool to cover your own incompetence shut up racist they saw working in America we're going to try that and it worked and then the entire American Press Corp covered for the Chinese government people like David from at the Atlantic oh he's so smart d David FR immediately pared that slur from the Chinese government you have to ask yourself was David from taking money from Beijing to repeat their lies we can't confirm that but he might as well have been taking money from Beijing and it wasn't just David from NBC News calls the called the phrase Chinese virus quote both inaccurate and harmful in tying racist associations between the virus and those from China of course the virus was from China it was from a Chinese military biolab and it may have been released on purpose to kill people it didn't matter no one asked a single question Joe Biden and his lackes in the media all repeated the talking point watch this but neither should we Panic or fall back on xenophobia labeling covid-19 a foreign virus does not displace accountability president referred to the Corona virus as a quote foreign virus and I think it's going to spack uh it's going to come across to a lot of Americans as smacking of xenophobia the administration's Labb in of this virus as foreign is undoubtedly playing into the rising xenophobia about it Trump isn't cautioning us to check our racism but is rather stoking xenophobic sentiment the President says it's a foreign virus as if this was launched on us like an attack we know what that's about that's about him playing xenophobia works with his base why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus why do you keep using this from racist it's not racist at all no not at all it comes from China every one of the people you just saw should resign in disgrace and should spend the next decade in ashes and Sack sackcloth pondering what they've done which is cover for a crime and by the way if the US media had swung behind the evidence in this story and pressed where did this virus come from then it's at least potentially conceivable that scientists in the United States would have forced the government of China to release the information they had about the genetic makeup of covid maybe we've had a vaccine that worked for example or a Medical Response that saved Americans lives but they didn't none of them did the New York times's top Global health and covid reporter a person called apurvi purva mandav wrote quote someday we will stop talking about the lab League Theory and maybe even admit its racist Roots but alas that day is not today what where is the Oberlin sociology Department New York Times pipeline like when did that start why are they hiring the dumbest and most reflexive people who take their opinions wholesale from The Hive of Twitter there were a few people who are not deterred by racist shut up they said what was clearly true and for their trouble they were denounced as crazed science denier science deniers okay Senator Tom Cotton was attacked because he relied on a map and common sense to ask a very simple question here's what he said here's what we do know this virus did not originate in the Wuhan animal Market just a few miles away from that food market is China's only biosafety level four super laboratory that researches human infectious diseases now we don't have evidence that this disease originated there but because of China's duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning we need to at least ask the question well yeah and by the way that wasn't a guess a wet Market is a seafood market a penglin is a mammal so they weren't selling Pengalin in a seafood market for one thing for another a group of Chinese researchers went and interviewed everybody in the wet market and asked have you ever seen a penglin for sale here or bats another mammal no not one hat that was on the internet we read it we reported it that was February 2020 so what we knew at that point was the Chinese government's lying Tom Cotton was absolutely right and for his trouble he was called insane a conspiracy theory Tom Cotton a couple of days ago uh spouting a conspiracy theory that the Chinese made this virus up don't try to spool up uh some of whoever was wearing 10 tinf foil hats in your audience let's apply aam's razor and just oh crazy crazy this is crazy this is an insane thing to do it's just wildly irresponsible and was totally unnecessary I don't know what Tom Cotton gets out of this in the 1980s I remember when the far-left tra Tred in rumors about HIV having been invented in CIA Labs the farite has now found its own virus conspiracy theory oh yes let's have the plagiarist Fred Zakaria on to tell us about science but it wasn't just Tom Cotton who was attacked it's it's almost too unpleasant to bring you the story because the wall of dishonesty was impenetrable at that point 3 years ago the one thing we needed to know where where did this come from was the one thing they wouldn't let you even consider in fact if you did you would be unpersoned Facebook banned any user suggested the virus was man-made because and we're quoting the science was settled was not settled at all there was no science we didn't know anything as NPR reported quote scientists debunk lab accident theory of pandemic emergence really on what basis they had no evidence to quote debunk it but that didn't stop Vox from quote reporting and we're quoting now no Corona virus did not start in a Chinese lab they had no idea they were just Flatout Shilling for the Chinese government and hiding its complicity in mass murder what and then a woman called Laura helmouth the diversity hire now running the once but no longer respected publication Scientific American said quote it's a conspiracy theory to believe a lab leak had occurred but it did that's the thing facts still matter every facet every element every Link in the chain that connects every part of elite America to itself pushed the same lies even the the quote comedians they were on propaganda Duty too watch this he's also pushing us intelligence to find evidence for this theory that the virus was accidentally released from a lab in Wuhan that's his new angle to feed the Wingnuts to treat this virus like it was a conspiracy of some kind it should have never happened this plague should never have happened it could have been stopped but people chose not to stop it what people tomorrow he'll blame the Spanish Flu on Antonio Banderas yeah imagine if you're a comedian and all of a sudden your Q card has all kinds of talking points from politicians and foreign governments on it don't read it you degrade yourself and you become complicit in the greatest crime in history so you have to ask what role did the US intelligence agencies play in all of us of course they knew well at one point msnbc's Nicole Wallace the single most dishonest person on television now or ever claimed that and we're quoting Donald Trump is turning his intelligence Community to now investigate a conspiracy theory about covid coming from a lab and Wuhan by the way we're not watching this woman's show but is she in tears tonight begging the Forgiveness of her audience no but let's parse this for a second obviously she was wrong about the origins of the virus it did come from that lab intentionally or not but what's interesting is that she was also wrong about what Donald Trump's government under the leadership in part of Mike Pompeo was doing on March 17th 2020 a group of scientists wrote a paper in nature magazine that paper concluded that quote we do not believe that any type of laboratory based scenario is plausible now well that's the final word that's the science well internal NIH emails show that Tony fouchy helped edit that paper he did not disclose this publicly it was all behind the scenes now that's significant because fouchi was funding bat Corona virus experiments in Wuhan the ones that apparently caused the pandemic so he was editing the report on the origin of the virus okay that's not peer-reviewed as we say it's the opposite as Paul Thacker reports on his subst a few days after that paper was published in nature the state Department's office of Outreach part of the Bureau of intelligence and research began promoting these false finding these lies the state Department covertly recruited scientists to go around Washington DC and off the record high level meetings telling everyone who had listened that covid quote emerged naturally in an animal before Crossing to humans and was not engineered in a lab now the scientists who made this false briefing who told these lies cited One Source the nature article that was secretly edited by Tony fouchy in other words and we can give you a thousand other examples America's not China's America's entire leadership class from the government to the Intel agencies to elected officials to of course the media in unison spent years trying to hide Chinese culpability for the greatest crime in human history they cooked up fate papers and bogus data they attacked anyone who asked obvious questions even people who were in Wuhan at the time who knew and you have to ask why did they do this could it be that they were implicated in this too they were implicated in creating the worst pandemic in modern history we're not sure but it's an amazing story as we told you liangang was one of the first people to tell the truth in the United States a great personal cost she was there she joins us now drct thank you so much for coming on you said three years ago that you believe that this virus was intentionally released by the government you once worked for the government of China today we're hearing in this leak to the Wall Street Journal that it was accidental do you believe this leak was accidental or intentional hi teers thank you for having me again first I really want to appreciate you and also Fox News have been taking so much efforts pursuing the choose of Co origin without your help there won't be such Milestone achievement and I want tell of course it was not an accident and maybe for people who don't have this kind of B safety Labs three or four exper uh experence on Corona virus maybe it's easy for them to accept the accident and lab League however I'm the scientist working in sear lab using Corona virus and I can tell you based on the print uh protocol and also the other U surveillance uh system it will be impossible for the lab leag accidentally happened in such lab and caused the Wuhan outbreak and also the pandemic so definitely now we just reach to the first step it was from China's lab and we need to pursue the uh truth of origin and we need to keep going on we know the Chinese government allowed its infected citizens to travel in huge groups to Western Europe in the early days of the pandemic that was intentional but you believe the whole thing they came up with this virus and they Unleashed it on the World to destroy the Western economies and to elevate their own position globally I want uh uh emphasize one thing is I would say based on the evidence and Source I have that the last the virus was intentionally brought out of this strict lab and released in the community however I don't think the outbreak in Wuhan was intentional I would say it was because CCP government and Military scientist underestimates the transmissibility that's why finally it got out of control and caused a local a local outbreak however we should know that CCP government intentionally to Let It Go all over the world to kill millions of people all over the world later we just have to hope and pray that you will be interviewed by many other journalists in this country over the coming weeks now that this has been confirmed you're an eyewitness to it you have a I think a credible story to tell and I and I really hope you're no longer ignored I appreciate your coming on again tonight leing young thank you so much thank you terer so Florida is technically a state but there's always been a little country within Florida its own Mouse dominated Vatican called Disney but the new governor of Florida Ron DeSantis has put an end to Disney's corporate control over the State of Florida and he joins us straight ahead to explain why and how be right there well here's a trivia fact you may not have known since 1967 56 years the Disney Corporation has enjoyed near tootal control over about 40 square miles of Florida its own little Vatican City and this is by Act of the Florida legislature which empowered Disney to function effectively as its government Disney could even acquire territory outside its chunk of land by eminent domain just take it from people now last year people began to wonder why would Disney which is a totally politicized company they pushes race race hate and sexualized propaganda on children why would they have all these special benefits in the State of Florida hm good question so last year Florida's legislature passed a bill ending this weird little Arrangement Disney had of course they hated it Florida's governor Ronda santis pushed for and then signed that bill into law Governor D santis joins us tonight Governor thanks so much for coming on so why did you see this as an important thing to do as the governor well as you pointed out Tucker I mean no company or individual in Florida probably anywhere else in our our whole country has enjoyed their own governing status being exempt from most many of the laws of the State of Florida massive subsidies so it's not a good arrangement to begin with but if you remember last year they came out very strong against a piece of legislation to protect parents' rights and to protect young children from having sexualized curriculum in things like elementary school and then they had Executives talking about it was their uh intent to jam some of this sexualized programming in the Disney cartoons and programming for young kids so then we're in a situation Tucker where they're taking those positions as a company which are antithetical to our values but with this Arrangement Florida was subsidizing that type of activism that could no longer stand and so now today in the State of Florida for the first time since 1967 Disney no longer has its own government uh they're going to have to abide by the same laws as everybody else they're going to finally pay their fair share of taxes and pay all the debts that they've racked up over these decades but my understanding was in democracy unelected corporate Executives get to make your laws for you no well you know there's a lot of people in the corporate press that think that that's what they would rather have you know I just won by 1.5 million votes and then I go and do what I said I would do and they squeal they would much rather have Disney running the show in Central Florida but there's a new sheriff in town and I think that this is going to be good for the State of Florida and I'll tell you Tucker the people that work there have been very very thankful that we took this action the firefighters for example on site we're so glad that we're finally stepping up going to listen to them and going to treat them much better so you just wrote a book about what you've done in Florida called the courage should be free Florida's brute print if I can pronounce it for America's Revival it's out tomorrow what's it about well people would say how'd you do it in Florida I mean we've become the focus point of freedom in the United States and even around the world people look at Florida you just had someone from Spain saying a politician she wants Spain to be the Florida of Europe and I think what we do is we talk about the different fights that we've had our approach to leadership but at the end of the day Tucker you talk about it all the time on your show yes we got to fight overweening government very important and we have a very uh uh vast administrative state that we battle with Biden but you also have Corporate America going woke big Tech censoring so these are fights all across the scene and when you stand up for what's right they come after you it isn't easy so you got to have the courage of your convictions to stand strong but I think what we've shown in Florida if you do that and people see you're willing to fight for them they'll walk over broken glass Barefoot to vote for you and I'm proof positive that four years ago I won by 32,000 votes last November I won by 1.5 million votes yeah well movement is the ultimate election people are moving there so that kind of tells you I would say a lot governor and santz Florida thank you very much thank you so it's Saturday Night Live which is filmed live at NBC Studios at 30 Rock on 6th Avenue New York the audience always applauds because they're told to but if you watch on Saturday night you may have noticed the studio audience that night was weirdly quiet during the end of the opening monologue they didn't know what to do woody harelson was describing a crazy idea he'd had for a film script an idea so wild and unlikely no one could possibly take it seriously here's the idea so the movie goes like this the biggest drug cartels in the world get together and buy up all the media and all the politicians and force all the people in the world to stay locked in their homes and people can only come out if they take the cartel's drugs and keep taking them over and over I threw the script away I mean who is going to believe that crazy idea being forced to doe drugs wait did he just make fun of fizer I mean Catholic Church is one thing the family is other but fizer not allowed he must be insane and that was the verdict of the media the Washington Post for example reported this quote on SNL Woody harelson pushes popular covid-19 conspiracy theory really where's the conspiracy theory there The Daily Beast echoed that Woody harelson spews antivaxx conspiracies in Rambling SNL Monologue now Rolling Stone magazine which was founded to fight the power obviously came out on the side of the guy fighting the power Oh no just kidding Rolling Stone used exactly the same headline so the same people who said you're crazy for thinking that covid may have come from a Chinese biolab now say you're crazy if you dare to complain about fizer which is buying them off shut up don't laugh hard to think of a better way to make Woody haralson's Point than that so George casone is supposed to be a prosecutor he's so completely out of control so totally politicized that he's reached a point where he's more concerned with respecting fake trans pronouns than protecting people in Los Angeles from kid touchers he just suspended a prosecutor for correctly referring to a child molester by his sex and that prosecutor joins us next well it turns out leprechauns exist not just on cereal boxes there are a lot of people who believe they have seen a leprechaun or as they're known in some countries as an elf some people think they've seen elves and that would include the president of Mexico who announced that elves are real naturally foxes Trace Gallagher has that story for us tonight hey Trace hey Tucker the Mexican president Andre Manuel Lopez oor better known as amlo says the picture he tweeted out was taken a few days ago by an engineer who works for the Mexican Government it appears to show a tree with a branch framing what looks like a Halo of hair but Amo says it's a picture of an alux a mischievous Woodland Spirit an elf from Mayan folklore maybe amlo feels a kinship with the mythical Mayan elf who was known to Dart in and out of view and play tricks on humans only to leave them duped again and again interesting because a few years ago amlo promised to bring down crime and lift the economy and alas the people feel duped again this by the way is not the first mythical creature that amlo has touted he was recently quot calling Cuban dictator Miguel Diaz Canal the leader of a profoundly Humane government despite Cuba not having had a free election in 64 years but back to the elux the elf it's the biggest social media hit since residental Mobile Alabama swore they spotted a leprechaun up in a tree they did not get a good photo of the Irish Legend but the description prompted this drawing which itself is Legend finally you'll excuse the Mexican media for not poking more fun at amlo and his elf tweet Mexico is the most dangerous country on the planet for journalists Tucker It's just such a great story everything about that was amazing and we're grateful for you trace Galer thank you bet here's a sad story when he was 17 years old a man called James tubs sexually assaulted a 10-year-old girl it wasn't a close call he sexually assaulted her in the bathroom of a restaurant so under policies enacted by Los Angeles's Soros back da George gasone tubs receiv received just 2 years in juvenile detention so getting stuck in a cage with a bunch of other dudes is no fun no one likes it so tubs figured a way to get out he decided he's a woman and that meant he had access to women in jail as you'd expect on a recorded jail house phone call tubs praised gon's policies listen don't worry about it it's a strike but they're going to plead I'm gonna plead out to I'm plead guilty they're going to S me on probation and it's going to be dropped it's going to be done done I won't have to register once or nothing an offender you don't have to register I won't have to do none of that so what are they going to do to you that nothing and the call gets worse actually so disturbing we're not going to play it but tubs goes on to make shocking comments about his 10-year-old molestation victim but George cascone is not mad at him no he's mad at one of his own prosecutors for misgendering the child muster correctly identifying tubs as a man that prosecutor Shaya isak enough to join us tonight and we are grateful for that Santa thank you so much for coming on are we misstating any part of the story you were suspended for using correct pronouns about a man who pled to child molestation correct so I was suspended because I did not use the preferred pronoun of a child molester when notifying the administration that I had evidence that James tubs was perpetrating a fraud in the court playing the D DA's office and perpetrating a fraud in our justice system so by notifying everybody that they're being played I was punished because I did not use you know I hurt a child molester feelings by not using the correct pronoun I'm it's just incredible to me that you're coming on the show to say this out loud why are you doing this this cannot help your career to put it mildly um no but how could I not I'm obligated to I have kids um I know how innocent kids be and the fact that um I can't stand by while the misguided policies of a progressive prosecutor like George gascon are putting child molesters in juvenile facilities which is going to create more victims and hiding the fact from the court so that the court is sentencing juvenil to these facilities with known child molesters who are adults James tubs was 26 years old and came from prison to the juvenile facility so wasn't like this is a juvenile and was convicted as a juvenile he was 26 years old and you're putting him in a juvenile facility I Can't Stand By and subject children to the risk of being harmed it's a public safety risk and an extreme Injustice I I just find it amazing that you're willing to say that out loud and of course you would know because you were there and we're truly grateful uh for your bravery Shay Santa thank you very much for telling us that horrifying story thank you thank you so there's some debate online about whether there actually are more environmental disasters more accidents with critical infrastructure or whether we're just noticing them well we'll let you judge fires have broken out at three separate oil facilities all owned by the same company in a single day when the US government has been caught committing the biggest Act of environmental terrorism in history and blowing up the northstream pipeline Maybe they're connected maybe not we're going to tell you what's happening cuz you should know we'll be right back a lot of destructive coincidences have befallen critical infrastructure North America lately have you noticed here's the latest example fires have just erupted at three separate oil facilities belonging to the same company the Mexican state-owned oil giant PMX in one day one of these facilities is located in a place called Deer Park Texas also on Thursday two more PMX facilities went up in flames in verac Cruz Mexico at least two people died what caused these fires we don't know but whatever's going on is clearly alarming something you would attract some attention from the B Administration but no no one cares and that may be why a waste disposal facility in De Deer Park Texas just received more than 2 million gallons of poisoned water from the Ohio train derailment local officials say were're not informed of this in advance and why would they be because they're not Ukrainian so ESG stands for en environmental social and governance it's massively popular on Wall Street the idea is to use investment pressure to force countries to adopt a neoliberal agenda and those principles destroy countries like Sri Lanka which was pushed to abandoned chemical fertilizer and people people St starved so how does the average investor get out of ESG well Omid Malik has created a way he's chairman and CEO of colum bear acquisition Corp he joins us tonight Omid thanks so much for coming on if you're the average person and you don't want your money to go to destructive schemes that anti-human what option do you have well we all know the problem that Americans are sick and tired of buying from woke corporations that hate them but the problem has been how do you set up an actual Patriot economy uh if we can't find each other well today I'm proud to tell you that we have a solution and that is that Columbia the company just mentioned uh that's a public company that I run that trades on a New York Stock Exchange is taking a digital Marketplace called Public Square public you need an exchange to be the foundation of this economy which will connect like-minded buyers and sellers in this Patriot economy so what I'm proposing today is that we create the foundation of the economy that we all want and that you and I have described the most exciting part of this though is how huge this Market actually is and that's not something that's really talked about for the last 20 years our corporations have gone to places like India and China to try to find demand what if I were to tell you there's a market with over a 100 million people that represents the third largest economy by GDP and it's right under our noses put differently the last Emerging Market in the world is red America and it is being actively ignored and alienated by our own corporations so for the average person and I'm pronouncing the name correctly now columb investment the average person can can get involved in this directly without having to send money to some big investment firm that hates them and their values yeah and that's the beauty of why Public Square the digital app that we're taking public wanted to do this it's very important to them that they become a public company that just rank and file folks can go and buy and support the mission and that's what we're most excited about is the democratization of capital markets and we need to do this Tucker because as we've discussed in the past we are slouching towards social credit scores in this country and so we need to create this economy to ol at ourselves from that because the battlefield for Liberty will be around Commerce not just politics that's exactly right you can have all the opinions you want but if all the money is on the other side you're going to obey in the end I think that's I think that's absolutely right I mean Mal I hope you will come back thank you for doing this and great to see you my pleasure Tucker thank you we've got more news welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight the war in Ukraine began a year ago today on February 24th 2022 when the Russian military rolled across the eastern border of that country but in many ways the Russian invasion of Ukraine was the end point of a much longer story The propaganda campaign designed to convince Americans to take sides in this conflict a conflict that has nothing strictly speaking to do with them or with America that effort began many years earlier we' Peg it to July 22nd 2016 that's the day that Wikileaks published thousands of emails from the servers of the Democratic National Committee in Washington those emails Pro that party officials had rigged the Democratic process the primary process in favor of Hillary Clinton and against the Insurgent populace candidate that year Bernie Sanders of Vermont within days the chair of the DNC Debbie wman Schulz resigned in disgrace the wick leag Scandal broke on the same day that Hillary Clinton chose her running mate Senator Tim Kaine and it overshadowed the nominating convention that followed but more significantly the wikileak Scandal threatened to split the Democratic party into pieces more than 13 million Bernie Sanders voters many of the young people learned that the process they had always believed in was in fact a sham they had been cheated Democratic leaders had to act quickly in the face of this to deflect blame from themselves onto someone else the dnc's servers they claimed had been hacked by the Russian military the goal was to hurt Hillary Clinton whom the Russians feared for her strength and wisdom and to help Donald Trump whom they controlled Russia hacked the servers in order to hack the election that was their story The Washington Post ran with it the first day as if it were true but there was never any evidence that it was true almost 7 years later there is still no evidence the dnc's story about its servers is a lie but as a political strategy that lie worked flawlessly Russia made the perfect villain it was a white Christian country with a traditional social structure it was everything the Democratic party already opposed the foreign policy apparatus in Washington was happy to hate Russia again after 40 Years of Cold War hating Russia was muscle memory so soon the leaders of both parties in Washington signed on to the Russia collusion hoax it had the twin benefits of paralyzing the Trump Administration which it did and justifying the expansion of the National Security State as the years passed and the rhetoric intensified hysteria set in after a while anybody with a heterodox opinion from right-wingers to avowed socialists could be accused of working secretly for Vladimir Putin many were accused and some were destroyed by it it was a textbook Witch Hunt far more effective than McCarthyism and unlike McCarthyism it never ended Russia remained America's greatest enemy even as China emerged as America's greatest threat over time the lie that Democrats told to hide their crimes in the 2016 primaries came to dominate America's foreign policy and then to imperil America itself for Generations Statesmen and diplomats work to prevent other great powers from aligning as a block against the US the idea was pretty straightforward you might be able to beat one strong country but if a couple of strong countries ever got together you would lose this is why Richard Nixon went to China to make sure the Chinese government didn't align with bnv with the Russians Donald Trump understood this very clearly Russia will never be our closest Ally he said but if Russia ever becomes China's Ally we're in deep trouble the combination of Natural Resources military and economic power and sheer population would make the Russian Chinese Alliance the most powerful force in the world the United States would soon be dethroned we'd be taking orders As Trump put it there is no reason to make Russia our enemy and there are many reasons not to it was a sound case but official Washington ignored him their response shouted in unison shut up Putin stooge and then they set about trying to provoke a war with Russia now they have succeeded but the war we are fighting in Ukraine is not against Russia alone but also against Russia's newest Ally the People's Republic of China what Donald Trump predicted has happened and in the worst way if the war in Ukraine continues we will lose No Matter How It Ends the world order is being reshuffled as we watch and by the time it's over the US will no longer be at the top of the deck that is very obvious to the rest of the world but what's fascinating is how few Americans seem to understand what's happening or its consequences but how would they know no one in American politics or media will tell them the truth since the first hours after the invasion Americans have been fed a steady diet of increasingly absurd lies about Ukraine Google and Facebook have joined with the Biden Administration to censor any factual information that contradicts the official storyline it's dystopian Joe Biden's first remarks about the war gave no hint that we would be sending Advanced Weapons Systems and American Military advisers to Ukraine then supporting the entire Ukrainian govern government and its pension system with hundreds of billions of us tax dollars no Joe Biden mentioned only sanctions which are free sanctions he suggested would be enough here is Joe Biden a year ago today the Russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of Ukraine without provocation without justification without necessity this aggression cannot go unanswered if it did the consequences for America would be much worse America stands up to bullies We Stand Up For Freedom Putin is the aggressor Putin chose this war and now he in his country will bear the consequences today I'm authorizing additional strong sanctions strong sanctions that'll do it now the goal at that point a year ago today you may remember this was to push Russian forces back into their own country to reverse the invasion and that seemed reasonable to most people it did not seem like the beginning of a third world war oh but it was exactly that and by December Lindsey Graham was confident enough to say so out loud here he is how does this war end when Russia breaks and they take Putin out anything short of that the war is going to continue to ask the ukrainians to give Russia part of their country after all this death and destruction is not going to happen to Signal a ceased fire Russia will take the opportunity to rearm and come at them again so we're in it to win it and the only way you're going to win it is to break the Russian military and have somebody in Russia take Putin out so we're going to says Lindsey Graham confidently continue pouring billions into Ukraine until they quote take Putin out does Putin know this well we have no idea we're not allowed to see Russian media in this country that's too much information for Americans to handle but if Putin does know that we plan to kill him wouldn't he fight back with nuclear weapons why wouldn't he fight back with nuclear weapons no one in the United States seems to be allowed to wonder that much less have a conversation about it out loud instead we're treated to more lectures about democracy Ukraine is a democracy we're told that's why we're on the side of Ukraine the problem is that is a lie Ukraine is not a democracy Ukraine is a corrupt one- party State Ukraine has none of the freedoms that Define democratic governance freedom of speech freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of religion Ukraine is the least free place in all of Europe and probably for that reason it is Joe Biden's favorite place so for those who understand what is actually happening and what Ukraine is actually like it is very frustrating to watch Biden say this again and again it is guling to be lectured about democracy by a man who took power in an election so sketchy that many Americans don't believe it was even real Joe Biden has never had the majority of American support for a single day of the Ukraine war in fact Joe Biden is far less popular in the United States than Vladimir Putin is in Russia that is not an endorsement of Putin it's just true and it says everything about Joe Biden's tenuous legitimacy democracy please we're adults stop lying to us so what happens next in this war well according to our elderly treasury secretary Janet Yellen the war in Ukraine will go on forever and so will our support for zalinski let me make clear the United States um and the Allies uh our support for Ukraine will be lasting and is unconditional unconditional support for Ukraine unconditional support for a nation most Americans know nothing about and couldn't find on a map unconditional support that's a profound statement outside of your immediate family how many people would you pledge unconditional support to how many countries would you pledge unconditional support to this is insane when you think about it but the people in charge of This Disaster aren't thinking the way that most Americans do the Atlantic magazine commemorated the anniversary of the war by commissioning a piece today by Tom Nichols Nichols is a thoroughly silly foreign policy establishment parasite who apparently is taken seriously by other Nells and dumb people in Washington but the piece is fascinating in it he inadvertently reveals the point of this war is in the clearest possible terms quote now we are faced with the long grind of defeating moscow's armies and eventually rebuilding a better world oh defeating moscow's armies and building a better world perfect thank you Tom Nichol adding those items to this week's to-do list unspecified in the piece is exactly how we plan to do this how we plan to defeat Russia and its Ally China and then build Utopia the piece is notably light onto tals now you'd feel a little better hearing all this if Tom Nichols and others like him in Washington had a track record that suggested they could do any of this a track record of competence and success they don't Nichols himself seems to spend most of his life arguing with other people on Twitter he's never achieved anything at all that we're aware of but then virtually none of them have achieved anything Biden's Chief Ukraine strategist Toria nuland you would not hire her to plan spring break she couldn't do it she doesn't have the skills now these very same people these demonstrably incompetent people say they plan to rebuild a better world all right that seems ambitious how about starting with Baltimore before moving on to Total Global transformation shouldn't we fix the biggest city in Maryland First under the leadership of people like Tom Nichols and Tor newand neoliberal Geniuses with grand plans Baltimore has devolved into third world chaos but then so has Iraq and so has Libya and so has every other place these people people have decided to quote rebuild it should spur a moment of silence and self-reflection in the US state department that the moment Western diplomats and NOS left the country Afghanistan got safer there are far fewer killings in kabell now than there were 18 months ago pedestrians at Cabell can walk to dinner at night without being murdered now that fact doesn't tell the whole story of Afghanistan of course but we shouldn't ignore that fact it means something if you spend B ions trying to make a place better and it gets worse you have an obligation to think about why maybe you're doing it wrong maybe you're not as powerful and clever as you thought you were maybe there's a problem with your formula but none of this ever occurs to people like Tom Nichols and Toran nulan and for that matter Joe Biden the more discredited they are the more self-confident they become they see every failure as evidence that their talents are more desperately needed than ever what is this well it's called hubris hubris is the delusion that causes people to mistake themselves for God they imagine they have power and wisdom and foresight they don't actually possess that no human does huis is a species of mental illness these people are unwell they're crazy and there's nothing more dangerous than that huus has caused more suffering than polio it's caused more deaths than small poox and apparently we're in the middle of another epidemic of it Douglas McGregor is a retired army colonel who knows a lot about hubus he joins us tonight so not to single out Tom Nichols who's one among many people Afflicted with this but to say that our goal is to crush Putin's armies the armies the over Million Man armies of Russia and then rebuild a better world does that strike you as a little ambitious well not really if you consider the Washington strategy right now led by President Biden why fight one war when you can fight two at the same time against two of the most powerful nations in the world everything that the Biden Administration has touched thus far is a disaster the world is dollariz Europe's economies are are not growing Russia's economy is growing and growing faster than Europe's economies we have a fire sale on dollars and us treasuries last year Russia's budget deficit as a percentage of GDP was 2.3% America's budget deficit is a percentage of GDP was 5.4% the Ukrainian armed forces are facing a Manpower crisis they're hurting boys old men and women into uniform the Ukrainian armed forces are strained to the Limit without NATO military Manpower Manning and conducting operations the Ukrainian armed forces would fall apart then you look at NATO NATO is deeply divided turkey is ready to leave the alliance they're aligning more and more with each passing week with Central Asia with China with Russia and other countries Germany is desperate for the resources to keep its scientific industrial base functioning Germany is not going to stay in NATO if this war continues indefinitely and then finally you have Russia itself our greatest achievement has been to enable Putin to build a Russian military establishment that is larger and more powerful today than we have seen in 30 years and qualitatively it is superior to anything the Soviets fielded in the 1980s and as you and I speak the Russians are assembling the largest stockpile of artillery ammunition Rockets missiles and drones frankly since the second world war and they're about to hurl all of it at Ukraine and finish the job they began a year ago I grieve when I hear nice people in this country there are so many and I often hear it root for zilinsky like he's a sports hero they have no idea a what's at stake here in the massive Global realignment underway because they would have no way of knowing U because they don't watch you and the very few others who tell the truth I appreciate your coming on tonight dou thank you the B Administration has spent billions and billions well apparently hundreds of billions if you total it all up in Ukraine but it has done nothing for the people of East Palestine Ohio really does seem like a metaphor Aaron Brockovich joins us next on that and much more on the special edition of Tucker Carlson sun on the year anniversary of the war in Ukraine East Palestina and Ohio Ohio and Ukraine are not technically related in any way but you still can't help but notice the difference between how they are treated by the Biden Administration so the administration just announced another two billion dollars in funding for Ukraine we sent them over 100 million already but no money for the people and East Palestine who as you well know were exposed through no fault of their own to toxic chemicals Aaron brovich is in East Palestine tonight and we thought it would be interesting to talk to her and thank you so much for coming on do you know I mean can you see the disparity in oh of course can you see that the the disparity between the concern for the people of Ukraine know which I'm not discounting as as real with the concern for the people in East Palestine there seems to be a huge difference well it's certainly concerning to the people of East Palestine I mean you know we're pushing a month now and they still don't have any answers it's very obvious something's really gone wrong out here I've been out here down on the ground and they're really frustrated why they don't feel that their agencies or their Administration cares about what's happened to the community so it is very apparent they are are concerned and not being seen or heard so that you you make such an interesting point and I don't know the answer to this but you've been around this kind of thing before you think that there's something specific that they're not being told that's that's your sense yeah there is and I mean it's like oh my gosh come on we're out here I what 44,000 fish are dead we've seen them we've seen them out here today ating The Creeks they're removing stuff the the wellheads are locked what's up look you don't have to go any further in my opinion than a 100-year study that we all know the miners did for us it's called the canary and the M shaft send the canary down there it dies might not be good for humans you have dead fish might not be good for humans you have dead animals might not be good for humans you've sent a horrible mixed message to this community drink the water don't drink the water safe not safe it's it's horribly confusing and extremely frustrating to them and something actually has gone wrong here and there's information that has yet to come forward and the story will continue to unfold I it's so nicely put and I just want to pick up on something you said the well heads have been locked what did you mean so so in the schools uh so the children can't drink The Fountains and then on private Wheels around here they've got locks on them so they obviously come on if there's no problem you don't need to lock a a drinking fountain you don't need to be error rating the system and you you can explained away all day long to me that nothing's wrong but I I I I see what's going on here yeah I think it's better to make decis me it's better to make judgments on the evidence than on the words I agreee with that thank you Aon brovich good to see you tonight thank you Tucker it's nice to see you thank you Senator Josh Holly represents Missouri in the United States Senate he's been watching all of this Senator thanks so much for coming on you just can't have you you hate to connect unrelated stories but you just can't help but notice the difference in the level of concern for Ukraine versus Ohio yeah and I don't think they're unrelated at all Tucker I mean the truth is that Joe Biden and let's face it Congressional Republicans have spent over 100 billion dollar in counting on the Ukraine war and meanwhile the folks in East Palestine have poison in the water poison in the air it's clear that our infrastructure in this country is crumbling and what is this Administration doing about it frankly what is Congress doing about it not a whole heck of a lot and I think that that's a STK contrast and I would just say to Republicans listen you can either be the party of Ukraine and the globalists or you can be the party of East Palestine and the working people of this country but it's time to say to the Europeans no more welfare for Europeans let the Europeans take the lead on Europe it is time to put the working people of this country first to make those folks strong again and to make this country strong again if you keep ignoring people and short circuiting the Democratic process they get increasingly radical everyone's like Trump's so radical Trump's pretty moderate actually are you concerned that you could see actual radicalism in American politics just born of frustration why wouldn't that happen well you just look at at what the the mayor of East Palestine for example said Tucker you listen to the folks on the ground there and listen I hear the same thing all over Missouri my state is not so different from Ohio it's not different at all people say that the folks in Washington DC care more about the borders of Ukraine than they care about the borders of our own country they care more about what's going on over there than the drugs that are flooding into our schools and our communities in Missourri and every other state across this country they care more about other Count's roads and bridges than they do about our own so yeah I'm concerned I'm concerned about the fact that folks don't feel they're represented they don't feel they're spoken for and the truth is much of the time they're not and that's why I would just say to my fellow Republicans it's time for us to stand up and speak for the working people of this country and put them first amen because people will get too frustrated and that's no one wants to live in a really volatile country uh Senator Josh Holly Misouri thanks so much for coming on tonight thank you so what's interesting is how the worst most destructive people in the world are almost always painted as the heroes and vice versa so zalinsky who is clearly demonstrably a destroyer of things not a builder of things a destroyer has taken over $100 million in your tax money and now he's telling you how dare you question that and if you do question or future payments to him and his wife it's dangerous watch I would like to thank all of the American people that are supporting Ukraine the Congress the president the TV uh channels the journalists little more on that this special anniversary edition of Tucker Carlson tonight the one year anniversary of the war in Ukraine we'll be right back risking nuclear war to defend what we're calling democracy in Ukraine it might be worth checking in with Americans since in a democracy their opinion should matter so according to the polls Americans actual Americans think we should stop giving money to Ukraine in a new AP Poll for example just 37% of Americans favor sending taxpayer dollars to the corrupt and repressive government of Ukraine now the the man who runs that corrupt and repressive government zilinsky was just asked about this watch his response if they do not support Ukraine they will lose NATO they will lose um The Cloud of the United States they will lose the leadership position that they are joining in the world uh that they joined for a very fair reason and they will lose the support of the country with 40 millions of population with millions of children are American children's any different than ours don't Americans enjoy the the same things as we do I don't think we're that different if it happen so that Ukraine due to various opinions and weakening depleting of assistance loses Russia is going to end Baltic states NATO member states and then the us will have to send their sons and daughters exactly the same way as we are sending their sons and daughters to war and they will have to fight because it's a NATO that we're talking about and they will be dying they're selling that man as a hero and he has for a full year done his best to get your sons to Ukraine to die in beh half of his country he's not a hero he's an anti-hero he's a destroyer Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis is the defense priority senior fellow he joins us tonight I'm just amazed that the US media in conjunction with this Administration has been able to sell this guy who clearly has contempt for the lives of American citizens as George Washington how have they been able to do that yeah I it's it's been concerning me for quite a long time Tucker I'll tell you but this this clip you just played really it's kind of as a whole new level of basically claiming that it's It's Our obligation to go and fight on his behalf and and it's not look the the idea that he's fighting for NATO and for Europe and to prevent America is nonsense I'm sorry we have to be honest about this but you can tell after a full year of War Russia has eak out about 15% of One Nation on their border they pose absolutely no threat to Nato or to the United States national security because they don't even have the capacity so this is issue is between Russia and Ukraine and that's what needs to be resolved but the idea that this could expand to Nato and that we would have to go fight that would only be a choice that we make completely outside of any need for our country why is Noone stood up really every single day for the last year to say you know you may feel for the ukrainians I certainly do we owe no historic debt to Ukraine we have no historic connection to Ukraine we have no treaty with Ukraine we have nothing to do with Ukraine any more than we do with East timour or Congo like this is insane why no one say anything about it right yeah and and I and I think that I I suspect that that's starting to change because look we have absolutely been over backwards to help Ukraine and given a staggering amount of our own national security equipment and yet it's more and more as demanded and now they I think he actually wants us to go and fight for him which I can understand from his perspective but I cannot understand from our perspective and it is time for us to say we need to focus on American National Security and on American needs and that does not mean getting close to to potentially striking a war between Russia and the United States nicely put Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis for us tonight thank you always my pleasure so the Biden Administration has effectively ignored East Palestine Ohio and and really all of Ohio which has been rotting for years parts of it and went and said to Kiev this week the aid Sirens played for maximum dramatic effect the media was deeply impressed by the whole warlike display he's Churchill to find a day of this kind of presidential bravery in a war zone you've got to go all the way back to 1864 July when Abraham Lincoln as president went to see Confederate soldiers who were firing on Washington DC I think it's historic uh it's like when JFK went to Berlin in 1963 when Ronald Reagan went to West Berlin in 1987 and said Mr Gorbachev tear tear down this wall sininsky has been called The Church of Our Generation and Biden going there today I think it's going to be a a moment for the history books what an inspiring day what an inspiring few days a Drew immediate parallels uh to JFK in Berlin uh Reagan at the Brandenburg gate saying Mr gorbachov tear down this wall of course the danger was far greater for Joe Biden this was just about as good as it gets the dishonesty and the recklessness the pure stupidity and the aggression really boggles the mind Glenn Greenwald is the host of the Fantastic show system update which airs every day on Rumble we're happy to have him join us Glenn thanks so much for coming you feel like maybe we've passed a threshold in propaganda where there's kind of no coming back if Doug Brinkley can say something like that that's just so obviously untrue on every level like where does that leave us I think it's the key is to actually acknowledge how potent War propaganda is if you look at the opinion of the American people which I know nobody cares about and you ask them should the United unit States be the world's policeman overwhelmingly 80% will still say no if you ask them do you think the United States is involving itself in too many wars overwhelmingly Americans will say yes and yet every time we're presented with a new war they're able to Rally the public to support it including a country that most Americans have never given any thought to for good reason before which is Ukraine that has no vital interest to the United States and now we're there for a year pouring more and more money and more and more Weaponry into it even though it has nothing to do with the of the American people except a tiny sliver of Elites who work for rathon in the CIA and the reason is is because they depict something as Bal and Theatrical and contrived as Biden's trip to Kiev for 5 hours as some sort of world historic event that everyone in reality will be forgetting about by next Tuesday and it's constantly designed to play at the heartstrings and the decent impulses of the American people to support things that are just not in their interest are you worried big picture that Americans will become so frustrated at being ignored by their leaders really mocked by their leaders that they'll get radical in a way that's dangerous I think you're seeing that around the world the reason why people are turning to all kinds of anti-establishment leaders or anti-establishment proposals like brexit where the United Kingdom just removed itself from the EU or turning to very unconventional leaders like Trump or bonaro and Brazil and the like is because whoever promises to burn down the establishment the Democratic and the Republican Party establishment or the Western military establishment that people know are not on their side the public will go to them regardless of who they are that is how much the hatred has compiled and assembled for these institutions and I have to say it's welld deserved so yes you can have negative outcomes but these institutions have made their own bed and now they're lying in it that's right but I mean bolsonaro and Trump let's be honest propaganda are moderate guys like they both believed in the system but you could get people who truly want to burn it down and they would have an audience because people are so justifiably infuriated yeah I mean the the contrast between what is happening in Ohio and what is happening in Ukraine that everybody ignores these people in Ohio because as we know those are the people in our country who do not count and they all know it and if you get to the point where tens of millions of people start to realize that the political class and their political leaders in both parties do not care about them at all they're will eventually lead to as you say something far more radical than the supposedly radical leaders we've already had and that can be dangerous but it can also be healthy and whether but but when you start trifling with that stuff the results are really unpredictable but I want to say again that the fault lies with this establishment that is just growing increasingly arrogant and insular that every word that you just uttered is true and I think very wise and people should pay attention Glen Greenwall thank you so much great to see you thank you Tucker so the Biden Administration committed the single largest most profound Act of industrial terrorism of sabotage in history they blew up the nordstream pipeline which brought energy from Eastern Europe to Western Europe the consequences of this will unfold over the generations we're going to bring you a update on that next on the special edition of talk Carlson night the northstream pipeline was one of the most important pieces of infrastructure in the world it supplied energy to our NATO allies in Western Europe it helped Western Europe continue then it blew up who blew it up well the bid Administration has had promised to blow it up and then it exploded and afterwards the White House and the media claimed Russia did it Russia they blew up their own pipeline voria nuland at the state department a truly Sinister figure admits she's very pleased the pipeline is gone well none of this makes any sense obviously the Biden Administration blew it up there's really no doubt about that but Democrats are sticking with the lie that no Russia did it we thought we'd ask Jimmy dor who he thinks did it he's the host of the Jimmy door show he joins us now Jimmy door thanks so much for coming on so it seems obvious the Biden people did it but in doing it they not only causes massive environmental catastrophe but they also shafted their so-called NATO allies why does no one seem to care about this well be uh you know Americans uh are are well people forget what happened is Americans are the most propagandized people in the world right and they don't even know what's happening with the nordstream pipeline what's they think that propaganda happens to other people so this is 100% propaganda War and why doesn't Joe Biden want to investigate this why doesn't Congress want to investigate this if they investigate it they'll know it it'll show that the United States didn't do it and Russia did it so why don't they want to investigate it Sweden Denmark and Norway already did their own investigation of this they won't release it why won't they release this investigations just like they don't want to investigate the cause of the Corona virus outbreak they don't want to know the answers they don't want to investigate them because they already know the answers you know America is turned into Chris Hedges has called the America a mafia State a tiny Cal of people have control of our government and they're using it to do War for economic profit you know what youed the difference between our Mafia State now back then the mafia helped defeat the Nazis back then now we're actually arming Nazis you know and isn't it just like America to ignore the Nazis that are suffering here at home trying to buy eggs while we fund Nazis and other countries it's unbelievable what's happening this is the this is really about World War III and why aren't they investigating it no now they won't even ask them a question you know saur's art uh article came out detailing how they all blew up the nordstream pipeline and the American Press won't even ask the people he named in that article a question about it they won't ask Victoria Nan they won't ask Jess Sullivan they won't ask Anthony blinkin in fact those people won't even give a statement about it you know who will talk about it Kirby the press secretary at the white house because I'm sure the people who did the investigations have a pipeline right to uh Kirby but not to Anthony blinkin not to Sullivan not Victoria neon by the way these are the same people who lied us into the Iraq War lied to us about Libya lied to us about Syria dropped so many bombs in Syria they ran out of bombs they're doing the same thing America is the world's terrorist we have 400 military bases surrounding China we provoke this by people don't know that the CIA got in bed with the right-wing Nazis in Ukraine to overthrow the democratically elected government of Ukraine in 2014 we had a we had a peace deal it was called the mince Accord and then they violated who violated it Ukraine kept sh shelling the donbass which are the Russian speakers in the eastern part of the Ukraine and that's why Putin had to be provoked to invade to protect those people nobody will tell you that everybody who talks about every other news station by the way you're the only one doing this and I applaud you for letting people come out and tell the truth about what's actually happening in Ukraine other stations when I watch what they do is they start the history of Ukraine from Putin's invasion they never tell you that we overthrew their de democratically elected government in 2014 they never tell you that they didn't stop shelling the people in the D they never abided by the minst Accord they don't tell you that the former uh German Prime Minister said that the the reason why they did the men the cords in the first place was so that Ukraine could build up their military to get ready for this war that they're provoking so the American people are waking up there was a big okay uh anyway I'll leave it there you sound like a Putin shill Jimmy door you're this is the most propagandized country in the world makes me sad to agree with you but I but I do Jimmy D thank you so much thank you so we're going to take a quick break from the super depressing news from Ukraine on this one- year anniversary to show you part of a fascinating conversation we just had with Mr Wonderful Kevin o that's next Yi is one of the most successful certainly one of the most famous investors and businessmen around because he's a TV star in addition to a businessman he's on Shark Tank and has been for 15 years he's Canadian he has a really interesting analysis of the economy and the United States and basically he believes certain places are becoming very different from other places and there will be no business in places like New York and California before long we talked to him for a brand new episode of Tucker Carlson today here's part of it Massachusetts is at war with entrepreneurship Elizabeth Warren will punish you for Success she will make sure you pay super taxes if you're successful the regulatory environment there is prohibitive for business New York even worse New Jersey forget about it California is not in business you can't do business there and they're leaving like droves out of there so this competition of states is beginning to occur I could put money anywhere anywhere why because the pandemic changed our economy 40% of my staff at every company regardless what city they're headquartered in Works remotely that's never going to change primarily in accounting Logistics some marketing positions certainly sales you just don't need to be in the office anymore I know there's guys trying to get everybody back but you can see through empty buildings in New York City they're just not coming back they never going to they don't want to pay those taxes but the point is they're never going to what happens to Sixth Avenue I think you turn it into condos I mean what else you going to do but who's going to why would why would people live there if they don't have to go to the office I'm not I'm not cap rates in other words the cost of real estate in in some of these places where it's highly now if you talk to real estate developers in New York and I hear them every day they'll talk their book to the cows come home the truth is in commercial real estate they got issues like real ones yeah because people don't want to put the Nexus of their business in a place where AOC is telling you I hate you I'm going to litigate you I'm going to sue you I'm going to make sure that you can't create a job do you remember the Amazon 10,000 jobs well she kicked out of there the guy that was running that program I know personally he said wow was I ever glad we get out of that mess they hate us there they don't want our jobs well which jobs are they going to get exactly like when you start chasing away entrepreneurial Capital so my whole point is there are goto States and there's no go States and no go States right now are New York New Jersey Massachusetts California you cannot invest in those places they are no longer investable interesting interesting perspective Kevin oi that conversation on Fox Nation right now so District Attorneys backed by George Soros are not simply ignoring the law in making major American cities unlivable they're enforcing radical crazed gender ideology the Soros back da in Los Angeles George gasone just suspended one of his prosecutors Shay Santa why because Santa supposedly used the wrong pronoun to refer to a convicted child molester called Hannah tubs that prosecutor is going to join us on Monday and we really look forward to that and a lot more by the way the show has learned there's a brand new book being marketed to kids that celebrates our fake trans Admiral Richard LaVine now called Rachel it's called she persisted because trans women are women anyway order in the book dramatic reading have the best weekend"
