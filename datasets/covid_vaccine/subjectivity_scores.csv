0,2IXl4qJGrRk,A man deliberately got 217 Covid shots. Here’s what happened,"A German man has puzzled scientists after he deliberately got more than 200 COVID19 vaccinations. 217 to be exact, over two and a half years. That's a shot every four days, roughly. CNN health reporter Meg Terrell is here to explain more. Meg, this guy sort of became a voluntary science experiment. Yeah, Boris. They call this guy a hypervaccinated individual. And researchers sort of found out about him through media reports, as he was already more than 200 shots into this self-experiment he was doing. And they asked if they could study him. He was actually being investigated by the authorities in Germany for potential fraud. They suspected maybe he was trying to sell vaccination cards, but no charges were ever filed against him there. Now, this guy is 62 years old. As you said, 217 COVID19 vaccinations within the span of 29 months. If you look at the pattern of some of these, and we've got a bar chart here that shows the dates of some of these shots, and these are not even all of them, but if you just look in this one-year span, he was getting maybe one or two per month as the beginning of the year was happening. As he gets into January of 2022, he got 48 shots within that one-month period. Most days of that month, he was getting two shots per day, one in each arm. He continued with a large number of shots in February, then dropped down to just six in March. Of course, scientists are wondering what the effect was on him. First of all, he didn't report any vaccine-related side effects at all, which is sort of crazy to think about when you think about how you feel about getting a COVID shot the next day. Secondly, his immune response did show an increase in immune cells, like antibodies and T cells, but not necessarily a better or worse immune response, even after more than 200 COVID vaccines. And finally, guys, he never got SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID. But of course, the researchers say they don't know if that's because of so many vaccines, because of just the first few vaccines, or because of his behavior or something else. But this leading to quite an interesting N of one person experiment, guys. Yeah, maybe tough to answer why someone would get 217 COVID vaccinations in two years. But Meg, walk us through the sane current recommendations on how many COVID19 vaccines to get. Yeah, it goes without saying it is not 200. Right now in the United States, the general recommendation is one updated each fall, similarly to how we get the flu vaccine. And we know that only a fraction of people are actually getting an annual COVID shot at this point. The CDC did also just come out and recommend an additional shot now for people over the age of 65 to increase their immunity. So you're talking about a couple shots per year against COVID, really at the most, this guy going way outside of those bounds. But luckily, he seems to be okay. Exponentially, to say the least. Meg Turrell, thanks so much for the update on this really odd story. Thanks, Meg.",0.4114357864357864

3,WhiBpmH1mE4,MAN GETS 217 COVID VACCINES! 😱😱😱 THIS is What Happened to Him! A Doctor Explains!,"A 62 year old man who lives in Germany got 217 COVID vaccines. That's right. He did this deliberately and for private reasons as written up by researchers who studied him. This was written up in the journal The Lancet. But yes, he got 217 COVID vaccines within a period of 29 months. He was getting a lot of vaccines a lot of the time, guys. And the study authors, and let me just mention this, he started getting these vaccines. It started making headlines and researchers reached out to him asking if they could study him. Anyway, they did. Of course, what he was doing was not part of any sort of clinical study protocol against doctor's advice, against national recommendations, of course. But one of the interesting things, believe it or not, is that there were no signs of past SARS-CoV-2 infection. The researchers tested him and checked him many different ways. I would hope not, but that's what we didn't have any evidence of having had COVID. So what happened to him? What did the scientist learn by studying this gentleman who got 217 COVID vaccines? Well, let me read to you what the study authors say. They say that our case shows that SARS-CoV-2 hyper vaccination, which is what this gentleman did, he hyper vaccinated himself, did not lead to adverse events, which means he didn't have any crazy side effects, and did increase the quantity, the number of spike-specific antibodies in T cells without having a strong positive or negative effect on the intrinsic quality of adaptive immune responses. Also, they say they found no signs of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections and this gentleman to date. But they do caution us by saying that any conclusions that they have made about him cannot be generalized to the greater population because he is just one person. They also say that hyper vaccination is not a strategy that is recommended by doctors, by national guidelines, etc. So in other words, do not try this at home.

4,LfmhYVCCGhc,Joe Rogan says tons of people &quot;died suddenly&quot; from COVID vaccine,"  This is really painful to watch. On  the bonus show today, we are going to talk about   the continued influence of the Joe Rogan Podcast.  We are going to talk about how, I mean, listen,   influential is the most accurate word about the  Joe Rogan podcast, and that's part of why this   is so painful to see. On a recent episode, Joe  Rogan, on whose show I've appeared twice, just   casually said, you know, it's crazy how many young  people got vaccinated and then died suddenly.   This is one of the most, what's the word? Is  it destructive? Is it pernicious? Is it just   dishonest? Is it inaccurate? Is it depressing?  What misstatements and inaccuracies about the   Covid vaccine? I'm going to play it for you. Then  we're going to talk about it. Listen to this.   This is how many people  were promoters of the vaccine,   then died suddenly. It's crazy how many young  people just died in their sleep after they took   it. And everybody's like nothing to see here.  Sudden adult death syndrome.   Yeah. Just died suddenly. You ever  go to the died suddenly Instagram page like,   Holy. There's so many and so many people like  talking about people who are, you know, anti   Darwin anti-vaxxers and then then you're dead.  Sorry if you bought, you bought into the wrong   bullshit. But that's, you know, if you really want  to get cruel, that's Darwinism. Do you not know   they lie by now do you not. Are you not aware of  the opioid crisis? You're not aware of vioxx? Not   aware of the very like to 25 percent of all FDA approved  drugs that get pulled? It's one out of four and   you're like, really? You're an anti-vax really  reality. What are you, a conspiracy theorist? You   fool. Darwin's going to do its work with you.  You're modifying your genes, you idiot. Like,   what are you doing? What are you doing? You're  just going to trust Pfizer. Well, they do support   Anderson Cooper. Brought to you by Pfizer.  Oh boy. Oh my goodness. Where do   you even start with this? Where do you even start?  With the amount of damage that is being done here?   You know, every single one of these claims is  wrong. First of all, the idea that the vaccine   modifies your genes. It's not true. It's been said  so many times. It's been explained no matter what   sort of medical expert you have, explain it. Some  of these folks just don't want to accept it or   believe it. He talks about the movie died suddenly  and the Facebook page died suddenly. That is a   propaganda film, widely debunked and completely  non empirically based. Which features a bunch of   headlines that you can find on Google about people  that died and then suggests this never used to   happen. Healthy young adults never used to die.  And it's happening now at a greater rate than it   used to. And it's because of the vaccine and the  film has gotten. At one point it was more than 20   million views. It's so hard to know because it's  on different platforms. And yeah, tens of millions   of views is fair to say. And, when you look into  the film, you find that, number one, the rate of   these, deaths hasn't increased other than by  the degree to which we know people have died   from Covid. We also have investigated some of the  specific people that died suddenly. They weren't   even vaccinated. So some of the people featured  in the film were not actually vaccinated with   the Covid vaccine. So total propaganda film that  is leading people dangerously astray. And then,   you know, there's always some, as Sam Harris  said to me last week in our interview or the   week last week, you. Sometimes these conspiracy  theories have some grain of truth. And the grain   of truth here is pharmaceutical companies  have lied and pharmaceutical companies have   done bad things. Joe Rogan mentions vioxx and  he mentions opioids. It's really important to   understand that these are dramatically different  sorts of medications. Vioxx was an Nsaid designed   to treat pain and inflammation, marketed for  osteoarthritis and for some acute pain conditions,   and it was withdrawn from the market because there  were concerns it would increase heart attack and   stroke if you used it for a long period of time.  Okay. The opioid crisis. Opioids are an entire   class of prescription pain relievers. You've got  your oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine and others.   The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. They  are known for pain relieving effects, but huge   addiction, potential overdose. We, know about the  Sackler family and their, deliberate, deception   when it comes to clinical trials, side effects  and risk for addiction, etc.. Vaccines are meant   to help the body generate immunity without getting  the disease. That's the idea. And vaccines are one   of the most effective ways to prevent diseases,  including diseases that can cause death, as well   as diseases that are that are less likely to cause  death. So when you look at the risk profiles with   vioxx, the risk was related to cardiovascular  events, and it was significant enough to say,   we've got to withdraw this from the market. With  opioids, you've got addiction risk, dependency,   overdose, death risk. These are significant, and  it has generated a public health crisis. Vaccines   are low risk. Most side effects are extremely  mild and temporary. Even the more rare serious   side effects almost always resolve on their  own. When we've talked about the myocarditis,   pericarditis, and do you sometimes get a serious  adverse event? Are there a few people that have   died from serious vaccine side effects? From  just about any vaccine? Yes. But the point is,   you don't suspend an incredibly successful  and effective public health campaign because   any intervention can have these extremely rare  side effects. You look at opioids and vioxx,   it's a completely different, situation. So anyway,  the vioxx opioid comparisons are just absurd. It's   really sad to see Rogan go in this direction.  And, you know, I don't know who people write to   me. They go, David, you know, if only he would  allow you back on, you could set them straight.   First of all, it's not about setting people  straight. I don't know if he would ever have   me back on. I would appear anytime. That's what  I've said. And, that that's where I will leave it",0.5358422340898975
5,oFDOQ9Pn-XM,Man vaccinated 217 times for Covid,"A German man has gone against doctors orders and had 217 Covid jabs, which he administered himself. The 62-year-old had the vaccinations over a period of 29 months and showed no side effects. For comparison, people in the UK will have had up to 7 jabs. Researchers at a German university read about him in the newspaper and invited him to undergo various tests. They worried that so much exposure to Covid might have weakened his immune response, but they actually found his immunity was the same as someone who had the standard three doses. And saw no traces of him having had Covid. But they stressed there's no indication that anyone should need to have any more than three doses with top-ups for vulnerable people.",0.2138888888888888
6,-Ea3UwYZnrA,Long covid and long vaccine," well a warm welcome to this talk and a particularly warm welcome back to Professor Robert clany all the way from Sydney Professor welcome back and thank you for coming my great pleasure John as always now Robert Clans is well known to the the channel he's a consultant physician a professor of immunology and holds qualifications in Medicine Science and pathology and is a holder of the Australia medal so great to great to have him back now you've been doing quite a lot of work recent L Robert on uh long Co and I think we should say that one of the big advantages of being shall we say at our stages in later stages in our careers is you don't have to worry about publication so much so quite a lot of what we're going to talk about now is fairly original work so thank you for sharing that with us so we want to talk about um post vaccine and post infection long covid um now both of these syndromes you you you've been seeing you've been seeing patients with these can you just tell us roughly roughly roughly what you see patients with long covid patients with long covid vaccine injury what are what are you seeing well I think the first point uh John is that uh there's no great mystery to to these conditions uh what happened was with the infection uh initially people were seeing ongoing symptoms and came up with a diagnosis that was vague and confusing and it was called long coov now long coov was anybody who had symptoms following Co infection that persisted for more than 3 months and the confusion for this is that it it included a number of different problems and every patient had a different mix of these problems and so uh for people who uh were working outside of say Immunology and related um related disciplines it it was incredibly difficult but to simplify there there are basically two different components uh it's been known really since the late 1800s that people who get particular infections uh have a chance of getting a persistent fatigue illness that follows it and that's quite it's nothing different about Co and so the essential component of long Co is what is essentially post viral infection fatigue and it has two Central components the first is what I call Energy activated fatigue which means that if you do something uh then you pay for it you get more fatigue and the way I discuss that with patients is I talk about a ceiling I say we've all got a ceiling and uh in people with post viral fatigue syndrome long Co that ceiling comes down and if you try to push yourself with energy then you hit that ceiling that ceiling pays you back and you suffer for hours or days with of increased fatigue uh and um Associated characteristics the the second character the second feature of this uh chronic inflammatory state is cognitive defects and most people don't say I've got a cognitive defect they say I've got brain fog and uh it comes in many different forms I always have I had a I worked at McMaster University in Canada for some years and set up the Immunology Department there and I I remember I had this wonderful patient uh who was always late for appointments and um I once said why is it that you're always late you know I'm seeing you at the end of the clinic when you're actually supposed to be here 2 hours ago she said well it's it's part of my my problem I stand at the bus stop and I see the bus coming along and it says mcmas University and by the time it's sort of registered the bus is gone and I've got to wait for the next one and so there are all sorts of variations I had other patients who were Math teachers who had to give up because they they couldn't sit and look at the board and do simple mathematics so brain fog is a terribly a terribly incapacitating problem but when we came to Long co uh patients had these symptoms but they had other sets of symptoms which were more structural damage and so while in classic chronic fatigue illnesses you don't have so much in the way of structural damage to tissues the brain the heart in Long Co you did and that's because uh if you look at the underpinning cause of all of these it's the antigen is persistent uh in classic chronic fatigue it's commonly not always but commonly the epstar bar virus which is the virus in my country we call glandular fever I'm not sure what you call in in England is it glandular fever or infe nucleo well the Americans like yeah we would say glandular fever or if you're feeling a bit more correct infectious mononucleosis yeah there's a lot of confusion of but there's no question that a number of patients will have that incarcerated into their cells and under various stresses uh the virus escapes and you get fatigue illness maybe a sore throat big lymph nodes uh things like that and so we've known a lot about that but long um long Co and the patients had damage to their peripheral nerves often uh small fiber neuropathy with burning feet burning legs uh major problems in the brain uh cardiac issues a whole range of structural abnormalities and they got all thrown in together and you can understand the the confusion of people saying well how do I sort this out you know there's no obvious treatment um what's going on here and that's the way I know it's interesting I knowing that we were going to talk today I I just printed out uh the latest paper that I found on cause of um long Co which came out just last month and um it's a very interesting paper because it's full of detail but not full of message and it's whole list of different things that people see without saying wait a second what's the big picture here what's really going on and unless you approach it in that way you can't really really help the patient because the patient wants to understand what's going on and wants to have some logic in terms of what they can do about it uh and I I think that's where an immunologist basically looks after these patients I mean people with chronic fatigue illness have usually fallen into the basket of clinical Immunology because um most people who work in vertical systems like chest or heart or lung or brain um look at a particular disease in that system whereas immunologists look at a mechanism across the different systems and so we try to understand a process that's going on in a a person with autoimmune disease chronic fatigue illness various conditions like that and then address the diagnosis uh in that form uh look at tests that might help understand that process and medications or processes that can help uh the patient with those issues so I I think that's the broad sort of difference that underpins this now so that was chronic that was chronic fatigue in the context of um of U the covid infection and then more recently people are saying wait a second I'm seeing people uh who have had vaccination who have never had uh uh uh Co and these people are developing very similar symptoms uh and I I see in I don't see a lot of patients these days but I certainly see a number and I I have a number of patients who have uh had vaccines never had Co um but they've got essentially long Co syndromes and again it's a mixture of classic um energy activated fatigue brain fog together with certain structural problems uh so and the reason that it's very similar is that the persistent antigen is the same antigen it's Spike protein so you're getting Spike protein from the infection Co and that can persist at least 12 months maybe a lot longer in some of these patients whereas uh with vaccine we know that the spike protein the messenger RNA vaccine that is given uh disseminates through the body uh it provides expression of the spike protein on potentially any cell in the body and that can go on for months or year at least a year and remember the these are new syndromes we we didn't know about them until the the last couple of years so we don't know how long these conditions go but the bottom line is that there's the same cause for the Post vaccine long Co if you like and the post infection long Co and this is incredibly important to understand and sadly it is not understood very widely because if you go and have I've got a patient at the moment who had uh postvaccine uh long Co and then got Co infection and of course um people said who dear me all those terrible symptoms you've got of long they've got worse um we thought if you'd had a vaccine you'd get um much less problem with with with Co but of course uh it's a totally different situation when you're looking at a small proportion of people who get postvaccine long Co to the average person who might get uh a a vaccine which reduces the intensity of covid and therefore is linked to a degree of less chance of getting severe long Co disease and so there's this commonality of persistent antigen that underpins both those conditions and we need to understand that if we're going to apply effective management strategies it's it's really quite hard to understand this so when someone's vaccinated if they get this long vaccine covid situation instead of producing the antigen for a few hours they're producing the antigen chronically over o over a year or or more um what what is what is happening there how can the vaccine which is a single dose go on and produce Spike protein for a year or more well I think that's that's the big question isn't it and the answer is fairly straightforward that if you have a messenger RNA vaccine that messenger RNA we know um in the way in which it's packaged and presented will go throughout the body and can uh be taken up into essentially any cell in the body now when it does that it the messenger RNA uh expresses through the ribosomal system in the cell the factory for proteins it it it expresses Spike protein which is represented on the surface of the cell and can be detected in blood uh for a length of time now when it's expressed on the uh length of um uh on on the cell surface uh in most people it's probably only a relatively short period of time but in some people in fact a significant number of people they'll express it for a long period of time and they get an immune response because that remember that's what you're trying to to do with messenger RNA vaccine you're trying to stimulate an immune response but what uh was not understood and and sadly had not been properly tested right at the beginning uh was that this antigen um Can persist for a long period of time and be the focus of a self-destructive immune response very similar to autoimmune disease and that's exactly what's causing one of the two main causes of the structural damage I'm talking about remember I I said you get a chronic inflammatory situation due to the Persistence of the antigen and an ineffective immune response that's not clearing it which leads to lowlevel inflammation which leads to the exercise induced fatigue and the brain fog but now you can also Express this antigen uh as a foreign antigen on the cell surface and that's destroyed by t-lymphocytes as that's the job of the T it's not supposed to do that because it's someone's injected messenger RNA into you uh and so you get structural damage uh one of the commonest ones I see are people with um small fiber neuropathy um which is terribly disconcerting uh Burning uh feet uh disbalance um neurological issues flare up of demyelinating diseases uh cardiac issues uh all of these structural damages and they're different in every person which makes understanding and analyzing postco either postco syndrome extremely complicated and extremely difficult I mean it's it's probably getting into the pathophysiology a bit but if you're going to go on produce producing Spike protein for a year after vaccine do you think that means that the RNA has somehow gone into the DNA and there's an ongoing process of transcription here I think there are probably two ways of answering that firstly I don't think there's any doubt that you can reverse transcribe into DNA that's been shown in human cells uh at least to my knowledge on three occasions um and and that is a worry in its own and quite different to the problems we're talking about here uh that's looking at how I can change DNA expression in the individual uh it ra it raises all the questions of um um Progressive and expanded cancer uh it looks at transgenerational defects if it gets into the germline cells uh so that's that's a different issue here we're talking about messenger RNA without necessarily going to DNA just working doing what messenger RNA does and that's code for the amino acid sequence in a protein on the ribosomal Factory in the cell and so you're making all a spike protein don't need the DNA for that uh you've got the the DNA normally makes messenger RNA but we're actually giving messenger RNA so we're we're we're adding to to to the pool and so you've got all these cells making Spike protein for God only knows how long uh we don't know how long a long time and um that's creating uh and one of the factors that conditions a very important factor because not everyone gets postco not everyone gets fatigued uh it would seem that there is a subset of people who are more prone to develop um persistent nonresolved antigen in other words the messenger RNA keeps producing antigen and the body's immune response doesn't effectively clear it um if we had a lot of time I could run through the the the background information for this but let me just summarize and say in my view about 20 percent of people are fatigue prone uh there's a phenotype um you know you look at kids who go to university and say how many of you you uh have ever had fatigue at the time of exams and whatever bit of a sore throat about 20 percent will say that about 20 percent of athletes um get uh um essentially overtraining syndrome which is a a form of chronic fatigue it's a form that most people with chronic fatigue would love to have means they just drop their their time for 100 yards by 0. one of a second but it gets them out of the final um but but it is a very good model system that we we looked at very closely some years back the uh so you've got this situation where is a a group of people who appear to be prone and they're the ones who will get postvaccine fatigue and probably the the ones who have got the persistent formation of um the spike protein and get um long coed with both the fatigue and the structural uh defect problem using different mechanisms totally different mechanisms for the two so it sounds like we've got two mechanisms going on well the main mechanism whether it's long Co or postvaccine long Co is Persistence of the spike protein the spike protein is still produced for whatever reason whether it's long covid or postvaccine injury chronically being produced sometimes the features are as as a result of specific tissue damage because the tea cells are beaten up these cells would You're expect ing the spike protein wherever that is and of course we know that can be anywhere in the body now because the vaccine is systemically distributed so we've got the tissue damage but we've also got the ongoing inflammatory effects the the effects of the chronic inflammation that we're seeing as long covid or long postvaccine long covid that's are they the two sort of main causes of the clinical features exactly but keep in mind there is one underpinning common denominator and that is persistent antigen production which is a feature of all the chronic fatigue illnesses going back to influenza and all the other issues that that we um and this may this is just my view might I often turn out to be wrong but it's my view is that there's a phenotypic um uh uh proness if you like to developing uh fatigue illness when they're stressed with and they're more likely for some reason to get a persistent antigen because they have uh a less effective immune response than other people so most chronic fatigue syndromes can be explained in terms of the ongoing Persistence of some virus presumably mostly a virus causing these these chronic features so in theory if you could like wave of magic wand and eradicate all the virus from the body the patient would get better apart from the pathology that's caused by the tissue damage the irreversible tissue damage that's absolutely right and in fact um um when we were dealing with the uh Institute of sport in Australia with the elite swimmers uh you might remember they they win gold medals uh but some of them didn't and um uh we found that what was happening uh at the time the stress of international competition is in a number of these people start excreting epara virus in their throat so normally it's contained by a wall of tea cells and under the stress in the people who have got a partial immune deficiency so they've got a predisposition of not having a really effective immune response when they're expressed and people with long Co will say the same where under psychological or physical stress um I get worse and um we looked at this very carefully with the elite swimmers and we were able to uh completely obliterate that expression of epstar bar virus coming out in a condition which used to be called overtraining syndrome by doing one of two things uh the first is we we actually treated them with highly potent antivirals and prevented this and maintained their swimming capacity uh or we identified that the main precipitating factor was a particular type of physical stress which was um high high energy training and so we changed their training program and the Olympics uh in 2000 uh every Australian Elite swimmer swam to their predicted best which had never been before and it gave our physiology colleagues a very good jobs for the English Olympics which came next because the English wanted to know why our swimmers were doing so well uh and partly was because they didn't get subjected to uh fatigue induced impaired performance um by changing their training program so all of these issues um come together with this Persistence of of antigen and control of that antigen uh epstar virus as you know gets integrated into the DNA of cells uh and it should stay there and the tea cells are critical for that uh with Spike protein uh they should never it should never uh be expressed systemically and should never um have a persistence uh of expression but in some people of course it is and they're the ones prone to developing these fatigue illnesses so you're going to be getting in and dat with the emails from Olympic committees from around the world now Robert asking for your assistance I'm sure I'm sure about that all that work's been published a couple of years back and and sadly our competitors know about it so um so this means that basically everyone has been exposed to Epstein bar virus just that some people managed to eliminate it and some people don't exactly uh 80 percent of people um with the the athletes uh was pretty much 95 percent of the athletes uh had been exposed had Mar a IG antibody and this is the interesting thing that the the people who um have glandula have the epstar bar virus uh and who are prone to getting fatigue never quite make the right sort of te- cell response and I I'll give you two quick examples and these relate exactly to the situation in uh that I'm certainly seeing and has recently been published to some extent uh with long Co um if you look at antibody production the antibodies are made by a cell given the very imaginative title of a a b cell a b lymphocyte requires T lymphocytes to help them so we have these helper tea cells now it appears that there's a defect in the tea helper cells in people with long Co and this has been identified in different studies and certainly exact L the same in people with other chronic fatigue illnesses and the way the te cell deficiency expresses itself is that the B cell has markers of not working as well as it should now if you get a virus infection you make what's called an IGM antibody the IGM antibody is the first antibody but it's not a particularly High Affinity good effective antibody and so what the body does it replaces it with an IGG antibody so you go from IGM to ig now uh which is a much higher Affinity antibody and you make different subclasses of IGG and there's four sub IGG 1 2 3 and four now two things I noticed over the years looking after literally hundreds of people with chronic fatigue illnesses is that number one many of these patients never switch from the IGM to the IG anybody and so when you do a routine epstar bar virus in antibody and every Doctor Who who's watching this will know you look for IGM antibody because that tells you you've got a current infection you've just got the infection and suddenly and I I used to get a phone call every couple of weeks from General Practitioners that I work with saying hey this is confusing I got a patient who's got IGM and IG antibodies and they've had them for weeks and months and of course these are the people who have got ongoing chronic fatigue and they're not actually eliminating or controlling their epstar bar virus by virtue of the fact they're not making a particularly effective immune response and the response defect goes back to the te- cell because it's not helping the B efficient effective IGG response and so when you do a routine test the IGM which should tell you it's a recent infection but it's not it's been there for weeks or years and an IG and and the second and this is really interesting because only just a month or so ago uh this was found for long Co that in people with chronic fatigue syndrome one of the things that uh we noticed uh in our Clinic was that a number of these patients have IGG subclass deficiency particularly an igg2 subclass and it didn't initially it didn't make much sense and I started seeing both the IGM IGG confusion plus the IGG subclass deficiency both of which depend on good te cells working um now different subclasses have different jobs and so ig2 has a particular job and if it's very low then you've got a defective antibody response by virtual of this so what a wonderful study I saw I think it was about a month ago John um where they looked at IGG subclasses in Long Co and lo and behold there's a highly significant reduction across the long Co something that's never really been done for chronic fatigue syndrome uh the classics um significantly lower igg2 so exactly the same things is occurring in Long Co which brings all of these chronic fatigue illnesses collect ly together so moving on to the sort of um management strategies that we going to use Robert I mean I mean the question is of course what the heck do we do we do about this so um do we need to promote a more effective immunity within the respiratory tract and how would we do that well uh I don't have all the answers no one has all the answers but I I think that if you understand the process that's going on you can see some sense in going forward now I can run through there there are five things that that uh I do with with my my patients uh or I I'm thinking about uh the first is that we we we've developed the idea and I I've talked briefly about this with you before of what I call immune resilience and that is um and I think in the context we discussed it before I said why is it 99 percent of people who get long co uh inconvenience for a few days they feel a little sick a fever sore throat and then they get better whether you treat them or not but 1 or 2 percent get very sick H and some may die and yet you look at that Collective group and of course there are predisposing factors for getting very sick but many of them are just like you and me uh that we all look the same we think we're the same and yet we handle the virus differently and this has been an area that my group's been interested in for a long period of time and um we developed the idea that there's a thing called immune resilience and that there are ways of Shifting that immune resilience so that that 1 percent behaves like the 99 percent now that that's something that that that my own we've been certainly working on and uh not available yet but but I I think is the way one of the ways to go in the future so in other words people who uh get uh Airway infections uh handle it more effectively and don't run into the complications which obviously include long Co because of a defective immune response so I I think that's uh for the soon future not not a long term uh the second is to understand the process as being persistent antigen uh now the spike protein um is I think without our question the persistent antig both these cases uh and this is a practical area uh and there are two approaches currently uh being used um uh our friends and colleagues in America uh have developed various enzyme packages uh based on ninas which is a long St very interesting um uh orally uh an ingested enzyme that has specificity for Spike protein and I know studies are being done uh in uh in America uh using these um substances uh and we're really looking for forward to seeing uh how how they come out uh the second thing you can do about the expression of Spike protein is blocking its effect um really really exciting work has come out in the last few months about how icton works and there's a complete relook now at iaon uh about time I may add but um and I think I think one of the things that's bridged from the The Narrative that that was very unkind to iaon and the reality of science is the demonstration by uh a combination French and American groups showing that ican blocks the uh blocks Spike protein so it blocks the spike protein getting into the cell and it blocks it aggregating red cells which is the reason that you get low oxygen tension uh low oxygen saturation in patients who get significant co uh and I I was on one of the three papers that that showed that it was amazing within 24 hours of taking icton oxygen desaturation reversed now that's not suppressing inflammation and now by virtue of these studies it's shown that uh you disaggregate the cells and so the oxygen can return very quickly now I've been treating some of my own patients with moderately high dose of ivaan for a month I think I've treated five or six and every one of those has improved now that doesn't mean a thing it's not a randomized control trial uh it's it's it's what I call clinical medicine you you look uh at at a problem you say this is a process uh what logically can be done now it's not necessarily going to change all the structural damage that's been done but certainly there's been some improvement not not necessarily dramatic Improvement some improvement uh in a month or so of taking icton I I think what really is needed is people who um have access to um academic uh um academic situations where they can study and do these a randomized control of icton in Long Co properly done uh would be the most important thing that can happen uh in in Long Co um the third thing that um that I think is really really interesting in Long Co is that uh and particularly a couple Chinese groups have been promoting this and that is that people who get long Co get a disturbance of the microbiome in the bow now you might say how on Earth can that relate to something that's going on in the airway well um I was lucky enough years ago to work with John benstock in Canada uh who came up with the idea of the common mucosal system which has been underpinning my work over many years uh in humans and uh it it's just suddenly I realized that all our focus on this common mucosal system was the immune expression not the microbial drive and when you think that the the architecture of this common system that expresses control over all the different mucosal surfaces of the body the architecture involves sensor systems all the way down the gut not just the small bow with pair patches but all sorts of little patches with specialized M cells they're called over them that allows bacteria to come in and so I I think the important thing to understand here is that the commonality of mucosal immunology and expression involves the microbiomes at the different sites and so uh what happens uh in the airway by swallowing and affecting P patches can distort the microbiome in the gut and the microbiome in the gut can equally influence what's going on in the airway and I'll just give you one exciting um observation and that is a group was looking at uh in mice they were looking at csel pneumoni which is a nasty bacteria that causes pneumonia and they couldn't understand why on Earth when they gave pneumonia to the mouse by putting the the bug in the airway their microbiome changed uh this is in the gut and of course um the reason is this commonality this communication system that's so effective so what they found was and this is exactly what was found in the patients with long Co a particular type of bacteria was depressed and these bacteria well bacteria that produce short chain fatty acids butyric acid um acetic acid propionic acid those three main one two and three um carbon short chain fatty acids um now the people working with the mice and ciella said well what happens if we um reduce these bacteria uh in the gut then the the main product from the bacteria uh is things like butc acid and so they measured butc acid and found it was very low so very sens they just started feeding butc acid to these these mice and the eclips and pneumoni became much much uh improved uh didn't completely cure them but it certainly improved showing there was this connection between the two so you have two ways in which the microbiome can change the expression of any form of chronic fatigue one is by metabolic transfer of of receptors of um molecules that can move around through the blood seam and secondly by changing the cell Delivery Systems through the aggregated infid issue of P patches um sequel patches and the various ones in the column so that to me is very exciting and again if you can bear with me for 20 seconds I I'll I'll give you a very very important example many years ago Tom Baro who was the guy who discovered the uh the treatment for peptic ERS to which eradicated them uh he also was the person who um really developed the idea of feal microbiome transplants by changing the microbiome by washing you out and giving you some healthy ones um Tom Tom is uh quite extraordinary um he Tom treated patients who came to him with fatigue and non-specific gut symptoms and was surprised to find not only did the gut symptoms improve with this fmt but so did the fatigue now uh no one quite believed it so he went back 10 years later 10 years later and found something like 60 percent of the patients and most of those patients still had a resolution of their symptoms including their fatigue now you don't see that in chronic fatigue illnesses in other words by having a specific intervention there was some resetting of the system which we don't understand very well and so um I'm I I do a clinic in in in Tom's practice uh and uh he was is my PhD student and um he Tom uh I'm I'm actually if he's watching this or I'm going to send him an email Tom uh you've got to go back and start looking at uh how we can manipulate the microbiome and have outcomes in Long Co um so um I I think the the next thing that I think is really important so we there are the three things that I think are really important the next thing is don't feed the syndrome don't keep giving people vac who have got long Co syndrome because um you look at the literature and I I just did a review for a journal last week on a metaanalysis of all the studies done on vaccination and and long Co and it blew me away I mean it was a very well done study and and 20 there was a 20 percent reduction of long covid in people who have been vaccinated but I looked at the number of people was 1 million if you're looking at probably a 100,000 or a couple hundred, thousand people they get lost in they're very different they're the people who have got a fatigue illness maybe phenotype that have develop this uh in the context of the vaccine and you give them more vaccine or they get Co and they get worse this is a concept that I find nobody really or or most people have great trouble grasping I just noticed this morning while I was waiting to hear from you John that Peter McCulla wrote one of his um uh reviews and it was making exactly the same point you know you don't vaccinate people with chronic fatigue syndrome you're just putting petrol on the fire and of course yeah the final thing is you address the issues the person has um uh I noticed that some of my colleagues say a lot of these people have got in the morning uh you can't work you lose your job you're broke um you're going to have a touch of reactive depression and anxiety and um it's not that they have a primary mental health problem they've got serious responses mental health responses of a normal type to a uh to a very uh incapacitating problem so that's that's our approach anyway to uh to chronic fatigue illnesses excellent updates and uh we'll um certainly keep an eye on this one but I I think gives us real cause for for Hope here Robert that there is potential ways ahead for people that are suffering in this way yeah but for now thank you very much as always okay",0.4445080683951658
7,im3otpqYAiQ,Covid Vaccine Study Finds Links to Health Conditions,"  In terms of how widespread the adverse event reporting has been. Talk us through what the findings were. Yeah. So these findings are not really at all surprising. We have known about these side effects really since the vaccines began rolling out at the end of 2020, early 2021. We've seen this myocarditis inflammation of the heart muscle pericarditis, inflammation of the sac around the heart, as well as this unusual blood clot that forms in the brain from the virus vector vaccine. So none of these findings are new, but they are actually fairly reassuring because they didn't find anything else that was that was at all alarming, Heidi. And it did look at a few different vaccine types as well. Was there any difference across them? There was indeed. Yes. They did see this increased risk for for the brain blood clots in in relation to the AstraZeneca viral virus vector vaccine. And and also we did see the increased risk of of myocarditis and pericarditis with the mRNA vaccines that are the ones made by Pfizer, Biontech and Moderna. There were some other interesting findings as well. Guillain-Barré syndrome was shown to be a an event of concern linked to mostly to the Oxford AstraZeneca virus vector vaccine. Otherwise, everything else was pretty much as we had already expected. Thinks so. And we've talked about some of those pre-established conditions of interest. Did they find anything that was pertinent across that subsection of the study? Beyond those 13 events that they were looking for that they didn't see, they weren't looking specifically for other aspects of vaccine injury. That has been noted in the past. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome that is increase heart rate that has been noted in relation to vaccines. The researchers have also seen in a higher frequency associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. So while the vaccines were known to be associated with this problem, they were actually occurring more frequently from an infection.",0.4479338842975206

9,m2skKkRwYj8,Covid vaccines are safe, well welcome to today's talk it's Sunday the 4th of February 2024 now in my country we have something called prime minister's question time where members of parliament can ask the Prime Minister questions now this was the British prime minister last Wednesday the 31st of January not 2021 but 2024 just a few days ago prime minister let me be unequivocal from this dispatch box that Co vaccines are safe Mr speaker now I know that you'll be struggling with credulity at this point so I don't want to quote the Prime Minister out of context so let's look at the context now Mr Andrew bridgen asks the question and Richie sunak the Prime Minister answers the question let's just watch the whole exchange only lasts for a couple of minutes brid thank you Mr Speaker more than two decades ago the then prime minister Tony Blair misled this house by promoting and endorsing the post office Horizon it system as perfect protecting the large corporation that created it and causing Untold harm and damage and misery to innocent people can the current prime minister think of anything he has promoted in partnership with huge businesses as safe and effective which has ultimately harmed the British people and will he use this opportunity to correct that safe and effective statement or will he choose the same line as Tony Blair sit back do nothing and let the misery just continue to pile up Prim Minister Mr Speaker as we've been clear the Horizon Scandal is a terrible miscarriage of justice and we're doing everything that we can to make it right and to what he was more broadly insinuating let me be unequivocal from this dispatch box that covid vaccines are safe Mr speaker now your Member of Parliament May well have been if you live live in the UK one of those that was poo pooing Mr bridgen when he said safe and effective and he may your elected member May well have been one of the ones that were cheering when Mr Richie sunak said the vaccines are safe notice he didn't say they were effective this time but he did say they were safe now let's just look at some more information on this here now this is the uh the channel where you can watch that that's the official UK uh Parliament Channel where it's all available check out the link for yourself and we also have this document called Hansard which records everything and that's the link for that check it out for yourself can the current uh prime minister think of anything he has promoted in partnership with huge business as safe and effective but has ultimately harmed the British people so clearly Mr bridgen there is talking about the vaccines and gives the Prime Minister an opportunity to uh correct previous errors now the Prime Minister here is talking about the Horizon now this Horizon Scandal there was this terrible thing where postmasters were accused of theft and it wasn't it was the computer system goes way back to Tony blle you might have heard of him something to do with was it an invasion of Iraq or something like that something like that anyway um sticking to the point um this Horizon was uh Scandal was ignored but recently Von clean and the these poor innocent people who suffered uh greatly have been completely exonerated although not adequately compensated yet the analogies are there Mr bridon of course did advocate for the Horizon victims in his own constituency quite strongly at the time but again was poo pooed as he is now so he was drawing this kind of analogy there so the Prime Minister had this opportunity to say just a minute but he actually said this let me be unequivocal so let me be une equivocal and is I think when he said unequivocal is that the point where he banged his hand down and said this is unequivocal and this is from the dispatch box now in the UK that means it's it's this dispatch box that the Prime Minister talks from in Parliament basically is saying by the authority vested in me as the British prime minister uh covid vaccines are safe and effective sry that are cross out safe there my mistake um so there you go now I'm not just blaming I am cont CRI critiquing Mr sunak of course unequivocally I am um I think he's wrong but we have a we have his Majesty's opposition in this country that are supposed to say just a minute government let me get you in check here so Richie sunak says something K starm with the leader of the opposition should be on his feet in second saying just a minute what about way back to the Joseph frayman paper what about the yellow card data what about all the international data that shows unequivocal evidence of vaccine harms no nothing Ju Ju Just huray and they went on to the next point so there we have it that was the uh they were the exchanges in the British Parliament British prime minister 31st of January 2024 let me be unequivocal from this dispatch box that covid vaccines are safe unbelievable but at least it didn't say effective now just a couple of uh lighter points now to finish off with we did a video a few days ago I know quite a of you saw it on icin use in Africa and those patients that were treated with icin in Africa for the scab bees are just virtually cured I'm going to be showing some videos that I've just been sent a couple of days ago I might do them tomorrow don't think we' got time today um but um I made an error in the video so as always I'll come back to apology olog um so apologies and correction from from John about a mistake I made in that video in this video I wrongly say that the scabies might are insects they are not they are correctly classified as a Radia uh this is because the adult might have eight legs as spiders do so they're in the same group as spiders not insects and of course even someone who's done school biology knows that spy all insects have six legs uh and the might are actually 0.2 to 0.4 5 mm not 10 times bigger as I said sorry I simply put the decimal point in the wrong place so my apologies for that and um hopefully normal service will be resumed so my mistake sorry if I've misled anyone but the content of the video uh and the videoos of course absolutely valid totally valid IV mein uh in combination with hygiene and cleaning the clothes basically eradicated The Wretched curse of gab is from that family and with many others that's just one we chose to video from our community health project in in Africa now I'm going to read a couple of the comments from that video now as we've said before there's a whole qualitative research project in looking at these video comments if anyone bothered to do it but I'm just going to read out a couple of comments on the uh from the Iva meon and scab's video now this says um um I'm not going to read out the names of the commentators but you can look at it they're all there they're in the public domain during the pandemic I caught the Delta version of the size Corona virus to and was very sick Strangely I contacted scab the same week not wanting to infect my doctor I phon my doctor and managed to get a prescription of icin a day later I was better so excellent glad to hear that very strange coincidence getting skabes and Delta variant all at the same time although I must say personally I do keep Ivon in the house just in case I get scabies another one here um my brother Dr William Colby started the icton distribution program in the Congo Basin in the 1980s 1 billion Doses and not one complaint now this is doses given to human beings not to horses not to cows to human beings a billion Doses and not one complaint according to this comment I have noticed that there is absolutely no Co in the covid base and not even in the G refugee camp where there is TB and starvation nothing to see here can't possibly comment of course but um congratulations to Dr William Kobe for starting the Ivon distrib distribution program in Congo in the 1980s and there's many other comments I'm just going to give you the gist of one of them again I'm not just I'm just reporting what's been commented don't know if they're true or not can't tell it's just comments but they're in the public domain you can read them for yourself um I've had long covid and I've been on oxygen at 5 liters for 2 years 247 um and at some point this commentator says I found some 12 12 milligram tablets of irtin in 24 hours my oxygen saturation levels Rose to prec covid level my mind cleared overnight from the fog my ears are ringing and improving my eyesight is improved today I went to my old doctor to show him your video he already was ahead of me he prescribed 40 milligrams a day for two weeks but I told him I would like to try 20 milligrams per day because 12 migam rocked my world and increased the level if needed um a little more detail about the individual there this has been a miracle in my life no machine day or night and I assum he was referring to the oxygen concentration machine um and he also refers to some personal tragedy so they're they're in the comments there now of course I have no idea whether they're correct or not they're just comments and whatever you do do not take medicines based on what we say on this um Channel we do not prescribe you need to go to your doctor for that but interesting that those things are in the comments and again congratulations to Dr William kobby for His Brilliant work in the Congo eradicating things like river blindness and uh uh elephantiasis the massive swelling of the limbs the terrible blindness and of course huge range of other parasitic diseases and now almost certainly IA Ian eradicating um scab as well although scab Beast keeps cropping up because people keep getting reinfected so there we go uh let me know what you think of the British prime minister's comments and um we'll leave it there thank you for watching,0.4875135351298141
10,YVFAvoeFahI,Do Americans who questioned COVID vaccine deserve an apology? | On Balance,"Dr. Brede-Rars, your former assistant secretary for health, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It's good to see you, Admiral, as always. Upon reflection, do a lot of Americans and people who are concerned about the vaccine deserve an apology? Absolutely. I believe they do. We approach this – you have to be open with people. We knew very early on that there was an increase in the heart inflammation, myocarditis, much more with a couple of the vaccines versus Pfizer. But this very large study of about 100 million people shows that there are rare neurologic effects, there are rare immune effects, and there are the heart inflammation. And these are legitimate concerns. We have to be open with people that, you know, if you're seven years old or 75, yeah, and that risk, you should be getting the boosters. But if you're 25 and healthy, particularly a male, and you've had COVID before, that risk of myocarditis is about the same or maybe even a little bit higher than your risk of having a serious outcome. So, yes, people deserve an apology. I think open, honest scientific discussion was crushed. And even I myself had a tweet banned because I simply stated the fact, proven by data, that those who were naturally immune who had COVID should not lose their jobs, should not need passports, should not need other things because they were equally immune as those who got the vaccine in the Delta outbreak. It's stunning to me always the banning and sort of the stifling of free speech because it was the ideas were somehow scary to the orthodoxy or somehow took away the power of the institutions. To that end was so much trust lost in our institutions and in public health. CDC and NIH seem to just be doubling down in their arrogance. Nope, we weren't wrong. No, we were completely right. Misinformation is this huge problem. Why do you think they refuse to learn and apologize to what is always a pretty forgiving American public? You know, I think there's some pathology there because one of the first principles of being a physician as I am is to be honest with your patient and to respect their autonomy. You provide the best information you can and you let them make a decision. We're not in a paternalistic society where we force people to have an operation or force people to take vaccines. We give them the information. And that is, I think, the most important lesson that public health officials need to learn. Get back to basics. Tell the truth. Be honest. American people are smart. They can handle the truth. Don't try to whitewash it or coerce people as Dr. Fauci clearly did on a number of occasions and let Americans make their own decision. I was banned. I was surprised to learn that it was a former FDA commissioner but who was then a board member of Pfizer getting me banned for simply saying that natural immunity is powerful. That's how deep and corrupt the system goes. Wow. Yeah, I remember those times. They were wild. Memoir of the Pandemic is your book. And I think it's really important that you go into these issues. You deal with them honestly. You've been one of the people from the very beginning. I think we had the courage to say, hey, we don't know what we don't know, which unfortunately became very difficult to so many people to say. Good to see you, Admiral. As always, thank you.",0.5363418803418802
11,IMRTSwb3hCs,Largest COVID vaccine study finds rare risks | CUOMO," THE GOOD NEWS IS THE LARGEST COVID VACCINE STUDY TO DATE WAS JUST RELEASED. 99 MILLION PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD. IT FOUND THAT THERE IS AN EXTREMELY RARE BUT INCREASED RISK FOR CERTAIN NEUROLOGICAL HEART BLOOD AND BRAIN DISORDERS AFTER TAKING THE VACCINE. BUT HOW RARE IS OKAY? AND HOW MUCH MORE IS IT NOW IDENTIFIED AND PEOPLE THEN? BEFORE THE VACCINE? AND ALSO, WHAT ABOUT ALL THE LONG COVID SYMPTOMS THAT PEOPLE ARE PRESENTING WIDE UNMASK THE 99 MILLION ABOUT THAT. THOSE RIGHT? YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW MINE. THEY COME FROM MY DOCTOR. DOUBLE BOARD, CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN LONG COVID CLINICAL SPECIALIST AT TERRAIN, HEALTH DOCTOR ROBIN ROSE. SO YOU CALLED ME ABOUT THIS AND SAID, BOY, THE HEADLINE MAKES IT SOUND LIKE YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. WHY? THE BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY IS IS THAT THEY LOOK AT LIKE YOU SAID, THESE 99 MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS 10 COUNTRIES. AND THEY IDENTIFIED THESE VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS THAT WERNER A LOGIC RD AT CARDIAC OR HUMAN TO ISSUES. BUT THESE ARE PROBLEMS THAT WITH ANY THERAPEUTIC VACCINE THAT IS COMING OUT. YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO SEE THESE ISSUES, RIGHT? OR YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT TO SEE THESE ISSUES. AND IF YOU DID, YOU WANT TO SEE THEM AT A LOW RATE AND THERE WERE A HANDFUL THAT WERE FLAGGED, YOU SAFETY SIGNNALS THAT WERE 2 TO 3 TIMES HIGHER. YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY LOOKED AT, THEY WOULD, YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE THE EXPECTED VERSUS WHAT THE OBSERVED OUTCOMES WOULD BE. AND THEY WERE 2 TO 3 TIMES HIGHER. ANYWAY, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT IS EXPECTED VERSUS OBSERVED ME. SO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE ROLLING OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY'RE UP UNICA TREATMENT. A VACCINE. YOU KNOW, YOU EXPECT MAYBE YOU'LL HAVE SOME SIDE EFFECTS, MILD, MODERATE OR SEVERE SIDE WHEN THEY SAW, YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY WHEN THEY WHEN THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE DATA, ARE THEY? THEY KNEW THAT. SOME OF THE SIDE EFFECTS THAT THE SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS, THE OUTCOMES COLLECTED BY THESE 99 MILLION PEOPLE WERE HIGHER THAN WHAT THEY HAD EXPECTED. THAT MAKE SENSE. YEAH. AND YOU TOLD ME THAT AS AN ANALOGY YOU WERE LIKE IF WE WERE TALKING ABOUT LIKE CANCERS OR THINGS LIKE THAT, PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE HAPPY ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE SEEING IN THIS STUDY. HOW SO? SO THIS IS WHAT I MEAN. SO WHEN THE HEADLINES COME OUT ABOUT ABOUT VACCINE, RIGHT VERSUS COVID. THE THE VACCINE GETS DOWN, PLAYED IN A LOT OF WAYS. ARE THE HEADLINES DOWNPLAY WHAT'S HAPPENING? OKAY. AND THE ISSUE IS IS THAT IN OUR SOCIETY AND IN HEALTH CARE IN GENERAL, WE ALWAYS DO CARE ABOUT THE FEW OR THE RARE THINGS THAT HAPPEN, RIGHT? SO, YOU KNOW, WE COLON CANCER SCREENING, EVERYONE. THAT'S 45 YEARS AND OLDER, YOU KNOW, IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT NEED TO GET SCREENED BECAUSE WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE 32 OUT OF EVERY 100,000 PEOPLE THAT PER YEAR RIGHT. SAME THING WITH WOMEN AND CERVICAL CANCER. YOU KNOW, 7.7 FEMALES AT OF EVERY 100,000 PER YEAR, GET CERVICAL CANCER. THESE ARE RARE OR FEWER EVENTS THAT OCCUR. BUT WE CARE ABOUT THEM. WE DON'T DOWNPLAY THEM AND WE SCREEN THESE PEOPLE AND WE TRY TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING. THAT WAS MY POINT. AND HERE ARE SAYING IT'S UNACCEPTABLE LOSS AND YOU MADE ANOTHER GOOD POINT TO ME, WHICH IS WHY DIDN'T THEY IF THEY HAD THIS BIG COHORT TO ABOUT A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT CLINICIANS LIKE YOU ARE SEEING AND SEE HOW PREVALENT THEY ARE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? ANSWER YOUR OWN QUESTION IS. RIGHT. SO EXACTLY. THERE'S 10'S OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE SCREAMING FROM THE ROOFTOPS SAYING THAT AFTER THEY HAVE THE VACCINE, THEY'VE SUFFERED JUST. YOU KNOW, BE SICK. SYMPTOMS ARE NOT THAT THE SEC, BUT NOT A SEVERE IS THIS BUT SYMPTOMS THAT HAVE IMPAIRED THEIR ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. YOU KNOW, THEY CAN'T LIVE THE WAY THEY USED TO LIVE ON A DAILY BASIS. AND THOSE ARE THINGS, INCLUDING, YOU KNOW, CHEST HAVING US. PERSISTENT HEADACHES EVERY DAY MOST EXERTIONAL MOLLY'S NEUROPATHY WEAKNESS. NEW ONSET CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA IS A STRUCTURAL HEART DAMAGE, AUTOIMMUNE CONDITIONS, ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAN NAME 100 OTHER THINGS. PROBABLY. YOU KNOW WHY WE NOT LOOKING AT THING. THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN THIS STUDY PARTICULAR THINGS THAT ARE SUPER RARE AND VERY, VERY SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING. LAST THING. MY PRODUCER JUST GOT MY URBAN AND SAID, HEY, YOU KNOW, THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT IF YOU WERE VACCINATED, YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO GET LONG COVID. IS THAT TRUE IN YOUR EXPERIENCE? OUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THAT AND MIXED BAG. IT'S A MIXED BAG. E THERE. WE NEED A LOT MORE DATA ON THAT. BUT IT SEEMS THAT MANY PATIENTS THAT HAD LONG COVID THAT GOT VACCINATED ACTUALLY GOT WORSE INSTEAD OF BETTER IN MY EXPERIENCE.

AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT STUDY OVER 51 percent OF THE WOMEN THAT WERE PREGNANT THAT WENT ON TO HAVE LONG COVID WERE VACCINATED. AND 49 PER SO THERE IT WAS IT A LITTLE BIT MORE, YOU KNOW, HEADS MORE TOWARDS THOSE BEACH A VACCINE WENT ON TO LONG COVID VERSUS THAT. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU GET IS MULTIFACTORIAL.

12,mkZ1MabMEZw,Covid Vaccine Side Effects + VAERS, so what do you think about getting the COVID vaccine today I don't know doc what about the side effects if you look in Bears there's millions of side effects true but those aren't all verified you think they're made up no I'm saying a lot of those side effects weren't actually from the vaccine but it says they were the various data isn't automatically verified by professionals it's reviewed by the experts to look for patterns it says thousands of people died from the vaccine that seems like a pattern to me for instance on Bears right now 12 people were reported in October of 2021 to have died within seven days of getting the COVID19 vaccine I don't want to die that month 6.6 million Americans were vaccinated okay and 55 thousand Americans die every week from COVID I heard that's inflated because no from anything there are a lot of Americans in 2019 on average 55 thousand Americans died every week wow so if we vaccinated every American in one day we'd expect 55 thousand of them to die within the next seven days seems high 6.6 million vaccinations in October of 2021 is 1.8 percent of Americans so even if we gave them a popsicle instead of a vaccine we'd expect 991 of them to die within the next seven days did you say popsicles so just because they died within seven days of getting the vaccine doesn't mean they died from the vaccine you're saying popsicles kill people no nice so can I have one a vaccine a popsicle and a vaccine nah I'm good,0.4652295918367347
13,sidjKoHS6NE,British regulators limit covid vaccines, what a warm welcome just a brief evening update for Wednesday the 25th I wanted to bring you this sort of hot off the press it's from The Joint Committee on uh vaccination and immunization and basically what they're saying is as from the 12th of next month healthy under 50s are not going to be eligible for COVID vaccination in the UK some might say this is a sensible targeting of resources as we move towards endemicity others might suggest it's uh frantic backpedaling the report is written in very positive language about this move to a more rational distribution of resources nothing about side effects nothing about adverse reactions nothing about changing risk benefit analysis some of you might find what I'm about to say fairly pathetic but let's do it anyway jvci makes uh recommend interim recommendations and we can expect these to be taken up by the government of course has advised that plans should be made for those at higher risk of severe COVID19 to be offered to booster vaccination this Autumn so looking at head so it's not saying that young people are at minimal risk especially in the age of Omicron it's not saying that we've now got huge amounts of natural immunity it's not saying we've now got huge amounts of mucosal immunity no it's just a simple rationalization and targeting of of resources Professor Lim chair as the transition continues away from a pandemic emergency response towards pandemic recovery yep in England at the closure of the Autumn booster campaign will be on the 12th of uh February 2023 still over two weeks away I guess um two and a half weeks away basically it means no more boosters for health healthy under 50s which we are of course very pleased to um very pleased to see uh similarly the jvcis advising that the primary course of COVID vaccination should move over the course of 2023 towards a more targeted offer so this is going to include primary immunization as well as the boosters fairly soon and this is all here really for yourself it's just put in language which makes everything sound so positive there's no mention of anything negative it really does strike me as being it's not written in a genuine way as far as I can see but but there we go now the current recommendations in the UK oh there's also another document here um that that is linked to COVID vaccination program this is actually the official document oh uh blood clotting myocarditis and pericarditis and Guillain-Barre syndrome um I guess it's not any longer possible to ignore these uh adverse reactions what's the word that describes that there's a word they use um rare that's it these rare these rare reactions so it's good to see some honesty at least on on that site there now at the moment in the UK and um let me just read it um coronavirus COVID vaccinations in the UK everyone age five on or before the 31st of August 2022 I know we can get a first and second dose of the COVID19 vaccine at the moment in my country you can take a perfectly healthy child in to see a professional health care advisor Healthcare practitioner and they will inject a healthy five-year-old child with a messenger ribonucleic acid vaccine that is the current position in my country at the moment I'm not allowed to disagree with this um I merely reported there you go that's the advice there from my government enough of that now Denmark of course is ahead of the uh the curb somewhat as usual um here's the the Danish government site they've already actually adopted this position very kind of the Danish authorities of course to make a full copies available of their documentation in English saves me using Google translate we recommend vaccination of people age 50 years and over as well as selected risk groups so ahead of the game other countries have got to move to this pretty soon haven't they I mean they simply they simply have to the risk of severe disease in young people from Omicron who have been previously exposed to The Vibes and we all have been previously exposed now it's absolutely minimal risk benefit analysis has changed as I've been saying for um well now what we are yeah for over a year now for over a year now radical change now just to finish off on a completely separate matter and this is nothing to do with the history of the MRNA vaccines of course um regulatory funding this article in the British medical journal now the British medical journal says industry money saturates the global leading Regulators not my words British medical journal that's what they say saturates and here we have a table in I'm aware you won't be able to see this I'm going to read some of the uh some of the Salient points about industry money uh proportion of the budget derived from industry so this is it here so Australia it's uh 96 percent Europe it's 89 United Kingdom it's only 86 percent so that means in the United Kingdom 86 of The Regulators money comes from industry and I don't imagine it's you making industry to you in the United States it's actually quite a bit lower it's only 65 percent now of course no one's saying that the fact that Australia get 96 of the money that the Europe get eight to nine percent of the money that UK get 86 of the money the Japan gets 85 of the money that the U.S Regulators get 65 in Canada only 50.5 no one's saying any of these huge percentages have any influence on their decision making of course we merely report what is in the British medical journal the various other things that the bmj has kept this in the public domain so check it out for yourself so there you go um if there was anyone here that wants to rush out and get a vaccine who's healthy below the age of 50 before the expiry time in the UK you've got until the 12th of January um I won't be rushing my last vaccine was on the uh it was November 2021 I haven't had one since then can't tell you what to do of course but I haven't had one since 2021. so there we go uh change from the jvci all in very positive uh language as they move towards consolidation and targeting I'll leave you to make what you like of that but thank you for watching,0.4681051091765376

16,_bjzWUkVknQ,World&#39;s largest study in COVID vaccine side-effects | ABC News, the results are written from the world's largest study into the side effects of covid vaccines the study involved almost 100 million people from eight countries for more we're joined by the host of the Health Report on RN Dr Norman swam Norman great to see you again now what have we learned from this study that's been highly anticipated well just you alluded to the scope of it 99 million people 183 million doses of vaccines looking at Astra Mna and fisa and they've done it in eight countries with very reliable data places like Australia New Zealand Canada Denmark Finland um and the results show that well first of all the uncovered side of side effects that they hadn't quite expected and they did show up as a signal there all the side effects were rare and it takes me a little bit just to explain the um you the data because what they were doing was they were saying look what's the base rate of these problems in the community and what's the rise above the base R how many cases would we have expected over this period of time in this group of people and then how many cases appeared and uh what they showed was that they were rare so they start and and they only chose significant side effects if they were confident that they were side effects so gon Barry syndrome is one that been talked about a lot you and I have talked about it on the virus on news channel and the um so this is an ascending paralysis of the body a bit like um well it's not really like multiple sclerosis but it it it affects the ne the nervous system usually in most people it's a temporary phenomenon although it can be quite serious at the time gon bar seem to be only a problem with the Astro vaccine rare but only with the Astro vaccine not with the MRNA vaccines myocarditis pericarditis inflammation of the heart that showed out is a significant side effect um and no surprises there with the MRNA vaccines then there was a side effect called acute disseminated enom myelitis so this is essentially a brain inflammation usually seen in children but in this case in older people these are largely 20 to 60y olds um and again in most people self-limiting but could can be quite nasty but to give you an idea of how and it was only with the modna vaccine they didn't see it with fizer and they didn't see it with Astra so out of 10 million doses of Astro 1 million well I think yeah 10 million doses of of Mna I should say they were they expected to see two cases in that population of this brain inflammation and they saw seven so it's you can see how rare it is but it needs more investigation so out of that cohort of 99 million participants who were the subject of this study how many people came out with side effects um I've been asked this question before in terms of how many people if you just take the brain inflammation yeah out of 99 million people seven because this was I mean the whole yeah but the thing about side effects is that a lot of people around the world were wondering what if I'm one of the seven right but proportionality is really really important here that's right so it's vanishingly rare but it does exist and it's it's all about transparency so that you know what the risks are and this would be like winning the biggest lot um three times in your life something like that as we mentioned this was uh eight countries was a scope how much can that be extrapolated to the rest of the world population are recipients of these vaccines it's a it's a good question because you might well get different genetic susceptibilities in different populations but um the uh in terms of a representative population for Australia the the um you know particularly Canada was heavily involved it's a very similar population to australas I think Australians can take it away that from their point of view it's gives a good understanding of the risk of side effects I want to turn now to another study this time into a type of blood fat blood fat that's been linked with heart disease and stroke tell me about that we all know about cholesterol and if you've thought about cholesterol you've heard about there's good cholesterol and bad cherol right bad cholesterol is called LDL and uh that's the one that they target to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and so on it's been known for a long time that on the side here there's another Blood fat it's not part of cholesterol separate blood fat and it goes by the name lipoprotein little a CU there's a little a next to it the way the the experts um describe it and it's been known for a while that LP little a increases the risk of heart attack and stroke but it's but cardiologist have been trying to find all sorts of reasons why they shouldn't measure it one of the reasons is that they haven't got effective treatments for it it turns out and it's just getting stronger and stronger and stronger that LP little a is a strong risk factor for heart attacks and strokes in its own right and we should have it should be measured in people who are at high risk cuz there are ways of bringing it down and reducing your risk and there are new treatments on the horizon and it's as poent in terms of heart attack and stroke as LDL cholesterol how do you get about working out if you are at high risk or not you get a simple blood test trouble that easy yeah it's that easy trouble is it's not re reimbursed at the moment so it will cost you anywhere between 25 and 50 bucks right Norman great to chat with you thank you so much

19,P3nXJB5PoBM,Bret Weinstein tells Tucker: 17 million dead from COVID vaccine, let's do a couple of covid related stories Brett Weinstein evolutionary biologist and podcast host of the Darkhorse podcast was recently interviewed by former Fox News propagandist Tucker Carlson and Brett told Tucker something that sounds shocking because it is and it's wrong which is that 17 million people have died from the covid vaccine that is quite a claim let's take a listen to what Brett had to say gauge Tucker's reaction and more generally we will discuss it there was uh a press I was recently at a conference uh in Romania on the covid crisis and so there was a lot of work trying to unpack what we actually understand and I saw a credible estimate of something like 17 million deaths globally from this technology so 17 million deaths from the coac well when you know when you scale up to billions uh it's not hard to reach a number like that with the technology that's dangerous now to your deeper question I think let's and by the way these are not our subtitles they're a mess but I just want to make clear these are not our subtitles Steelman so just for perspective I mean that's like the death toll of a global war yes absolutely it is this is a a a great tragedy of History so that proportion um and amazingly there is no way in which it's over I mean we are still apparently recommending these things for healthy children never stood any chance of getting any benefit from every chance of suffering harms that are uh not only serious but tragic on the basis that children have long lives ahead of them so listen uh let's start anecdotally okay okay the claim is 17 million people have been killed by the covid vaccine and it's continuing let's start anecdotally which is not the way we do things but sometimes it's useful to start with an anecdote just as a sniff test and then we'll go further okay first of all does anybody in my audience know a single person who had a serious vaccine complication maybe there's a couple of you okay sometimes that happens extremely rare we have an audience in the millions C L it's possible that someone in the audience not not you but knows someone who had a serious vaccine complication maybe there's a few of you okay does anyone in my audience know of anybody personally right who died from the covid vaccine I assume the answer is zero since almost no one okay almost no one has died from vaccine complications so does anyone in my audience then know anybody who has died from covid or covid complications just about everybody I know says the answer is yes I assume the answer is yes both personally and certainly obviously we know of people through through the media my aunt died of complications from covid she was imuno compromised had a number of health issues got covid never recovered passed away an uncle of mine died from Co pneumonia now let's go beyond anecdote okay the global death toll of covid about six million closer to seven depending on whether we talk recorded deaths or an excess death model OKAY somewhere between six and7 million Deb of covid and 17 million dead of the vaccine now you can go and watch the presentation that Brett saw in Romania okay it's a Canadian scientist Dennis rancour uh here's just like a few seconds of it this is all available online it's 26 minutes scene that is explained by the magic of mathematical models written by bought out scientists working for bought out politicians so it is not true the vaccine did not save lives okay you can go and watch this entire thing and then you will have the information that that uh Brett has and then you can also find the 130 page so-called analysis of this on which that presentation is based we're not going to link to it we're putting up a screenshot but we're not going to link to it since I don't know we could be banned or something who knows and here's what this quote analysis did the analysis looked at all cause mortality in 17 countries and the analysis claims that all cause mortality data shows there was no benefit from a covid vaccine now all it does is it looks at population data doesn't confirm whether anybody who died was even vaccinated and it makes it an impossibility to draw any kind of conclusion about the relationship between vaccination and morality like at the top level it's bogus we don't even need to go further but we can the analysis also ignes really good evidence that we have that when we see a spike in excess mortality in a country it aligned with a covid surge not a vaccination surge if you look and you say okay we know there was a covid surge in this country at this time and then you see excess mortality go up that's really good data about what might be going on on the other hand and if you look at a country like Peru when you saw the excess deaths Spike uh did not coincide with when the vaccination rates went up we know when the vaccination rates went way up in Peru and you didn't see excess deaths so the studies that we have show all cause mortality is uh higher in the states with lower vaccination rates and all cause mortality was lower in states with higher vaccination R so it is truly dangerous listen do I think Bret Weinstein really believes this I genuinely do not know I do not know whether Brett Weinstein believes this stuff five years ago four or five years ago I would have said Brett Weinstein is too smart to fall for this crap it's just what my view would have been and I don't know what the answer is because unfortunately if he doesn't believe it then he's deliberately spreading misinformation which I mean what's worse being a liar being misinformed being a deliberate liar seems worse to me it's really sad what's happened to Brett Weinstein and of course opportunist Tucker Carlson loves the ability to just promote the hell out of this crap for clicks and is he even getting clicks I don't know something that's been in the news a lot lately is data Brokers collecting vast amounts of data about everything you do on your phone and computer where you go what you look at they identify patterns in your behavior and it's really quite disturbing how much data Brokers know about us even our health information and then we found out that sometimes government agencies like the FBI will buy that information from data Brokers to spy on Americans

Yeah, bad time of cough. I thought you were doing it deliberately. No, so two very rare Covid vaccine side effects have been detected in a global study of 99 million people. So these are these are new Covid vaccine side effects, a neurological disorder and inflammation of the spinal cord. They've been detected by researchers in the largest vaccine safety study to date. Results confirm how uncommon known complications are as researchers confirm benefits from vaccines still outweigh the rest. So some people are getting sick from the vaccines, but it's still overall. They're saying it's better than you're going to have less chance of getting ill than if you don't get Covid. They don't give numbers. They don't they don't say, you know, oh, this many people died from Covid and this many people died from, you know, spinal inflammation caused by the vaccine. But at least we are hearing more about people who have had bad side effects to the vaccine because for a long while that was just, you know, hushed up. It was a conspiracy, a right wing conspiracy theory. Like all right wing conspiracy theories is 100 per cent true. And you can trust all of them. But of course, the scale of it is the question, isn't you know? So a lot of people will say that the scale is immense and it probably isn't immense. But it is real and people have lost loved ones as a result of it. It's worth talking about, isn't it? Yeah, and we don't need to focus on the severe effects. There are a lot of moderate effects that have effectively disabled people that were previously very healthy. And of course, this has been undertaken by the Global Vaccine Data Network, which sounds to me like they're marking their own test paper here to some degree. Yeah, they're going to be within the industry. Now, I'm not suggesting that we should all go conspiracy theory on this, but we should. Leo always wants to.

23,I9S2jooTxkQ,Vaccination and multiple sclerosis, well a warm welcome to today's talk Monday the 29th of May now last week the World Health Organization put out a release showing that there was a possible cause or relationship between COVID19 vaccine and multiple sclerosis and we're allowed to report on this because it is an official who paper we're limited to other things we can report but we can report this now this is the paper here now um it says COVID19 vaccination can induce multiple sclerosis via cross reactivity with t helper cells so quite a mission from the World Health Organization now this isn't available on quite a few servers now but I've got DuckDuckGo on my um on my desktop so I could find it again but that's that's that's it there and it is as I say who publication so we can actually talk about this nice to be able to talk about things now what is this actually uh showing what what is going on here well I'm going to sort of do a quick explanation of what seems to be going on so what we have here imagine this is a nerve fiber here so the nerve that the nerve impulses will travel down here and this will be in the brain or the spinal cord and these nerve fibers are surrounded by this protective myelin sheath and in the nest central nervous system they're made by cells called oligodendrocytes here we have the spike protein from a natural uh SARS coronavirus II infection and here we have the spike protein produced by the vaccine on its own now in learning to recognize this is the CD4 lymphocyte here the T helper cell this is the famous tea helper cell that's disordered in um in HIV so when people become immunocompromised in AIDS acquired immunodeficiency syndrome what actually happens is is the virus destroys a lot of the CD4 helper cells until they can't produce any immune response but here it's not lack of immune response it's too much immune response that is the uh the problem so the CD4 is learning to recognize rightly as in the principles of vaccination these uh these Spike proteins and it can beat up these Spike proteins which of course is is good these are the spike proteins produced by the vaccine and the idea is that will help the CDL CD helper cells to get rid of the spike protein should there be a natural infection which we could argue about but the point is the same sort of chemical profile that we're finding on the surface of the spike protein um molecules there we're finding very similar proteins on the surface of the well there are very similar proteins on the surface of the myelin sheath so the T helper cells are also orchestrating a response which beats up on these myelin sheaths and when the myelin sheaths go in central nervous system um that is multiple sclerosis the myelin sheaths of course are essential they facilitate what we call bouncing transmission much faster so-called salutatory transmission of nerve fibers the nourish protect the protect the nerve fiber so without them basically you get progressive paralysis that is the main feature with multiple sclerosis and I've looked after many hundreds I guess of multiple sclerosis patients so over the years horrible debilitating disease although with a very varying path so that's what seems to be happening and that's reporting on this paper so if you can't find it on Safari or something do do try Duck Duck Go because that's where I got it I actually started to prep this about three days ago and when I went and clicked on it this morning it just wasn't there you know one of those can't find it sort of make messages anyway let's look at a little more detail now because it's a pretty significant paper and it's not only showing what this this particular autoimmune reaction is to Multiple Sclerosis but is there other autoimmune reactions well the one I'm allowed to talk about is is this one because it's a who publication um you get the impression it's probably been taken down from some other servers um but hey what do I know now this is the paper here uh COVID19 vaccination can induce now this is the this is the who so Canon juice multiple sclerosis via cross-reactive T helper uh CD4 Health cells recognizing SARS coronavirus to Spike protein and as we've said myelin this essential myelin that protects the cells in the central nervous system now the article goes on both natural infection and mRNA vaccine based vaccinations can be accompanied by transient autoimmune phenomena now this is pretty significant in itself because here we have the who actually admitting that uh SARS coronavirus 2 vaccines can cause autoimmune phenomena this is actually a pretty big breakthrough um let's hope this paper stays up because it really is quite a groundbreaking piece and I am live from the who website now via Duck Duck Go uh and uh and um I can't remember the search engine now but just don't don't go anyway um do let me know if you find it under the search engines because I've had difficulty um so on set of autoimmune disease confirmed by the World Health Organization now here we have a test case of two multiple sclerosis patients with clinical signs and new radiological Signs Now what this means is radiological signs is the um if you do MRI of the brain and the spinal cord it's very obvious when you see multiple sclerosis because you have these multiple patches in the old days multiple sclerosis used to be called disseminated sclerosis because you get patches in different parts of the body hence the different uh symptoms in different parts of the body from different lesions in the brain and spinal cord but we now call it multiple sclerosis now they're saying it's a temporal relationship to the spike protein vaccine in other words the vaccine came first and the multiple chlorosclerosis came second does this mean there's an automatic cause or correlation no it doesn't but we go back to the title of the paper COVID19 vaccination can induce multiple sclerosis so the very title of the paper is indicating that there is a causal relationship at least that's the way I read the title of that paper how long it will be there for of course is a different matter um the aim of the study uh the onset of multiple sclerosis in two cases are very likely so the saying very likely caused by the CD helper cells that cross recognize SARS coronavirus to spike protein from myelin proteins now um Spike specific uh T helper cells from peripheral they found these cells in peripheral blood and they found them in the cerebrospinal fluid most of you probably know the cerebrospinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord all the central nervous systems in this cerebral spinal fluid is a shock absorber but it's also immunologically very important as as well and they were underwent Auto antigen screening now an auto antigen is is part of you it's a it's a it's a it's a it's part of you it's endogenous um but it stimulates the production of Auto antibodies so it's when one of your own proteins stimulates antibodies to beat up on your own proteins which of course is the the essence of autoimmune disease and that is what is happening in this case according to the who circular which is uh which is still there um um so they looked up a list of well-known Auto antigens in multiple sclerosis these people knew what to look for the results self-reactive T cells were detected from Spike specific T-cell populations so the yes the vaccine in that sense worked it stimulated the T helper cells but also showed reactivity against various proteins now this MBP we'll look at in a minute the MOG is the myelin oligodendrocyte protein now what that means is this is the um this is the central nervous system here's the myelin sheath and in the central nervous system this myelin sheath is produced by the oligodendrocytes or the oligodendron glial cells so it's a protein that's specific to these cells that are producing this myelin sheath the oligodendrocytes so these are specific myelin related proteins now I'm just going to give a quick this is papers in parenthesis here but um this is just to give a some insight this is about multiple sclerosis and myelin based proteins um my myelin-based protein uh so this MBP that they found the cross reactivity to one of the ones so this cross-reactivity between the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and the spike protein there's also a cross-reactivity between this myelin-based um protein here it's a central nervous system protein in the myelin as uh MBP has long been studies as a factor in the pathogenesis and the beginning of autoimmune the auto neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis so this is not new science this is well established it is the cross-reactivity where the antibodies produced from the vaccine that is new and multiple sclerosis is characterized by central nervous system inflammation demyelination axon or loss and as we said Progressive paralysis so getting back to the paper finally we found pro-inflammatory T cell clones so in other words these the T cells were involved as as well um now it's the T Cell involved here just seems to be the T helper cells whether other ones were involved we're not told but anyway these pro-inflammatory T cell clones like the CD helper cell the CD4 cell they recognize spoke Spike protein and immunodominant myelin-based proteins in other words they're beating up on the myelin tooth as well as the spike protein and as we said myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptides which have previously been implicated in multiple sclerosis their conclusion detailed studies of both peripheral blood and cerebral spinal fluid derived CD4 plus T cells that's the C help Burton CD4 helper cells the T helper lymphocytes shows that the onset of multiple sclerosis in these two very likely caused by the T helper cells clones that the population of these cells that are developed the cross-recognized SARS coronavirus 2 Spike protein derived peptides and peptides derive from myelin proteins in other words it's beating upon the same it's beating up on the same similar structures a similar molecular structures in both of these areas beating up on the spike protein is good beating up on your own um myelin in the central nervous system is potentially a disastrous so um I think we'll actually leave that out there's more I'll tell you well we'll go on for a bit more there's always more there's always more to say but um um you've got the main effort so that's just part of the text I was working on before I lost before I found the new DuckDuckGo site uh now post misrepresent research on multiple sclerosis vaccines found by 2who databases now the fact Checkers have helpfully waded in on this and um quite a few fact Checkers it's obviously put the wind up them a bit um very good of these fact Checkers to tell us uh what's going on so we don't need to bother thinking for ourselves but I think we'll pass on it because I think we do like to think for ourselves now this is a bit of line because this is not new now this is a paper here this is another paper new diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in settings of mRNA COVID vaccine exposure this is published published published in January 2022 so this is based on data collected in 2021. why wasn't this highlighted at the time why wasn't it highlighted at the time multiple sclerosis with onset uh with onset in the settings of acute SARS coronavirus 2 virus infected people has been reported so yes it's possible after natural infection and reactivity of multiple sclerosis following mRNA COVID vaccines there have been three reports of newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis following exposures to mRNA COVID vaccines so yes that is occurring in 2021 the association cannot be determined to be causal of course because it could be caused by other factors but it's temporal correlation whereas the new who paper goes further and says it's now lightly um we report a series of five cases of newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis following recent exposure of mRNA COVID vaccines now this bit's a bit concerning latency from vaccination to initial presentation varied neurological manifestation the clinical course appear to be typical for MS so the time between people getting vaccinated and developing the features of multiple sclerosis varied there was latency how long could this latency be we don't know in these cases it was fairly short because of course the vaccines only started in in 2021 so these must have been within the course of a year are there more to come we don't know that not least we haven't been told that someone there's probably some information around somewhere um but there's multiple sclerosis responding as normal so their conclusion was acute neurological deficits in the settings of recent mRNA COVID vaccination and administration may represent new onset multiple sclerosis so we knew that in uh 2022 and yet nothing changed incredible why won't the warned of these risks at a much earlier stage well the the research wonders but it didn't translate into um any meaningful findings right now just a couple of quick things um this is um petition if you're in the if you're in the UK you can sign this petition here that we're concerned about the new who amendments and some amendments that are going to kick in in just a few months that we didn't know about that have been kept quiet so if you click on that if you're in the UK you can sign that uh petition and when we get to 100 thousand signatures there has to be a parliamentary debate albeit it's a fairly small one but there has to be something let's get up to a hundred thousand and um stop this uh uh these new international health things from the World Health Organization or at least not stop them let's have a parliamentary debate rather than rubber stamping it and the other thing I'll put a link in in the description as well but I've started a sub stack as well um don't know how much time I'll have to put on things but um you can put some I've put some quite detailed physiology and pathophysiology on there and um as well as news more news related items so there we go World Health Organization quite surprising really COVID19 vaccinations can induce multiple sclerosis from The Who itself um and I can tell you about this one because it is an official who site let's hope the who published more so I'm free to discuss more pathology a bit concerning about what's going to happen over the next couple of years in terms of prevalence but um we'll find out won't we we'll leave it there for now and uh thank you for watching,0.3755005237817739

25,NGxPkc_9uhY,"Going against FDA, Florida Surgeon General discourages use of mRNA COVID vaccines","Florida's Surgeon General is calling into question the safety of the mRNA COVID vaccine. Dr. Joseph Latipo is calling for a stop to the use of the vaccine, but federal officials disagree with him. News Channel Ace Melissa Marino has the story from Tampa. This is a copy of the letter that Dr. Joseph Latipo sent to the FDA saying he has concerns about the safety of the vaccine and he's now recommending against it. Now this goes against what the FDA and other local vaccine experts are saying. They say that advice could be dangerous. In an unprecedented move, Florida's Surgeon General calling to halt the use of the mRNA COVID vaccine going against the FDA. We continue to live in a world where the CDC and the FDA when it comes to COVID at least are just leading their own path and a direction that is inexplicable in terms of thinking about data and thinking about common sense. Dr. Joseph Latipo spoke on the issue a few months ago and December 6th sent this letter to the FDA citing safety concerns and a case study that claims mRNA could cause cancer if a sequence of events happen. Dr. Thomas Unash with USF Center for Global Health Research says that's highly unlikely. One in several hundred billion that this would actually occur. The FDA sent this letter in response to Dr. Latipo saying the FDA is confident in the quality, safety and effectiveness of the COVID19 vaccines. Also responding to each of the Surgeon General's questions about the vaccine safety. Dr. Latipo also saying there hasn't been enough clinical trials. Worldwide several billion people who have gotten mRNA vaccines. So to say that we don't have the data, in fact we do have Dr. Unash worries Dr. Latipo's stance could be dangerous. Are there going to be more people who aren't going to get vaccinated and as a result is particularly among the you know the at-risk groups there are people who don't get vaccinated and then there are people who are going to end up hospitalized and die from the infection. Latipo would need federal approval to stop distribution of the vaccine in Florida something that for now is unlikely to happen. Melissa Moreno 8 on your side.",0.4536666666666666
26,uOxppT3gPpE,Post-vac syndrome: &#39;There is no such thing as a vaccine without side effects&#39; | DW News,"Have you heard of the post-bac syndrome? It's a name some people in Germany are using for long-term side effects after a COVID vaccination. Based on a few minor studies and observations, scientists estimate that the likelihood of severe side effects is low. Really low. Researchers speak of around 0.01 to 0.02 percent of all vaccinated people. That is quite a normal risk for any medicine or vaccine. Personally, I definitely wanted to get vaccinated. First of all, to protect myself, myself, but of course others. Annette Herbert says she suffers from post-bac syndrome. I met her in Cologne, Germany. Annette was working as a medical assistant when she was vaccinated back in 2021. But right after the jab, she says this happened. I had the most severe pain in my thighs. I went to bed and a few minutes later I realized that my right leg no longer belonged to me. I could move somehow, but not like usual. And the front feet were like pigeons. Up until today, the feeling in her forefeet is mostly gone. She suffers from nerve pain, overstimulation and is exhausted quickly. Similar symptoms can occur in rare cases with other vaccines as well. But since many people were vaccinated at the same time during the COVID19 pandemic, exceptional cases were more prominent. There is nothing without side effects. And of course, as with any other vaccine, there can be side effects. So far, there is no evidence that the proportion of long-lasting symptoms after the COVID vaccinations is unusually high, according to the Paul Ehrlich Institute, referring to an investigation of suspected cases from 36 countries. The Paul Ehrlich Institute is the German Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedical Medicinal Products. The problem, however, is that people like Annette, who may be suffering from adverse events after a COVID vaccination, felt neglected for a long time. Only slowly is the topic getting more attention. For her, it's clear that the jab is to blame. But with the exception of one doctor, she told me, no one would take her seriously. I found it sometimes very despicable how they treated me. Also, this always, no, I don't believe you, that has nothing to do with the vaccination, although it was very short-lived for me. So it wasn't months later, but directly. When I heard her story, I started researching and found more and more people that share similar experiences. There is yet no solid scientific proof of a relationship between the COVID19 jab and the symptoms described. But experts say it's just a matter of time. For Annette, that's an unbearable situation. She found a safe space in her self-help group. Here, she can share her experiences with other affected people. Their symptoms vary, but they are united in rage and disappointment. And one more detail, everyone I talked to in the group were initially positive about the COVID vaccine. You really have to read yourself in, become a specialist yourself, and then make sure that you are being examined. It's just awful. We didn't just get sick physically, we were socially excluded. Financially, we were all harmed. We lost friends because we weren't believed. Let's remember, the pandemic was a highly political time, in Germany and elsewhere. The atmosphere within society was charged. Anti-vaxxers took to the street, claiming the jab makes you sick or even kills you. People questioning the side effects found themselves pigeonholed with anti-vaxxers. Now, research is starting slowly. It just takes time until it's running and you have results. We have to focus on several years. If you let studies run for a while, we get results in two or three years at most. Annette and the others want to see research efforts stepped up. The problem is that the supply structures are not there, or that it has been denied. That's the main problem. That's my main criticism of this whole situation. The damage is there, but that people are left standing in the ring and are still being directed back, and that we demand proofs, no matter how bad the people are. Some people who say they have post-vaxx syndrome are now suing vaccine manufacturers like BioNTech and Pfizer for compensation. But right now, what seems to be needed is research, research and more research.",0.4179149645346828
27,3rIQHrbDguM,COVID at SEAL Team - Refusing Coronavirus with Chris Cappa | Mike Drop Clips - Ep. #174, So Co was a big deal um obviously we're essential cuz the dogs have to be clean fed and upkept you know they're alive so the contractor training company was there and hands down and me and the kennel master we do have a kennel master there he's an MA like most most at least most places in the Navy have him and we had to run a blue gold schedule because they didn't want us all there um and training you know we were kind of Off the Grid so no one knew we really existed kind of so we got away with you know doing what we wanted to do wasn't too bad to me it's fascinating and alarming that uh the whole Co experience had the impact that it had on our military well it got me out yeah forced me out really yeah I didn't take it no  I I refused it in my uh EOS lined up and it was a complete and utter abortion and Alleyway for me because I had to put a religious R waiver in like most guys Kick the Can down the road long enough until it was my time to go and I literally made the choice I think I got out in like 61 days wow no plan no job no nothing no doubt no kids or two kids in a family just said nope this doesn't feel right guys I'm sorry it just doesn't feel right and uh and unfortunately it wasn't what the brochur said the experience anymore so it was taking my smile so it was time for me not good for you I I I applaud that I think uh how do you how does it sit with you now looking back and seeing the military saying hey if you want to come back in cuz you didn't do it you know you're welcome like how many of those guys are like  you I'm not coming back in do you know anybody that's come back in no and all the guys were already at that point of  you yeah because of how they were being treated the guys that were saying hey this doesn't feel right I don't think I agree with this I mean they got railroaded oh man I mean I know I know on the I know on the west coast they were pretty powerful movement over there and on the East Coast they just coralled these dudes in an office and said check in every day we don't care you know like it was you're black bald man like it was yeah they wanted you under ma supervision I mean it was what dude guys were for not getting the shot guys were fighting for their lives man dude what fighting for their lives dude it was crazy um dude that's that's embarrassing it's very embarrassing and uh it got to the point with me my wife and I were you know holding tight saying hey well we feel this way then we're being told it's time to get to leave yeah wow um but I I I feel like you like you to answer your question I feel like it's complete UT dog  that they're going welcome people back they kicked out yeah I mean there's no way I would do it absolutely not matter of fact I'm going to come after you and probably sue you to be honest with you yeah I think I think they should yep uh do you know about how many guys ref like how many no  active duty seals refused the shot and were forced out of the military I don't have that number ballpark dozens hundreds I would say dozens because I know in the West CO I think the the group in the west coast that kind of started it like Hey we're going to lawyer up this doesn't feel right it was a pretty big group of dudes I don't think it I think it was somewhere 10 or more and I know in the on the East Coast it was guys were on a daily mission like well if I don't do this and I got you know and that was another dozen two dozen dudes that were in a holding pattern of what their future was going to be and these weren't all like new guys This Is War you know veterans that were like this does not feel right that's absurd yep absolutely absurd yep um so all right so you play that game long enough to at least get out without having to kicked out got my got my honorable which was good did the the were the guys that were forced out for not getting the shot did they get other thanor I believe so or they're getting threatened with that I believe if not dishonorable because you were getting hit by you were not you were disobeying a direct order to me this sucks for two reasons right uh actually more than two reasons but the primary two are that I get the hey when you sign up like you can't refuse all the other inoculations and you can't be like no I don't want that like this is what you're getting you signed up that's part of the deal I get that where this is different is is that you know that's not one that you signed up to get number one and number two it's like you know I mean you can argue till we're all blue in the face about the efficacy or the lack of efficacy of it but the fact that it was you know essentially experimental it was rushed through it wasn't part of the program when you signed up you know it's it's kind of an oddball you know to me from a legality standpoint it's kind of a weird grade area that way like you know where I think it's the most disheartening is that you know to take guys say look like I could understand if the Navy said we would like everybody to get it but we're not going to force you to get it you know um you can suggest of sell to me all day long yeah but I have to have a choice yeah to to me that that is how they should have handled it to to legitimately like slap your dick on the counter and say if you don't get this we're we're kicking qualified combat veteran active duty Navy Seals out of the military because you won't take this  shot to me says so much more about what what I've been bitching about since you you and I have have come in contact with each other since last night and just just the lack of overall quality leadership and the higher you go the worse it gets you know and to me this is as clear-cut of an example that exists uh you know of that um from morale standpoint from a an overall Community Vibe if you will you know you've you've gotten now how the  is there a fly flying around in here especially in this weather Bryce handle that will you um the uh from your perspective having gotten out fairly recently um how would you characterize the overall morale of of the seal Community right now I have more conversations on a weekly basis with the guys that are so lost because they lost what they feel as a part of of them when they had to inevitably leave the sealed teams before they wanted to yeah um I was one of them and I think between that instance the situation we're talking about now and then everything else because the op Tempo isn't where it was and now everyone's so focused on I hate to say but like haircuts and shaves and stuff that I understand we join the military and there has to be some bearing there I'm not going to say we're special so we should get special but we should be focused on our priority and that's defending this country at the highest level yeah and I don't think that that's necessarily the priority all the time and I think from the the mafia you know the little E5 E6 Mafia it's um they're still going to be pipe hitters and they're still going to get after it but I think that a lot of guys are really looking at it like man it's not what the brochure said yeah and I think that it's it's heartbreaking it was for me it was really difficult to to make that transition out when I wasn't done I had plenty of left in me to give to the Navy um and uh yeah like I said a lot of my buddies it's a weekly conversation on what's next what do we do next how how do we navigate this space that we didn't anticipate being in and I found my you know found my silver lining s my found my light through helping others get out with what they're entitled you know to get out with so yeah it's it's low morale is low my friend let's just to put it in nutshell very low and I'm talking with guys coming off you know coming off the birds now from deployment and you know on my Coast it's we we got to get across the street we got to get over to the command like we're trying to we want we want them to take the next step forward you know yeah I mean I think from a from a again from a big picture standpoint I you know would would beg to differ a little bit in that uh you know it's called Naval special Warfare called Special Operations know you know so so to me you know whether you're shaved or not or you're uniform looks a certain way it's like yeah you're in the military but Special Operations are unconventional unconventional by Design correct and I I think you should you should always look at like I was saying last night you know to me the the simplest question that you should always ask yourself when you're deciding whether or not to do something is does it make us a more effective War fighting force the answer is yes do it to me if if you're expecting guys to be uh as Blended in and and as um kind of autonomous as possible within the military to go execute anti terrorism and and quick strike raids and unconventional warfare to me the smart answer is will let them from a uniform and and code standpoint let them be however they need to be to be good at that you know um I think being clean shaven with a high and tight has no bearing on that and and if anything you know the amount of time that you spend going through training and getting to that point is something that very few people uh obtain and and if something as simple as letting guys have beards and out of rgg tattoos and  ponytails or Top Knots they look like Vikings or or whatever if that helps them feel more like a a Band of Brothers if it raises morale why not do it you know it's not hurting anything we need you back man we need you back bro,0.4792125531934448
28,fdGj6p2qDdk,The Nobel laureates behind mRNA COVID vaccines," it's easy to think of great historical moments  in the abstract but too often the people behind   them are largely forgotten this morning Kelefa  Sanneh spends time with two unsung heroes whose   groundbreaking work we can all be thankful for  Katie will tell you I'm a quieted guy who sticks   to myself I didn't know about him either I  didn't chit chat around at the University of   Pennsylvania Medical School Drew Weissman and  Katalin Karikó known as Kati met by chance at   a copy machine in 1998 we both used to copy a  lot of Articles to read we started talking he   was an immunologist studying cells that adapt to  mount immune responses against diseases she was   a biochemist working with messenger RNA known  as mRNA the molecule that teaches cells how   to make proteins I joke it's like the reese's  commercial where the chocolate and the peanut   butter come together and make a new treat  we learn from each other what is it do you   think that makes a good scientific team respect  each other listen to each other we didn't try to   overpower each other you know just did you try  no never their collaboration led to the Pfizer   and Moderna covid vaccines in 2020 that year  the virus spread worldwide leading to Global   lockdowns and killing Millions I knew the minute  I heard about it it's a virus it's a respiratory   infection I knew the vaccine was going to work  how did the lockdown affect your life and your   work we never stopped working they work day and  night different shifts and minimizing the presence   of people in one room this is the Frozen vaccine  wow for patients you thaw this out you dilute it   and you inject it in their arms the MRNA Covid  vaccine uses mRNA to direct the cells to create   a spike protein like the one on the surface of  the virus so the body builds defenses against   that protein this protection helps fight the virus  the vaccine became available in the United States   in December 2020 that month Weissman and Karikó  were vaccinated with a flourish did you think on   that day about all the years and Decades of  work it took to get to that point yes yes I   I was thinking about that and thinking about what  we went through they put up some cameras and took   pictures and and had fun Pfizer Moderna which  one Pfizer the covid vaccine reduced the death   toll and helped people get back to relatively  normal lives was there any disappointment that   the vaccine didn't just sort of put an end to  covid once and for all in the beginning of the   pandemic I would go into the Intensive Care  units and every bed would have a covid patient   on a ventilator doing poorly and now when I went  into the Intensive Care units there were no covid   patients at all and that's because of the vaccine  and their work will be used in the battle against   some of the world's most difficult diseases how  bright is the future it's truly phenomenal right   now there's 250 Phase 1 clinical trials of RNA  vaccines people are making vaccines for HIV for   malaria for Hepatitis C for TB for food allergies  talk to a parent with a kid with a peanut allergy   and every day is a panic the covid vaccines were  backed by government mandates and sparked an   uproar the controversy I still don't understand  people thinking that science and vaccines are   out to get them and I've never heard of such a  thing before well maybe it's just what happens   when politics collides with medicine that's not  the job of our politicians they're not supposed   to tell people how to live less well of how to die  from diseases they're supposed to help the world   this past December 3 years after the vaccine was  released the Nobel Prize committee awarded Karikó   and Weissman its 18 karat gold medallion how  long does it take for it to sink in it's still   happening yeah it takes time did you think  finally my finally moment was the phase three   clinical trials when we saw that the vaccines  were 95 percent effective that was a life's work has   turned into something useful did you take a moment  to celebrate no I'm not much of a celebrator I I   just probably went back to work famously I ate  the whole bag of chocolate covered peanuts well   on a day like that you had definitely earned it  a good good scientific lab has top-of-the-line   equipment but a really great scientific lab has  a trophy room when you think about like becoming   a scientist is it somewhere in the back of your  head like I might win the Nobel Prize never no my   parents when I was maybe five they were brought in  on a tour of the Nobel Auditorium and at one point   they walked up to a pair of seats and said Reserve  these for us if weissman's rise seem predictable   Karikó's did not born in communist Hungary Karikó  never knew a scientist but she knew she wanted to   be one in 1985 30-year-old Kati Karikó along with  her husband and young daughter left Hungary for a   job in a lab in Pennsylvania this teddy bear  seems like it would be kind of out of place   but this is actually a very important bear isn't  it yes this is the bear that uh helped us get to   America and start our life if I turn this over  someone did a little surgery on this teddy bear   didn't they tell me what happened here I put  $1,000 equivalent of British pounds and I saw   it back because in Hungary we were not allowed to  take any money out of the country your daughter   was the mule nobody found it nobody suspected  and from there to here Nobel Prize yeah and   some decades in between yeah decades spent doing  what both Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman truly   love laboratory is a is is a wonderful place and  so kind of my home is a laboratory I sometimes get   the sense that maybe you would rather be in the  lab doing your work than talking to journalists   yeah partially it is true but also we realize  that it is important to go out and educate the   public and explain what we are doing and Inspire  the next generation of scientists exactly I mean   I'm much happier and nothing personal I'm still  happier sitting in my office or in my lab working   that's my favorite place as a member of the  human race I'm glad to have you working in your lab",0.4671142547928262

34,UijQ-6jhVuc,Doctor Dies After Getting COVID Vaccine? Post Vaccine Deaths," hey guys welcome to another video yesterday i  was seeing one of my patients in the pulmonary   clinic and she was asking me about my  thoughts about getting the covid vaccine   she also asked me if i heard about the doctor  in florida who died after getting the first   pfizer vaccination so this is something i want  to talk about so there was an obstetrician   gynecologist in miami who received the first  dose of the pfizer vaccine on december 18th   and shortly after receiving the vaccine he  reportedly developed acute immune thrombocytopenia   he died 16 days after getting the vaccine his  cause of death being a result of brain hemorrhage   or bleeding into the brain obviously  this is horrible it's tragic and you   have to feel for his family but it makes you  wonder was his death a result of the vaccine   and if it was a result of the vaccine should that  change your perspective on getting the vaccine   so i'm going to tell you my thoughts on this but  first let's learn a little bit more about what   happened pfizer is actively investigating the case  but they don't seem to think that the vaccine is   the cause of this so far over 10 million people in  the united states have received at least one shot   of either the pfizer or the moderna covid vaccine these are the two authorized in the   united states as of right now me personally  i received both doses of the pfizer vaccine   which overall went very smoothly now so far  there have been about 40 cases of anaphylaxis   as a result of these vaccines meaning a severe  allergic reaction none of which were reported   as being fatal now many people have had other  side effects that are very common after the   vaccine like having a sore arm having some fatigue  headache or fever and this typically lasts a day   or two the miami-dade county medical examiner's  office is investigating this death as well   and as of right now there is no official autopsy  report but based off the reports let's see what   we can make of this case so this man was healthy  he did not smoke he did not take any medications   never had any reaction to any medication or  vaccines supposedly three days after he gets   the first dose of the pfizer covid vaccination  he gets tiny reddish spots or petechiae caused   by bleeding under the skin of his hands and feet  this prompted him to go to the er he gets blood   work done and his platelet levels are low and this  is something called thrombocytopenia platelets are   one of the components of blood clotting if  platelets are too low it makes people more   prone to bleeding normal platelet counts range  from anywhere from 150 thousand to 400 thousand or so   people can have spontaneous bleeding including  internal bleeding but that doesn't typically   happen unless the platelet levels are less than  ten thousand his levels were reportedly zero   and because they're so low or absent really  he gets admitted to the intensive care unit   for two weeks doctors tried to get his platelet  count higher as he had experts from all over the   country involved in his care now presumably  they tried a number of different treatments   typically we give platelet transfusions which is  really a blood product that we're transfusing but   also we give steroids specifically glucocorticoids  such as salimetrol or methylprednisolone if that   doesn't work we try other drugs like ramiplostim  or eltrombopag to try to stimulate the bone   marrow to make more platelets sometimes we give  immunoglobulins sometimes we give a drug called   rituximab which is a monoclonal antibody if  all else fails the last resort is to take out   the spleen because sometimes a spleen plays a  role in sequestering and destroying platelets   so they were actually planning on doing  a splenectomy meaning removing his spleen   but shortly before that he ends up developing a  hemorrhagic stroke that took his life in a matter   of minutes in other words he bled into his brain  now just because someone bleeds into their brain   it doesn't necessarily mean that they die but  what happens is if the bleeding is severe enough   the pressure starts building up inside the skull  and this is known as raised intracranial pressure   and this compresses the brain and eventually the  pressure forces the brain down through the base   of the skull that big hole at the bottom  of the skull known as the foramen magnum   when this happens the only life-saving option is  emergent brain surgery where a neurosurgeon does a   craniotomy to relieve the intracranial pressure  but his bleeding was so severe and happened so   quickly it took his life and his thrombocytopenia  was not only severe but it wasn't getting better   despite all the treatments that they tried and  this leads to the question why does a healthy   guy all of a sudden get severe thrombocytopenia  to the point of bleeding to death because no   matter what the cause is this kind of thing is  incredibly rare i've never had a similar case   like this in the intensive care unit now there are  some cases like this reported with certain drugs   medications can lead to thrombocytopenia  as a result of drug-induced antibodies   being made by the immune system that  end up attacking the body's platelets   so drug-induced thrombocytopenia refers to  acute immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and   it should be suspected when someone has a sudden  severe thrombocytopenia so ditp or drug-induced   thrombocytopenia is even more strongly suspected  when a patient has repeated episodes of a sudden   severe drop in the platelet count by far the  most common drugs that cause this are things like   quinidine the blood thinner heparin and then also  sulfonylureas like trimethoprim saltomethoxazole   aka bactrim and also there's other antibiotics  that are fairly common that cause this as well   so it's not just drugs that can cause this  but also certain foods herbal remedies and one   vaccine the mmr vaccine the risk of itp occurring  within six weeks after getting the mmr vaccination   is increased however the attributable risk of  thrombocytopenia within six weeks after mmr   vaccination remains overall low at one in 25 thousand  vaccinated children now complications or long-term   consequences of itp in this age group are rare  for the majority of children less than six years   of age the illness is self-limiting vaccines  stimulate the immune system and in theory could   in rare cases cause it to mistakenly identify some  of a patient's own cells as enemy invaders that   should be destroyed but with that said millions  of various vaccinations are given every year   and clusters of thrombocytopenia don't occur and  regarding the covid vaccine millions of doses   have been given and so far there are no other  reports or associations with low platelet counts   so did the pfizer vaccine cause this based on the  timing of things it seems like it but it's too   early to come to a conclusion one way or another  we have to know all the facts and understand the   autopsy report but even then it's still not a  guarantee that we come to a solid conclusion   although this is an incredibly sad story and even  if it does prove that the vaccine did cause this   i hope people aren't dissuaded from getting  the vaccine because this type of thing is still   very incredibly rare every decision we make  in medicine is based on risk versus benefit   and when you compare the risks of covid  and the risks and benefits of the vaccine   the benefits outweigh the risks for the vast  majority of people in fact there are lots of   COVID patients in the intensive care unit that  have thrombocytopenia so that is something   else to put in perspective knowing more details  about this case might help us to better devise   treatment plans in case this happens again and  other people after they get the vaccine but   i doubt we're going to hear many more cases like  this anyway that's all i have for this video   thanks for watching and i'll  see you in the next one you",0.4971023888103095
35,nqZdzaKFF3c,What you need to know about the new Covid vaccine,"Turning now to the coronavirus pandemic, as the new COVID shots have now received the green light by both the CDC and FDA and now they might be on their way to a pharmacy near you. That's right, this latest round of boosters have been recommended for anyone over the age of six months and the CDC is now urging people to get this latest jab as COVID cases rise across the country. NBC News medical fellow Dr. Akshay Sahil joins us now from one of these pharmacies where you can soon receive this shot. Dr. Sahil, great to see you. I guess kind of two questions here for you. I think we keep talking about this as a booster. Does the kind of the mindset need to change about this just being something you get every year? And how do these new COVID shots differ from the last ones? Good morning, guys. Yeah, we're here to see the S in Midtown New York, where some of the first people in the country actually got that updated vaccine that you're talking about Savannah. And and yeah, to answer your question, we're looking to turn this updated COVID vaccine and sort of the thought process behind this into what we see with the flu Savannah. And so that really comes down to, you know, having an annual vaccine once a year that really matches the current strains. And Savannah, the reason that, you know, health officials are saying this is so necessary is because our vaccines that we had before aren't really matching the current variants that we see. So with this updated vaccine, we're really hoping to bolster that protection against the current variants and really keep people out of the hospital. Savannah. So Dr. Sahil, there has been some push back against the new COVID shots by Florida Governor Rhonda Santus, who's also running for president. He's now advising Floridian 65 and under not to get them, saying in a statement, quote, I will not stand by and let the FDA and CDC use healthy Floridians as guinea pigs for new booster shots that have not been proven to be safe or effective. What should people know that we know there are people who have questioned whether these vaccines are safe. This is politics from Governor to Santa's. But for those who do have legitimate questions, what's your advice to those who might be opposed to getting the shot? Hey, Joe. Yeah, you know, my advice to those who may be opposed to getting the shot. It really comes down to your risk profile, meaning that are you somebody if you are under the age of 65? Are you somebody who has a lot of chronic health conditions? Are you somebody who has diabetes? Are you somebody who's suffering from obesity? If you are somebody who's under the age of 65 and you have those things, I would really strongly urge you to consider getting this vaccine. And I think that's my big problem with the Florida statement, Joe, is that, you know, it looks at a blanket statement for those under 65 really not considering people at an individual level, those who may have certain risk factors, those may be living with somebody who has certain risk factors. So that's really where my advice comes in, Joe. And Dr. Salina, you spoke to some patients who received this vaccine. What they say? Yes, Savannah, we wanted to be out here and really hear from people who are the first in line to get this shot. Take a listen to some patients here at CVS and why they wanted to get the vaccine in the first place. I'm traveling next week to Japan and I'm going to be surrounded by a lot of people, so I just want to make sure I'm safe. Also, I have a number of friends who are actually down with covid right now, so I think it's important for me to stay safe, you know, get, you know, the vaccine. My primary motivation is I don't want to get my family sick, and that's my primary concern. And then also people around me, my friends. For those who are wondering when they can get the shot, many pharmacies are offering it today, but most should have it within the next seven days. And guys, you really want to aim to get both the covid vaccine and the flu vaccine before Halloween. All right. Good reminder there, Dr. Okshasa. Thank you so much. Thanks for watching.

38,Z-zWo835gOs,COVID-19: GP explains why she won&#39;t have vaccine but says she&#39;s not anti-vax,"Doctor, I want to know why you won't have a vaccine. I've looked at the risk benefit analysis like I do for all drugs that just come out on the market. So naturally, as soon as a drug, any drug or vaccine comes on the market, I will wait before I prescribe it or wait before I actually take it myself, just to see what sort of, you know, side effects come out. But also there are other issues like for myself, I got Covid, I had some immunity, and also I had some other illnesses. So I might have some predisposing factor to be more likely to have a side effect, for example. Our regular GP says you're being irresponsible by not having a vaccine. I'd like you to reply to that, please, if you would. There are many irresponsible behaviours, but we don't criticise other people for. So, for example, the vascular surgery ward is full of people maybe who smoke, and we don't go about saying, oh, you're so irresponsible for smoking, or you're on the liver transplant ward and you have drunk alcohol. We don't not treat people because of the decisions that they have made. The issue is that the Covid crisis is petering out. I mean, we had good news yesterday that the cases are going down. And it looks like, you know, coming towards March, Michael Gove said that we should learn to live with Covid. If an 85 year old patient of yours came to see you, and as a result of you not having been vaccinated, they contracted Covid from you with whatever effects that might have, how would that make you feel? They wouldn't necessarily have got it from me because I wouldn't necessarily be carrying Covid. You don't know what my antibodies are like. You don't know that I'm not protected on it. To carry Covid, it gives you some immunity if you have your vaccinations and your booster, unless you're flying in the face of everything else that we've been told. Are you right and all the other doctors are wrong? No, you are likely to be safer if you have the boosters and vaccinations. That's not the issue. The issue is that even if you do, you could still transmit the virus. Less likely to. Not necessarily for me. You reduce the odds. You can reduce the odds, but the point is that people, I'm worried that people are going to lose their jobs and the NHS is going to really suffer.",0.5617574199304969

41,xYW-o8CNQiU,Lunatic &quot;Doctor&quot;: Everyone You Know Will Die from COVID Vaccine,"  Anti-vaccine so-called expert Sherri  Tenpenny is again spreading fear and promulgating   disinformation about the COVID19 vaccine. She is  now warning everyone that is close to you is soon   going to die from the COVID vaccine, not from  COVID, from the COVID vaccine. Sherri Tenpenny   is now warning about a tsunami of deaths in  2023. She says by the end of this calendar year,   the year of the Lord 2023, every one of us will  know five, maybe ten or more people who have died   from the COVID vaccine. Okay. Let's listen to what  she had to say. This is very instructive in terms   of fear mongering and so many other things.  Let's listen now. We're seeing the   tsunami of deaths. Tsunami I've been talking about  since the beginning of 21. Millions of people are   going to die. You know, when Judy Mikovits came  out on Plandemic at the beginning of that and by.   The way, that was one of the biggest  nonsense propaganda films. Plandemic and Mikovits   It's crazy to even mention it.  That   that more than 50 million people are going  to die. And everybody was like, Whoa!   And when they started interviewing me and I and  they asked me, what did I think about that number,   I said, It's way too low. Oh, it's going to be  much more than 50 million people in America alone.   And we're already starting to see it.  We're not.   So the tsunami of deaths is  coming. It's already here. And I believe   that what's happening now is is starting  to happen now is the tsunami of regrets   of the people that fell for the lies,  the fear, friends and family members and   parents and children. And all they did  to your grandchildren just could not be   told otherwise. But now that people are dying  like flies, I mean, my business partner has   83 close people in his life that have died.  You know, most the truth is most   people don't have 83 people in their lives that  they are close to. This is like a separate issue,   but these are obvious lies.  83.   Yeah. No.  It's the beginning.   And I predict that by the end of this year,  every person in this room and every person   listening behind here is going to know a minimum  of five, probably ten or more close friends and.   Figure you don't have as many  friends as her business partner. So you'll   have only 5 to 10 people die.  Members that have   died from these shots.  Right.   So I want to remind everybody, and this is so  controversial every time people say David, is   Sherri Tenpenny a doctor? Is she not a doctor? And  when I explain it, people get mad. Sherry Tenpenny   is not a medical doctor. She is an osteopathic  physician. Now, whenever I make that distinction,   people start writing in, including osteopath,  saying, David, you shouldn't act as though that   is less than being an MD. I'm not saying anything.  I'm just telling you she's not an M.D. She's an   osteopathic physician, and her claims have no  scientific basis. It doesn't mean every osteopath   believes the things Sherri Tenpenny believes. I'm  not saying that at all. All I'm telling you is   actual medical doctors have debunked her claims.  Health organizations have debunked your claims.   Many osteopathic have also debunked her claims.  But in the sense that osteopathic physicians   are doctors, she is indeed a doctor. Now, if she  sounds familiar, and this is really the big point   I want to make. It's because we have listened  to her predictions in the past, and of course,   none of them have come to pass. What I would like  is accountability for these people when they make   these predictions. Let's remember and then we can  follow up and say, hey, that stuff didn't happen.   Because remember when she said this last year?  The more shots you get, the more the   more you destroy your immune system and the  faster that happens. And it's anticipated.   The German data says that by the end of  2022, every fully vaccinated person over   the age of 30 may have the equivalent of full  blown vaccine induced immune suppressed AIDS.   Ladies and gentlemen, as a fully  vaccinated person over the age of 30, I am here   today to tell you I do not have full blown vaccine  induced immune suppressed AIDS. I do have a little   neck pain from a weird movement I did at the gym  three days ago, but I don't have full blown AIDS.   So the point is, it's fear, fear, fear. And we're  going to talk about this later. I can't believe   I'm saying these words. But later on in the show,  I'm going to talk to you about Tucker Carlson,   fear mongering about a space vagina. I know it  sounds insane, but it's what it is. They have to   induce fear. Fear generates the environment they  need in order to then sell you something, whether   it's tickets to an event or a product or liquid,  liquid, silver, whatever it is they sell you.   And then there's no follow up and there's no  accountability. We have to hold these people   accountable for their endless failed predictions.  This is yet another one of those. And if you want   to if you're listening today and you want to see  what this looks like when this woman makes these   claims. We'll have all of these clips on our  YouTube channel, YouTube.com slash The David   Pakman Show and on our Instagram, which you can  find by searching Instagram for David Pakman show.",0.4119047619047619
42,eFx-d0SvOVg,"Higher Number Of COVID Vax Received, Higher RISK Of COVID: Newly Peer Reviewed Study Implies",  a newly peer-reviewed study from the Cleveland Clinic found that the risk of COVID19 varied by the number of COVID19 vaccine doses previously received and the higher the number of vaccines previously received the higher the risk of Contracting COVID19 popular YouTuber and comedian who has been a prominent skeptic over vaccines and mandates throughout the pandemic Jimmy Dore tweeted FYI it's not a vaccine it's a failed experiment we are the guinea pigs all right take these findings with a grain of salt but this is interesting because the first this first came out earlier this year I think around February and there was a lot of pushback at that time part of the pushback was that it was not a peer-reviewed study it was just what's known as a preprint now we're talking about this again because it has been peer reviewed and the parts of the study that raised a red flag to some vaccine Skeptics are still there in the study yeah yeah go ahead yeah so the the the authors of the study note that this is unexpected like I don't think these are people who were these are not like anti-vaccine people who are setting out to disprove the efficacy of vaccines and so so they're saying there was an association of increased risk of COVID19 with higher number of Prior vaccine doses importantly and it was not because so you could rationalize why that might be the case well maybe people who are getting the most um Jabs the most doses of vaccine are people who are older and higher at risk anyway so then yes they're more likely to get COVID19 because they're higher risk so it would just be incidental that they're more likely to get a lot of vaccines and they're more likely to get covered but that's not one doesn't have anything to do with the other however that is not the case here as they lay out of the Cleveland Clinic they're like okay we see why you might think that but the um the yeah that most of the people in this study were young people some young people can be at a high risk of COVID if you have a pre-existing condition but you would not expect that to be most of the people and so they're saying that that really makes this finding um unexpected um yeah the risk yeah the people despite this their risk of acquiring COVID19 the people who had fewer injections was lower than those who'd received a larger number of Prior vaccine doses so it's worth noting that the overall conclusions of the study is that the vaccines do work to buy valence specific valent vaccine work to lower the incidence of covid right they work that this is not a the study is not saying that in that ultimate conclusion should be taken into account the question is whether at a certain point requiring or suggesting that people get multiple vaccines at a certain point that they're whether there is diminishing returns so there's we should distinguish between getting a vaccine or incrementally boosted versus a certain volume that seems to have an unexpected effect the paper also notes that this is not the only study to find a possible association with more prior vaccine Doses and higher risk of COVID19. during an Omicron wave in Iceland individuals who had previously received two or more doses were found to have a higher odds of reinfection than those who had received fewer than two doses of vaccine and an unadjusted analysis and it goes through some um kind of technical scientific reasons why this might be happening something called immune imprinting and some stuff with the spike protein that I think is beyond the technical uh know how of us here but it is being interpreted as validating some concerns and some anecdotal evidence that people have had that folks in their lives who got more vaccinations and more boosts seem to have succumbed to the virus more frequently than those people who only maybe got the first round or what have you again I could see for a very at-risk population or the elderly you might say well even if this is increasing the chance you get COVID19 honestly the odds of getting you know when a wave comes through you have good odds of getting it anyway you want if you're an elderly person or immuno compromised person the protection from the dose is more important than some slightly increased odds that you would get it in the first place the odds being that you were going to get it anyway however to you know to repeatedly boost younger people who are healthy otherwise over and over again they might be saying well you know if I get it I get it but I'd rather not I'd rather not increase my risk of getting it because if I get it I'm probably gonna not have such a bad time with it and maybe I was you know you were maybe you were vaccinated originally and we're just talking about subsequent doses or maybe you had it before they're actually in this paper it does say that um the multivariate analysis also found the more recent the last prior COVID episode the lower risk of covid saying again that's the you know some kind of enduring natural immunity um and I just keep thinking how you know the the places in our society that are still trying to take this decision away from individuals like University campuses where the bivalent some of them is going to be required still in the fall uh that that can like how how naive and and and and unscientific it is to take that decision out of out of people and their doctors and then also the kind of the attempts to suppress um criticism of vaccines you know calling it all misinformation that has occurred online and and Elsewhere for the last three years so short-sighted so a couple of things first it should be noted that this was an unexpected observation in this study and they in the study say that the it needs to be steady further uh so that is you know it's we We I Wouldn't draw too many hard and fast conclusions though I take Jimmy Dora's point that it does feel like if there is in fact a negative result like making people more vulnerable to getting covered and they're just saying well we should have studied this more I can understand people feeling like they are guinea pigs in this situation right that there there should have been more of this kind of research that happened earlier but there was a real hesitancy to do so when we were in the throes of the pandemic but it's also worth noting that the objective or the biggest gain of getting vaccinated we've now known for a long time is preventing hospitalization so this study is talking about whether or not people are more susceptible to access coming to the virus but there's a whole separate conversation about whether or not it's preventing you from having the worst outcomes here so for young people who already tend not to have the worst outcomes I think that's a really interesting question that you're raising about college campuses and the like for even older people there could be a calculation that says sure you might be this percent more likely to catch covid than you might not if you had gotten multiple boosters but if you hadn't gotten boosted you might end up in the hospital or be more likely to die so it's better just to basically like take on more softer waves than to wait for the one big one to take this is yet more or this is another point of data in the column of the group of people for which it is least justifiable if you think it's justifiable at all to require them to get vaccinated is actually the population where the the requirements were most likely school-aged populations sure yeah and I that's just that's so people are going to feel I think so gaslit about all this stuff saying again the the initial promise may be implicitly I guess but a lot of people in the media reported it was that everybody has to get vaccinated we're really encouraging it where we're not requiring it outright we're encouraging it because this is how we're going to stop the spread and we're going to you know get rid of covid because when we have her immunity because you're no longer going to be able to transmit it or get it when you're vaccinated that didn't pan out and like on and on and on and on and on yeah that I I you know not under selling the vaccines I understand that they are the findings are still that they're very protective against severe decent disease and death for at-risk populations but the the logic of the requirements was really for the public health rationale was really on stopping cases yeah I totally get get that and I agree that that was the rationale but it hasn't been out for some time yeah and so I just think from a public health perspective as people are considering these kind of studies it's important to really emphasize that the goal the stated goal for some time now has been to prevent hospitalization and death and that vaccines including this study show that there is a significant benefit when the vaccine is correlated to the stream that's happening it does effectively lower hospitalization uh in depth here right but again you could have a more targeted even based on this study you could say are you in this risk category yeah look at this study you would benefit from vaccination on net you would benefit because even if you're increasing your likelihood of getting covid the protection is is important for severe indices and death you are in this this categorization you're a healthy young person and really all you're doing by getting you know your fifth or something dose is making it a slightly more likely you're going to get covered or whatever it is and that doesn't make as much sense for you and and we and we have not had that Approach at all and people are going to feel anything just valuably outraged and I think that people like Jimmy Dore who are saying well where was all this research why hasn't there been more research about what's going on with covid I think are completely right and I think there also needs to be a sensitivity to and frustration about the lack of research with respect to Long COVID as well whatever you think about it the or whether or not it's credible or whether you're skeptical about how how real it is as a phenomenon the reality is that we are out of ignorance about what's going on allowing the government to basically ratchet back any protections any long-term health care support for people with long COVID any way to protect protect themselves against it and also insulating the manufacturers of vaccines from any liability there's a whole mixed bag of shielding that's happening for people who are going to have outcomes one way or the other and I do think that before we are overly interested in saying well I don't think that long COVID is a thing because it's being used as a pretext for the government to have overreach also downplaying the possibility of long COVID having this effect that's being used as an excuse for the government to not have any responsibility for policies that may have set up a significant portion of the American public to be dealing with a crisis a Health crisis where we don't have Universal Health Care long after the government has washed its hands of all of it well I mean as you know I remain um extremely skeptical of a lot of long-covered claims however if and I I don't know what should be studied I mean it should be studied and I don't really know what people who are very worried about law and covid I'm not sure what the state of their claims are with respect to like is it worse if you've gotten a more COVID19 more times or is it is it correlated with the severity of the infection severity of so if you've gotten it if you get covered a bunch of times but none of them were severe you're not going to get it's no it's also correlated with a number so that's what I'm getting at so so a vaccine that makes you if you're again in a population where you're not at severe risk of it's going to make you more likely to get it maybe from a long COVID19 perspective that is I mean that kind of cuts both ways but that's why I agree with everyone who's looking for profound scripture more more more research and more studies and I do think there is a real issue with there being so much delay here in getting some of this kind of information out well we'll have more Rising right after this foreign ,0.4903232358774234

44,i9JLZuhqRuU,Encephalitis After COVID-19 Vaccine Administration: Perspectives,  welcome to another medcram COVID19 update today we're going to review a couple of papers that go into detail about autopsy findings in patients with disease in the heart related to Spike protein who have been previously vaccinated and specifically we're going to look at the brain and the heart in a particular case where someone died with Encephalitis we at medcram have talked extensively about the vaccines and not only their efficacy but also side effects and that goes back to April of 2021 when we covered the vaccine pause of the Johnson Johnson vaccine as it related to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis there was about six cases out of six million cases at that time and we also covered in September of 2021 in our video called COVID19 vaccines 10 key questions answered with Rhonda Patrick where we delved into the connection between mRNA vaccines and myocarditis as a pulmonary and critical care physician in full practice and on the faculty at two medical schools the side effects of medications are not foreign to me I use these medications all the time in the Intensive Care Unit and one of the medications that we see used often but also with side effects are blood thinners and so it was a privilege for me to be involved in research prior to the pandemic in 2017 where we looked at clinical outcomes of prolonged anticoagulation with rivaroxaban which is a blood thinner after unprovoked venous thromboembolism people who have blood clots and we don't know why they have blood clots get put on anticoagulation for a set period of time and then they are taken off of anticoagulation and so the question is how long should they be on it and whether or not they should be on it indefinitely so this was a real world study where we actually looked at patients who had discontinued anticoagulation which you see here in red and those that had continued anticoagulation clearly you can see that those that discontinue initial month period had a higher risk of venous thromboembolism than those who actually had stayed on it and so that's an important thing to see the efficacy of a medication but the flip side of it is to see the safety if we're getting benefit but also seeing worsening and side effects that's not good so we asked the same question of the same cohort except in a little different way we asked how many of these actually had major bleeding which of course we see all the time in the Intensive Care Unit when patients are put on blood thinners and as you can see here there really wasn't much difference so this was a boon this is basically a situation where there's very little risk of continuing the medication and if you continue the medication you reduce their chances of getting blood clots no-brainer in this one we came to the conclusion that continued riverox event in this case beyond the initial three or six month treatment period significantly lowered the risk of recurrent thromboembolism without a significant increase in major bleeding compared to the treatment that discontinued at three or six months and so the key here is that for any medical intervention that you're ever going to do you have to understand that there's always risk it would be very surprising to me to hear that perhaps there's never been any kind of side effects in any way shape or form to the vaccines I think that's just Preposterous any medical intervention that we do even drinking water to an excess can cause difficulties so when those side effects happen they have to be characterized and I think that's a legitimate thing and here we're going to talk about a case that was published back in October of 2022 titled a case report multifocal necrotizing Encephalitis and myocarditis after bnt-162b2 which is basically the Pfizer mRNA vaccine against COVID19. this was published recently in just October of last year it talks about a 76 year old gentleman who had gotten three doses of a COVID19 vaccine now the first one was actually the AstraZeneca the Oxford AstraZeneca which is not an mRNA vaccine but rather a DNA this one actually goes into the nucleus it is a Dental viral vaccine chimpanzee specifically according to this article when they interviewed the family they said that the patient on day one of that injection actually started to have cardiovascular side effects dose 2 which was in July of 2021 so a good two months later was actually the Pfizer vaccination and after some time it doesn't say how long after that but sometime after that there was behavioral and psychological changes and worsening of their Parkinson's disease so this patient had already been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease is not only a neurological degradation it's also a manifestation of mitochondrial dysfunction and it also has cardiovascular effects so there is a confounder there in the fact that Parkinson's disease is well known to cause cardiovascular issues and neurological issues of course and autonomic issues that's the shrine Drager aspect of the parkinsonian disease and then finally in December of 2021 so a full five months later the patient had the second dose of the Pfizer biotech vaccine two weeks after that had collapsed while eating apparently the patient was continuing to do worse ever since shortly after July and then again in one week where the patient actually collapsed it was felt that the patient had had an aspiration to money that's where the patient cannot control how they swallow which is actually very common in Parkinson's disease the food goes down the wrong way and causes a pneumonia and actually that was what was seen on autopsies we'll talk a little bit a family was quizzed about this there was no symptomatic COVID19 disease although the paper does not mention whether or not the patient was actually ever tested for SARS cov2 infection they don't mention it so I don't believe they probably were by the way you can find this article here in this link you can also search it by title let's get into this in a little bit more detail on the lungs microscopically there was cloudy secretions they're purulent spots brittle parenchyma bilateral muco purulent tracheal bronchitis dissol is basically code words in the anatomic pathology and Pulmonary discourse for basically pneumonia copious purulent secretions that is what I would see on a bronchoscopy if I was to Bronk this patient or put a scope down into the lungs and this is basically the manifestation of a significant and very bad pneumonia which in people who are immunocompromised don't really cause a lot of symptoms unfortunately people who are older and immunocompromise when they get pneumonia they don't complain of shortness of breath they don't complain of chest pain instead they become lethargic sleepy tired and pass away I see this often so yes bilateral broth and ammonia was known in the lower lungs there was multiple stages development of lobe filling with secretions and fragile parenchyma this is basically what you would see in chronic aspiration that's exactly what you would see in Parkinson's disease as well as the patient has difficulty controlling their ability to swallow things will silently aspirate down into the lungs no surprise there but some surprises here as we go along there was actually quite a lot of findings in the heart macroscopic examination revealed manifestations of acute and chronic cardiovascular insufficiency that just means basically coronary artery disease there was a pulmonary edema so when the heart doesn't work the fluid backs up into the brain congestion chronic hepatic congestion this is one of the organs right behind the heart renal tissue edema pituitary tissue edema evidence of shock kidney disorder and so forth and so forth there was hyper contraction of cardiomyocytes there was a number of histiocytic infiltrates this just means inflammation prominent endothelial swelling this is not what you want to see and also something called coagulation necrosis as well as fibrin clots so a lot of damage going on and what they did was they started to stain the tissues to look for two things specifically one is the spike protein and the nucleocapsulin protein now why that's important is because of the following when you have the virus the virus is made up of Spike proteins which sit on the surface and has been the target of vaccines for antibodies and then there are the nucleocapsid proteins which are inside which are not the target of vaccines and so this is what a virus would look like a true virus and the vaccine of course is just going to make Spike proteins or ask your cells to make those Spike proteins nucleocapsids if they are seen are basically indicative that the virus is there and that's the important part with understanding about nucleocapsids when they stain for Spike and when they stain for nucleocapsid this is a respiratory secretion in a patient who has been infected with SARS cov2 this is not the patient that we're talking about who died and is in the autopsy and is part of the paper this is in the paper but they're showing you a control that you can stain for this you can use an antibody which has the dye Amino bin benzodine marker on it and that's what you're seeing here with this brown so what you're seeing here is antibodies against the spike protein so we're seeing spike in respiratory secretions in a patient who is positive for SARS cov2 in those same respiratory secretions we're staining for nucleocapsid proteins these are in the respiratory epithelial cells in the respiratory secretions that's primarily where the infection is taking place so that's important to understand this is the control that they're doing in this situation now let's go back to the patient that died and was getting the autopsy so when they looked at the patient's brain they did the same sort of staining here they're looking for the presence of Spike protein in the brain of the deceased patient who they never tested for SARS cov2 but what did they find as you remember he was vaccinated three times and the purpose of those three vaccinations is to make Spike protein and what are they seeing here they're seeing Spike protein here in the brain so this is lighting up on this immunohistochemical staining for SARS cov2 Spike subunit one when they do the same thing for the nucleocapsid protein it's crickets they don't see anything there's no staining whatsoever in the brain why is there no nucleocapsid protein that is up for discussion but there isn't any as we can see here on this page let's go to another specimen from the same patient also brain again we're looking for the presence of Spike and as you can see here there is Spike protein Spike protein this blue arrow by the way is not Spike protein it is actually an individual glial cell so just ignore that that is not Spike protein Amino histochemical stating again brain deceased they're looking for nucleocapsid protein and again we don't see anything there's no nucleocaps in protein staining all right let's keep going now let's look at the hearts in the same deceased patient we're looking for Spike protein and we see again Spike protein staining on immunohistochemical staining we look for nucleocapsid protein and once again we do not see any nucleocapsulin protein in that individual so what did this lead the author of this paper that was published in October to say well first of all on the autopsy the final diagnosis was this is the official death diagnosis after the autopsy bilateral bronchopneumonia undeniable because the patient was probably silently aspirating Parkinson's disease necrotic Encephalitis based on what they saw and myocarditis as well let's see what the author says they say immunohistochemistry for SARS cov2 antigens which is the spike protein and the nucleocapsid revealed that the lesions with necrotizing Encephalitis that means dying part of the brain inflammation as well as acute inflammatory changes in the small blood vessels in the brain and heart were associated with abundant deposits of Spike protein subunitive one since the nucleocapsid protein of SARS cov2 was consistently absent it must be assumed that the presence of Spike protein in affected tissues was not due to an infection of SARS cov2 but rather to the transfection of tissues by the gene-based COVID19 vaccines the reason why they can safely say that this was not an infection from SARS cov2 is because there was no nucleocapsid proteins seen on the autopsy they go on importantly Spike protein could be only demonstrated in the areas with acute inflammatory reactions brain heart and small blood vessels and in particular the endothelial cells microglia and astrocytes this is strongly suggested that the spike protein may have played at least a contributing role to the development of the lesions and the course of the disease in the patient they go on based on the alteration pattern in the brain and heart it appear that the small blood vessels were especially affected in particularly the endothelium endothelial dysfunction is known to be highly involved in organ dysfunction during viral infections he does mention that this can happen in viral infections as it induces a pro-coagulant state microvascular leak and organ ischemia this is also the case for SARS cov2 infection so in other words this is looking like a SARS cov2 infection however he's not calling the SARS cov2 infection because there's no nucleocapsid proteins in the extra respiratory tissues they say here where a systemic exposure to the virus and a spike protein elicits a strong immunological reaction in which the endothelial cells play a crucial role leading to vascular dysfunction immunoth thrombosis and inflammation and those of you who know us at medcram we've talked extensively about this and how oxidative stress in the endothelial cells can lead to damage releasing on von Willebrand's fractor which causes these small micro clots in the circulation of the lungs and causing hypoxia that's probably what leads to happy hypoxics he goes on although there was no history of COVID19 for this patient immunochemistry for SARS cov2 antigens was performed Spike protein could indeed be demonstrated in the years of acute inflammation in the brain particularly within the capital endothelium and the small blood vessels of the heart remarkably however the nucleocapsid was uniformly absent during an infection with the virus both proteins should be expressed and detected together he says it doesn't give a reference for that interestingly but it makes logical Sense on the other hand the gene-based COVID19 vaccines encode only the spike protein and therefore the presence of Spike protein only but no nucleocapsid protein in the heart and brain on the current case can be attributed to vaccination rather to infection this agrees with the patient's history which includes three vaccine injections the first one was a DNA the last two were RNA and the third one just three weeks before his death but no positive laboratory clinical diagnosis of the infection doesn't sound like the patient actually had a COVID19 test which could be asymptomatic so the conclusion illusion was numerous cases of encephalitis and encephalomyelitis have been reported in connection with the gene-based COVID19 vaccines with many being considered causally related to vaccination however this is the first report to demonstrate the presence of the spike protein actually in these encephalitic lesions and to attribute it to vaccination rather than infection these findings corroborate the causative role of gene-based COVID19 vaccines and this diagnostic approach is relevant to potentially vaccine-induced damage to other organs as well he's making the point here that the absence of the nucleocapsid is the cinquequinone to speak the Latin that this is definitely vaccination contrast this with this paper this is a paper that was published in the annals of diagnostic pathology its original contribution notice here that this was available online even though it was published in October around the same time as the other paper the results of this paper were available since May of last year let's find out what this paper says they say here cardiac manifestations are common in severe coven 19. so these these are looking at COVID19 deaths these are deaths that are attributed to COVID19 and they're looking actually at 11 of these and 11 controls and what they're able to do is something called insight to hybridization which is a way of measuring RNA samples and they're also using exactly the same technique that they used in the first paper which is immunohistochemistry for viral proteins and what did they do they looked for ace2 expression which we're not going to get into because that's not really the purpose of this they did see that ace2 expression was 10 times greater than the heart tissues of cases and controls with obesity or type 2 diabetes I think that's really interesting but what they found is these are COVID19 cases that died and what they found starting right here is interesting however in each case abundant SARS Kobe 2 Spike protein was evidence but SARS cov2 RNA and nucleocapsid protein were rarely detected in situ in any COVID19 heart let me repeat that again here these are known to have COVID19 from source cov2 even in these cases in non-respiratory tissue whereas they found plenty of Spike protein they did not find nucleocapsid protein as well what they conclude though is that the viral Spike protein is endocytized by macrophages in the lung and are carried to the heart and the brain and other organs and that's the reason why you're seeing the spike protein and not the nucleocapsid so let's take a look at some of the data here here's what's called a western blot from proteins extracted either from the nasopharynx which is NP that's part of the respiratory where you'll see a lot of nucleocapsidin Spike with no evidence of SARS cov2 or a positive result so here's the nasopharynx it's negative and you can see here we don't see any proteins here's the nasopharynx with someone with a very high copy count of SARS cov2 and what you see here is you see this band and you see this band this blue band at the top is the spike protein and this Brown Band down here is the nucleocapsid protein notice that when you look at the nasal pharynx and you have low copy count you can see still the spike protein but this nasal frenchial sample of nucleocapsid protein is almost non-existent which means that even in respiratory tissue where there's a high copy count you might not pick up nucleocapsid protein even if you are infected with SARS cov2 all right let's move on to the nucleocapsid proteins specifically so here we have nucleocapsid protein and this is the band that you want to look at because that is the nucleocapsid protein these are covered lungs covered lung one covered lung two notice in normal lung we do not see that nucleocaps at protein by the way these are just reference lines let's take a look at these covid organs we have covid liver organ one there is no band if we look in the brain in this COVID19 patient no band covid cns-1 no band how about the spleen in covid no band of course the normal CNS there's no band either they said their nucleocaps of protein is only evident in the lung samples and nasopharynx that's respiratory that's where it divides and it's not found in any of the other organs tested what about Spike maybe it's just not there maybe the spike isn't there either maybe it just didn't go it was a mild infection no because most of the COVID19 heart samples showed a band that analyzed for viral spikes so where's the spike protein this is Spike this is Spike so in the lung we see spike in the heart we see a light spike in this heart we see a light spike in this heart we see a light spike in this COVID19 heart too we see a light Spike pre-covet heart no Spike spike can go to extra respiratory organs but we have not seen an example here where the nucleocaps that goes to extra respiratory organs in SARS Kobe 2. they say here quote interestingly only the COVID19 lung and nasopharyngeal samples showed a signal for the nucleocapsid protein specifically 0 out of 11 cardiac cases were positive for the nucleocapsid protein whereas 7 out of 11 were positive for the viral Spike and the envelope proteins they did not show that data in this but that's what they showed now let's take a look at the immunohistochemical staining which is what they did in that first study and let's see what we see here we see lung do we see nucleocapsid absolutely we see nucleocapsid in the same way that we would normally see it but do we see heart Spike yes these little pink things are heart Spike well if we're seeing heart Spike we should also see heart nucleocapsid right because this is a viral infection but we see crickets here we see nothing there is no nucleocapsid in viral infections so what do they say they say the source of the endogenous Spike protein in severe COVID19 would likely be the extremely high copy viral load seen in the lungs of these patients they're saying here that in the lungs of patients this is where the virus is replicating so much that you're going to be able to see both Spike and nucleocapsid the virus in the lung induces a micro angiopathy that causes viral degeneration and is a logical source of viral Spike proteins entering the circulation this is exactly what we've been talking about and docking in organs with a high perivascular bed and ace2 population that would be Hearts preliminary data suggests that the viral Spike protein alone with the Matrix and envelope proteins are carried by macrophages in the circulation this could explain in many studies which have shown that the viral Spike protein per se or more accurately the S1 subunit the spike protein which has the RBD sequence for ace2 can demonstrate cytotoxic effects so you may never see the nucleocapsid going to distant organs that are non-respiratory because it's the spike that gets picked up by the macrophages and not the nucleocapsid so remember when we go back to that first study remember there was a control and here we saw a spike in the respiratory secretions and here we saw nucleocapsid in the respiratory secretions but we never saw this for non-respiratory secretions remember that the author of the first study says since the nucleocapsid protein of stars cov2 was consistently absent it must be assumed that the presence of Spike protein in affected tissues was not due to infection I'm not sure if that is a logical assumption anymore based on the data that we have now and that was actually available at the time of publication even back as far as May of 2022 it seems very likely in fact that you're not going to pick up the presence of nucleocapsid proteins in non-respiratory organs of the body in patients who are infected with SARS cov2 let's go back to our case study again I would be very surprised if there wasn't a single case out there or multiple cases even where there has been significant injury or even death from an intervention right I see this all the time in my Intensive Care Unit I have patients that come in with head bleeds because they're on anticoagulation and clearly as a result of the anticoagulation that they're on but the Hope was is that that anticoagulation would prevent a stroke and indeed we know that every year thousands and thousands of Strokes are prevented because people are put on blood thinners but we also get maybe a few tens 20s 30s of people who have head bleeds and we look at that risk benefit and so I think it's important to continue to look for these things but we also have to look at the data and make the analysis here to see whether or not in fact this is going on and this is what I've done looking at data and actually telling you things that could falsify my interpretation conclusions in this situation the patient had a mRNA vaccine dose 3 and it was two weeks later that the patient collapsed and then one week later the patient died so three weeks after this basically this mRNA Pfizer vaccine was given so the question is if this is actually happening we should see a signal after people have been vaccined so I go again to the graph of vaccination versus excess deaths here up on the top we see daily SARS cov2 infections during the beginning of the pandemic we have the first wave this is a scale going to 1 million you can see here the first wave was about 300 thousand and this Delta wave here again was probably maybe 250 000. this was up here almost a million we didn't catch all of these people some of them weren't tested but we tested as many as we could and we can kind of get relative looks at these things down here we have excess mortality so this is anybody who died and the thing I like about excess mortality not none COVID19 mortality it doesn't matter what's put on the death certificate whatever's on the death certificate is on the death certificate all you need is a death certificate and a date and it goes in here so it doesn't matter if the patient is misdiagnosed as having COVID or not having COVID19 or they died of encephalitis and they didn't think it was from COVID it's all going in here it's all being captured notice here that the same pattern of SARS cov2 matches the same pattern here of this excess wave happening exactly at the time that it should happen maybe two to three weeks after it we have the same thing here with the Delta wave and we see again here because that Delta wave was just so virulent we see it exactly popping up two weeks later because it takes about two weeks for people to die once they get infected from Stars Kobe 2. the Omicron wave once again so we see here that the Peaks completely line up superimposed on top of that and reversed for ease of looking at here is the number of vaccinations whereas we had about 300 thousand Stars Kobe 2 cases here in a single day we vaccinated three and a half million people over 10 times the number of people got a spike protein from the vaccine then the people that got a spike protein from the first wave of SARS Kobe 2. and so if this is what we're seeing as a result of excess deaths from the first wave we should see something approximately three weeks later down approximately right here as a result of vaccination with an mRNA vaccine I'm not saying that it doesn't happen as I said I would be very surprised if there was absolutely no risk associated with a intervention there's risk associated with every intervention but what I am saying is that whatever the magnitude of that risk is has to fit underneath this curve at that point if we're talking about an immediate effect from SARS cov2 vaccinations If This Were happening I would have expected depending on the magnitude I would have expected something to look like this you know be a little bit delayed or I would expect it's something to look like this or if it was less in magnitude or even less in magnitude something that would look like that when this is the number of I have it upside down here right so that's the peak this here is the peak of all vaccinations in the United States we vaccinated in one day on this day three and a half million people doesn't mean that there's not long-term effects but I'm not seeing an acute Association here at least on this curve going back to the publication that I was involved with we have to realize that there is always going to be side effects and we can see that here that as time goes on regardless of if you're on the anticoagulation or not on the anticoagulation there are going to be people who have major bleeding events but the key to understanding whether or not and how you can prevent those is not to compare somebody who would never have an event with someone who did have an event you have to compare someone who did have an event with someone who didn't get the intervention and that's where it's important to be able to look at things epidemiologically and with studies and with data the other thing that this shows is that sometimes things may seem logical but this is the reason we press for evidence-based medicine even though something may seem logical or it may seem like it makes sense like in this case it would seem logical that if you see the spike protein without the nucleocapsid that it would make sense that since the vaccine only makes the spike protein without the nucleocapsid this would implement Kate the vaccine however there could be other factors that are preventing that nucleocapsid protein from getting out of the respiratory tissue and into non-respiratory tissue organs the second paper highlights that even though this thing made sense it may not be the case and without my condolences to all of these people that had perished from one reason or another that were used in these studies and with the families as well I know all too well the impacts here we talk about statistics and numbers but each one of these people have families

45,6mH0_S-_FqE,Study finds long lasting antibodies after COVID vaccine,"our health watch today. We have a new study from Mount Sinai shining light on COVID19 vaccine immunity. The research found that antibody response from those vaccines are long lasting instead of short term. Joining us now to discuss is Komotra Vastava, director of strategy and operations at Mount Sinai Center for Vaccine Research and Pandemic Preparation. Welcome. Thank you so much. I'm honored to be here. Can you talk about what inspired this research and what makes this study different from others done on this topic? Absolutely. So our research team here specializes in how to understand viral infections, vaccines, and their impact on the human immune system. One of the ways we do this is by measuring antibodies, the protein in your blood that helps your immune system fight viruses. If I could take us all back to four years ago when New York was an epicenter for the COVID19 pandemic and there was limited resources for testing, for understanding how the virus worked, our two lead scientists, Dr. Viviana Simon and Florian Kramer developed and invented an antibody test that not only confirms whether someone is making antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID19, but also gives a measurable score as to how these antibodies are tracking how many are being made. We started the Paris study to learn exactly how long these antibodies last, not just in the short term but over the course of years. So we enrolled health care workers from the beginning of 2020 up to the current day and we track antibodies on a monthly basis with additional visits if somebody reports a new vaccine or infection. The paper that we publish covers the study's work over the first three years spanning 8,000 visits from 500 participants. When the study says that vaccines effects are long lasting, what does that mean for people? How long are you talking? Well because our study has been going on for years we were able to measure the antibody response from the primary vaccines all the way till people got their boosters averaging from eight months to over a year out from their first vaccine dose to the third and we saw the antibodies never decayed to the point where they were no longer measurable. The vaccines were really effective in producing a high jump in antibody production in the onset and then over six to eight months they fall to a very steady but strong state. The boosters and the new vaccines are really important in terms of making sure that antibody production stays high but it's not true that people lose their antibodies within two months of getting their shot. They stay on for months and months. What surprised you the most about these findings? Well we were shocked at the supreme efficacy of the vaccines themselves and we were also shocked by how quickly the virus changes. So thanks to the fact that the study started before the vaccines rolled out at the end of 2020, we were able to measure vaccine impact on antibodies before and after the primary series and up until boosters and we saw that people who had COVID before the vaccines first came out had a stronger antibody response and that the booster vaccines did a lot in making sure that people no matter of their infection history had the same strong antibody response. The other surprising factor was when we saw COVID changing and the different variants coming out before Omicron in our highly vaccinated group there were little to no breakthrough infections. We had no breakthrough infections in people that already had COVID but after Omicron and the virus changing dramatically we saw breakthrough infections skyrocket in our study in people with and without prior history of COVID which made it really important for us to underscore how the current vaccines are very effective for the current variants and it's important to stay up to date with that. And how do you anticipate the study will help with COVID fatigue? Anecdotally a lot of people say that COVID is like the cold or like the flu but we know that that's not the case. There are many people who have gotten COVID in the past and are still experiencing symptoms weeks, months, even years after the fact. Many of our participants also have this experience so we're hard at work at investigating it and we hope that our study findings are going to provide reassurance and insight as we give a behind the scenes look at how your immune systems work in healthy adults before and after different vaccines and breakthrough infections. I can't emphasize enough that people who are experiencing this and would like to participate in research we welcome support from the public and finding this it's only thanks to people like you reporting their experiences, sharing their stories, and sharing their information that we're able to know what we do. homeless Shravastava, director of strategy and operation of the Mount Sinai Center for Vaccine Research and Pandemic Brabareness we thank you.

SAFETY  PROJECT REACHED THIS  CONCLUSION AFTER COLLECTING  DATA FROM NEARLY.   100 MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS 8  DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. TODAY I  SPOKE WITH THE LOCAL MEDICAL  EXPERT AND SAYS THE COVID  VACCINE STILL OUTWEIGHS THE  RISKS. WE ALSO TALK TO  EVERYDAY PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR  ATTITUDE TOWARD GETTING THE  SHOT.   I'MGOINTHUGH LOT OF  MENTAL AND PHYSICAL. THINGS.  NOW I'VE IT WASN'T LIKE THAT  BEFORE.   ELIZABETH FOSTER SAYS SHE  QUESTIONS IF THE COVID19  VACCINE SHE TOOK IN 2020 HAS  ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE  DECLINE. SHE SAYS SHE'S  EXPERIENCING IN OUR HEALTH  FOSTER, STILL DIGESTING THE  NEW DATA RELEASED BY THE  GLOBAL COVID VACCINE SAFETY  PROJECT WHICH STUDY NEARLY  100 MILLION VACCINATED  INDIVIDUALS ACROSS 8  COUNTRIES. THE REPORT  SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT THE  ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE PFIZER,  MODERNA AND ASTRAZENECA  VACCINES FINDING THE  FOLLOWIN E STUDY LINKS  VACCINES TO SLIGHT INCREASES  IN NEUROLOGICAL BLOOD AND  HEART-RELATED CONDITIONS LIKE  MYOCARDITIS PERICARDITIS AND  GAIN BARRE SYNDROME. FOR  INSTANCE, OUT OF THE MORE THAN  99 MILLION PEOPLE STUDY,  RESEARCHERS OBSERVED ONLY 190  CASES OF GUILLAN BARRE  SYNDROME AND PEOPLE WHO TOOK  THE VACCINE. RESEARCHERS  STRESS THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN  THE VACCINES AND ADVERSE SIDE  EFFECTS DOES NOT PROVE THE  VACCINE WAS THE ROOT CAUSE FOR  THE ILLNESS.   AND I THINK WHAT THE STUDY  CONFIRMED IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT  THEIR SMALLEST ASA SAID THE  PAST. AND THAT'S THE  FOLLOWING. NUMBERNE.  VACCES VE RKS. I THINK  ONLY A FOOL WOULD SAY VACCINES  DON'T HAVE RISKS. DOCTOR  JONATHAN KANTOR WHO IS AN  ADJUNCT SCHOLAR AT THE PENN  CENTER FOR CLINICAL  EPIDEMIOLOGY AND BIOSTATISTICS  REVIEW. THE STUDY AND STILL  CONTENDS THE BENEFITS OF THE  VACCINE OUTWEIGH THE RISKS.  KANTER SAYS THE NEW RESEARCH  SHOULDN'T ERODE ANYONE'S TRUST  IN THE VACCINE, BUT INSTEAD  PROMPT THEM TO THINK ABOUT  THEIR OWN PERSONAL MEDICAL  CONDITION AND THEIR OWN NEED  FOR PROTECTION. WHAT DO YOU  SAY TO THOSE I SAID, HEY, WE  KNEW THE VACCINE WAS DANGEROUS  ALL ALONG.   NOW, HERE'S THE PROOF IS NO  SUCH THING AS A DRUG THAT HAS  AN EFFECT WITHOUT A SIDE  EFFECT. SO EVERYTHING S  POTENTIAL RISK. THE PROBLEM IS  WHAT IS THE RISK OF THE THING  THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO  PREVENT?   AND THAT'S WHAT COMES INTO  PLAY. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU  HAVE A FOR PARENTS, RIGHT, IF  YOU'VE GOT A HEALTHY 3  YEAR-OLD WHO'S HAD COVID 4  TIMES ALREADY. WELL, THEN I'D  SAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE  BENEFIT IS THAT YOU'RE GOING  TO GET GETTING THAT VACCINE  TODAY.

WELL FOR  THAT FIRST TONIGHT SAY, WELL,  ABOUWHETR VID CCINE TO THINK  MAKES SENSE FOR THEM.   SINCE THE COVID19 PANDEMIC  BEGAN IN MARCH OF 2020, NEARLY  7 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE DIED  ACROSS THE GLOBE FROM  COVID19. THAT INCLUDES MORE  THAN 1 MILLION PEOPLE IN  AMERICA.

48,l84zftrMoyc,"More VAX, More Infection?! Newly Peer Reviewed Study SHOCKS Covid Logic: Rising Reacts",  a newly peer-reviewed study from the Cleveland Clinic found that the risk of COVID19 varied by the number of COVID19 vaccine doses previously received and the higher the number of vaccines previously received the higher the risk of Contracting COVID19 popular YouTuber and comedian who has been a prominent skeptic over vaccines and mandates throughout the pandemic Jimmy Dore tweeted FYI it's not a vaccine it's a failed experiment we are the guinea pigs all right take these findings with a grain of salt but this is interesting because the first this first came out earlier this year I think around February and there was a lot of pushback at that time part of the pushback was that it was not a peer-reviewed study it was just what's known as a preprint now we're talking about this again because it has been peer reviewed and the parts of the study that raised a red flag to some vaccine Skeptics are still there in the study yeah yeah go ahead yeah so the the the authors of the study note that this is unexpected like I don't think these are people who were these are not like anti-vaccine people who are setting out to disprove the efficacy of vaccines and so so they're saying there was an association of increased risk of COVID19 with higher number of Prior vaccine doses importantly and it was not because so you could rationalize why that might be the case well maybe people who are getting the most um Jabs the most doses of vaccine are people who are older and higher at risk anyway so then yes they're more likely to get COVID19 because they're higher risk so it would just be incidental that they're more likely to get a lot of vaccines and they're more likely to get covered but that's not one doesn't have anything to do with the other however that is not the case here as they lay out of the Cleveland Clinic they're like okay we see why you might think that but the um the yeah that most of the people in this study were young people some young people can be at a high risk of COVID if you have a pre-existing condition but you would not expect that to be most of the people and so they're saying that that really makes this finding um unexpected um yeah the risk yeah the people despite this their risk of acquiring COVID19 the people who had fewer injections was lower than those who'd received a larger number of Prior vaccine doses so it's worth noting that the overall conclusions of the study is that the vaccines do work to buy valence specific valent vaccine work to lower the incidence of covid right they work that this is not a the study is not saying that in that ultimate conclusion should be taken into account the question is whether at a certain point requiring or suggesting that people get multiple vaccines at a certain point that they're whether there is diminishing returns so there's we should distinguish between getting a vaccine or incrementally boosted versus a certain volume that seems to have an unexpected effect the paper also notes that this is not the only study to find a possible association with more prior vaccine Doses and higher risk of COVID19. during an Omicron wave in Iceland individuals who had previously received two or more doses were found to have a higher odds of reinfection than those who had received fewer than two doses of vaccine and an unadjusted analysis and it goes through some um kind of technical scientific reasons why this might be happening something called immune imprinting and some stuff with the spike protein that I think is beyond the technical uh know how of us here but it is being interpreted as validating some concerns and some anecdotal evidence that people have had that folks in their lives who got more vaccinations and more boosts seem to have succumbed to the virus more frequently than those people who only maybe got the first round or what have you again I could see for a very at-risk population or the elderly you might say well even if this is increasing the chance you get COVID19 honestly the odds of getting you know when a wave comes through you have good odds of getting it anyway you want if you're an elderly person or immuno compromised person the protection from the dose is more important than some slightly increased odds that you would get it in the first place the odds being that you were going to get it anyway however to you know to repeatedly boost younger people who are healthy otherwise over and over again they might be saying well you know if I get it I get it but I'd rather not I'd rather not increase my risk of getting it because if I get it I'm probably gonna not have such a bad time with it and maybe I was you know you were maybe you were vaccinated originally and we're just talking about subsequent doses or maybe you had it before they're actually in this paper it does say that um the multivariate analysis also found the more recent the last prior COVID episode the lower risk of covid saying again that's the you know some kind of enduring natural immunity um and I just keep thinking how you know the the places in our society that are still trying to take this decision away from individuals like University campuses where the bivalent some of them is going to be required still in the fall uh that that can like how how naive and and and and unscientific it is to take that decision out of out of people and their doctors and then also the kind of the attempts to suppress um criticism of vaccines you know calling it all misinformation that has occurred online and and Elsewhere for the last three years so short-sighted so a couple of things first it should be noted that this was an unexpected observation in this study and they in the study say that the it needs to be steady further uh so that is you know it's we We I Wouldn't draw too many hard and fast conclusions though I take Jimmy Dora's point that it does feel like if there is in fact a negative result like making people more vulnerable to getting covered and they're just saying well we should have studied this more I can understand people feeling like they are guinea pigs in this situation right that there there should have been more of this kind of research that happened earlier but there was a real hesitancy to do so when we were in the throes of the pandemic but it's also worth noting that the objective or the biggest gain of getting vaccinated we've now known for a long time is preventing hospitalization so this study is talking about whether or not people are more susceptible to access coming to the virus but there's a whole separate conversation about whether or not it's preventing you from having the worst outcomes here so for young people who already tend not to have the worst outcomes I think that's a really interesting question that you're raising about college campuses and the like for even older people there could be a calculation that says sure you might be this percent more likely to catch covid than you might not if you had gotten multiple boosters but if you hadn't gotten boosted you might end up in the hospital or be more likely to die so it's better just to basically like take on more softer waves than to wait for the one big one to take this is yet more or this is another point of data in the column of the group of people for which it is least justifiable if you think it's justifiable at all to require them to get vaccinated is actually the population where the the requirements were most likely school-aged populations sure yeah and I that's just that's so people are going to feel I think so gaslit about all this stuff saying again the the initial promise may be implicitly I guess but a lot of people in the media reported it was that everybody has to get vaccinated we're really encouraging it where we're not requiring it outright we're encouraging it because this is how we're going to stop the spread and we're going to you know get rid of covid because when we have her immunity because you're no longer going to be able to transmit it or get it when you're vaccinated that didn't pan out and like on and on and on and on and on yeah that I I you know not under selling the vaccines I understand that they are the findings are still that they're very protective against severe decent disease and death for at-risk populations but the the logic of the requirements was really for the public health rationale was really on stopping cases yeah I totally get get that and I agree that that was the rationale but it hasn't been out for some time yeah and so I just think from a public health perspective as people are considering these kind of studies it's important to really emphasize that the goal the stated goal for some time now has been to prevent hospitalization and death and that vaccines including this study show that there is a significant benefit when the vaccine is correlated to the stream that's happening it does effectively lower hospitalization uh in depth here right but again you could have a more targeted even based on this study you could say are you in this risk category yeah look at this study you would benefit from vaccination on net you would benefit because even if you're increasing your likelihood of getting covid the protection is is important for severe indices and death you are in this this categorization you're a healthy young person and really all you're doing by getting you know your fifth or something dose is making it a slightly more likely you're going to get covered or whatever it is and that doesn't make as much sense for you and and we and we have not had that Approach at all and people are going to feel anything just valuably outraged and I think that people like Jimmy Dore who are saying well where was all this research why hasn't there been more research about what's going on with covid I think are completely right and I think there also needs to be a sensitivity to and frustration about the lack of research with respect to Long COVID as well whatever you think about it the or whether or not it's credible or whether you're skeptical about how how real it is as a phenomenon the reality is that we are out of ignorance about what's going on allowing the government to basically ratchet back any protections any long-term health care support for people with long COVID any way to protect protect themselves against it and also insulating the manufacturers of vaccines from any liability there's a whole mixed bag of shielding that's happening for people who are going to have outcomes one way or the other and I do think that before we are overly interested in saying well I don't think that long COVID is a thing because it's being used as a pretext for the government to have overreach also downplaying the possibility of long COVID having this effect that's being used as an excuse for the government to not have any responsibility for policies that may have set up a significant portion of the American public to be dealing with a crisis a Health crisis where we don't have Universal Health Care long after the government has washed its hands of all of it well I mean as you know I remain um extremely skeptical of a lot of long-covered claims however if and I I don't know what should be studied I mean it should be studied and I don't really know what people who are very worried about law and covid I'm not sure what the state of their claims are with respect to like is it worse if you've gotten a more COVID19 more times or is it is it correlated with the severity of the infection severity of so if you've gotten it if you get covered a bunch of times but none of them were severe you're not going to get it's no it's also correlated with a number so that's what I'm getting at so so a vaccine that makes you if you're again in a population where you're not at severe risk of it's going to make you more likely to get it maybe from a long COVID19 perspective that is I mean that kind of cuts both ways but that's why I agree with everyone who's looking for profound scripture more more more research and more studies and I do think there is a real issue with there being so much delay here in getting some of this kind of information out well we'll have more Rising right after this foreign

50,EETuOY3JjfM,COVID-19 Coronavirus Vaccine: How Does It Affect Your Body?," Have you been able to get  your COVID19 jab yet? Many countries are rolling out the COVID19 vaccines so that the pandemic will be over  and we can get back to normal. If you’ve never had COVID19,  your body doesn’t know  how to fight it off. Vaccines help train  your immune system to recognize the virus  and be ready to attack. But as we all have  different immune systems,  we respond differently to the vaccine and the virus. Having side effects has nothing to do  with the effectiveness of the vaccine.   So let's see what's going on  once you get the jab. Congratulations! You’ve just had your first dose of the COVID19 vaccine.  For this episode, we'll be focusing on messenger RNA, or mRNA vaccines. Once it enters your body, the mRNA vaccine instructs your cells  to create a spike protein. This simulates part of the SARS-CoV-2 viral structure  and tricks your body  into believing that it's been infected. The spike proteins will then head to the surface of your cell. Your immune cells will detect these proteins that don't belong  and begin making antibodies. If you happen to catch the virus  in the future, these antibodies will attach  to the spike proteins on both  your infected cells and the coronavirus. This will mark them  for immediate termination by your immune cells. To be clear,  the mRNA does not change your DNA  in any way.  Hear what I say? Once the spike proteins are made,  your body destroys the mRNA.  Five minutes after your vaccine shot,  you'll feel some soreness in your arm. To be safe, the Centers for Disease Control recommends you stay at the vaccination site  for at least 15 minutes in case of a severe reaction. While it's rare, you could have anaphylaxis, which is an immediate allergic response. It causes a series of symptoms such as hives or swelling. Thankfully,  trained healthcare personnel will be available at every vaccination site to treat you immediately with epinephrine. And according to the CDC, you have a greater chance of being struck by lighting, around one in 500,000, than having an allergic reaction. Four hours after your vaccine, you could feel nothing at all. Lucky you. But you could also get a slight headache or a low-grade fever and feel tired. This is perfectly normal and is a sign that your immune system has kicked into action. At this point, you may experience mild symptoms as your body acclimatizes to the vaccine. You might feel tired and feverish. Be sure to get some rest and take the day off work if you need to. After about 48 hours, you should start to feel normal again. So let’s keep going. Okay, if you got the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, you’d need to get your second booster shot three to four weeks after the first dose. Your immune system would be stronger than the first time.  But let’s see how it goes next.  After your second dose, you might feel crummy again.  You could feel tired feverish and you might get the chills.   These reactions are more common after the second dose of the vaccine.  But they’re mainly mild to moderate and usually go away in a day or two. And two weeks after your second shot, you’d be fully vaccinated against the COVID19 virus. So far, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been 95 percent effective at preventing COVID19 illness.  In either case, the vaccine can prevent hospitalization and death in people who have gotten sick. So getting a vaccine is your safest path to protect yourself, your family  and your community against this virus.  It could also help reach herd immunity by having vaccinated people act as a barrier between non-vaccinated people and those who have been infected.

52,Jb2YMvfvm_M,More vaccinated deaths than unvaccinated deaths from covid (US), welcome to today's talk Friday the 25th of November now for the first time in the United States we've got data that says there's been more COVID deaths in people that are vaccinated versus people that are unvaccinated and we want to look at that in a little bit of detail in a minute and put some context in that and also we want to look at the bivalent vaccine boosters that are being given in the states and we're going to be looking at information from V safe which shows that 54.8 percent of vaccine recipients of the bivalent boosters had a systemic side effects most of which weren't serious in the time frame they were looking at now that's about the only way I can summarize this it is a bit complicated and of course YouTube rules and my own personal standards insist that we will be looking at a data from official sources and other reputable sources of data so we're not going against any uh any guidelines from the United States government now um here we have this this is this is this was a report it was commissioned by The Washington Post Kaiser Family Foundation vice president Cynthia Cox who does a lot of this kind of work now um this is quite interesting 58 of coronavirus deaths in August with people who were vaccinated or boosted and that is people who'd had a primary uh course of vaccines at least a primary course of vaccines so what it looks like is happening here is we're getting waning of the protective effects of the vaccines it's now waning and of course this combined with the systemic side effects that we're going to look at from the booster doses needs to be taken into account as we consider the the consider the risk of benefit analysis because we started these vaccination programs a while ago and the risk benefit analysis has changed um we're not saying the vaccines aren't effective we're not saying that there are anything about the vaccines we're just saying the risk benefit analysis has changed let's go on um so therefore 42 of deaths in August were in people who were unvaccinated so the majority For the First Time The More Death covered deaths in the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated population in the United States now it's fair to contextualize this because if we look at CDC data we do find that 80.06 percent of the United States population is vaccinated so there's more people in the vaccinated group than in the unvaccinated group but it's also true as we saw that there were more COVID deaths in the vaccinated group for the first time now historically this is quite interesting September 2021 vaccinated people 23 percent of the coronavirus fatalities in people that were vaccinated January in February 2022 had gone up to 42 percent and as we saw now it's now gone up to 58 percent so we see that the risk of benefit analysis is changing the data is there before our eyes so a direct quote from the Kaiser foundation in the Washington Post we can no longer say this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated so uh Mr Biden's um not saying Mr Biden was wrong at the time but um times have changed we know protective effects Wayne and this needs to be taken into account when we look at risk benefit analysis in my view so this was a the Kaiser Foundation had conducted the analysis now A Center for Disease Control and prevention morbidity and mortality weekly report and this is this paper here from from the CDC so we're banging bang in the middle of official U.S government data safety monitoring a bivalent COVID19 vaccines now um August the 31st 2022. um the FDA authorized the bivalent booster for Pfizer and moderna um MRI encoding the spike protein from the original SARS coronavirus II and from Oregon ba4 and ba5 so it was this bivalent combination vaccine advisory committee on immunization uh practice recommended all persons over 12 receive an age-appropriate dose of the one of these vaccines that was their recommendation at the time and indeed still is now v-safe is a voluntary smartphone-based U.S safety surveillance system established by the CDC to monitor Adverse Events after covid vaccination and here we have it it's a v safe here now I don't actually know too much about that so if people that are using it in the states have been giving me some feedback on that that would actually be really uh really quite useful to get some information on that as of the 3rd of October I believe there were 10 million users of that period of time so it looks like it's being fairly well used are we getting better data now from the states it certainly is starting to look that way we're getting better quality data now vaccine Adverse Events reporting system is the other way of course and um information is also taken from that total data from the 31st of August the 23rd of October 14 odd million uh had received a Pfizer bioentec 8.2 million uh the modernist just over uh I think the modern is just over 18s so pretty large numbers that we're getting here now v-safe is a bit more confusing it looks like in this period of time there was 211 959 registrants age over the age of 12. slightly complicated as well because people under the age of 16 have to have supervision to use this program so quite how that's working out I don't really know in the states but registrants now it looks like these are people that had just started using the app in that period of time but as is often the case with CDC it's not that clear really the way the writers is not that not that transparent very often August 31st to 23rd of October is the period of time so um just that finite window of time 2022 reports in the week after vaccination be put so this is just a one week period now clearly you don't have to be a that clever to realize that this isn't going to pick up any potential long-term side effects we're not saying there are long-term side effects but any potential long-term side effects would by definition not be picked up in the first week so it is limited but anyway injection site reactions 60.8 that's not too surprising and it's not really concerning you get a soil arm of course um systemic reactions though this is more concerning to me 54.8 percent fewer than one percent and I think we'll see later it's about point eight percent uh received Medical Care so vsafe is reporting that some people did need uh medical opinions and medical care after the vaccination I don't think that's controversial it's a simple statement of fact uh vaccine Adverse Events reported system so uh 5542 reported Adverse Events of bivalent uh vaccine pretty small number really actually um are all the cases being reported to bear as of course not of course not uh but 4.5 of those were serious now remember this is of cases actually reported but still a reasonable proportion of the case is actually reported were classified as being serious Adverse Events now this is straight from the CDC Healthcare Providers and patients can be reassured that Adverse Events reported after bivalent boosters are consistent with those reported after monovalent vaccines do you see what they've done here they're comparing the bivalent boosters with the monovalent they're comparing two groups this is a relative risk not an absolute risk not saying the CDC are being disingenuous not at all but we they are reporting a relative risk not an absolute risk the absolute risk um they didn't put that in not given so it's a relative risk the absolute risk is going to be smaller than the relative risk how much smaller don't know they didn't say information not given disappointing from the CDC that they're just talking about relative risk the health impacts after COVID vaccines uh vaccination are less frequent and less severe than those associated with covered illness again they're comparing people that have had illness with people that are vaccinated a relative risk not an absolute risk for the whole population not saying the CDC are being deliberately disingenuous here but it would have been better to have information on absolute risk as well as relative risk unfortunately the the absolute risk is not given but we know it will be smaller than the relative risk now the reference they use for this is interesting because they're making this broad statement here health health impacts which so Health impacts is a broad statement it applies to everything but the reference they give reference to there is quite specific now that's the reference there and uh it just refers to myocarditis pericarditis and combinations of those or multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children within seven days or 21 day risk window after the index date so again this is only a 14-day window that they're taking this information from and even then they're giving it as a relative risk I mean we're not saying the CDC are trying to give the wrong impression here but it just doesn't seem very well written to me um I I I know many relatively Junior academics who could write it much more clearly than this I think but we're not arguing with the numbers that the CDC are giving we're more uh commenting on their on their presentation okay comparison between and after uh vaccines after infection again they're comparing between the infections and uh after the vaccines two groups the relative risk between those absolute risk not given again so we see that the CDC are really giving relative risks comparing one group with another group not giving the absolute risk for the population as a whole CDC please you need to give both we need to know what the absolute risk is as well as the relative Risk please now a bit do a bit more detail here a review of these safe data from the mobile app again during August the 31st to 23rd of October same time period now this is what they say 211 212 thousand nearly registrants these are presumably people that registered new newly in that period of time um they're covered a fairly good age group um a few to 12 to 17s as we see there more in the uh more in the older age groups but a good a good spread of Ages no complaints there at all uh quite a few of these 50 45 were the fourth dose and the fifth dose was 50.2 percent but of course we know that if these risks if the heart disease complications especially that the CDC does admit can occur after vaccines they're more likely after the second dose so again it's not giving a really good overall picture it's really quite specific to these um bivalent boosters that they're talking about uh in the week after rece receiving um a bivalent booster dose local injection site reactions now this is interesting uh 49.7 amongst the over 65s higher in the younger age group and the age group they use for comparison here is the 18 to 49. so younger people men and women getting more local uh reactions systemic reactions it's the same 18 to 49 getting 67.9 local reactions as opposed to 43.5 in the over 65s and when they look at the specific problems they see this same Trend that it's younger people that are getting more so 30 in older people 53 in younger people headache again 19.7 in older people 42.8 in younger people and again we see it the same with the muscle pain and the fever now it reported inability to complete normal daily activities was 10.6 amongst those over 65 and 19.8 percent in those aged 18 to 49 after vaccination so over 19 in that younger age group couldn't carry out their normal activities after the uh the booster vaccine I would have thought these are fairly fairly High numbers uh receipt of Medical Care was reported by 0.8 percent now 0.8 percent who took medical advice after vaccination I would have thought that is rather high but the CDC just report it they don't say anything about it they just say that's what it was I would have thought it's rather High 0.8 percent you can decide whether you think that's high low or indifferent again we're talking about risk benefit analysis so so there we go um I know that's fairly data intense um but it looks like um the risks after the risk of side effects after vaccination are becoming clearer with uh vsafe although I don't yet fully understand how it's working but it's good that these are being honestly reported and just combine that with the risk benefit analysis um that more COVID deaths are now occurring in vaccinated versus on vaccinated despite the fact we have to be clear about it only 20 of the the population are unvaccinated so the vaccinated is a much larger group thankfully though uh COVID cases are getting milder they still do cause some deaths as we'll see seeing some hospitalizations but the trend is that they're getting milder and I think these things should be taken into account where the risk benefit analysis so that's about as far as we can go on this talk I think lots of data there all the references are given I've been as honestly I've been as honest to the data as I can and um check the links and uh I'm pretty sure all of my numbers are accurate you'll have to decide uh how you interpret the information I have given you interesting don't want to say any more well could say more but probably best not say more thank you for watching,0.442072501937034

56,-92HQA0GcI8,Inside the Lab That Invented the COVID-19 Vaccine," This is how coronavirus invades your body. Sinking its crown-like spikes into your cells,   using molecular deception to pick  their locks, and hijacking your body. But there IS one way to prevent this. By using one of the virus’s weapons on itself…  Hey smart people, Joe here. Right now, there’s about 7 billion  people all waiting for the same thing:   A vaccine that will protect us  from the virus causing COVID19. And if you’re like me you want to know  what’s in it…  what makes it work?    Making a vaccine and getting it out to the  public is a long process with a lot of steps,   so we can make sure the  vaccine is safe and effective.  And it’s pretty typical for  that to take ten years or more, In an emergency, like this pandemic,  well… we can’t skip any of those steps,   but we can speed this up by  doing some at the same time But none of that can happen until  you figure out the first step:   What do you put in your vaccine  that will make it protect people. …and it’s what we’re going to talk about today. We’re gonna visit a lab and meet some  scientists who study the coronavirus.   We’re also gonna meet a really big Awesome  Science Machine, and learn how they used   it to design this: the key ingredient  inside the very first COVID19 vaccines. Here’s my goal with this video: To show you  what exactly is in the new COVID vaccines   that makes them work—and how they got  made faster than any vaccine in history.   My hope is that you’ll be better  informed when you get your shot,   and you’ll have a new appreciation for  why science like this is so important. This is how to make a COVID19 vaccine. It turns out that some of the most  important research for making the   COVID19 vaccine is happening  right down the road from me… …at the University of Texas—which is pretty  cool. Because I did my PhD right *here*,   and in *here* is the lab of… Dr. Jason McLellan. He studies how pathogens  like the coronavirus cause disease… There are four human coronaviruses that occur seasonally and generally cause the common cold.   And then there've been three coronaviruses that have caused pandemics.   And that's the first SARS  coronavirus back in 2002,   the MERS coronavirus in 2012. And now  SARS-CoV-2, which emerged earlier this year. So at the end of December, 2019, it was on the  news that there’s these pneumonia clusters in   China. Uh, in the scientific community, we thought  maybe a new flu virus or possibly a coronavirus.  I was actually snowboarding with my family and  my collaborator, Barney Graham at the vaccine   research center at the NIH called. And he  said, he's been in contact with US CDC,   Chinese CDC. Uh, it looks like it's a  betacoronavirus similar to SARS coronavirus, and   they want it to move rapidly, try and make a  vaccine. And I said, we're definitely in… So you're just like scrolling  through your phone. in this ski   lodge, and you're  like we gotta get to work! So while the rest of us were  focused on royal family drama   and just hearing the first mentions of  “coronavirus” for the very first time,   scientists like Jason knew this was serious,  and they were already getting to work. As soon as researchers in China decoded  the virus’ genome and published it online,   Jason’s lab could start designing a vaccine… I texted Daniel Wrapp my graduate student   and let them know be on high alert  because as soon as we get the sequence,   we're going to race on this thing  and move as quickly as we can. Jason was on that winter vacation and texted  me that it was a CoronavirusAnd eventually   in early January, the sequence  was released online publicly. That's when the clock started ticking because we   knew a bunch of people were  going to be working on this. Uh, and then things started moving pretty quickly… Let’s step back for a minute.  What does a vaccine do?   It trains your immune system to  know what a germ, like a virus,   looks like. So it can recognize the germ, fight it  off, and keep you safe, without you getting sick. This is the virus that causes COVID19.  The outer shell is made of a few different   kinds of proteins, butthese proteins  sticking off the side are the most   important part. The spike.These spikes are  what give this family of viruses their name:   The coronaviruses, because  they look kinda like a crown. The coronavirus uses that spike to sneak  into our cells. The 3-dimensional shape of   that spike is super important, because that  exact shape is what lets the virus latch on   to receptors on the outside of our cells … almost  like picking a lock. And then, it sneaks inside. Those shapes sticking out on the outside of  a virus are also what your immune system is   feeling for, to figure out if this is a  foreign invader, if it should attack or not. The problem is, the first time your body sees a  virus, your immune system responds so slowly that   the virus has time to make gazillions of copies  of itself, and you can still get very, very sick. That’s what’s great about a vaccine. It  trains your immune system what to look for,   so when the real virus shows up,   your body can respond super fast—and destroy the  virus before it has a chance to hijack your cells. So what’s actually in a vaccine? Sometimes,  a vaccine has a weakened or dead virus.   That’s how polio and measles and  mumps and some other vaccines work.  But these days, a vaccine usually just  contains a little piece of the virus. The newest COVID19 vaccines?  They’re just the spike. But for that spike to work as a vaccine, to train  your immune system to recognize the actual virus,   it has to have the same 3-dimensional shape  as the spike on the whole, complete virus. But making the spike all by itself,   not attached to the rest of the  virus, turns out to be really hard. Because the spike is actually pretty  floppy just floating around on its own. It doesn’t look much like the  spike on the actual virus. And this is the key thing Jason’s lab figured  out how to make.  For years they’d studied SARS   and MERS viruses, which are really closely  related to the virus that causes COVID.  So they already knew what tiny tweaks  to make to freeze coronavirus spikes   in the perfect shape. Um, so we got to work  designing our stabilizing mutations into the   new spike sequence. There was just two amino acids  that we knew would, uh, if we mutated them that   would stabilize the spike protein and make it a lot easier to work with in the laboratory. A protein, like the coronavirus spike…  ...is a long, folded string of  individual units called amino acids. And these strings of amino acids are built  using code written in RNA, and stored in DNA*. By changing, or “mutuating” the letters of  DNA code, we can change the amino acids in   our protein string. So that's cool. You're like  building scaffolding into the protein, to be like   “freeze in this shape.”    Yeah, that's a good way to put it.  How do you get from there to  making the actual spike protein? I can show you…  Scientists are able to grow special immortal  human cells outside the body which they use as   factories. They put a modified gene for something  like their spike protein, into those cells… …and then they'll start spitting out this protein So they're just pumping it  out into the liquid, right? Yeah, that's right. They take that liquid, run it through  special purification machines,   and are able to isolate a pure  sample of their spike protein. But how do they know for sure  that this special spike protein   looks like the real thing, 3-D shape  and all? They take pictures of it… …using a big Awesome Science Machine.  This is a cryo-electron microscope.  This machine took a 3D picture  of the coronavirus spike,   and helped design the first COVID19 vaccines Check out the big science machine! It looks like a giant microwave Am I ok to walk up here? Yeah, it’s ok. I mean the room is a million  dollars, and the microscope is another million.  So you’re saying don’t touch  this screen right here. You can see the floor is separate  from the instrument, it’s on its   own, free-floating. So vibrations are bad. These are wall panels that contain water   running behind them to keep the  temperature constant in the room. Oh wow, that’s… Then it also has to be  electromagnetically shielded too.  That is nuts. Look at this beefy cable over here. That’s the high-tension, that’s the  200,000 volts comin in over here Oh ok, so don’t lick that one! Oh this is… Sciencey! Look at all that science happening in there.  It’s kind of a marvel of physics and engineering. Joe N : Can you play Doom on this thing?  Um, some of our computers you  can play Far Cry at max settings. So maybe this sounds like a super stupid question,   but why can't you just use a regular light  microscope to take a picture of a protein? Well, the wavelength of visible light is  on the order of hundreds of nanometers. And that means the smallest things  you can see with visible light are   also on the scale of hundreds of nanometers. But what we want to see—the atoms in a  protein molecule—they’re angstroms apart,   tenths of a nanometer, so  we can’t use visible light.  We have to use a special electron microscope. So super high energy electrons make very   tiny wavelengths, which lets you see  very, very small resolution things. Okay. I want a camera like that. That's  better than 4k. We can go angstrom-K.  So, to take a 3D picture of a protein  with a cryo-electron microscope,   first you put a drop of protein  onto a special metal grid.  Then you freeze it in place with liquid ethane.  When we shoot a beam of electrons at it,those   proteins will be in all kinds of random  orientations, some like this, some like that. Each orientation leaves a particular “shadow”. Powerful computers look at all those 2D  images, and combine them into a final 3D shape. It’s kind of like using a bunch of 2D  photos of someone’s head to make a 3D model. And when Jason and Daniel and their team  looked at the spike they made, with their   tiny little tweaks and mutations, their spike has  the same 3D shape as the spike on the whole virus. Now we can put that spike into people, and see if  it trains their immune system, and protects them   from the real virus. And? It works. This protects  people from COVID19. The research you just saw,   from those scientists, is literally what’s  being used in the very first COVID19 vaccines. And some of those vaccines work in a  really cool way. Instead of having to   make the actual spike protein, in big factories,  with huge tanks of cells like the ones we saw…   some of these new vaccines, the genetic  instructions for making the spike is   all that’s in the shot, on a molecule called mRNA. Your body uses those instructions to  make the spike. YOU are the factory.  That’s awesome. This is a really incredible piece  of science. A year ago, no one had ever seen this   virus before, and thanks to these scientists  and thousands of others around the world,   now we have vaccines that work. It’s gonna take months, maybe years to get these  vaccines, and the dozens of others still being   worked on, to the billions of people that need  them, and that is a huge challenge on its own. But this is a really hopeful story. No  vaccine in history has ever been invented   this fast, and we were able to do it safely.  And we were able to do this so quickly  because scientists like Jason and his lab   and others, they were ready. Because they  were studying basic scientific questions about   other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, they’ve  spent years trying to figure out their secrets,   so when this one showed up, they were  already ten steps ahead. And to me,   that’s why work like this—supporting basic  research—is so important, and why we need it. Stay curious…",0.5101237980475269
57,RaLxhFiOBYk,Covid-19: Researcher blows the whistle on data integrity issues in Pfizer’s vaccine trial,"My name is Brooke Jackson. I was fired in September of 2020 for being a whistleblower. I was working on Pfizer's phase three pivotal trial on their COVID19 vaccine. My first day on the job was the 8th of September and from the very beginning I noticed irregularities, things that were questionable. I would bring up the concerns to my managers and it was always we're understaffed, we're really trying hard to, you know, make this work. You know at one point when I was going through emails, there were emails from ICON begging Ventavia to follow up on severe adverse events that had been reported. There were several emails about mislabeled specimens, blood specimens, and the nasal swabs. There were specimens that were labeled with another participants information. It was a nightmare. And on the 16th of September, I stayed late in clinic one evening and I was the only one in the clinic. I walked into an area where the vaccines were refrigerated or frozen rather. And when I walked in, I saw a biohazard bag. The plastic biohazard bag contained used needles and I realized how unorganized and sloppy Ventavia was handling everything. In that same room where they kept the vaccine, the vaccine was just left out and the boxes that the vaccine came in, the containers, they had written the subject information on these containers. So right there, you know, me working on the study, it unblinded me to the the randomization of these patients. I made note of that. I took pictures. I took pictures to just to document what I'd seen to show my managers. It was also discovered that Ventavia was unblinding participants in the study based on a directive from our COO, which was to print out the randomization scheme and put that drug assignment in everybody's chart. Per Pfizer's protocol, we should have immediately stopped enrolling, but they never they never told Pfizer. Instead, they wanted us to go through each of the charts and actually take out the randomization scheme that was printed. So that coupled with everything else, I made the recommendation for Ventavia to stop enrolling clinical trial participants in the study until we were able to let Pfizer know. You sent me the photos, thank you, and I didn't pull them up. I mean, now granted, that's whether I'm trying to or not. Should I not have taken the pictures? At that point, it was clear to me that I wasn't fitting in. I decided that that next morning I was gonna gonna report my company to the FDA. And so I did that about nine o'clock in the morning on the 25th of September. And about six hours later, I got a call from Ventavia and was fired on the spot and told that I was not a good fit. I remember investigator Cannon called me and we spoke for an hour and 16 minutes. To be precise, I can tell you everything that we talked about. It mirrored what was typed in my formal complaint to them. The unblinding, the safety of the clinical trial participants, not monitoring them for adverse reactions. They were late to report adverse events. Again, the untrained staff, the oversight by the principal investigators, specifically at the Fort Worth location, the targeting of the employees for coming forward. I thought that the FDA was gonna swoop in and take care of everything. What I was reporting was so important.",0.4469600340136054
58,sv0dQfRRrEQ,How American conservatives turned against the vaccine," We’re entering the third year of the pandemic and in the US the loss of life, month by month,  for two years, looks like this. Altogether more than 900,000 people have died. But there really are two pandemics here. Because starting in the spring of 2021 the distribution of the vaccines dramatically changed the nature of the pandemic. If we look closer at the delta wave  and the beginning of omicron we see the deaths of unvaccinated people were much higher than vaccinated people. This data comes from a subset of US states and cities that provide immunization data. While the delta wave did kill  some vaccinated people the risk was 15 times higher  if you were unvaccinated. Philly Baird was one of those  unvaccinated people. And he started going live on his  Facebook page from the hospital. ""I love you guys."" ""I’m able to talk today."" ""Today’s been a great day."" In one of the videos he recommends to his friends and family that they get the vaccine. Do you think that was a  hard thing for him to say? Yes, because that’s not what he had been communicating, you know, prior to that. But I think that he would want me to communicate what I know he wanted and that is for you to look at his situation and realize that you could possibly get you could get severe the Covid like he did  and be fighting for your life. And then have a lot of regrets that you didn’t have the vaccine at that time. ""You know I was one of those  that sat there and kinda was more on the political side with Covid and all."" ""We gotta put all that aside."" Now when it comes to the political breakdown on vaccinations, there are two things to know. One is that a majority of Republicans are vaccinated with at least 1 dose according to the most recent survey  from the Kaiser Family Foundation. The 2nd thing to know is that most  unvaccinated Americans are Republican. So the question is: how does that affect the balance of lives lost? Well, we can plot the states directly by their 2020 election results with the red states on the right and the blue states on the left. And we can look at their death rates since April 2021. And it's pretty striking. The Republican states were suffering  much bigger losses. And I want to stress that this relationship wasn’t there before the vaccines. This is the same chart, but it shows death rates before April 2021. And they’re much more spread out, with Covid hitting blue states as hard as red ones. So what I want to understand is the series of events that took us from this... to this. ""The Democrats are in a full-court freak out over coronavirus after Ted cruz self-isolated  after coming into contact..."" Phil Valentine was my younger brother. A very accomplished radio entertainment personality. ""New York Times even called it the Trump virus."" ""Can you imagine if the Ebola virus had been called the Obama virus?"" He was on air in July and you can hear him kind of talking through the symptoms. ""This is my Covid saga."" ""And yesterday was probably my worst day and just the shaking and the chills..."" Really processing things on air. ""And as I’ve told you, I’m not judging anybody either way."" ""If you want to get the vaccine,  it’s a personal health decision."" ""I made the decision that I probably wouldn’t die from it."" ""Phil would like his listeners to know that he regrets not being more vehemently pro-vaccine."" ""He is in the hospital in the critical-care unit..."" He said, you know, I got it wrong. And then it went from bad to worse. We know how it all ended. ""We’re all very sad right now at the passing of a friend and a colleague."" ""And our thoughts and prayers go out to Susan and the boys at their tremendous loss."" Had he been opposed to other types of vaccines in the past? Were his or his kids vaccinated  with the school vaccines? He wasn't against anything else? No. It’s not obvious that Republicans would be more vaccine hesitant. Similar percentages of Democrats and Republicans said they get the flu shot “every year” according to a May 2020 poll. And in 2019, the Pew Research Center  found that nearly identical shares of  Republicans and Democrats said that the benefits of the vaccinating kids for measles, mumps, and rubella  outweigh the risks. Republicans were slightly less likely to say they should be required but it’s nothing like the  30 point gap that we see in Covid vaccination rates today. One way to understand that gap is to consider the vastly different information environments that Republicans and Democrats live in. This is a list of news sources trusted by at least 40 percent of Democrats according to a 2019 survey by Pew. ""... health officials warn..."" ""... the highest daily rate..."" ""... the Covid variant was first reported..."" ""... the latest data from the centers..."" And here’s a list of news sources trusted by at least 40 percent of Republicans. What this means is that American conservatives are quite exposed to the editorial choices of a single network. And on vaccine coverage, that network's choices have been confusing. ""It’s a great vaccine. It’s a safe vaccine."" ""It is something that can keep you out of the hospital."" ""How many people have been killed or injured by the Covid vaccines? Does anyone know the answer?"" ""If your doctor says you’re ok for it,  get it. It will save your life."" ""I got my second dose. I got a horrific pain in my right eye."" ""The vaccine is still working. It’s still protecting you and those around you."" ""Why should you penalize people for not taking a vaccine which doesn’t work?"" ""The mRNA covid vaccines need to be withdrawn from the market now. No one should get them. No one should get boosted. No one should get double boosted."" If we compare the information sources of those who said they’d definitely get vaccinated with the information sources of those who said they would definitely not get vaccinated we see that the vaccine-resisters were less likely to consume most news sources except for two: Fox News and social media. For 18 hours, I laid in bed  dealing with my mortality and not knowing which way  that was going to go. And I'm laying in bed going, this is my fault. I should have been listening to doctors and nurses and medical professionals  instead of my political algorithms. And so is it mostly Facebook where you were getting sort of these messages? Yes. I saw some of Fox News reports online. But, 90  95 percent of what I got was through my algorithms and friends on Facebook. And I can tell you when I started  telling people, you need to consider this vaccine and  you need to stop politicizing this. I lost a lot of friends, and the more hardcore you were... I had some really ugly things said to me. And I had to start blocking people that I've been friends with for years. The Kaiser Family Foundation found that 64 percent of unvaccinated people believed at least 4 pieces of Covid-19 misinformation, of the 8 that they tested. And they found that among those who trusted conservative news outlets belief in misinformation was more common than among those who trusted other sources. But we have to remember that this is a correlation. We don’t know if anti-vax content  on TV and Facebook  caused people to turn against the vaccine or if it was simply pandering to people who had already made up their mind. It was probably both. See, one thing I didn’t mention  about this chart  is that this data is actually  from January 2021. So most of the anti-vaccine content on these platforms hadn’t been published. So I went back and searched for  the earliest polling I could find. This is from May of 2020 and it asked people if they would get  a hypothetical coronavirus vaccine. 40 percent of Republicans said  “definitely not or probably not.” And that’s pretty much where Republicans are at today, 20 months later. So what explains why a big chunk of Republican voters had already turned against the vaccine six months before the presidential election and nearly a year before the vaccines  were even available? I think the answer is somewhere in here. Of the 8 false claims polled by the Kaiser Family Foundation the one most widely believed wasn’t about the vaccines at all. And so of the different pieces of misinformation we tested, the most commonly believed overall and particularly by Republicans was this idea that the government was inflating the number of deaths due to Covid-19. ""Top US health officials are rejecting President Trump’s suggestion that the US coronavirus case and death totals are 'fake news'."" ""He said a couple of hours ago the number of cases and deaths of the China virus..."" ""... are quote 'far exaggerated'."" That claim was based on a misunderstanding of how death certificates work but it was extremely potent. If you’ve been told not to trust the death count, how do you assess your own risk? And why would you take action to protect yourself and your family? If we compare unvaccinated republicans with their vaccinated counterparts the biggest difference between them isn’t that the unvaccinated ones are younger or more conservative or more rural although they are it’s the pervasiveness of the belief  that seriousness of the coronavirus  is generally exaggerated. And that idea that the pandemic has been made into a bigger deal than it really is has been an overarching belief for a majority of Republicans. Even as Covid became one of the leading causes of death in the US even as the virus shifted  from cities to rural America. And that takes us back to the very first weeks of the pandemic. When the virus found a United States under an exceptionally polarizing president and at the start of an election year. ""We have it under control.  It’s going to be just fine."" ""Joe Biden calling him the worst possible person to lead our country through virus."" ""Well we pretty much shut it down  coming in from China."" ""President Trump has no plan, no urgency, no understanding of the facts."" ""If the coronavirus ends up having a real impact on the economy  it could tip the election to the—"" ""Democrats and their media cronies have decided to weaponize fear to improve their chances against Trump in November."" In the early stages of the pandemic, you got this very large polarization around things like lockdowns, mask wearing, and the severity of the pandemic itself. Just how seriously to take this. ""Trump supported anti-lockdown protests..."" ""Liberate Minnesota, Michigan, and Virginia."" ""...states led be Democratic governors."" ""President Trump without a mask..."" ""Defiance in the face of adversity..."" ""Joe Biden wearing one."" ""...an image of trepidation, even fear."" ""Making for a splitscreen campaign moment."" And it seems that rank and file Republicans, largely on their own, figured out that if you don’t take the pandemic seriously,  why would you get vaccinated? You know the people telling you to do it, they’re not trustworthy. And so, you know, flash forward to spring of 2021 and you get this weird paradox where most Republican politicians are vaccinated but they're saying stuff at the same time to cater to to anti-vaccine sentiment in their base and now there's real political downside to promoting vaccination for a lot of these folks. ""...your freedoms, I do. You have to do what you have to do."" ""But! I recommend take the vaccines."" ""I did it. It's good."" ""Take the vaccines."" ""But you got — no that's okay, that's alright."" ""You've got your freedoms..."" Let me tell you how I make sense  of what happened to your brother  and I want to get your reaction. I see Phil looking at the data concluding that his risk of dying  from Covid was low. But I think his brain was sort of pushed in the direction of that conclusion by signals that were sent really early on in the pandemic by Trump and Fox and others that Republicans kind of think this coronavirus is overblown. The polarization starts there. Then by the time the vaccines come out Phil's not getting clear, consistent signals from the people that he trusts that it's time to update his risk calculation and go ahead and get that vaccine. And then he gets hit by the beginning  of the delta wave. Does that seem accurate to you? That's on the right track, I think that that... The calculus changed when the delta variant presented itself because it attacked a much younger segment of the population. Then all of a sudden, politics starts  to enter into the thing. We already we've just come off of being lied to for three years straight that Trump was a Russian agent,  a traitor to the country. So I think that that was that people looked askance at that whole messaging system. The underlying problem is that there are two diametrically opposed views of what America should be like in this world and one is held by one side and  one is held by the other so you decide which one  you’re going to be on. You get into this situation where elite politicians in the respective parties feel like they have to polarize on the issue because their base expects them to disagree with the other party. It would have helped a great deal of the elites of the political leaders of our country had coordinated across party lines and laid out a unified message at the beginning I definitely think we could have largely mitigated the polarized responses  that we saw in the mass public. What do you hope for, what do you fear,  when it comes to polarization around public health issues? One of the things I really worry about  going forward is what we’d like is reduced polarization around Covid vaccination especially as we move into a possible regular regime of boosting going forward. But what I think might be more likely if we aren't really, really effective and proactive on reducing that polarization is that polarization around Covid vaccination persists and spreads to other vaccines like measles, mumps, rubella. And sure enough, researchers at UC San Diego tracked vaccine attitudes  from March to August 2021 and they found that not only were the Republicans in their study more likely to turn against the Covid vaccine as the year went on they also ended up with declining attitudes about vaccines in general  and lower intentions to get  the flu shot next year. Which means the health consequences of pandemic polarization could extend well beyond Covid-19.",0.4587097940272545
59,7DlcRSvuvnw,How do mRNA COVID-19 vaccines work?,"The US authorization of two COVID19 vaccines marked a turning point in the pandemic and vaccine science. These vaccines use messenger RNA, or mRNA, to deliver immunity. mRNA are short strands of instructions used to build proteins. It's impossible for these mRNA vaccines to alter our DNA in any way. Although that technology has been in development for decades, mRNA vaccines hadn't made it to market. Until now. There are a few ways to make a vaccine. Most use a version of the pathogen they are trying to protect you against, like the flu or measles, to trigger an immune response. You can think of vaccines like a biological, wanted poster. They show our bodies how to recognize the enemy, an antigen such as a harmful virus or bacteria, so we know how to react if it ever shows up. Our bodies will be prepared to send T cells to attack infected cells, and B cells to produce antibodies, which neutralize the virus and prevent it from invading healthy cells. mRNA vaccines use innovative technology to deliver protection. If traditional vaccines deliver wanted posters, these vaccines carry USB drives with instructions that tell our cellular machinery how to print its own poster. In other words, they instruct the body to make its own antigens. In the case of the coronavirus, the antigen is the infamous spike protein that attaches to and infects your cells. These vaccines use mRNA, a molecule that our cells need to create any type of protein to introduce us to that spike. To start, researchers isolated the part of the coronavirus's genetic sequence that codes for the spike protein. Then, they put an mRNA molecule containing the code into a super tiny drug delivery system known as a lipid nanoparticle, which can enter our cells. Inside the cell, ribosomes use the code to create a protein chain that resembles the enemy, the coronavirus's spike protein. Those cells can then temporarily display a lookalike of that protein, which prompts our immune cells to respond as if it were an antigen from a traditional vaccine.",0.6588541666666666

62,v-NEr3KCug8,How the COVID-19 vaccines were created so quickly - Kaitlyn Sadtler and Elizabeth Wayne," In the 20th century, most vaccines took well over a decade to research, test, and produce. But the vaccines for COVID19 cleared  the threshold for emergency use in less than 11 months. The secret behind this speed  is a medical technology that’s been developing for decades: the mRNA vaccine. This new treatment uses our body’s  existing cellular machinery to trigger an immune response, protecting us from viruses without ever experiencing an infection. And in the future, this approach might be able to treat new diseases almost as quickly as they emerge. So how do these  revolutionary vaccines work? The key ingredient is in the name. mRNA, or messenger ribonucleic acid, is a naturally occurring molecule that encodes the instructions  for producing proteins. When our cells process mRNA,  a part of the cell called the ribosome translates and follows these instructions to build the encoded protein. The mRNA in these vaccines works in exactly the same way, but scientists use the molecule to safely introduce our body to a virus. First, researchers encode trillions  of mRNA molecules with the instructions for a specific viral protein. This part of the virus is harmless by itself, but helpful for training  our body’s immune response. Then, they inject those molecules  into a nanoparticle roughly 1,000 times smaller  than the average cell. This nanoparticle is made of lipids, the same type of fatty material that forms the membrane around our cells. But these lipids have been  specially engineered to protect the mRNA on its journey  through the body and assist its entry into the cell. Lastly, the final ingredients are added: sugars and salt to help keep the nanoparticles intact  until they reach their destination. Before use, the vaccine is kept at a  temperature of -20 to -80 degrees Celsius to ensure none of the components break down. Once injected, the nanoparticles disperse and encounter cells. The lipid coating on each nanoparticle fuses with the lipid membrane of a cell and releases the mRNA to do its work. At this point, we should note  that while the vaccine is delivering viral genetic material into our cells, it’s impossible for this material  to alter our DNA. mRNA is a short-lived molecule that would need additional enzymes and  chemical signals to even access our DNA, let alone change it. And none of these DNA altering components are present in mRNA vaccines. Once inside the cell, the ribosome translates the mRNA’s instructions and begins assembling the viral protein. In COVID19 vaccines, that protein  is one of the spikes typically found on the virus’s surface. Without the rest of the virus  this lone spike is not infectious, but it does trigger our immune response. Activating the immune system can be taxing on the body, resulting in brief fatigue, fever,  and muscle soreness in some people. But this doesn’t mean  the recipient is sick— it means the vaccine is working. The body is producing antibodies to fight that viral protein, that will then stick around to defend  against future COVID19 infections. And since this particular protein is likely to be found in most COVID variants, these antibodies should reduce  the threat of catching new strains. This approach offers significant advantages over previous vaccines. Traditional vaccines contain  weakened versions of live viruses or amputated sections of a virus, both of which required time intensive research to prepare and unique chemical treatments to safely inject. But mRNA vaccines don’t actually contain any viral particles, so they don’t have to be built  from scratch to safely adjust each virus. In fact, every mRNA vaccine could have roughly the same list of ingredients. Imagine a reliable, robustly tested vaccine that can treat any disease by swapping out a single component. To treat a new illness, researchers would  identify the right viral protein, encode it into mRNA, and then swap that mRNA  into the existing vaccine platform. This could make it possible to develop new vaccines in weeks, giving humanity a flexible new tool  in the never-ending fight against disease.",0.445001639774367
63,IxCHv7T_mao,Would I Take a COVID Vaccine?, good morning john so this video could be very short uh yes yes i would take a COVID19 vaccine i would i would spend 15 hours in a target for a COVID vaccine i would eat a blenderized happy meal i would wax my chin i would give up coffee i would walk around with clif barts on my feet instead of shoes for a month i would let ruby rod be my roommate for a covid vaccine the news that pfizer moderna astrazeneca and others have had really promising results in their phase 3 trials it's good it's it's like i don't think people get how good this news is or maybe we're just like so overwhelmed with everything else in the world but it is it's like the best news of 2020. it was entirely possible that this first slate of vaccines and these are the first ones wouldn't work it was also possible that no vaccine would work it was also possible people wouldn't get any lasting immunity from even getting the disease which is true for many other coronaviruses it looks like we're finally getting lucky with something that getting the disease does confer some lasting immunity and vaccines that expose our immune systems to like little broken off bits of the virus that can't infect you also confer immunity now there are things that we still don't know we don't know whether or how much getting the vaccine prevents you from spreading the disease it probably does pretty substantially considering people are testing negative but like we don't know for sure we also don't know how long these vaccines last and we won't have a good idea about that for a pretty long time but i'm very excited by this it's such good news and i will immediately line up whenever i am allowed to to get this vaccine but i know that there's also a lot of hesitancy around vaccines so i want to talk about like the three main reasons why i want to do this first if you are concerned about the politician or politicians who developed this vaccine like you don't trust donald trump or you don't trust your abiding politicians and political leaders don't develop vaccines and the rules and systems we use to test for the safety of vaccines did not change at all in the last year scientists and doctors very specifically for this reason chose to change nothing they looked and they said maybe there are some things we could do to speed it up but we're not going to do them because we don't want people to feel like we're cutting corners there are things that we worked hard to speed up but the things that take time we let them take the time which is why it's taken so long so i want to get a COVID vaccine because i know it's going to be safe and certainly much safer than getting covered second thing when we prevent ourselves from getting COVID19 we aren't just protecting ourselves because every time somebody gets this disease they become a vector for other people to get this disease so by wearing masks by distancing how and when we can but by taking a vaccine when it's available we are keeping hospital beds free not just for people with COVID but also for anybody who is experiencing a medical problem or emergency and that given my track record may very well be me if we only imagine the direct impacts on ourselves right now it will result in more death and suffering and so why would i get a COVID vaccine so that i can live my life again without having to worry whether i am going to be the cause of someone else's suffering and finally we all need to do what we can to help frontline healthcare workers right now they are having a year unlike any ever before and these are people who signed up for jobs to help people all of the times when i have gone to the hospital either with a broken bone or for my ulcerative colitis these people have done tremendous kindnesses for me and how we act during this pandemic is in a very real way how we give back to them for the services that they have rendered to us in the past and also will render to us in the future and are giving to all of our neighbors and fellow humans right now so i want to take a COVID vaccine for them i'm not gonna get to do it for a little while i'm not first on the list and i shouldn't be but as soon as they tell me i can you best believe i'm gonna be in that line it's understandable to be wary of new things and of big important things like a vaccine for a deadly pandemic and i have health care workers and elderly people and scientists in my life who can help give me the perspective that i have i understand not everybody has that i think i'm lucky to have the perspective to feel like this isn't something that's being done to me it's something that i want to do for myself and for other people john i'll see you on tuesday,0.4995123045123045

65,iyo2UNQcdpQ,"Vaccination v excess deaths, correlation study", what a warm welcome to this talk it's Wednesday the 22nd of March now today I'm going to be looking at a paper and this is the paper here I want to look at is there a link between the 2021 COVID19 vaccine uptake in Europe and 2022 all cause mortality not covered mortality all cause mortality and this study did find such a correlation now let's look at it now this is the question that's the paper now this is studied in this is paper this papers published in Western Norway University of applied sciences now in Norway they have certain freedoms that we don't have in Western countries we don't have in the UK or the United States for example in Norway you can actually camp anywhere so there's certain freedoms in Norway that we don't have in other other countries anyway getting back to the topic in hand um conflict of interest statements the authors declare no conflict of interest so I think we can take it from this that the authors are not being paid uh huge amounts of money by vested interest which of course is always good to check so no vested interest there the authors say we primarily study a possible link between 2021 COVID19 vaccination uptake in Europe and all cause mortality in 2022 so the correlating vaccines in 2021 for covered 19. and monthly mortality in 2022 now let's be perfectly clear this is a preprint this is not a peer-reviewed paper but I wanted to cover this paper because I think the possibility of this getting published in a mainstream peer-reviewed Journal is essentially zero leave that there I don't think it's going to get published in the peer-reviewed journal if it does I'll be very surprised and more certainly report on it but I think it's important to report on it now because this is the whole point of uh preprints they are papers for discussion and we're discussing it now um so I.E mortality higher than before the pandemic so this is taking the mortality in 2022 comparing that to pre-pandemic levels now the analyze 31 countries January to September 2022. they did point out the importance of analyzing the last three months in 2022 when they get the full data available for that is it just where that went up to 31 EU member states throwing in Norway Iceland Lichtenstein and Switzerland all cause mortality this is direct quote from the paper increased more the higher the 2021 vaccine uptake in other words countries with more COVID19 vaccines in 2021 had higher excess mortality in the first nine months of 2022. this is what we call a positive correlation between vaccination in 2021 and excess deaths in 2022 and they quantify it there was a one percent Point increase in 2021 vaccination rate so for every one point and one percent that went up basically the mortality went up by a tenth of a percent so the mortality in 2022 was 0. 105 basically tenth of a percent so uh I consider that number to be uh huge one percent increase in vaccination in 2021.1 percent increase in overall mortality in 2022. it's a huge number absolutely huge number when controlling for alternative explanations the association remained robust so they remained robust and significant now 2021 or cause mortality was lower the higher the vaccination uptake so interestingly in 2021 um we uh the more vaccines people had the less people died in 2021 but in 2022 it was the opposite but and it's a big but in 2021 when they controlled for other uh variables that became a non-significant effect so there was an inverse correlation between COVID vaccines and all-cause mortality in 2021 but it was not significant after they accounted for um quite a few variations that they cleverly accounted for in this paper this is from data's from eurostat we've looked at this many times official European statistics check it out for yourself EU experienced success mortality in the first nine months of 2022 we've looked at that before no question that that is the case tragically tragically we're talking about um mortality here as if it's some abstract concept of course it's not it's multiple individual human tragedies and bereavements this is why we do this this is this this is of massive importance COVID19 vaccinations prevented SARS cov2 related Hospital admissions and deaths so there's evidence that in 2021 May 2021 and 13th of May so these are both may 2021 and given that these papers were both published in May 2021 they're dealing with um data from January February March mostly 2021 very early on in the pandemic the Alpha and the Delta stages of the pandemic so evidence that the vaccine was effective from 2021 and 2021 that's from the landsat that's from British medical journal so vaccines were preventing SARS coronavirus to related Hospital admissions and deaths specifically of course to SARS coronavirus 2 not talking about or cause mortality COVID19 vaccination are side effects such as myocarditis and pericarditis says who don't take my word for things well as always we give evidence evidence for myocarditis and pericarditis post vaccine this one's from uh Journal of the American Medical Association Cardiology a note we're now into 2022 so this is a year later so uh that this is six seven months later 25th of January 2022. so we can clearly see that times have changed a recent study falsified suspected association between the two diagnoses that's myocarditis and pericarditis and COVID19 virus infection so journal of clinical medicine that's that publication there they found post-covered 19 infection was not associated with either myocarditis or pericarditis so that makes us a bit curious about where the increase in myocarditis and pericarditis came from if it's not caused from the natural infection vaccine uptake is the percentage of the no this is how they've got the data vaccine update they took us the as the percentage of the total population that's received a primary course by week 52 of 2021 in other words this only goes up to the end of 2021. now here are the countries they studied and these are the percentages of the primary courses now of course all of this is in the article I just put this here to show you what a huge epidemiological study this actually is so percentage of primary courses by the end of 2021 and that's what they took their correlations from so low in Bulgaria going all the way up to uh Iceland and Ireland 76. 6 percent countries that you might be interested in you can see there of course the UK no longer a member of the European Union but we will be at that very much the higher end of this um and of course of course the accounting for population size needless to say their conclusion here of direct quote from the paper the interaction between vaccine uptake and time passed in months since the beginning of 2022 is strongly significant strongly significant and implies that the mortality increase and the higher the vaccine uptake so implies that the mortality increases the higher the vaccine uptake so the more people had vaccines in 2021 so that was uh vaccines in 2021 and this was a increasing deaths in 2022 there is a positive correlation between the two the higher the vaccination rate the higher the deaths the lower the vaccination rate in 2021 the lower the excess deaths um now of course these are correlations so they they rightly went on and looked at other things that could be causing this um potential reverse causality we looked at could it be the excess mortality that was causing the vaccinations well they eliminated that because of course the excess mortality came after the correlations and we know from um you know the the the need the need for uh temporal correlations that the cause has to come before the effect um but anyway They carried on concerning alternative explanations we control for average or cause mortality in 2020 and 2021 by dividing the average between 2016 and 2019. so the mortality data they were taking was from before the pandemic so that got rid of that variable relatively low mortality at one period is followed by relatively High mortality and later on and vice versa so in other words what they're saying here is well if lots of people died in 2020 you'd expect or 2021 you'd expectually expect fewer people to die in 2022 and the exact opposite was the case but they did mathematically account for that so we know that it's it's not that is not the cause of the excess mortality uh but even when they took account of this direct quote from the paper we still observe a significant association between 2021 vaccination uptake and 2022 monthly increasing all cause mortality countries with higher vaccines in 2021 had a higher or cause mortality in 2022. now they did acknowledge What's called the ukological fallacy uh now the the this would say that because something is true a nation is not necessarily true of uh of individuals which of course is is true and they acknowledge that they acknowledge that uh we are cautious about making uh individual level inferences from our nation level findings so very honest of the researchers there now excess mortality um caused by delayed medical treatment or diagnosis um which of course is the main reason given in the UK Parliament for the excess deaths that is caused by delays in medical treatment during the pandemic and indeed the relative chaos in the NHS at the moment which is true but um we cannot see that the issue the issues have been more prevalent in high vaccine versus low vaccine countries in other words delay in healthcare is is all over the place all countries have delays in healthcare but the correlation is still there when they looked at the um when they looked at the countries vaccine when they looked at the vaccination rates that one when they looked at that one the correlation is still there is still there so um they don't think it's caused by that and they actually specify this I.E we do not expect delayed diagnosis on medical treatment during the COVID19 pandemic to substantially over I've included omitted variable bias so they don't think it's that so there we have it it's very clear that there's a positive correlation um it's in that paper there the higher the uh the higher the vaccination rates were in 2021 the higher the excess mortality in 2022. so that's the end of this video I've nothing more to say on that now on a completely separate matter I've been um thinking of might go to the states and take up some uh start playing basketball no nothing drag I'd probably just start with Semi-Pro and then build up but I've been looking at the terminology and apparently um you have something called a slam dunk in basketball and this is a literally a goal scored in the basket by by putting the ball straight down into the loop with one's hand so that's a slam dunk the same points as a traditional basket but it's a show of force dominance and skill so a slam dunk is something that is a completely convincing as I say nothing to do with this today's talk um but I'll need to use the correct terminology for when I'm playing basketball in the states so do look out for me I'm quite optimistic about it but for now thank you for watching,0.4403316147586979
66,iMx7kmld9sk,Idaho lawmakers introduce legislation to criminalize those who administer COVID vaccines,"A bill has been introduced in the Idaho legislature that would charge people who administer mRNA vaccines with a misdemeanor. Republican Senator Tammy Nichols and Republican Representative Judy Boyle introduced that bill in the House Health and Welfare Committee yesterday. Johns Hopkins Medicine says mRNA that's molecule that assists in making proteins and some, if not most of the COVID19 vaccines are known as mRNA vaccines, and they help your body make proteins that mimic the COVID virus to help fight the infection. This bill obviously still needs a vote in the committee before it moves onto the House floor.",0.5
67,oMXGGmBfkf8,"RNA Vaccines (mRNA Vaccine) - Basis of Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, Animation"," Vaccines prepare the immune system, getting it ready to fight disease-causing organisms, called pathogens. A vaccine is introduced to the body to mimic infection, triggering the body to produce antibodies against the pathogen, but without causing the illness. Conventional vaccines usually contain a weakened or inactivated pathogen; or a piece of a protein produced by the pathogen, called an antigen. RNA vaccines are a new generation of vaccines. Instead of the antigen itself, RNA vaccines contain a messenger RNA – mRNA  that encodes for the antigen. Once inside the body’s cells, the mRNA is translated into protein, the antigen, by the same process the cells use to make their own proteins. The antigen is then displayed on the cell surface where it is recognized by the immune system. From here, the sequence of events is similar to that of a conventional vaccine. Some RNA vaccines also contain additional mRNA coding for an enzyme, which, after being translated in host cells, can generate multiple copies of the antigen-encoding mRNA. This essentially amplifies the production of antigen from a small amount of vaccine, making the vaccine more effective. These are called self-amplifying RNA vaccines. RNA vaccines are easier and safer to produce than conventional vaccines. This is because mRNA molecules can be synthesized in a cell-free system using a DNA template with a sequence of the pathogen; while conventional vaccines usually require a more complicated and risk-prone process of growing large amounts of infectious pathogens in chicken eggs or other mammalian cells. Without the risks of being contaminated by infectious elements or allergens from egg cultures, RNA vaccines are also safer for patients. Because protein synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm, RNA molecules do not need to enter the nucleus, so the possibility of them integrating into the host cell genome is low. RNA strands are usually degraded by cellular enzymes once the protein is made. The relative simplicity of the production process makes it easier to standardize and scale, enabling rapid responses to emerging pandemics. Other advantages include lower production costs, and the ease of tweaking RNA sequences to adapt to rapidly-mutating pathogens. On the minus side, it can be challenging to deliver mRNA effectively to the cells, since RNA sequences and secondary structures may be recognized and destroyed by the innate immune system as soon as they are administered intravenously. These limitations can be overcome by optimizing codons, using modified nucleosides to avoid recognition, and packaging RNA into protective nanoparticles. Another disadvantage is that most RNA vaccines require uninterrupted refrigeration for transportation and storage, which can be a hurdle for vaccine distribution. Research is ongoing to engineer thermostable vaccines.",0.4286028487641391

I'm so excited about this. I've been waiting, counting down the days that I can get my last child, my five-year-old vaccinated so that, you know, we can all breathe a little easier and things will feel a little bit more normal. Missing out on school was a huge thing in having to stay home. They have been quarantined once and being able to play with their friends and just being normal kids and having to wear masks everywhere, they don't love it. So I'd like them to be able to get back to normal as quick as possible. As a mother, I've been really excited for the vaccine for ages five to 11 to come out. All my kids are that age and I feel like it's a great way to provide them that extra protection. They enjoy being in school.

71,I3kd5SyYHEE,Myocarditis and coronavirus vaccines: Explaining the rare side effect,"Over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, there has been growing evidence linking COVID19 infections to myocarditis in patients. Myocarditis is simply inflammation of the heart muscle. It occurs in response to infection or to injury. That injury can be from what we call autoimmune diseases when the body is reacting to a certain invader. It's producing antibodies to attack that invader and sometimes it gets a little confused. It may actually attack the body itself. Our bodies respond to COVID19 by producing antibodies to attack the virus. And in rare cases, when these antibodies attack the heart, the resulting inflammation can start impeding normal heart function, resulting in a slew of symptoms. If the damage becomes a little more extensive or in some ways disturbs the nerves, then people can feel it as chest pain. If it gets extensive enough that it disturbs the actual function of the heart, then it can cause shortness of breath because the heart's not functioning in the usual way. And there could be some heart failure. That is, some of the lungs can become congested because the heart's not functioning properly. Most often with myocarditis, these things just heal themselves. And in many cases, people may not have even known they had it. It's only in some rare cases where the damage becomes extensive enough that it actually causes people problems. There has also been evidence of myocarditis in patients who have received the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines. And despite being an incredibly rare occurrence, about one case per 50,000 patients, according to two Israeli studies, myocarditis has been cited by some of the vaccine hesitant as a reason they are holding off. What we've seen is that this risk, this increase in risk seems localized to males somewhere between 18 and 29. And the risk, again, in the very best studies is suggested to be quite low, that the people who are affected are most often affected in a very mild way. It's what we call self-limited. Federal officials have acknowledged a link between myocarditis and the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. But experts agree the benefits of vaccines far outweigh any potential harms, especially the harms caused by coronavirus infection. The CDC reports that coronavirus patients have 16 times the risk for developing myocarditis compared to people who are uninfected. There may be some risks associated with the vaccine, but these are highly effective vaccines in preventing the covid itself. And that provides a lot of offsetting benefits, both for myocarditis and for the wide range of other things that are prevented as a result of taking the vaccine.",0.5376839826839828

for state and local Health authorities about myocarditis and other complications relating to the covid vaccine but for reasons unknown did not send it now this email that the news Outlet obtained allegedly from Dimitri desalis the cdc's top official for equity in COVID19 data and engagement to to two other CDC officials Bears the subject line draft alert on myocarditis and mRNA vaccines desalis adds that this is the most recent draft of an alert as discussed happy to discuss further the email is stated May 21st 2021 3 days later the CDC acknowledged for the first time that reported cases of myocarditis uh existed after receiving a COVID19 vaccination that there were those levels were higher than expected however the agency still recommended that most Americans 12 and older get vac vacinated here to discuss is RAV Aurora an independent journalist at the illusion of consensus podcast welcome back to Rising hey guys great to be here yes thank you for joining us again I turn to you uh whenever there's news on the vaccine and myocarditis front um specifically how significant is this um development that there was this draft email um concerning this issue which you have talked about so much yeah yeah I think there there should have definitely been an alert and some kind of public engagement on this topic and um you saw there was some early reporting just a couple days prior in The Epic Times as well that Zachary styberg great credit to him for this fantastic reporting um about how in in in April um the CDC I believe April 27th the CDC said um relle binsky in this uh White House Press briefing that they had deliberately looked in over 200 doses uh given to the American public of the MRNA vaccines and they could not find a myocarditis signal when in fact uh there were hundreds of reports and vs already on myocarditis up until that point uh they had already consulted with the Israeli Ministry of Health with the Department of Defense um and uh there was also the the US military as well that reported on uh cases of vaccine myocarditis in the military which is kind of unsurprising because that's a kind of concentrated group of uh younger males um who are incredibly fit and healthy which uh where myocarditis cases are particularly concentrated yet days later in late April the Public Announcement by the CDC was that there's no signal here and then when you fast forward to may you have this alert that's drafted um and it's it's not clear what the alert was going to say this is very vague um but days later they do acknowledge that there is a vaccine myocarditis issue um but then it's they say that well the cost benefit analysis for teenagers and young adults is still to get vaccinated so they later do acknowledge it but they don't actually change their tune and they continue recommending it which I I think is particularly egregious when at that particular point and afterwards as well we knew the infection fatality rates we knew who was at risk from covid we knew this was primarily concentrated among elderly individuals with comorbidities people who are obese so for the CDC to have all this data already in vs Israeli Ministry of Health Etc um and to have this this proposal for this draft not being shared to the public and instead um days later it being promoted uh to uh Young Americans without any clear evidence of benefit um I think is completely wrong and just shows just how captured these regulatory agencies are uh help me understand Rob because my understanding was that although the there's an argument to be made about the diminishing or marginal benefits of the covid vaccine for younger people without coor comorbidities as you've described there are also when you look when you compare the risks of having heart uh disease as a consequence of covid versus the risk of having heart disease as a consequence of the uh covid vaccine myocarditis as a consequence of the covid vaccine it's still even if you think that all being a wash you shouldn't get the vaccine the the balance comes out in favor of uh being vaccinated in terms of having a lower uh incidence of heart rate at least within every population except for the narrow band of men within a certain age bracket so was it inaccurate for the CDC to advise that there was still some benefit even if it is marginal to Young people getting the vaccine especially given that many young people do in fact have comorbid comorbidities R obes these are not um rare uh rare quantities to have and unfortunately in our population yeah yeah no it was it was completely inaccurate and this particular comparison between hard complications from the vaccine versus covid you know I'm not a cardiologist so initially for me I was looking at this topic um and I was wondering like what's going on here CU you read mainstream media and you read you listen to Peter hotz they're all talking about how the cardiac risks from uh covid are far greater than the vaccine then I interviewed this guy Dr Anish Koka who distributed uh covid vaccines at his own clinic in Philadelphia Koka Cardiology um I highly recommend you check out his stuff I interviewed him and that interview is actually going to be coming out soon there was an earlier article that I did with him and we went over this for like three hours um and I I fact checked him and we did rigorous research and he's still operating the clinic and he explained to me and this really Bears out in the data is that Co viroc caritis from covid is fundamentally different from myocarditis from the vaccine because myocarditis from the vaccine particularly affects younger and healthier people and more importantly than that you can still see myocarditis in people in their 40s and 50s but myocarditis from covid is not the same thing it's not myocarditis in any traditional sense it's more like individuals who are in the hospital who are having multiple complications they're being pushed over the edge uh they have they're having lung issues Brea you know breathing issues uh they might not potentially make it and they're also having cardiac issues and when you test them you find elevated cardiac levels so it's labeled as myocarditis whereas with vaccine myocarditis it's just myocarditis it's not 10 other different things going on and the individual um struggling in the hospital uh with with every last breath it's individuals who otherwise would have been uh healthy so those two groups are very very different so that's actually an apples and oranges comparison which is something that I didn't know initially thankfully now I'm educated on this topic so that comparison doesn't really work when it comes to younger healthier people now Brianna you're absolutely right and this is something um that I've I've debated with some people and talked about is that in the United States comorbidities are real it's not just you know 0.00 something percent of the population there are significant rates um of obesity but when it came to the vaccine discussion the CDC just refused and just were not doing an honest conversation about risks and benefits there was just always this very strange from the outside and to many other scientists very strange like dogmatic approval um and promotion of these covid vaccines in younger Americans when they hadn't done that proper risk benefit analysis right how much are we actually lowering mortality you know what are the risk of myocarditis versus uh you know preventing um hospitalization from covid I mean these kind of conversations were not actually uh being had um you know very clearly and instead they were pushing it uh kind of zealously and then it was left to other uh research agencies like around the world like studies in Thailand and Hong Kong um which I don't know why they had to do those studies and we couldn't do those studies but a lot of those countries actually did the myocarditis studies the rigorous myocarditis studies like subclinical myocarditis and they ended up finding like 1 to 2 percent of uh young uh adolescents uh young teens uh had gotten some form of subclinical or clinical myocarditis and those rates are absolutely terrifying if if if those rates actually apply some of those studies are very small they're in one 100 or 200 people um but there again we weren't clear on the risk benefit analysis the CDC seem to be clear absent the requisite evidence and instead of being cautious about this and instead of when we're talking in April and May when they had gotten all these reports in v and Israeli Ministry of Health and Department of Defense instead of being like Oh let's let's be careful here let's maybe recommend this to elderly people or to people who are vulnerable the CDC never did that they never did what European countries like Denmark and Sweden and certain Asian countries that here we had this potentially predictably very zealous pharmaceutical traditional American approach where it's all about medication vaccination just you got to take these products by fiser and madna and if you question it then suddenly you're antiva that's not how science should be done and the CDC completely failed in my opinion RAV Aurora thank you so much for joining us today we appreciate it  thanks,0.3925145268601644

And I'm  really looking forward to both of your responses   because, since the beginning of the pandemic,  you've been outstanding communicators about the   science and the data as it becomes available.  You critically read COVID studies, you confer   with expert colleagues, and then you help break  down what do people really need to know. And   you've also really focused on ways that people can  optimize their own health and immunity throughout   your discussions. I think this is going to be a  lengthy discussion and geared towards people that   want to better understand the data and some of  the important nuances related to these questions.   So thank you both for being here today. Dr.  Seheult, I'm going to send the first question   your way. I've heard some people say that COVID  vaccines aren't necessary for relatively young   people who are in good shape and don't have  medical problems. What are your thoughts on this? [Dr. Seheult]: Well, Kyle, as you may know,  I'm a critical care intensivist, and I take   care of patients in the hospital. I work in a  one ICU hospital in a one hospital town. So,   anything bad that happens, it comes to me in  the intensive care unit. I'm the one that is   there when they put the endotracheal tube in. I  put the chest tubes in, the central lines, and   holding the patient's hands. And so for me, in  the last couple of weeks, this has become really   personal for me because what I've seen in the last  couple of weeks in our hospital is like nothing   else that I've seen even with the prior wave  going back to February and January of this year.   So, what is it that I'm seeing?  I'm seeing patients in their 30s,   patients even in their 20s coming in with very few  comorbidities, maybe just a little bit overweight,   and they are ending up on the ventilator. I've  seen fathers in their 60s coming in crying,   asking me to do everything that we can  for their sons who are in their 30s,   newly married with small children. We didn't  see that back in February. And so, to get to the   root of your question, is what do people who are  younger have to be concerned about? I think it's   a very good question because all of the things  that we have learned about COVID19 in the past   is now being rewritten by the Delta variant. So,  if you look at some of this data, this is data   from Virginia, and you can see here on the left  hand side of the screen in January is a graph that   we're all very familiar with. This is basically  the monthly hospitalization rate by age group.   And what you can see there is on the right side  of that first graph is it's a very high number for   the elderly, and it goes down very precipitously  for the young. And that's because the young were   not being hospitalized. But as we go across  this screen, you can see here that when we end   up in August, a very ominous sign is occurring.  What we're seeing is that the younger population   are being hospitalized at almost the same rate.  Maybe, instead of, you know, a 20th or a 10th,   it's maybe half of the rate of the elderly.  And so why is that happening? Well, we know   that there's a very high vaccination rate in the  elderly and a relatively low vaccination rate in   the young. Even look at the...you can barely see  it, but the yellow boxes are describing what's   happening to pediatric cases. Pediatric cases,  of course, those less than 12 years of age who   can't get vaccinated are skyrocketing.  And so this is the concern that I have. We look at some of these other issues. For  instance, this idea of the 99 percent survival rate.   That's something that they say. Hey, 99 percent survival,  and I really don't need to be concerned about it.   So if you look at this data, and we compare it  to something that we know very well like the flu   virus, you'll see here that the hospitalization  rate for the flu virus in young people is about   0.01 percent. If you look at the pre-Delta COVID19 data,  it's about 0.2 percent. It's almost 20-fold higher for   COVID19 in the young than it is for the flu. Now,  if you think about the 1 percent number, you'll start to   see very clearly that if you start to think about  there's only the 1 percent that are going to be affected,   that won't affect me, what we are seeing right  now in this country, especially in states like   Florida and Texas and specifically Idaho, is  an overwhelming of the critical care hospital   health care delivery system. Think about this.  The population of the United States is 331 million   people. If just 1 percent are going to die, that's 3.3  million people, and that's just the people who are   dying. Let's talk about the people who are sick  and need to be hospitalized because they can't   breathe because of oxygenation. We only have under  a million acute care beds in the United States,   and so as a result of that, you are  going to quickly overwhelm the healthcare   system if you have a problem with an overwhelming  infection. Let's take the state of Idaho. It has a   39.7 percent fully vaccinated rate, and what we're seeing  there, as of yesterday, the governor has declared   that hospitals now because they're overwhelmed are  going to start to deliver basically rationed care.   You should not expect the same standards of care  that you're used to expecting in the health care   delivery system because they're just not able to  give it. Let me give you some specific examples.   Instead of having one intensive care nurse for  two patients, it's now going to be one intensive   care nurse for six patients with some help from  non-ICU nurses. Because they're overwhelmed,   you cannot transfer patients to higher level of  care for things that they need to get done if   they have very advanced cancers, for instance,  because those hospitals don't have room. If you   need elective surgery, their elective surgeries  are being canceled. Traumas are still happening.   Babies are still being born. These are the  problems that we're having in a situation where   you may think that because you're healthy and  strong and young, you're not going to be affected.   But if you were to get into a car accident, or  you wanted...know somebody that wants to deliver   a baby and has a complication, it's going to be  difficult for those things to happen. And so this   is the thing that's occurring. And going back  to my experience in the last couple of weeks,   every single one of those patients in the  hospital that were there in their 30s,   their 40s were not vaccinated. And it's  based on information that's coming out   that you're making decisions based on whether  or not you should get the vaccine because   you hear about side effects, or you hear  about things, for instance, about myocarditis.   Well, here's an article from the new England  journal of medicine, peer reviewed published   September 16th, 2001 looking at the Israeli  data with almost a million subjects in each arm.   So what we have here plotted in yellow is the  risk difference per a hundred thousand persons   infected with SARS-CoV-2, and in blue is the  risk difference per hundred thousand persons who   received the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. First,  let's take a look at SARS-CoV-2, or COVID19.   We see big risks here for acute kidney injury,  for arrhythmia, for deep venous thrombosis, for   pulmonary embolism, and for myocardial infarction.  And again, notice that there is a small signal   here in terms of COVID19 for myocarditis  and pericarditis. Clearly, there is a small   signal there with post vaccination myocarditis,  and pericarditis, but actually the data here   on these from Israel is showing that it's more  likely to get myocarditis and pericarditis   post SARS-CoV-2 infection. But in terms of the  relative risks for the vaccine, which is in blue,   notice that the biggest one here at 78 is  lymphadenopathy, which is a normal response   to the vaccine. Now there's been a couple of  papers that are in the peer review process,   but have been published to a medical archive  server. And again, the peer review process is   where the paper is submitted to experts in the  field that review it looking for possible bias   or things that were not taken into consideration.  And this pre-print non-peer reviewed article using   electronic records in the United States, also  agreed with the Israeli data that was published   in the new England journal of medicine and came to  the conclusion that young males infected with the   virus are up to six times more likely to develop  myocarditis as those who received the vaccine.   Another pre-print, which is still currently  in the process of being peer reviewed, made   headlines in a number of papers in the UK and also  in the United States. And it showed the opposite   that the incidents of post-vaccine myocarditis  had a higher incidents than hospitalization in   pediatric patients from COVID19. However, the  article glean most of its data from the VAERS,   which as you know, is a reporting system and  raw data based on reports that could be made by   anyone and often contain incomplete  descriptions and chart notes that require   additional investigation, removal of confounding  variables and comparison to background levels of   medical problems to become useful. Now, we'll talk  about the VAERS here just a bit, but as you'll see   various data, doesn't allow you to really conclude  anything. VAERS can use to generate hypotheses,   but not to test them directly. So in summary,  I think it's good for researchers to generate   hypothesis from VAERS data, but it's a problem  when newspapers turn hypotheses of observational   data that haven't been peer reviewed yet and  turn them into headlines. So it'll be interesting   to see what issues the peer review process  points out in these papers and if they go on   to be published. So to answer your question Kyle  it's, it's, there's a lot of information there.   Um, but for a young person now, today facing  the Delta variant and maybe future variants,   it's not the same type of virus that we were  dealing with back earlier in 2021. Yes. Now they   are more susceptible to getting the infection and  now the risk of them being hospitalized is higher. : Dr. Patrick, what are  your thoughts on this question? [Dr. Patrick]: Well, I think in addition to  hospitalization, there's also the risk of people   who have mild symptoms who don't have to go to the  hospital, they stay at home during the duration of   their illness, are coming down with post-acute  COVID syndrome, which is popularly known as   the long-haul COVID. The symptoms range  from brain fog to racing heart problems   to lethargy. And there's been a variety of  studies that have come out that have looked at   what long-haul COVID is and what population  it seems to be affecting. And interestingly,   you'd think, well, people having these long-term  effects would be the ones that were, you know,   on the ventilator. Well, of course, people on  ventilators do have long-term effects. But you'd   think people that are hospitalized would be the  ones mostly having these long-haul COVID effects,   and it turns out younger people, people under  the age of 50, teenagers even, people in their   20s are the ones that are really, you know,  coming down with this long-haul COVID syndrome. There's a pre-print that has not been  peer-reviewed yet, and it's a big study that   was done out of the U.K. It's part of this ongoing  study called the Biobank Study. They get large   population sample sizes. In this case, it was  close to 800 people. It was 780 or something like   that people before the pandemic came in and had  MRI brain scans. Researchers have all this data   on individuals', you know, brain structure  and volume. And so once the pandemic hit,   many people came down with COVID19, some mild  cases, some more severe, some were hospitalized.   And a few months, you know, into the pandemic,  researchers doing this Biobank study thought,   ""Hey, we should bring these people back in and get  a brain scan and see if there's any changes."" And   so that's what they did. Just, you know, months  after their first scan, they brought them back   in for another scan. And what the preliminary  findings, again, that are not peer-reviewed yet,   showed is that there are major differences in gray  matter regions of the brain. Gray matter atrophy   is occurring in several different regions of the  brain, very prominently in the olfactory region,   which makes sense because, you know, one of the  telltale symptoms of COVID19 at least pre-Delta   was loss of smell, loss of taste. And also  there's atrophy in other brain regions   involved in memory and learning. People that had  severe COVID do have worse atrophy compared to   the people that only had mild cases, did not  need to be hospitalized, but they themselves   were also experiencing brain atrophy. These are  people that did not have to go to the hospital.   And, of course, people were matched for the  same age, the same gender, the same ethnicity,   and the same time in between scans, so  trying to keep everything, you know,   as comparable as possible to compare apples to  apples. To me, that was quite frightening because   it really suggests that there are  complications, and there are, you know,   long-term effects of this virus that we don't  quite understand and that are affecting,   you know, hundreds of thousands of  people. I personally know quite a few. : Dr. Seheult, anything  to add on the long COVID   front because I know...that's a concern that  I have. At my age, if I got COVID19, would I   have lingering symptoms? What are you seeing  on your end clinically with regards to that? [Dr. Seheult]: Oh, yeah. So, in addition to me  working in the intensive care unit, I also have   an outpatient pulmonary clinic. I've diagnosed at  least three or four, just off the top of my head,   blood clots in patients who went  to the hospital, had COVID19,   survived, got better, so they weren't part of  the 1 percent, but then they had persistent shortness   of breath, leg swelling. We immediately made the  diagnosis and put them on blood thinners. And so   that's just a small slice of what we're seeing   in terms of comorbidity. So the 1 percent is death, but  there's a lot worse that can happen up to that   point than death. There's a lot of bad things  that can occur. So, totally agree. Absolutely. [Dr. Patrick]: To add on to the blood clots and  strokes, there was this study...multiple studies,   one out of Israel, and a couple out of the United  States, showing that people under the age of 50   were coming in to the emergency room for strokes.  And one of the studies out of Israel found,   because they test everyone for COVID19,  a high percentage of the people that were   coming in for these strokes, these young  people under 50, had COVID19 and didn't   even know they had had it. So, I mean, we're  talking obviously mild, mild cases, potentially,   even asymptomatic if they didn't even know they  had COVID19 and they're coming in with strokes. [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah, absolutely. And so this is  the thing is that COVID19 has many different ways   of affecting the body. The one that we  all know about is the lungs, of course,   because it can cause inflammation in the lungs.  But as Dr. Patrick points out, there are blood   clot issues. So blood clots to the lungs can  also occur, but also blood clots to the brain,   which manifest the strokes. : Dr. Seheult, could you also speak  to this question that some people have,   or really the interpretation of  something that's on the CDC website   about death certificates and how only...at one  point, only 5 percent of death certificates had only   COVID19 on the certificate. I know you fill  out quite a few death certificates in the ICU.   What are your thoughts on this idea?  What can we really interpret from that? [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. So it really boils down to  how the death certificate is filled out. Generally   speaking, the way the death certificate should be  filled out when somebody dies is you have the most   proximal thing occur at the top line, and that  would be...let's say there was a car accident.   Okay. You were in a motor vehicle accident, and as  a result of the motor vehicle accident, there was   a rupture of one of the internal blood vessels,  and then you bled out. So, you wouldn't just put   at the top of that death certificate motor vehicle  accident. That's not what the bureau of statistics   of your state wants to see. They want to see  ruptured, you know, pulmonary artery, and then   under that, they want to have the reason for the  ruptured pulmonary artery. That would be motor   vehicle accident. So, when you are describing  someone with COVID19, COVID19...you don't   die from COVID19, right? COVID19 is not  a final cause of death. It may be the thing   that set things in motion, and so you would have  COVID19 caused pneumonia, and then that caused   something like adult respiratory distress  syndrome or acute respiratory distress syndrome,   and that was the cause of death. Because, as we've  just mentioned, COVID19 can cause death in many   different ways. COVID19 could cause you to die  by a pulmonary embolism or a stroke in the brain.   Unfortunately, some physicians are  just putting COVID19 at the top. So I think, Kyle, what you're referring to is this  statement that we see here on the CDC website,   and they say here that ""The number  of deaths that mention one or more   of the conditions indicated is shown for all  deaths involving COVID19 and by age groups.""   ""For over 5 percent of these deaths, COVID19 was the  only cause mentioned on the death certificate.""   So people have taken that to mean that really  COVID19 only caused 5 percent of the 600,000-plus   people that have died in this country, and all  the other things were just comorbidities. But if   you actually look at the CDC's website, you'll  see what some of these ""comorbidities"" are,   and as we've just discussed the actual way  that COVID19 kills people. So, for instance,   the number one comorbidity was pneumonia.  Influenza and pneumonia are grouped together.   Well, the pneumonia was caused by COVID19.  It wasn't a comorbidity. Another one that's   very common is respiratory failure. Yeah, it's not  like people are coming with respiratory failure,   and they also happen to have COVID19. No,  COVID19 causes respiratory failure. And another   one of these ones that was on there was adult  respiratory distress syndrome. That's actually   what they mean to say there's acute respiratory  distress syndrome. Again, another thing that's   caused by COVID19. And so what's happening here  is that, you know, these physicians are very busy.   They're being handed death certificates. They  need to fill these things out. They think, ""Oh,   yeah, that guy, he died of COVID19. That's  right."" And they just write COVID19 at the   top. That's the incorrect way of filling those  out, and that's the reason why, fortunately,   only 5 percent of those death certificates are being  incorrectly filled out with just COVID19. : Just to clarify, using  that data to make a case that   really COVID19 is only killing people with  multiple comorbidities is not accurate. [Dr. Seheult]: Not at all. : Okay. Well, Dr. Patrick, this next  question's for you, and it's about spike   protein. We know that the spike protein can be  dangerous and cause a significant immune response,   and there's this idea floating around that because  spike protein is dangerous from the SARS-CoV-2   virus, therefore, the COVID19 vaccines must be as  dangerous as well. What are your thoughts on that? [Dr. Patrick]: Well, I have a lot of thoughts on  that, Kyle. I've thought long and hard about it.   But sort of before I get into some of the details,  I think, the spike protein has really become a   common household name. At this point, most  people around the world know what the spike   protein is mostly because it's the entry point  for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to get into our cells.   There are about 26 different spike proteins.  I shouldn't say different. There are about 26   spike proteins that line the surface  of a SARS-CoV-2 viral particle,   and these spike proteins will bind to a receptor  on many different cell types we have in our body   that have a receptor called ACE2. And when the  spike protein then binds to the ACE2 receptor,   it undergoes a conformational change that  essentially refers to the structure of it changes.   So it binds on to this receptor, and it then  elongates, and sort of twists and turns around,   and then it fuses with the cell membrane and  is, you know, engulfed inside of the cell.   Another way it happens is through  endocytosis. But essentially,   the point I want to make here is that  conformational change happens because   when the spike protein initially binds to the  ACE2 receptor, it's in a conformation called   the pre-fusion conformation. You can think of  it more like a closed type of conformation.   Once it binds, this triggers a conformational  change for it to, again, like I said, elongate   and sort of twist around. When it does that, that  is referred to as the post-fusion conformation.   And the reason that's really important is  because all of the vaccines that are available   in the United States under either emergency  use authorization or under FDA authorization   or up and coming vaccines, so that includes the  Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines,   the Johnson & Johnson adenoviral vaccine, as  well as the Novavax vaccine, they all contain an   insertion of two proline amino acids into the  spike protein to lock it into the pre-fusion   conformation. And this was brilliant work done  by the structural biologist, Dr. Jason McLellan.   He's at the University of Texas in Austin. And he  thankfully had figured out this way to lock viral   proteins into the pre-fusion conformation. First  it was with the respiratory syncytial virus, RSV,   and then later, he had figured out for the  other beta coronavirus, the MERS coronavirus.   And so he really had a running start there.  And the reason that is so important is because,   when you're comparing the spike protein  from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as I mentioned,   there's 26 of them on every viral particle,  to the spike protein that is in the vaccines,   including the mRNA vaccines and the vaccines in  the United States, it's a different spike protein.   It's a spike protein that cannot undergo  that structural change. It does not elongate   and, you know, dig into the cell membrane and fuse  with it. It's a different spike protein because of   those two proline amino acids that were inserted  to lock it into the pre-fusion conformation. And one of the first things you learn as a  scientist, as a budding young scientist is that   you can't compare apples to oranges. You can't  compare two different things. You have to compare   apples to apples or oranges to oranges. And  so when you're talking about a different spike   protein, structurally, it's different, right? You  can't take a study that's looking at the spike   protein that is from the surface of SARS-CoV-2  and say everything that that spike protein is   doing applies to the spike protein in the vaccines  that are available in the United States because   it's different. And so, I think, that's a really,  really upfront important thing to understand. And   the burden of proof is on, you know, people making  the claim that the spike protein from the mRNA   vaccines is dangerous because some studies have  shown that the spike protein from the SARS-CoV-2   by itself can be dangerous. You have to show that,  and it has not been shown. So, what these studies   that have shown that the spike protein from  SARS-CoV-2 virus, how it can be dangerous, there's   been some in vitro studies, which means cells in  culture in a dish. When you dump spike protein   on them, it can cause the activation of cell  signaling pathways that could lead to cell death.   This is often referred to as cytotoxicity. There's  also been some animal studies shown where either   recombinant protein, which is just basically  made in a lab, so they make the spike protein,   or what's called pseudovirus expressing the spike  protein, so this is not the SARS-CoV-2 virus,   but it sort of acts like a virus  to allow it to get into cells,   if you directly inject the pseudovirus with  a spike protein into the trachea of hamsters,   it causes severe lung damage and also  gets into the circulation and causes   circulatory damage and vascular  damage to the vascular system. And so these studies, and there's been, you know,  a few of those, have really spurred this idea   that the spike protein from the vaccines must  be dangerous because these studies showing the   spike protein that's found on the surface of  SARS-CoV-2 is. And again, you can't compare.   You can't make that comparison, and that's  really just one aspect of, you know, this story.   The other aspect has to do with where the spike  protein goes in the body. And, you know, I think,   first and foremost, anyone that's concerned about  these studies showing that the spike protein   by itself is dangerous should be terrified  about getting SARS-CoV-2 because, for one,   you're getting, as I mentioned, 26 of those spike  proteins on one viral particle. How many viral   particles are replicating inside of your cells  at any given moment? You know, thousands of them.   And on top of that, there have been studies that  have shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus is detected in   multiple organs. You know, this isn't just in the  nose and in the trachea and in the lungs, which   in and of itself is bad. I mean, the damage  to your lungs is, you know, one major concern.   But the SARS-CoV-2 virus, again, with spike  protein has been detected in the heart   in humans. It's been detected in the brain. It's  been detected in cerebrospinal fluid. It's been   detected in kidneys. It's been detected in the GI  tract. It's been detected in the testes. It's in   many different tissues in humans. Oh, and it's  been detected in plasma in the circulatory system.   So, again, you know, the concern should  be amplified for actually contracting the   SARS-CoV-2 virus if you are concerned about  the study showing spike protein itself is   dangerous. And that sort of leads me into  the vaccines. And generally speaking,   I'm going to talk a little bit more about  mRNA vaccines because there's been some more   concern about that, and there's  been some more data on that. But people are concerned that these mRNA  vaccines are getting into multiple organs,   and therefore the spike protein is getting into  these other organs and causing damage, again,   different spike protein. So, that needs to be  considered. But a lot of this data stems from...a   lot of this concern stems from some data that was  generated by Pfizer and BioNTech when they were   doing a bunch of safety studies looking at,  you know, what happens when you inject really   high concentrations of the mRNA vaccine  by Pfizer into rodents. And so, I think,   the first thing to keep in mind...and I know  that at MedCram, you guys have had people on   like Dr. Shane Crotty who's explained how the mRNA  vaccines work, how you have, you know, the mRNA   inside of a lipid nanoparticle along with some  other factors like polyethylene glycol, and that   is injected into the deltoid muscle tissue, and  that basically, after that injection into the   tissue happens, you have the lipid nanoparticle  with the mRNA vaccine now getting inside of muscle   cells using your own cell machinery, the ribosome,  to actually make the spike protein, which itself   has been shown to peak after 24 hours, and then  after 48 hours, the spike protein, half-life of   the protein that's made is degraded. It's not very  long-lasting. The mRNA itself also has a half-life   somewhere between, you know, 48 to 72 hours, and  the lipid nanoparticle has a very short...like   within hours. It really only lasts long enough to  protect the mRNA from being degraded. But once you   actually do make the spike protein, the spike  protein itself is...it is expressed on the cell   surface, what's called the plasma membrane of  the cell. And the spike protein itself has a   region on it called a transmembrane domain that  sticks it. It's like an anchored...anchors into   that plasma membrane, so it is not freely floating  out into your circulation. It is stuck there.   And at that point, you have other immune cells  that recognize this foreign protein and begin   the process of, you know, making antibodies, and  you have that whole, you know, immunity effect. But the concern was from this Pfizer study where  rats were given a dose that is 10 times the amount   of what humans are given. So humans are given  30 micrograms of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine   for one dose. The rat was given 50  micrograms of the Pfizer-BioNTech   vaccine. So, if you were to do the calculation  for a rat equivalent dose, so if you want to   give the rat what humans actually get, an  equivalent dose based on their body mass,   it would be more like 4.86 micrograms. So they got  50. That's essentially 10 times. Okay. And this   was done for a reason of, ""Okay, what happens when  we give them a huge amount of the vaccine?"" Well,   what was found...the lipid nanoparticle  that contains the mRNA was radio-labeled.   It's like a tag that you can visualize things.  And that radio-labeled tag was found in other   organs. It was, you know, found in a variety of  organs. Again, it was to a very small degree,   but it was found in other organs. And so people  got really concerned that these mRNA vaccines were   traveling to other organs and causing damage. And  a few things to keep in mind there. One, the dose   was super high, and, in fact, within the same  document, the same Pfizer study, they gave a   more equivalent dose to mice. In this case, they  give mice 2 micrograms of the mRNA vaccine, and   that vaccine did not go to all these other organs.  In fact, the only organ that was shown to have any   amount of this radio-labeled tag was the liver,  and it was completely gone after 48 hours.   And so, I think, that's really good news  because it suggests, yeah, when you give,   you know, a rat 10 times the amount of what the  humans are getting, you might have some spillover.   But on top of that, again, the radio-labeled tag  that we're looking at is the lipid nanoparticle,   and if there is some spillover, you know, in  the muscle tissue, what surrounds the muscle   tissue is your lymphatic system, lymph, where  all the immune cells are. So you essentially   have your immune cells like dendritic cells  recognizing something foreign, in this case,   a radio-labeled lipid nanoparticle with some  mRNA in it, and they basically chop it up, and,   you know, it undergoes phagocytosis and is taken  to other tissues for recycling. And so, whatever   we're seeing in those other organs, we don't even  actually know if that's, you know, the intact mRNA   vaccine lipid nanoparticles. It's probably just  remnants of it because that's what your body does. So, I think, all of those factors in combination  give some reassurance that people should not be   so concerned about the spike protein from mRNA  vaccines or from the Johnson & Johnson vaccine   getting to other organs and causing...you  know, wreaking havoc essentially. And I will just add one more thing to that, and  that is another study, and this is something   that I've seen concern about on the internet.  This study was done in humans. It was a very,   very small sample size. It was 13 people, and  they were given the Moderna mRNA vaccine. What   was found in that study is that 11 out of 13  people, the S1 subunit of the spike protein   was detected in their plasma. Three out of the 13  had the entire spike protein detectable. However,   the assay that was used to detect this S1 subunit  and the spike protein itself in these 13 people   has a false positivity rate of 25 percent. That's one  in four people, showing they have spike protein.   This was another study done,  they took samples pre-pandemic,   there should be no people with spike protein  pre-pandemic, and they were showing that they   had spike protein. So with a sample size  of 13 and a false positivity rate of 25 percent,   you can't make any conclusions from  that small study showing, you know,   that 11 out of 13 people had, you know, S1  subunit of spike protein showing up in the plasma.   It just doesn't make any sense to make any strong  conclusions from that. So, I guess that, you know,   the bottom line is that, you know, as Roger  mentioned, we've had over 177 million people   fully vaccinated in the United States. You know,  if this thing was causing severe damage in people,   we would know about it. And, you know, we do know  about the adverse effects that are occurring like   the myocarditis that is happening, you know,  in some young people. It's still quite rare.   It does occur. And, again, as Roger mentioned,  it's happening six-fold higher in younger healthy   individuals than it is in the same individuals  that are being exposed to the COVID19 vaccines. : Well, that is a perfect segue to a  discussion about adverse events and deaths   reported from the COVID19  vaccine. And, Dr. Seheult,   could you explain what VAERS or the  Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System   that we use in the United States is and  how that data should be interpreted? [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. Thanks, Kyle. So,  to back up a little bit, let's talk about   a six-month period of time here. So, if  we look at December, January, and February   of just a few months ago, that was a period  of time at least where I'm working in Southern   California where there was a lot of COVID.  In fact, we had to build an entire new ICU   with isolation precautions. We had to have  nurses trained. We basically used a lot of   resources because surgeries weren't happening at  the time. And compare that with the next three   months after that, which would be March, April,  and May. So, the reason why those two groups of   three months are very different is the first  group of three months had a lot of COVID19   patients coming in. We were very full. And  then after that wave went away, we basically   disbanded the second intensive care unit. We  were able to contract back to what we were   doing before, and this despite the fact that in  March, April, and May of 2021, we were vaccinating   millions of people a day. And so, again, I just  want to underline what Dr. Patrick was saying   there. If the spike protein from the vaccine was  so dangerous, how were we able to contract down   our hospital ICU intensive care services during  that period of time? However, what did happen   during that time was that there was a huge spike  of...so the argument may be made, for instance,   that maybe the spike protein is not causing  disease or conditions that would get people into   the intensive care unit, but it might be causing  more mild symptoms or more mild problems. And   that might show up in something called the  VAERS systems. Let's talk about the VAERS. So, as you can see here on the screen, there's  this chart that has made the rounds on the   internet, and what it does is it shows the  total reported deaths post-vaccine. And you   can see obviously not post-COVID vaccine because  the COVID vaccine didn't exist back during these   years. And we're going back way back into  the early 2000s. And then all of a sudden,   there's this huge spike here in 2000, and these,  again, are reported deaths. So this is evidence,   some say, that these patients that are receiving  the COVID19 vaccine are dying. So, again,   I don't know how they could be dying without  going through the intensive care unit. I guess   it's possible they could be dying at home  and never making it to the hospital. So let's   investigate exactly what it is that's going on  here. The thing that you've got to understand   about this reporting system is that...first  of all, a couple of things. Number one,   you have to understand that because the vaccines  that were given emergency use authorization   in the late 2020, because of this, they  expanded the reporting requirements   for the VAERS. In other words, before a physician  would make a report to the VAERS if he suspected   that a vaccination led to a death, and they were  under suspicion that something was connected.   Now that was completely eliminated. Now, no  matter what happens, if a patient gets a vaccine,   and anything happens, hospitalization, death,  anything, it should be reported under law. So, I wanted to take a look at this a little  bit more, and what I did was I looked at this   paper that was published back in 2016,  so pretty early. And it was looking at   the flu vaccine because a lot of people  say that this has never happened before.   This huge increase in reporting  from the vaccine has never happened.   But yet there is a situation that occurred, and  it was published here in December of 2016 titled,   ""Surveillance of Adverse Events After Seasonal  Influenza Vaccination in Pregnant Women   and Their Infants in the Vaccine Adverse Event  Reporting system, July 2010 to May 2016."" So,   as you may recall, in 2009, we had a flu epidemic  called the swine flu epidemic, and in that year,   there was a huge amount of H1N1 influenza. And you  can see that here on the screen with that red bar.   So you can see the blue is sort of the endemic  influenza, and then in 2009, this massive   increase in H1N1 reports. And so what you also  see here is that purple line is the amount of   vaccinations that happened. So because there  was a lot of influenza that was going around,   a lot of people were being vaccinated. So what  you're actually seeing here, these bar graphs,   is the number of reports of adverse events.  Okay. So that's key to understand that. Even   though the vaccine had not changed, the makeup  of the vaccine had not changed, what we saw was   because there was more vaccinations being  given, there were more reports being given.   But there's something actually more to it than  that even still, and that is that there was more   understanding and more awareness of influenza.  So what I've done here is I've superimposed   Google trends. So how often somebody would  get on the internet and search for influenza,   you can see clearly there at the same point in  time that we're seeing increased reported spikes,   we're seeing an increased interest in influenza in  general. In fact, the highest that there ever was   during that time because it was a very  important news item at that time. Now,   again, this was under strict reporting system.  So, they only could report whether they felt   that there was a connection. But even that after  they looked at it, and published this paper, this   is the conclusion that they came to. Despite the  increase in reporting events, they said that the   peak in the number of pregnancy reports observed  during 2009 to 2010 followed by a decrease in   reporting suggest that the 2009 spike in pregnancy  reports after 2009 H1N1 inactivated vaccines   may have been due to stimulated reporting.  In other words, the vaccine hadn't changed,   the side effects hadn't changed, and so their  conclusion was is that as in 2000 and 2009-2010,   no new or unexpected patterns in maternal or  fetal outcomes were observed during 2010 and 2016. So, if we take the same kind of methodology that  we've done, we've looked at this huge spike here   with COVID19, and this is supposed to be evidence  that people are dying from the COVID vaccine, we   see a very interesting pattern because, if we look  at Google trends, and we type in COVID vaccine,   obviously, there's a massive spike at the same  time, the same kind of recipe that we would see   with the influenza. And then also, again, just  to make sure that we understand here, this is the   deputy director for the Centers for Disease  Control, and this is what he says. He says,   ""Health care providers' reporting requirements  are much broader than for other vaccines.   After someone receives the COVID19 vaccine, their  health care provider is required by law to report   all serious adverse health events, that would  include death, even if the provider does not   think the vaccine caused that event. These events  can include death, inpatient hospitalization,   or a serious case of COVID19. That  reporting protocol is due to the fact   that the FDA authorized the COVID19 vaccines  for emergency use."" So you can see that the   rules have changed in the middle of the game,  and so we have to look at that. If we were to   give a placebo injection, the question is  is we would still see deaths associated with   the vaccine. Why? Because we're vaccinating  so many people and because of just chance. I did a little bit of an epidemiological exercise.  So bear with me. If you look at the U.S. death   rate per 100,000 population per year, it's around  870 deaths. So, in other words, if you were to   take at random 100,000 people in the United States  and follow them for a year, you would find at the   end of that year that about 870 people would  have died. Obviously, as the age goes up, that   can go up to as high as 4,000. Here in the 75 to  84-year-old age group that's much higher. So let's   just take the average. We'll be conservative. And  also if you were to look over the period of the   last seven months, going from January this year  to August, seven or eight months, you'll see that   there's a fairly linear...if you want to take that  approach, fairly linear increase in the amount of   vaccinations over that seven month period of time.  And in fact, over that 7 month period of time,   there's been about 166 million people that  have been vaccinated. So, if that's over a   seven month period of time, the average period of  time that someone's been vaccinated is about three   and a half months. And over that period of time,  which started in January, that's when we have the   highest death rates, but then as we go through  the year, it comes down to the lowest death   rate. So that's over that period of time, there's  about an average death rate in the United States. So let's do a little bit of calculating. If there  is 870 dead people per 100,000 people per year,   and we adjust that for the 166 million people  that we've vaccinated in 1 campaign, and then   we adjust that for instead of 12 months just 3 and  a half months, which is the average period of time   that people have been on average vaccinated,  we come to this number of about 421,000   people that should be dead just by chance  from getting the vaccine. And clearly,   that's not the number of people that we're  seeing. The reports show maybe 10,000 or   15,000. So, clearly, there is a huge amount of  underreporting occurring. Now, realize that,   again, most of the people who are being vaccinated  at least in the country are actually much older.   So this number should actually be higher. And  number two, that most of the people that were   vaccinated very early on and therefore have a  longer range of vaccination were the older group   as well. And so when you look at that, you can  see here that the reported deaths totaling about   5,000 or 6,000 is a huge underreporting of the  number of deaths that we should have if we just   put a little red dot on their shoulder or gave  them a placebo injection. That's very important   to understand because some people...some  disingenuous people will show this and say,   ""Look, the vaccine is causing these deaths,"" and  that cannot be gotten from that type of data. The other graph that you might see is this graph,  which shows the number of days after vaccination   that deaths are reported. So, based on our 400,000  number that we've come up with, if we were to   prorate that on a daily basis, we would come up  with about 4,000 people dying on a daily basis   on average. Obviously, that gets bigger as more  and more people get vaccinated. But what we're   seeing here after a vaccination is only 600 to 700  deaths per day. Again, huge underreporting here at   this point. And again, so because there's huge  underreporting occurring, one might think that   what would be the most likely reporting situation,  someone who got a vaccine and died the next day,   or someone who died maybe a month later?  Obviously, when you have a death occurring close   to an event that has to be reported, the reporting  is going to happen more likely in that situation,   and you're going to have underreporting occurring  much more likely a month later. And that's exactly   what is demonstrated here with this graph. We see  that the most reporting occurs within one or two   days, and then it goes down precipitously  consistent with that type of pattern. The other last thing I'll leave you with here as  well is that with the mRNA vaccines, with Moderna,   for instance, it's a four-week interval between  shots, and for Pfizer, it's a three-week interval.   If, in fact, that second shot is causing  the problems that we see with myocarditis,   myocardial infarction that's been proposed or been  suggested, I would expect to see another peak here   about three to four weeks out, but,  in fact, we don't see any such peak.   And so that, again, lends me to believe that  this graph is the result of reporting events   and human psychology rather than an actual spike  protein that's causing deaths in these patients.   I agree that we should look for this stuff.  This stuff needs to be taken seriously,   and that is exactly the purpose of the  VAERS system is to look to see if there   are patterns. But to go out and say that simply  because there are deaths, that that must mean   that the vaccine is causing deaths. I think that  is disingenuous and not supported by the data. : Dr. Patrick, anything to add to that? [Dr. Patrick]: Yes. I do agree 100 percent with that  last statement that Dr. Seheult just said because   people are taking this data that is,  you know, accessible to the public   from the VAERS system, and they're  trying to make sense of that data. But   scientists from the CDC and from the FDA analyze  that data. They have to, you know, stratify it   by age, by gender, by ethnicity, and see how many  people die of X, Y, or Z in that age range of that   gender, of that ethnic group without a vaccine,  just what's the normal background death rate. You   need to do that comparison. Otherwise, this is  like the worst epidemiology data you could ever   imagine without any correction for confounding  factors. You know, it would be like one year,   you know, there was 200,000 births in the city  of San Bernardino, and at the same time, we had,   you know, 10,000 storks that flew by, therefore,  storks have to be causing...delivering   the babies, I mean, you know...or  causing the births basically. So,   you know, epidemiology is a big mess, and so  you can't just take that data and make these   correlations. And I think to sort of add  to what Dr. Seheult's kind of brilliant   epidemiology experiment that he just explained,  to add to that, in the United States alone,   every 30 seconds, someone dies of cardiovascular  disease, every 30 seconds. Now, generally   speaking, most of those people are going to be 50  or older because cardiovascular disease doesn't   usually, you know, affect people in their 20s  or 30s. It can, but generally speaking, it's   an age-related disease more or less. And so, you  know, if you look at the reported VAERS deaths,   more than half of them are in a population of  people that are 50 and older. So, it's like,   what are the chances that some of those people are  probably just dying from a heart attack or from   cardiovascular disease? Stroke, every 40 seconds,  someone has a stroke in the United States. They   die from it every about four minutes or so. Like  Dr. Seheult said, there are a lot of people dying   every day in the United States  completely independent of COVID19,   completely independent of vaccines. It's not  accurate to try to interpret the VAERS data   yourself without stratifying it and looking at  all the other factors that I just mentioned. But even on top of that, last time I did a VAERS  report actually was probably close to a month ago,   maybe three weeks ago, and at that time, I was  stratifying the data by age and looking at the   reported deaths. Over 584,000 people of the age  of 50 and over have died from COVID19. And last   time I looked at the VAERS, which is about a month  ago or so, about 5,000 people over the age of 50   had reported, you know, VAERS deaths. And so even  if you were to take that 5,000 and triple it,   you're still 40 times more likely to die from  COVID19 than you are from a vaccine if you're   over the age of 50. People aged 40 to 49, about  20,000 people have died from COVID19, according   to the CDC website. If you look at the VAERS, it's  much lower than that, about 200 people. And if   again triple that number, even after tripling  it, you're 33 times more likely to die from   COVID19 than from a vaccine if you are age 40 to  49. Bring that age group down even further, 18 to   39-year-olds, about 10,000 people have died from  COVID19 in that age range. And if you look at   the VAERS data, it's somewhere around 200, let's  triple it 600 people, you're still 17 times more   likely to die from COVID19 than from a COVID19  vaccine if you are in the age range of 18 to 39.   So, again, at every age group, you're much,  much more likely to die from COVID19 than   you are from a vaccine. We're just directly  taking the VAERS reporting. And as I said,   you can't do that. We don't even know if  those deaths are actually causally linked,   right? It's correlation. I think when you look  at it like that, it makes a lot more sense that   everyone's going to be exposed to  the SARS-CoV-2 virus at some point,   do you want to be vaccinated when  you're exposed to it? I do personally. : Okay. Let me summarize my understanding of  this, and correct me if any of this sounds wrong.   In our country of over 300 million people, there  is a background number, an expected number of   deaths and other medical problems that are going  to happen on a daily basis or an annual basis on   average. And then we have this reporting system,  the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, where   medical professionals are not only encouraged, but  they're actually required to report any medical   problem or death that happens after someone  gets a COVID19 vaccine, whether or not they   think the vaccine caused it or not. So it's  an epidemiologist and other scientists' job to   look at the number of reports that come into the  VAERS and compare that with the background numbers   for each age group and other demographics  and assess, does the number of reports   actually rise above what we would expect for  that age group and other demographics? And   listening to you, Dr. Seheult, it sounds like  for deaths reported from the COVID19 vaccine,   the number of deaths actually falls far below  the background level that we would expect,   which suggests that there's underreporting.  But it also suggests it's very unlikely that   a significant number of deaths are happening  from the COVID19 vaccine. Do I have that right? [Dr. Seheult]: Yep. [Dr. Patrick]: Absolutely. And I think  just to kind of even add to that, you know,   the myocarditis link that we now know about  linked to the mRNA vaccine specifically came   out of the VAERS data, and after the scientists,  epidemiologists analyzed the data, they found   myocarditis was above that background noise.  It was higher. So there was something there.   I've heard so many conspiracy theories that,  you know, the government agencies don't want us   to know about it, don't want us to know about the  adverse effects. Then I just don't understand why   we would know about myocarditis being linked to  the mRNA vaccines, or why we would know about rare   blood clots in some cases with Johnson & Johnson,  very, very rare. If there was some big conspiracy,   why would we know about some of the  potential rare adverse events but not others? : It's always powerful when someone knows  someone who got a COVID19 vaccine and then had   a death afterwards, or, you know, some  new onset of symptoms. So what would you   both say succinctly to someone who says, you  know, ""My parent, or grandparent, or whoever,   got the COVID19 vaccine, and then 3 weeks later,  they died of a heart attack. I think that those   are links""? What would you say to that person?  I'll start with you Dr. Seheult on this one. [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. I mean, this is really what  makes us human beings. We have to put on our   scientific hats when we talk about numbers because  we can't be attached to it, and on the other hand,   we're also human beings, and we live with it. So,  it's hard to do that. I can tell you that when   I'm in the hospital, if I give a blood thinner to  somebody because they have a condition, and they   bleed out and die, and the next person that comes  in with that same condition, I'll have to tell you   as a human being, I'm a little bit less gung-ho  about giving that person a blood thinner even   though it's indicated, and it's the right thing  for that person. In other words, what happened   before doesn't necessarily tell me what's going to  happen again. It's statistics that tells us that.   That's actually one of the fallacies of medicine.  So, when you're making medical decisions,   there's always going to be risks. It's  always going to happen. I can tell you that.   Don't let anybody tell you that we don't do harm  in medicine. We try to do more benefit than harm.   We give aspirin to people who have heart  attacks. We give blood thinners to people   with atrial fibrillation. Are you telling  me that we've never had a situation where   someone has bled on a blood thinner, or someone  has gotten an ulcer from aspirin? It happens,   but we have to look at the  benefits versus the risks. So,   in that situation, I would tell them that, you  know, it's possible that whatever they had could   be linked to the vaccine, that we have to look at  epidemiological studies to see whether that's the   case. And I would understand if they were hesitant  to get the vaccine in that situation. I would   completely understand as a human being because  that's the same struggles that I have as well. But if we want to make policies going forward,  we always have to realize that no matter how many   times you've rolled the dice, and it's come up six  every time, that the next time you roll the dice,   there's still a one in six chance  that it's going to be a six despite   the previous rolls. And unfortunately, that's what  we have to deal with when we're looking at risk   to benefit ratio. Maybe one day in the future  we'll be able to do a better job at predicting   who will benefit and who won't, but  right now we do the best that we can. : Dr. Patrick? [Dr. Patrick]: I think just to add... Sorry. : Yeah. Go ahead. [Dr. Patrick]: Just to add to that, I think, you  know, the fact of the matter is that in the United   States alone, over 177 million people are fully  vaccinated, over a billion people worldwide. And,   you know, as Dr. Seheult point out, people  respond to things differently, to drugs, to   different...the foods that we eat every day, you  know, if we were to give peanuts to 177 million   people in the United States, a good size of people  would have a pretty serious adverse reaction.   Same goes for shellfish. You know, it's a really  big world out there, and there are individual   differences in the way we respond to foods, to  medications, to vaccines but it does not mean...   So, you know, in other words, it's not  a zero risk as Dr. Seheult was saying,   but 100 percent of the population is not  responding that way. It's not because   there's something inherently... For the  most part, you can have a medication that   is dangerous, but, you know, we would know  that by now with 177 million people fully   vaccinated in the United States and over  a billion people worldwide. We would know. [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. And, Kyle, this is all  be...probably a good time to also say that,   you know, the purpose for Dr. Patrick and myself  being on here is really to educate people on   what are the risks and the benefits and the  relative risks so that they can make a decision.   And the reason why we want to arm them with that  information is so that they can make a decision.   We're not for forcing people to get vaccines.  We're not for the purpose of saying it's okay   to be forced to get these vaccines. We're not  really for mandates. We're really here to educate.   And I think that's an important distinction,  but Dr. Patrick can speak for herself. [Dr. Patrick]: Yeah. I 100 percent agree. I would never  want to force anyone to do anything they're scared   of. I certainly wouldn't want to force a parent  to do something to their child that they were   scared of. And I think that the purpose of this  podcast and in general speaking about what the   data shows about vaccines and COVID19 is  to really help people that don't have the   capacity to interpret the scientific literature  to help them have a more...a well-informed,   you know, basically background so that they  can make a good decision on whether or not   they want to get or choose to get vaccinated. And  I think that there are people out there that are   not giving good information for whatever  reason. To be honest, there's a lot to gain from   making sensationalistic claims that something  you think is good for you is actually not. So   we think vaccines are good for us, but they're  not. And you can gain a large following,   and there can be a little bit of a  perverse incentive in some instances   for people that are technically versed in the  scientific literature that may have a degree,   higher education and yet are cherry-picking  and misleading people. That does happen, and   in order to counter that, I think it's important  to put an unbiased approach. Try to, you know,   interpret the data for what it is and  also put that information out there. : Right. Dr. Patrick, this next question  is for you. It's about antibody-dependent   enhancement. Can you explain what that is and if  you think it's relevant or applies to COVID19? [Dr. Patrick]: Sure. So, antibody-dependent  enhancement refers to when your immune system   makes antibodies against a pathogen that is...it's  non-functional. So the antibodies can bind to the   pathogen, for example, in our interest here,  a virus. They can bind to it, but they don't   neutralize the virus. And, in fact, not only  do they not neutralize it, they can activate   other immune cells to become more aggressive  and cause more damage. So, in the end,   the immune system can end up being more  damaging after being exposed to a virus   than if it hadn't previously had those antibodies.  And so when I say previously had those antibodies,   most often I'm referring to vaccine-induced  antibodies. I would say that in the United States,   we really became aware of this phenomenon back  in the 1960s. So this was when the respiratory   syncytial virus vaccine...one of the vaccines  was made, and it was being clinically tested   in infants and toddlers. Half of the infants  and toddlers in the treatment group were given   the vaccine, and the other half were given the  placebo. And then the infants were then, you know,   going to be exposed to the RSV virus, which as all  of us parents know like every child gets, and it's   a respiratory virus. They end up having a cough  that can oftentimes linger for quite a while. So, what was terribly tragic about this vaccine  story is that the infants and toddlers that   had received the RSV vaccine, about 80 percent of them  were hospitalized after being exposed to the RSV   virus naturally versus the infants and toddlers  that had placebo, only 5 percent of those infants and   toddlers actually ended up in the hospital after  being exposed to the RSV vaccine. So this was   terrifying, and, of course, the vaccine never  made it past this original clinical trial. But,   you know, what was happening is antibody-dependent  enhancement wasn't quite known at the time,   but you know, much research has...you know,  decades of research since then have been done,   and it's now known that antibody-dependent  enhancement occurred. So the antibodies that   were generated from the RSV vaccine were binding  to the virus. They were not neutralizing it,   and, in fact, they were making the immune system  worse. They're making the immune system act worse   in response to the virus and become more  damaging. And so what was figured out by   many scientists, and including some of the work  of Dr. Jason McLellan who I mentioned earlier,   is that the antibodies that are generated   that play a major role in antibody-dependent  enhancement are called post-fusion antibodies.   And you probably can guess it. We talked about how  viral proteins go from a...they make a structural   conformation change. They go from a pre-fusion  conformation to a post-fusion conformation.   Well, guess what. Your immune system is making  antibodies to both of those different types of   viral proteins. And so what the brilliant  work of Jason McLellan showed is that   you could basically lock a viral protein into the  pre-fusion complex, and when you then, you know,   use that pre-fusion viral protein in a vaccine,  you don't make post-fusion antibodies because   you don't...your body isn't exposed to that  structure of the viral protein. That's what we   have in all of our U.S. vaccines, the pre-fusion  viral protein, the pre-fusion spike protein. We are not making post-fusion antibodies against  the spike protein, which is so reassuring that   antibody-dependent enhancement is so...it's so  unlikely to happen because we don't make those   antibodies. And, of course, on top of that, what  we would see in the hospitals as I mentioned with   RSVs is that if you take an unvaccinated versus a  vaccinated person and, you know, randomly choose   them at any point, then the vaccinated person  would always have the most severe disease.   They would be the one that are most likely  to be hospitalized compared to unvaccinated.   They would be the most likely to die. And I'm not  talking about, you know, if you have all of your   population vaccinated. Well, of course, you're  going to end up having some people in the   hospital that have been vaccinated. I'm talking  about comparing the unvaccinated to vaccinated.   What you would see is that unvaccinated people  would be less likely to have a severe disease, and   that is not what we've seen at any point during  this pandemic at all. So, that's also reassuring. I think a lot of concern for antibody-dependent  enhancement came out of both in vitro studies,   again, those are studies done in cultured  cells in like a petri dish as well as in   vivo studies. These refer to animal studies,  it can be, you know, a rodent or a hamster.   Pick your animal. These studies were done  with the original SARS virus back in 2003   or 2002, what we now call  SARS-CoV-1. When vaccines were made   for that virus and injected into some animals,  they did cause antibody-dependent enhancement.   That was not the case with all studies and all  vaccines for the SARS-CoV-1. So it was sort of an   inconsistent data. But that's really what  started the initial concern. I myself was   concerned. I was reading this data, and I thought,  ""Oh, geez, well, that's scary."" So, at the time,   I didn't know anything about the post-fusion  antibodies that were involved in that and how,   you know, Dr. Jason McLellan and his collaborators  had figured out a way to bypass that,   to lock that viral protein in the pre-fusion  complex so we don't make those antibodies.   So that is really...at the end of the day gives  me a lot of peace of mind that antibody-dependent   enhancement is not likely to ever happen with  our current vaccines in the United States. : Dr. Seheult, anything to add to that? [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. As Dr. Patrick was saying, if  we look at Israel, which has been vaccinating with   the Pfizer vaccine the longest out of any of the  countries on the planet, and we look here at the   Delta variant, which is what we're interested  in, we really need to make sure that we're   concentrating on the Delta variant because that's  the current variant here in the United States,   there was a study that was released. And  you can see here on the graph we've got   red as those who are unvaccinated in Israel,  and green, those who are fully vaccinated in   Israel. And you can see here that over the months  of July and August, which were just pure Delta   at the time, clearly, you can see that  it was the unvaccinated that were having   the most severe cases. And that would not be the  case if we had antibody-dependent enhancement with   the Delta variant. That's clearly not the case. If  you break it down in the next graph even by age,   you'll see that the same relationship occurs with  age. But again, in each of these age categories,   if you age stratify them, you will see  that is the unvaccinated in these that are   leading the severe cases. So this goes against the  grain of what you may hear that Israel is telling   us that the Pfizer vaccine is just breaking  down, it's useless, it's not working. That's   just totally not the case in terms of preventing  severe cases, which is an important endpoint. : Dr. Seheult, this next question's  for you, and it's about the vaccines and   human fertility. There's an idea that's been  floating around that the COVID19 vaccines   somehow impact human fertility.  What are your thoughts on that? [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. So it's come from many  places. One place in particular was this idea   that the antibodies made against the vaccine  would crossreact with proteins in the placenta.   So, let's go back and look at some of the data  to see if actually this is happening or not.   And you can see here I've got a table of the phase  three trials in the four different major vaccines   that are available. We have Pfizer,  Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Janssen,   which is the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. So, in the  phase three trials, one of the specific exclusions   for entering into the trial was the fact that you  might be pregnant. So those were excluded, but,   of course, you know, accidents happen. And so what  we have here is a number of subjects in the phase   three trials that became pregnant after enrolling  in the study. And so while these aren't huge   numbers, they just sort of give us a little bit  of an insight. What you can see here is you've got   the control group on the left, the vaccinated  group on the right, and in all of these cases,   the amount in the vaccinated group and the control  group were the same. So if you look in the Pfizer   vaccine, we had 12 pregnancies that occurred in  the control group, 11 in the vaccinated group.   We had seven pregnancies in the control group in  Moderna and six. We had 9 in AstraZeneca and 12.   Four in the Johnson & Johnson, and four in the  vaccinated group. So, in terms of miscarriages,   that was also looked at, and as you can see there,  there was no statistical significant difference   between either pregnancies or miscarriages  at least in the phase three trials. Well,   that's not where we have to leave  it because we've looked at this now   after the marketing, of course, so post-marketing,  and there was a very good trial data that was   published in the ""New England Journal of  Medicine"" entitled ""Preliminary Findings of   Messenger RNA COVID19 Vaccine Safety in Pregnant  Persons."" And what they looked at was a number of   areas. They looked at pregnancy loss, spontaneous  abortions, stillbirth, neonatal outcomes, preterm   births, small size for gestational age, congenital  abnormalities, and even neonatal death. And they   compared the rates of people who have gotten the  vaccine and were pregnant to the registry, so the   V-safe pregnancy registry data, to see...which  is what they got the data from and compared it   to the published incidents of these occurrences.  And what they found in every one of these cases   is that there was no statistical significant  difference in terms of what they saw in   the pregnancy data versus what they  should see in the regular population. Finally, what I would say from my aspect or  from my standpoint is to direct you to Dr.   Viki Male who we've had here on MedCram and has a  Twitter account who's actually updating this. She   is a reproductive immunologist that has found it  her duty to always constantly being updated in   terms of data in terms of not just pregnancy, but  also breastfeeding, in terms of getting pregnant,   in terms of all of those risk factors. And I  would highly recommend that you check her out   on Twitter. But I'll be interested  to hear what Dr. Patrick has to say. [Dr. Seheult]: I'm just sort of adding on to  the ""New England Journal of Medicine"" paper   that you just referred to. There was a follow-up  study. It's still a pre-print to my knowledge.   And this study was done in around 2,500 people,  and they were women specifically. They were given   a COVID19 vaccine before 20 weeks of pregnancy,  and much like you mentioned with the study in the   ""New England Journal of Medicine,"" the miscarriage  rate was on the low...within the normal range,   and it was actually on the low end. So it was  about 12.8 percent of miscarriages that occurred, and   the normal range is between 12.5 percent to 18.7 percent. So,  again, it was on the low end of the normal range. There was another study that was published  last June, and it was in the American Society   for Reproductive Medicine. And that study  found that neither having...previously   had a SARS-CoV-2 infection or having had a  COVID19 vaccine affected embryo implantation. So,   there was no effect on the ability of the embryo  to implant into the uterus. On top of that,   there was a very small study looking at fertility  in men, and this study found that there was no   effect of COVID19 vaccines on any of the normal  sperm parameters that are measured like motility,   etc. Like there was no  effect on that. So, I think,   generally speaking, it seems as all  the data so far points to no effect   of COVID19 vaccines on...no real, you know,  large effect of COVID19 vaccines on fertility. : Okay. Dr. Patrick, this next question  is for you. This is in your wheelhouse,   and it's about the mRNA vaccine specifically.   And since this is for a lot of people new  technology, technology they haven't heard about,   and there are rumors that this is somehow gene  therapy, and it's going to be impacting our own   DNA within ourselves, can you speak to that,  and what are your thoughts about those rumors? [Dr. Patrick]: Well, sure. I think it's  understandable for most people to be a little   concerned because they've never heard of this  mRNA technology. The word RNA is in it. It's just   overwhelming in a sense. And, I think, as I  mentioned earlier when I was talking about...you   know, from a thousand foot high...mile high, you  know, viewpoint, how these mRNA vaccines work,   and how there's, you know, a sequence of the  messenger RNA inside of a lipid nanoparticle   and along with some other factors that essentially  when that lipid nanoparticle with the mRNA gets   inside of your cells, your cells themselves, our  ribosomes translate that mRNA into actual protein.   And so really, it's more accurate to be a protein  making technology in a way. But nonetheless,   there's been a lot of fear that mRNA vaccines are  gene therapy that are altering our DNA. And so to   understand that, you need to understand...I mean,  I think first and foremost, if someone says that   to you, you might want to ask them, ""Where inside  the cell does DNA reside?"" And if they don't know   the answer to that question, then they probably  don't understand what they're saying. So our DNA   resides in a part of our cell called the nucleus.  It's inside of a nucleus. Things don't just freely   pass into the nucleus of the cell. In order to  get inside of the nucleus of the cell, you have   to have what's called a nuclear localization  sequence. This is a very specific sequence   that allows something to get inside of the  nucleus. And so there's no nuclear localization   sequence anywhere in this mRNA, anywhere, you  know, inside of the lipid nanoparticle. It's   not present. It's not there. There's no way for  it to get inside of the nucleus of the cell. If   somehow it did somehow miraculously get inside  of the nucleus of our cell where our DNA resides,   in order for it to alter our DNA, the mRNA would  first have to become DNA. And in order for that to   happen, you would need an enzyme called reverse  transcriptase. There's no reverse transcriptase   inside of our nucleus, inside of the, you  know, lipid nanoparticle with our mRNA. It's   not present. So, that is not likely to happen.  But if all those things were to happen somehow,   then in order for the DNA...so if you somehow  got inside the nucleus, turn the mRNA into DNA,   and then in order for it to alter our DNA,  you'd have to have something called an   integrase enzyme, it would have to integrate  into our DNA to get in there to change it.   And again, no integrase enzyme present  there. It's not going to happen. So, the chances of the mRNA  vaccines actually changing our DNA   are so small. I mean, it would just take  some sort of grand conspiracy where,   you know, we're somehow getting these enzymes into  this mRNA, and it's doing all this stuff. I mean,   like it's just not going to happen.  It's not biologically plausible. : Dr. Seheult, anything to add to that? [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. I mean, the central dogma  of molecular biology is that DNA goes to RNA,   RNA goes to protein. And what we're doing with the  vaccine is we're simply instructing the ribosomes,   which reside in the outer portion of the cell,  to make the protein. This, by the way, is exactly   what the virus does. And so if you're a little  bit freaked out or creeped out by the fact that   your cell machinery is being taken over to  make something that it shouldn't be making,   well, let me introduce you to COVID19  because that's exactly what's happening   in the viral infection. And instead  of it happening just in one or two   cells, it's happening in millions of cells. In  fact, there's billions to trillions of copies   of the virus that's being made in one individual,  and it goes all throughout the body. So,   what's happening here with the vaccine is that  it's simply using the ribosomes to make proteins.   There's no aspect of the messenger RNA vaccines  that do anything with the nucleus. And it's the   nucleus that holds the DNA, and that's where your  genome is. So, that's basically it in a nutshell. [Dr. Patrick]: Well, just to add  to that, Dr. Seheult, you know,   speaking of viruses and what viruses do, we know  some viruses actually can change back into DNA   and affect our DNA. So, HIV is one,  some of the herpes viruses as well.   If there's anything to be worried about changing  our DNA, it's actually viruses themselves. [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. : Dr. Seheult, working in the ICU, I know  you've been following any potential treatment for   COVID19 very closely throughout the pandemic, and  you've featured a number of potentially promising   treatments in your COVID19 update videos. And I  want to ask your thoughts on this idea that, you   know, viable treatments currently exist or viable  options exist if one were to get COVID19 or even   potentially to prevent them from getting COVID19,  and therefore they don't need the vaccine because   they can just treat it effectively if they  get it. What are your thoughts on that? [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. So that's a very interesting  philosophy. I follow the philosophy of the Swiss   cheese model. Let me explain what that is a little  bit. Imagine you've got a block of Swiss cheese,   and you've sliced it up all throughout. And if you  were to pull out one of those slices, you would   see that there may be some Swiss cheese holes  in there, and each slice would have the holes   in different places. Maybe some slices would have  more holes than other slices. Maybe some slices   would have very little holes. Maybe others have  a lot of holes. But the bottom line is, is that   the more slices of Swiss cheese you put in there,  the less likely you're going to be able to find   a hole that's going to get through all of those  slices. And that's kind of the general principle   here that we see with the Swiss cheese model of  making sure that we have the best protection we   have to avoid the outcomes that we don't want to  have. Let me put it in a different perspective.   In the operating room, we want to make sure  that we have no post-operative infections,   and we have a lot of layers that we put into  that. For instance, the surgeon wears a mask.   They sterilize the instruments. They  put a solution, a sterilizing solution   over the area of the skin that they're going to  make the incision. I mean, this goes on and on,   positive pressure ventilation in the room, a scrub  nurse, adjusting the humidity in the room just   right, adjusting the temperature in the room just  right. So we don't say that because sterilizing   the equipment works, then therefore the mask  doesn't work, or say the fact that we have to   put sterilization solution on the skin that  therefore we don't have to humidify the room.   That's foreign to medical thinking. I mean, if  we even think about it in the general practice,   right, we do crash tests on vehicles, not  because we don't think seat belts work.   We don't put airbags into vehicles because we  don't think crashed...I mean, what we're doing   is we're doing multiple layers because the more  layers we have, the better protection we're going   to have in the end to avoid the undesired outcome  at the end. So, to hear this about saying that   people are getting vaccinated, but because  we're making everyone wear masks, that must   mean that the vaccines don't work. Completely,  I'm lost on that. That's not the way we think   in medicine. We try to avoid these things. And so  the Swiss cheese model is how we think about this. So one of the things that's come up is the idea of   ivermectin. Ivermectin is this medication that  was initially studied. This came out in June   of 2020. And what they found was that in high  enough concentrations in vitro in a test tube,   when they went to something  called 5 micromolar concentration,   they were able to completely shut down and reduce  by about 5,000-fold the ability of the SARS-CoV-2   virus to reproduce. And so obviously, there was a  lot of excitement because perhaps we might be able   to use a repurposed medication like ivermectin,  which has been around for years and is used as an   anti-parasitic or anthelmintic medication,  especially in South America and Africa.   Perhaps this could be used to treat COVID19. And  so this paper, which was an in vitro paper looking   at 5 micromolar concentration that was required to  shut down, was one of the things that were looked   at. The problem was is that when you look at the  actual dosing of ivermectin in a human being,   you only get about 0.28 micromolar. So that's  a number of orders of magnitude, if you will,   reduced than the concentration that you would  need to have in the cell to get that. And so this   paper here that was published in the ""British  Journal of Clinical Pharmacology"" said that   ""The free plasma concentration of ivermectin  would need to be 250 times lower,"" was actually   250 times lower than the concentration required  to reduce viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 in   vitro. And so that was one of the things. But  again, this is all in vitro, and so we look at   actual randomized controlled data and  meta-analyses. And there was a meta-analysis that   came out in June of 2021 titled ""Ivermectin for  Prevention and Treatment of COVID19 Infection:   A Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, and  Trial Sequential Analysis to Inform Clinical   Guidelines."" And what they did was they looked at  a number of different studies, up to 25 different   studies that were...some of them were randomized,  some of them were not as well randomized. Some of   them had bias. And they analyzed all of those  things, and they came up with the conclusion   that there was moderate certainty of  evidence that there was a reduction   in death compared with no ivermectin. But the  rest of the conclusions had a very low certainty   evidence. Now, this meta-analysis included  a randomized controlled trial that was later   retracted because there was basically fraud going  on in the study. Although that hasn't been fully   investigated yet, but it seems as though there  were some problems in that study. The authors   of the meta-analysis say that it wouldn't have  changed the overall conclusion, but you can kind   of see that there are some questions. And a lot of  these studies were done in patients that were in   basically outside of the United States. And why  would that be an issue? If you think about this,   ivermectin is a medication that kills off  parasites. And if you look at some of the data,   for instance, in Egypt, and in the Middle  East, South America, the amount of clinically   silent parasitic infections in the population  approaches in some studies 50 percent to 60 percent. So you   can imagine, if you take these patients who  then come down with COVID19, put them in   the hospital, and apply to them large doses of  dexamethasone, which is an immunosuppressant,   it's possible...we don't know for sure, but it's  possible that some of these parasitic infections   may be coming less silent and becoming activated  with the suppression of the immune system.   And so it makes sense that in those types  of situations, that adding ivermectin   may be beneficial, not because it's helping  out COVID19 specifically, but because it's   suppressing these concomitant infections that  are going on. That is a potential possibility. And so, if you're asking about  whether or not ivermectin should be   used in the United States, what you really need is  randomized controlled trials in the United States,   looking at the United States population. And right  now I'm happy to say that there are a number of   studies that are undergoing, not only in the  United States, specifically at Temple University   in Philadelphia, but also there's a trial data  that's looking at McMaster University and also   in Brazil called the Together Trial. And  what they've done is they've actually made   this platform where they can rapidly assess the  efficacy of repurposed medication. So things like   hydroxychloroquine was looked at. That didn't find  any improvements, so they stopped that study. They   looked at lopinavir-ritonavir, and they stopped  that study because there wasn't improvement. They   stopped the metformin study because there wasn't  improvement. But there are two medications that   they're currently looking at. They're looking  at the ivermectin single dose to see if that   is causing any improvements. They've now gone to  three doses to see whether or not they are. There   is some evidence that they're seeing some signal  that may be appropriate, but the one that they're   noticing actually has an even better signal that  they're studying more is fluvoxamine, which is an   antidepressant medication. It has some claims  that it may be an anti-inflammatory medication,   antioxidant. The point is, is that we should be  looking at these medications. It should be done   in a randomized controlled trial under a specific  study platform, and we shouldn't be writing these   things off. So, the question is, is whether or not  we should be requiring the high level of evidence   that we normally would have in a pandemic or not.  And I think that's a reasonable question to have.   But these things do need to be studied.  They do need to be looked at. But realize,   at the end of the day, this is just one slice in  the large slices of cheese. We can't all depend   on that one slice because every slice has holes  in it, and the more slices we have, the better.   And so as part of my philosophy, if there is  something that works, great, that's a slice,   but it doesn't mean that we don't do the other  things that are important because nothing is 100 percent. : Dr. Patrick, what are  your thoughts on this question? [Dr. Patrick]: Well, I do have many  thoughts particularly with the ivermectin   being as good as vaccines statement that is very  sensationalized and I think is doing a lot of harm   because, as Dr. Seheult pointed out, you  know, we should study any type of therapeutic   that is repurposed, anything we know is  safe in humans, and anything that could have   even the slightest positive effect on the  SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID19 illness because   we need everything that we can to fight this. We  need multiple therapeutics. We need vaccines. We   need everything. And so, I think, when you  sensationalize something more than the data   suggests it deserves, then you have a couple  of problems. One, you're misleading people,   and that's a big problem. And two, you're getting  a sort of knee-jerk reaction from researchers,   scientists, from physicians that are going,  ""Whoa, wait a minute. Something feels a little,   you know, off."" And so you kind of put off  those people that otherwise may be more open   to looking at that therapeutic if they otherwise  didn't hear a very sensationalistic claim   like ivermectin is just as good as vaccines  at protecting against COVID19. And so   meta-analysis, Dr. Seheult mentioned a very  popular one that was a systematic review   and did show some conclusions that  were positive generally speaking.   But when you actually go down and look at the  individual studies within that meta-analysis and   other types of analysis that are aggregating  a bunch of data, what you'll often find is a   common set of problems. And these problems are  manifold. One, they include the co-treatments,   and the treatments are very different with  each of these studies. So, for example,   sometimes you'll have ivermectin alone. Sometimes  you'll have ivermectin plus azithromycin.   Sometimes you'll have ivermectin plus some kind  of nose spray. Sometimes you'll have ivermectin   plus vitamin C and zinc and blood thinners and  azithromycin in the kitchen sink basically.   Then you'll compare that to sometimes  placebo, sometimes hydroxychloroquine,   sometimes hydroxychloroquine and  azithromycin, sometimes doxycycline.   There's so many variables here that you can't look  at just one of the variables and say ivermectin   is doing this when you have ivermectin plus  the kitchen sink, or you have ivermectin   plus something else compared to the kitchen  sink or compared to...you know, so there's   a lot of variables that are just being  aggregated together that are very different. The second major problem with a lot of these  studies is that they are small sample sizes, and   so at the end of the day, when you're looking at  a clinical endpoint, for example, hospitalization,   when you have 50 people in a group, you know,  then if 2 people end up in the hospital, so you   have 2 people in the control group end up in the  hospital, but out of the other 50 people, you have   zero end up in the hospital, so let's say in the  ivermectin group because you'll find studies like   this, it's such a low sample size that the risk of  that event happening, the certainty of that event   happening being actually, you know, causal  by that treatment is so low. Like you can't   make a definitive statement about that. And so  what you'll see happening is that more and more   studies will be pulled together so that you now  have larger sample sizes when you pull them all   together, and then your certainty becomes a little  bit better. But then you have to ask yourself,   well, is that really true? When you have such  a low sample size within that individual study,   pulling them together is kind of a statistical  way of manipulating the data in a way saying,   well, look, there's statistical significance when  you pull it all together. I think that's really   important to keep in mind when you're looking  at some of these meta-analysis with ivermectin. And then you also have the clinical  endpoints varying. So you have people looking   at hospitalization. You'll have research  groups looking at deaths. You'll have   research groups looking at viral clearance  time to a negative PCR. And in some cases,   they're all being aggregated together,  and it's like clinical benefit is the   end point. And it's like, well, geez, these  are vastly different clinical endpoints. So,   you really need to be careful when  looking at aggregated data. Certainly,   there's a number of websites out there that  are doing this. And I can tell you that I've   looked at these individual studies, and in many  cases, I mean, it's everything I just mentioned   and worse. It's where you can't even find  the numbers that they're coming up with. But sticking to just the scientific literature,  you know, even that systematic meta-analysis   that Dr. Seheult mentioned, you know, if  you look at all the different studies,   and a lot of them were pre-prints that they  included, the only real consistent finding   that was found, consistent meaning every study  showed it, was basically time to a negative PCR,   in other words, an ivermectin plus the  kitchen sink or ivermectin plus whatever,   it seemed to lead to a faster viral clearance  to some degree. And again, it might be that it   takes ivermectin plus the kitchen sink to do it,  but that ivermectin plays a small role. We don't   really know. And when you take ivermectin plus the  kitchen sink, you can't pinpoint it and say it's   ivermectin doing it. You just can't do that unless  you give the kitchen sink without ivermectin to   the control group. And then you can say, well,  look, they were given the exact other, you know,   array of therapeutics, and they didn't have the  same improvement as the other group with the array   of therapeutic treatments plus the ivermectin.  So, there's a lot of nuance to this. And I think   that at the end of the day, there is a little  bit of a signal. There is something that seems   to be going on with ivermectin, whether or not  it's in combination with all these other things   or by itself. It's unclear. What is clear is that  we definitely do need more data. We need more high   quality data. We need more data from, you know,  states that...or from countries that don't have a   really high background of parasitic disease as Dr.  Seheult pointed out. It's a very big confounding   factor. But also we need to not sensationalize  something and, you know, speak about things that   are not true. Like there's just no evidence  that ivermectin is going to protect you from   infection and from severe disease as well as a  vaccine. There's no evidence of that, and so don't   make that claim. Make the claim for what the data  speaks to. There may be an effect. There may be an   effect particularly on viral clearance. If people  would tone it down and not make these grandiose   claims, there would be a lot more interest  in ivermectin and studying ivermectin. And, you know, the other thing to keep in mind is  that there's been a lot of people that have now   sought out a veterinary form of it because it is  something that in addition to being used in humans   for parasitic diseases and helminths and  also scabies and lice and things like that,   it's also used in like...you know,  people are calling it horse dewormer,   which, you know, it's just...it's not a good idea  to go and get a veterinary type of medication and   try to treat yourself because there's vastly,  you know, different doses involved. I mean,   you know, horses are much larger than humans.  It's very dangerous to do something like that.   And I think people have sort of heard these  sensational claims and sort of taking their   own action trying to get some form of ivermectin,  and really, that could be quite dangerous.   I agree with Dr. Seheult that we should  be studying these repurposed therapeutics.   There is a potential for ivermectin. At  least in my opinion at the very least,   it seems as though it's pretty consistently  involved in speeding up the viral clearance   to some degree. It's not like a huge, huge effect,  but there is an effect, and it's consistent with   pretty much all the studies that I've personally  looked at. So, I think that, you know, we should   really go after that and try to see if  that's real. That's pretty much my thought. : Excellent. And speaking  of those studies that you both   talked about and these meta-analyses, one  argument I've heard for ivermectin is some of   these population-based studies where certain  countries have decided to give ivermectin   on a large scale. And you can understand, you  know, potentially their motivation. They want to   protect their population and prevent COVID19  if they can, and they're going to use whatever   resources they think they have to do that. What  are some problems with these population-based   studies for people who aren't  familiar with what those are? [Dr. Patrick]: So basically, they're known as  ecological studies. They're great to look at.   They're hypothesis generating. You don't rely on  hypothesis generating studies to determine whether   or not somebody gets a medication. So first off,  you know, all the disclaimers, don't take this   as medical advice, talk to your doctor, see if  it's right for you, and don't get your ivermectin   from the feed store are some reasonable advice to  take. But in terms of the studies, what you need   to be able to reach the point where you're able  to prescribe someone something is what the FDA   requires, which is a randomized placebo-controlled  trial that's usually multi-centered,   and it's very large. And that's what you have  to do to be able to say this is the medicine   that's indicated for this condition. And we just  haven't had that yet here in the United States. [Dr. Patrick]: And to sort of add to  that, Dr. Seheult, I mean, you know,   even going back to the original clinical trials  with our mRNA vaccines, there were 75,000 people   originally in that randomized controlled trial  where, you know, half the population was getting   the treatment, which were the vaccines, and  the other half was getting the placebo. And   then on top of that...so that's a large number of  people. The sample sizes with this ivermectin is   a fraction of that, I mean, a fraction. And on  top of that, we now have all this real world data   where we've got billions of people worldwide  who have had a COVID19 vaccine, and they are   protecting from severe disease, and to some degree  they're also protecting against even getting   infected depending on which, you know, vaccine  a person has gotten. So, we know they're   effective. We know from large, large, large  numbers. And to sort of even add on to that,   everything has changed since the  Delta variant. We have had to sort of   start again and look at...aggregate new  data because this is a new variant where   our vaccines are not as effective at preventing  infection. And, you know, the reality is, is   all these meta-analysis and all this data  we just talked about with ivermectin,   this was not when Delta was the dominant variant.  We don't really know what ivermectin even does   with, you know, the Delta variant. I haven't  seen data really showing how ivermectin,   you know, affects Delta variant. So I think  that's also something to consider as well. [Dr. Seheult]: Yeah. That's a great point. And,  you know, FoundMyFitness even more than MedCram,   we've been talking about things that you can do,  things that are easy for you to do like sleep.   We talked about vitamin D. We're not opposed...I  mean, look at our video histories, our respective   video histories, we are all in for trying to take  control of your health care, take control of your   life, and to do this. So let's just take the 3,000  foot level here or the 30,000 foot level. This   vaccine is indicated for this particular virus.  I mean, I'm not naive to believe that this is   the only pandemic that we're ever going to see in  our lifetime. It's not the only illness that we're   ever going to have to deal with. Some of those  other things that we talked about with vitamin D,   with sleep, with exercise, stress reduction,  fresh air, sunlight, these things have enormous   benefits, not just with COVID19, but  every other aspect of our life. And so   again, it's the Swiss cheese model. The  more slices you have in there, the better. [Dr. Patrick]: 100 percent. I mean, the low hanging  fruit is obviously the things that you can do   to improve your lifestyle, making sure your  vitamin D levels are high enough, you know,   trying to be metabolically healthy, you know,  eating the best diet or losing weight if   you're overweight or obese, getting good enough  sleep. All these things are hugely important for   overall health and certainly for immunity. So,  again, thank you for pointing that out because   it really...at the end of the day, there are so  many factors that do need to be optimized as well. : Dr. Patrick, this question's for you,  and it's about transmission. And we know that   the Delta variant has been a game-changer, and  we've seen the efficacy of vaccines drop to some   degree with regards to do they prevent symptomatic  COVID19. And we're also aware that transmission   of the Delta variant may be happening  among...well, is happening among   fully vaccinated people. So, what are  your thoughts on this? Should this   shake people's confidence in  getting a COVID19 vaccine? [Dr. Patrick]: Well, I think people  have...it's always easy to make   generalized statements when you see a little  piece of data coming in, which, by the way,   new data every day, things are changing  constantly, hard to keep up with. I think   people have made this overarching statement  that vaccines do not prevent the transmission   of SARS-CoV-2 virus. In other words, they do not  prevent people from contracting COVID19. And,   I think, to understand why that is not true,  we need to start with the word transmission   because there are two major types of transmission  when we're talking about a viral illness here.   First is called onward transmission,  and this is the type of transmission   that is more at the individual level. So  a person becomes infected with a virus.   They have viral particles in their nose, and, you  know, they're basically shedding viral particles.   And this can be transmitted through aerosols and  large respiratory droplets to other individuals,   right? So this is the transmission of  the virus that most people think about.   But there's also what's called its overall  transmission, and that is the transmission   in an overall population. This is the  population level. So if we have a treatment   or a vaccine that is able to prevent even a  small percentage of people from becoming ill,   then it still reduces overall transmission because  fewer people are actually getting the illness. And so as you mentioned, the Delta variant  has sort of changed everything because, when,   you know, we had the Alpha variant and even the  Beta variant, we know that the vaccines in the   United States were largely effective still  and, you know, in many cases still 90 percent, 95 percent   effective at preventing people from even getting  COVID19 symptomatic and seeking out health   care. We know that in addition, people that did  become...that did get infected with SARS-CoV-2   virus, they actually had fewer viral particles.  They were not transmitting the virus like an   unvaccinated person was. That's all changed with  Delta. Now we have to aggregate new data, see,   you know, what the data shows. And, I think,  I would say that the data shows that in about   July of 2021 is when the Delta variant in the  United States really started to become dominant,   sort of took over. And so there was a large  study that was done out of the Mayo Clinic.   Many states were involved in terms of like the  sample population from many different states in   the United States. And this was like 25,000  people that were vaccinated versus 25,000   people that were unvaccinated. What the  Mayo Clinic study was looking at first was   vaccine efficacy, like the ability to, you  know, prevent people from getting COVID19   and also looked at the efficacy of preventing  hospitalization. So that's also very important. And so when the Delta variant became dominant, it  was clear that efficacy for preventing infection   went down. So people that were fully vaccinated  with the Pfizer vaccine went from an efficacy of   like 88 percent to 93 percent or something like that down  to 41 percent. So, there was still some efficacy.   In other words, you know, 41 percent of people that  were fully vaccinated were still not getting   COVID19, which means that the Pfizer vaccine  still reducing overall transmission. And   on a similar level, the Moderna mRNA vaccine  also had reduced efficacy in terms of   preventing infections, although it wasn't quite  as dramatic. So the Moderna vaccine is about twice   as protective as the Pfizer vaccine in getting  a SARS-CoV-2 infection. So that was about 77 percent   effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. So,  again, overall transmission is reduced because,   you know, a large percent of people  that are fully vaccinated with Moderna   are still not getting even infected. That was good  news. Both vaccines were still quite effective   anywhere from 80 percent to 97 percent effective at  preventing hospitalizations, which is ultimately   the most important thing. As Dr. Seheult pointed  out earlier in this discussion, you don't want   your hospitals overwhelmed with COVID19 patients  because, when your parents have a heart attack,   or if you get in a car accident, or your  child comes down with a severe form of RSV,   you know, or fill in the blank, you're not going  to get the care that you need and you deserve.   So it's good to prevent hospitalizations  because that protects our health care   system from being overwhelmed,  which is important for all of us. The other thing that was found was that...not  with the Mayo Clinic study, but there was another   study, a large study that was done out of the  U.K. and this study showed that this was...the   most interesting thing in my opinion in this  study, this also included AstraZeneca vaccine   because AstraZeneca has largely been used  in some European countries like in the U.K.,   that people that were fully vaccinated  were still...you know, there was still some   efficacy in terms of protecting against, you  know, getting the virus as I just mentioned   with the Mayo Clinic study something similar was  found. But when you looked at peak viral load,   in other words, when the virus is at its peak  for replicating, the peak viral load was similar   in a breakthrough infection from a vaccinated  person versus a unvaccinated person that had   contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus. And so that  sort of caused a media frenzy, you know,   to sort of make this general statement  that vaccines don't prevent transmission.   And it's just not accurate to say that.  For one, they're still preventing overall   transmission as we just discussed. But two, you  need to look at overall viral replication. So,   you know, it's not just peak transmission  that's important. You're transmitting this   virus to other people at many different stages of  being infected. And so that's exactly what this   pre-print study out of Singapore, which was  with the Delta variant showed that while initial   viral loads were similar between a breakthrough  vaccinated case and an unvaccinated person that   had SARS-CoV-2 virus...infected with SARS-CoV-2  virus, those initial viral levels were the   same. If you followed those individuals over  time, the vaccinated people cleared the virus   faster than the unvaccinated. So they actually  had a shorter negative PCR time. If this was true,   you would have the hypothesis that at any given  time, if you were to take a random person out of   the population and sample their viral load, then  you would see vaccinated people at any point in   time should have a smaller viral load because  they're clearing the virus faster. And that's   exactly what this real-time data that's being  aggregated out of the U.K., it's called REACT   Study, that study found that if you were to take  a random sampling of people at any point in time,   vaccinated breakthrough cases, they had  a lower viral load than unvaccinated. So,   I think, with this data, it suggests  that not only do the vaccines still   prevent...sorry, still reduce overall  transmission, they also still reduce onward   transmission. They're still affecting transmission  on multiple levels. And so, I think, that's really   important to keep in mind. In addition to that,  understanding who gets the breakthrough infection.   Why are 41 percent of people vaccinated with Pfizer  still protected from even getting, you know,   SARS-CoV-2 virus? And why are 77 percent of people fully  vaccinated with Moderna not getting infected? There was a big study that came out of Israel  looking at breakthrough infections. Now,   this wasn't necessarily when Delta  was dominant, but I think it still   is important to keep in mind that what's  causing these breakthrough infections.   We don't know exactly everything,  but if you look at this Israel study,   they were looking at health care workers.  And there was about 15,000 of them basically.   These health care workers, they took blood  samples, and they could look at their antibody   levels against...these were vaccinated health care  workers. They could look at their IgG antibodies,   and I'm not sure what other antibodies they looked  at, but they could look at the levels of them and   quantitate them. And then if they came down with  a breakthrough infection, they could sort of use   that data and go, ""Oh, could we predict whether  or not this person came down with a breakthrough   infection based on their antibody levels?"" And  that's exactly what was found. People that had   lower antibody titers were much more likely to  get a breakthrough infection than people that   had higher antibody titers. And there was another  great study that came...it was a Miles Davenport   group, and it published in ""Nature Medicine.""  And he did this mathematical modeling to predict   breakthrough infections. And what he found was  that it seems as though, according to his model,   people need a six-fold higher antibody titer level  to be protected from contracting SARS-CoV-2 virus.   Then they need to be protected from being  hospitalized from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In other   words, you need a much lower antibody level or  titer to prevent yourself from being hospitalized,   but you need a higher level to prevent yourself  from actually contracting the virus itself. [Dr. Seheult]: So what Dr. Patrick has told us  is that there is a difference that you have to   look a little bit deeper. I was able to find  a pre-print of an article that just came out   a couple of weeks ago that looked at the quality  of those viral particles that are shed from those   that have breakthrough infections. So in other  words, is it possible that the shedding of the   virus that comes from unvaccinated are the same  as vaccinated. And what this pre-print showed   very interestingly if you look at this graph,  here we have the amount of viral load being   shed on the X-axis, and on the Y-axis, what they  did was they tried to see what was the chances   of these viral particles of actually growing in a  viral culture, kind of a surrogate to successfully   infecting the next person. What you can see here  is the dark blue are those that are unvaccinated,   and the light blue are those that are vaccinated.  You can clearly see here that at any given viral   load, the vaccinated health care worker in this  study from the Netherlands was shown to have a   less likelihood of infecting somebody based  on viral culture. So, not only do we see with   the vaccinated less breakthrough infections,  and when there are breakthrough infections,   they are cleared faster. But we're also seeing  that the viral particles that come out of   vaccinated people are less likely to infect.  And that's important because there has been   some talk going around that it's the vaccinated  people that are transmitting the virus more   and causing these outbreaks to those that  are unvaccinated, and those are the ones   that are showing up to the hospital. But clearly,  here, the data is showing that is not the fact. [Dr. Patrick]: Oh, just to  add to that, Dr. Seheult,   that is very interesting...that the study  is very interesting because the way that   researchers are measuring, you know,  peak viral load is through real-time PCR,   and real-time PCR can actually be detecting  dead viral particles. That makes a hypothesis   even quite likely that there are some dead viral  particles, which you would even...you'd sort of,   you know, theorize would be true because, if you  do have antibodies against the spike protein, that   your immune system would start to kill or to, you  know, clear the virus that you're being exposed to   since you have some antibodies, you'd think there  would be some effect. So that's very interesting. [Dr. Seheult]: Right. It boils down to the  thing that I've heard that explains this as PCR   is a way of looking...it's kind  of like looking at dead body parts   and assuming that those dead body parts are  alive. All it's looking for is parts of the virus,   and parts of viruses don't infect.  They just make PCR positive. [Dr. Patrick]: Right. Exactly. The question is,  is like how many of those viral particles are   actually even alive. If they were alive, you  would imagine that when you put them in culture   that they would replicate.  So, very interesting study. : Dr. Patrick, I've heard some people  say that the vaccines themselves might be   contributing to putting certain pressures on the  SARS-CoV-2 virus, specifically this idea that the   vaccines can make the virus actually more deadly  or more virulent. What are your thoughts on that? [Dr. Patrick]: I certainly like coming into   hearing these statements, which I've heard  and it's proliferated on many different   areas of the blogosphere and people that...you  know, friends of friends, you know, etc.   My first thought was, well, if this is...we need  to know whether or not this is true because,   if it is, it changes everything in a way,  right? You don't want to make a virus,   you know, more deadly to the unvaccinated. And  that's kind of what the general statement is,   is that vaccines are causing selective pressure  for the virus to mutate into a more virulent form,   which is more dangerous and deadly to the  unvaccinated. Nobody wants that. Like if that   were the case, I mean, all of our children are  unvaccinated. So, you know, as a parent, to me,   I wanted to get to the bottom of this and  understand, is this something to be concerned   about because, if it is, it's a game changer in  my mind. So, as a non-evolutionary biologist,   I went on a path to trying to understand to the  best of my knowledge, you know, the literature and   what the literature out there says on how viruses  evolve and what the selective pressure is and,   you know, what that typically, you know, entails.  And so from all of my reading and understanding,   again, I'm not an evolutionary biologist, to  me, I came out of it with the understanding that   viruses...the selective pressure on viruses  is to evolve to become more transmissible.   They are not under a selection pressure  to become more virulent. In other words,   it's not in their best interest to kill  their host because, if they kill their host,   then their host can't incubate the virus and allow  them to reproduce and infect more people. And so   all the studies that I've read outlined that  there's these factors and that virulence isn't   something that's selected for. It is something  that happens incidentally to transmission. In   other words, it sort of hitchhikes alongside.  So, a virus evolves to become more transmissible,   like that is its major purpose. And in some  cases, if it becomes more transmissible,   sometimes it can also become more virulent. It  can be more, you know, dangerous to its host. So many of the different studies have outlined  that there are factors that limit transmission.   So, if something limits the transmission,  then it's also going to limit the potential   of the virus to become more virulent. And the  factors that limit transmission are, one, physical   constraints. So, the virus infects human cells,  and the human cells then make viral proteins,   and, you know, are basically allowing the virus  to replicate. So, our own cellular machinery,   the ability of our cells to assemble viral  proteins, the ability of ourselves metabolically   to do it quick enough, like there's a limit  to that. Like we can only do that so quickly.   So once that happens, then, you know, a virus has  sort of reached its peak transmissibility in a way   because our cells physically can't do it quicker  than it's already doing it, if that makes sense.   And so with the Delta variant right now, we  may be at a peak transmissible...you know,   we may be at the point where our cells can't  assemble all the viral proteins quick enough   for it to become even more transmissible. We  don't know. Maybe we're not there yet, but   maybe we are. We have no idea. It's definitely a  much more transmissible variant. So that's the one   thing that limits the ability of a virus to become  more virulent is the limitation on transmission. The other thing is host mortality. If a virus  is killing the host within a certain time frame   before transmission ends, then, you know, you  start to like not be able to transmit the virus   more, and you're not going to have more variants  crop up because the host is dying. And so this   is something people have been very concerned  about with vaccines because the argument is that   vaccines are preventing more...they're preventing  people from dying from COVID19, and therefore,   they're going to allow the virus to have a chance  to mutate into something that is more virulent.   Again, it has to mutate into something that's more  transmissible, virulent hitchhikers alongside of   that. But if you look at the deaths in COVID19,  people that are unvaccinated, or just generally   speaking, people usually die much later than the  transmission phase. They die, you know, days and   days and days after actually becoming infected  with SARS-CoV-2. And so the transmission phase   is well over before people are even dying. The  reality is, is that people that are unvaccinated   have...they're creating these mutations and  allowing variants to evolve even at a greater rate   because, not only are they, you know, able to do  it even before they potentially succumb to death,   but, you know, the fact that we just talked about  overall transmission reduced by vaccine, so,   people that are vaccinated are  less likely to even get infected,   and we talked about onward transmission reduced,  in other words, people are clearing the virus   faster that are vaccinated than unvaccinated.  In every sense, people that are unvaccinated,   there's more chances for the virus to replicate  and to potentially mutate and form another variant   that could become more transmissible,  and that's potentially more virulent. Now, people are also conflating the vaccine  escaped immunity. That is a completely different   thing. That is not something that is relevant  to virulence, if you look at the large body of   scientific literature covering this topic. I  shouldn't say large body. It's actually quite   limited. So there's no example of human  vaccines causing a more virulent strain.   There are examples of vaccine escape. So in other  words, variants crop up that are no longer...that   can evade the antibodies produced by vaccines.  That's a different thing. That isn't something   that's more virulent. That's something that's  going to affect people that are vaccinated   because now they're going to be more likely to  be infected, and their vaccine is less effective.   That's a very different thing than what we're  talking about, which is the evolution, the   selective pressure on viruses to transmit, become  more transmissible. And that is the selective   pressure that exists, not virulence. Virulence  hitchhikes alongside the transmission aspect of   why viruses, you know, mutate basically in the  selective pressure that's on them to do that. : Dr. Seheult, I want to hear your thoughts  on that. And also Dr. Patrick mentioned how,   you know, with Delta variant and other variants,   and in the past with vaccines, how  sometimes a variant can crop up that escapes   vaccine antibodies. Can you talk a little about  the other big aspect of the immune system,   and that's the T cell response, and how that can  still offer us a lot of protection potentially? [Dr. Seheult]: Sure. Yeah. So first of  all, in order for you to have variants,   you have to have replication because it's the  errors in replication that cause variance.   And so the only way you can have  replication is if you have viruses   in hosts. So, if you look at the examples that  we have, whether it's Alpha, Beta Gamma, Delta,   most of these variants, if not all of them, came  from populations that were not vaccinated. Now,   India's done a great job at producing vaccines,  and they're well on their way to vaccinating   their population, fortunately. But  the Delta variant came out early on   when they were not having a lot of people  vaccinated. Same thing with the South African   variant, and the P1 that came out of Brazil. This  was during a time where there was not vaccinated.   If it was vaccination that caused variance, then  we should be seeing variants coming out of Israel,   in the United States. These are probably the two  most vaccinated countries in the world. And that's   just certainly not the case. Now, in terms of  B cell, or I should say antibodies, antibodies   are very important when it comes to neutralizing a  virus that is outside of your cells predominantly.   So, neutralizing it before they become inside  your cells, before they infect the cells,   that's very, very important. But there's  a whole another aspect to the immunity   that help in terms of hospitalization,  in terms of those memory T cells,   and that is what we just mentioned was the T  cells, the cytotoxic T cells and the rest of it. What's interesting that I found about  T cells is that when they reproduce,   they also reproduce in a way where they put  errors in there so that as the virus may mutate,   there seems to be some evidence that the T  cell response may be able to anticipate and   mutate along with it. Now, that's not 100 percent science  yet, but there seems to be some evidence of that   at least in the research articles that I've read.  And if you look at what's happening right now with   the Delta variant in Israel, in the United States,  we see a reduction in the ability of the vaccines   to reduce transmission, right? So with the Delta  variant, instead of the 80 percent to 90 percent that we enjoyed   early on in the pandemic, it's been knocked down  somewhat. But we really haven't seen an erosion   to that extent in prevention of hospitalization  and severe disease. That has more to do with T   cell responses in cytotoxic because by this point,  the virus is inside the body already inside the   cells. And antibodies have very limited ability  to take care of those types of situations. So,   the immune system is very complex, and I  think we need to just sort of look back and   always couple our in vitro hypotheses with  real-world data. And so far the real-world data   is still holding up in terms of  prevention of severe disease. And I'd also like to add, there's been some  sort of a false equivalence, if you will,   that is made in terms of what we know that  overuse of antibiotics can cause bacterial   resistance to those antibiotics. And there's  no question about that. That's a whole other   topic of discussion, the overuse of antibiotics  in humans and in animals especially. And that   gives rise to these superbugs that emerge that are  no longer susceptible to the antibiotics that we   have, but that's a different situation. That's  where the antibiotics that are being used are   basically selectively killing out  all of these susceptible bacteria   and only leaving those that are resistant. So in  other words, the resistant bacteria already exist,   but we're knocking out the bacteria that are  susceptible and allowing the resistant forms   to produce. That's very different than what  we're talking about with vaccines because,   in the terms of vaccines and viruses, the  resistant viruses don't exist. What allows them to   be created is the ability to replicate. Okay. And  that's very different with bacteria. In bacteria,   very few resistant bacteria are occurring  because they're being allowed to replicate.   The only way that they can become resistant  is if they acquire DNA that gives them,   they're called plasmids or vectors that allow  antibiotic resistance to then be incorporated in   their DNA. That's not the case with viruses.  Viruses and bacteria are very different. : Dr. Seheult, I think the most  common reason I've heard for people   choosing not to get the vaccine is that they  feel like the process may have been rushed,   that there isn't enough long-term data yet. They  may be willing to get the vaccine at some point,   but they will, you know, look at the  historical timelines for vaccines   and realize that it takes often 10 years, you  know, maybe the average for a vaccine to actually   be manufactured and go through the  authorization and approval process.   What are your thoughts about this sentiment? And,  you know, do you feel like the vaccine was rushed?   Do you feel like we can trust the process in  this case with this particular technology? [Dr. Seheult]: That's a great question. So there's  no question in my mind and anyone else's that this   process was accelerated. No question about it.  The question is, is was the quality of the product   compromised by the acceleration of the process?  And here you can see on the screen a typical   vaccine timeline. If this was done under normal  situations, we would have started in 2020,   and we wouldn't have had a product until 2034.  And the reason for that is because there is risk   in making these vaccines, but there's also  processes that they have to go through.   So there is the research that has to happen.  Then there's the pre-clinical trials, the bench   top trials, and then phase one, to figure out the  right dose, phase two, to do the small randomized   controlled trials to see if there are problems,  then finally, the big phase three trials,   leading up to building the factories to make  these vaccines, and then the manufacturing,   and then the approval process, and then finally,  the distribution. So what you can see in the   lower portion of that screen is everything got  compressed. Now, notice that nothing got skipped.   So we still had the phase one trials, and the  phase two, and the phase three. Some of these   were being run concomitantly, which means at the  same time. But notice something very interesting.   The factories were being built at the same time  that the phase one and two trials were being done.   Why is that? Why were they able to do that?  Because what the government did by stepping   in and providing them money and resources and  providing those barriers is they're saying, ""Look,   we'll give you the money to build the factories,""  realizing that if these phase one, two,   and three trials are a bust, you're  not going to be held liable for the   amount of money that you've spent in building  these factories that aren't going to do anything.   And so that was one of the major barriers to  getting this thing done was the risk that the   companies would not normally be willing to take  on these vaccines. But the government was saying,   ""We don't want you to take that risk. We  want you to get those things started."" Now, this sort of thing has happened  before. If we go back to World War II,   and we talk about the Nazis and World War II  and the tremendous machinery that they had   and the amazing amount of the war machine of  the Nazis, what happened was Franklin Delano   Roosevelt sat down with a guy by the name of  William Knudsen, who was basically the most   powerful man in terms of...in Detroit and the auto  manufacturing process. And he basically offered   him a salary of $1 to basically coordinate the  infrastructure plan to build the war machine that   would be able to go against Hitler. This is what  William Knudsen, the president of General Motors,   said in a meeting of the executives.  Basically, the first half of 1941 is crucial.   He said, ""Gentlemen, we must outbuild Hitler,""  and that's exactly what he did. There was a point   in time in Detroit where they were at the Ford  manufacturing plant putting out a B-24 Liberator,   which is a large plane with four engines, at the  rate of one per hour. That was because the entire   infrastructure of the United  States was turned towards one goal,   and that was defeating Hitler in World War II. And  the same thing happened with the implementation   of the project of coming forth with a vaccine.  Now, some of the vaccine companies took advantage   of the funds. Others did not. But the bottom line  is, is that those barriers that created a lag   time because of risk, because of money, those  sorts of things were completely eliminated,   and they were able to speed up the production  of the vaccine. Now, the phase one trial still   happened. The animal studies still happened. No,  the animals did not die in the production. In   fact, it was because the animals did so well that  they were able to go to phase one, two, and three. The other aspect of this that is tossed  around is that this is new technology.   Now, I know that Dr. Patrick knows more  about the technology in terms of the history,   but I will just give you a very short timeline.  Back in the 1990s, we injected for the first time   mRNA into the muscle cells of a mouse, for the  very first time. By 2005, we had modified the   nucleotides, which are the signaling in that  mRNA vaccine to get around early destruction.   So the problem early on was that we couldn't  allow these messenger RNA molecules to last   long enough to make the protein product.  The problem wasn't that they lasted forever.   It was that they didn't last long enough, but they  were able to finally figure out how to do that.   And by 2013, they started working on medications  that were based on mRNA. And then finally,   we have the vaccines. Here is a paper that  was published in 1990, so over 30 years ago,   that was for the first time showing that this  technology actually had viability. And so this   technology is not new. It's been around for 30  years, and it's been looked at. And with that,   I'll turn it over to Dr. Patrick. I  think she has some more details on this. [Dr. Patrick]: Yes. I do. You know, in  addition to this technology not being   new in the sense that everyone...most people think  this is the first time it's actually been used   in humans, just to kind of speak to your point  about the acceleration of the process of getting   this vaccine into people, and you were talking  about all the money that's available for building   the factories, I think another really important  thing to point out is the difference between   this vaccine and our history of vaccines in  terms of how we make them. For the mRNA vaccines,   all you need is the sequence. That's all you need  to make it. And it's so easy to make in mass,   mass, mass quantities versus having to actually  grow vaccine in some kind of animal cell type. And   like, I mean, you're limited. There's a limitation  in how much of it you can make, physically,   limitation. So, just going back to the actual  history of mRNA vaccines and this mRNA technology   in humans. In 2001, we have the first clinical  trial of this mRNA technology that was made. It   was mRNA-induced dendritic cells. In 2009, we have  another clinical trial where mRNA was used as a   therapeutic. In 2014, there's the first mRNA  vaccine in terms of immunotherapy for cancer, so   trying to treat cancer with mRNA vaccines. These  are all in humans. In 2017, there were 2 clinical   trials, one for mRNA-based vaccine for influenza,  and another one for mRNA technology used to treat   patients with heart...basically had  heart failure, and they were injecting   mRNA vaccines into their heart. So, we've got a  lot of clinical data dating back to 2001 where   we've been using this technology in humans, you  know. So this is not the new technology that   people in their minds they think that this is the  first time it's ever been used in humans and how   scary that is. It dates back to decades, well, you  know, a couple of decades being used in humans. To kind of add to that, I really...moving forward,  it's amazing how this field has exploded in terms   of all the clinical trials now being started  and planned for this mRNA technology. There is   so much interest, and there's a lot of funding  now to understand this technology as a therapeutic   for infectious diseases in addition to the  SARS-CoV-2 virus for other ones. There are   now clinical studies that are now starting to look  at this technology to treat genetic disorders like   muscular dystrophy where there's no treatment  that exists. Can you imagine being the parent   of a son that has muscular dystrophy and knowing  there is no treatment and having to watch your son   degenerate and die? I mean, we may see a  treatment for muscular dystrophy in our   lifetime because of this. It's accelerated and  exploded this clinical arena where now we're   seeing tons and tons of trials for mRNA vaccines  as immunotherapy for cancers where they're going   to be injecting this mRNA technology into a  variety of different types of solid tumors.   And again, we may very well in our lifetime now  see a cure for different types of solid tumors.   Solid tumors are the type of cancers that are  hardest to treat with chemotherapy because   they often grow far away from blood vessels.  And so blood vessels, you need them to be close   to the cancer site because that's how the  chemotherapeutic gets, you know, delivered   to the tumor site. And so you'll get these tumors  growing far away from them. They're what's called   hypoxic. They're growing far away from blood  vessels. And so it's one of the reasons why many   different solid tumors are resistant to many types  of chemotherapeutic treatments. So imagine being   able to directly inject the tumor with this mRNA  technology where we're going to, you know, test a   variety of different immune generating, you know,  molecules and things that are going to activate   the immune system to go right directly to that  tumor and kill it. It's a very exciting time, and   I understand that people are scared because it's  new to them. And it's always scary when something,   you know, is new, and there's change. But there's  a bright side, and that bright side is, is that   science is moving forward at an accelerated rate.  And we are witnessing something that would have   not have happened otherwise without this terrible  pandemic that obviously a lot of bad has come out   of. But, you know, to try to see the silver lining  here, the good out of it is that the science   has really catapulted forward, and there's some  exciting stuff going on with the mRNA technology. : Thank you for that. Definitely  good to have some silver linings right now.   And before we sign off, any items  that we didn't cover that you want to? [Dr. Seheult]: I was just going to say  this, Kyle, is to keep in mind this   image in your mind that I've got here on the  screen, and that is the U.K.'s second wave,   which was non-Delta, and then the third  wave, which was Delta. I want the audience   to sort of keep this in mind when it comes to  the vaccines and what they can potentially do.   In the second wave, which is in red, the left  half of that shows how quickly the infections   rose as time went on. And concomitantly, on the  other side of it, on the right side, you can see   how quickly deaths unfortunately also  rose in that second wave. And that's   without the vaccine. That's without the vaccines  that we currently have now. And then the third   wave came, which was Delta wave, and what  you can see there, which is a stark departure   from the wave on the left, is that while you  have the increasing amount of infections,   which are basically positive PCRs as we've talked  about, what's missing there from that is the   increased amount of deaths in that third wave. And  that is with the vaccine, and that's something to   keep in mind that I really want to make sure  the audience understands is when you hear   news stories talking about the decreased  effectiveness of the vaccine, make sure that   you understand that they're talking about their  ability to prevent infections. What they're not   talking about at least up to this point  in time and with the Delta variant   is that we're still holding on its ability  to prevent hospitalizations and deaths. Now, there is some data  that is coming out of Israel   where at least some experts believe that that  ability to hold may be waning in the most   elderly and in those that have been vaccinated  the longest. And that's where we're talking   about booster shots and things of that nature.  I think that data as we're talking right now   at the beginning of September is still needing to  be settled. The FDA is still looking at that and   deciding whether or not booster shots are  going to be offered and to whom and when.   And so we don't have the science on  that settled as yet. But I still want to   at least make sure that people understand, that's  an issue for people that have been vaccinated for   six to eight months already. That's not an issue  for those that have not yet been vaccinated   and are concerned about where the Delta variant is  especially in those states right now where Delta   is raging. So, I just wanted to leave that as a  general point and as really the motivation for   me and I'm sure for many others in making these  kinds of videos so people can understand that. : Well, thank you both so much for your time  and all the information today and throughout this   pandemic. Thank you for empowering people to  better understand the data and the science of   this pandemic and also ways that they can optimize  their own health and immunity.

I  know she appeared on the Bill Maher program   and they got to talking, I guess, about elements  of medical, medical elements, medical things. And   Roseanne Barr tells Bill Maher the Covid vaccine  is killing everyone. The billionaires want to kill   us and the Covid vaccine is killing everyone.  We're going to fact check this. And I want to   make clear for all of the different platforms  that are going to limit me because I'm spreading   anti-vax propaganda. I'm about to debunk, debunk,  debunk, anti-vax propaganda. Okay. Let's listen   to what Roseanne Barr had to say.  You're all broke.   I'm pro Monsanto and all that crazy.  So not even those are you and me.   You say it drives me berserk.  I have a You can   attack me in many things.  No, I attack you. I'm just saying.   I'm just. Yes, I know. But I.  Want to.   Straighten you out on something.  Strange, man.   Yes.  Because you don't even   know. Okay? You work for me, and.  I'm seventh.   Day.  If I want.   To put your hand down  right there, do it. No. Put your hand.   There. What are you going to do?  I'm going to cover it with mine.   And I'm going to tell you that I love you.  Wow. What a 180 that was.   I love you and I don't want to  hurt you. I love your hand there. I want mine.   Oh, that's right. Right.  I love you. And I want to   bring everybody together to see they're getting  screwed and robbed. Okay. Now, are we on the   same page with that? Yeah. Okay, now let's talk.  All right. I have a lot of videotape,   and if I wanted to go into the archive, I could  send you where I pretty much alone in media was   questioning the pharmaceutical industry and  think people like Monsanto. I was the early   part of the century with the growers,  right? Yeah. So I'm not the guy to hit   that for you. And you're for Monsanto.  I was the vaccine shit.   And I've been way  out on a limb on that one too.   You were wrong.  I don't know   which one. I don't know what your stance on  vaccines is. Why don't you tell me yours and   I'll tell you mine and we'll see who's wrong.  They're trying to kill us. They're trying to.   Yeah. That's why  they're giving us the vaccine.   I don't think they're trying.  Well, they are killing us.   Well, it's much more.  Complicated than us.   Who hates us? The  pharmaceutical industry? No, actually.   The crazy psychopath billionaires.  Oh, boy. They hate the regular people.   Okay, Bernie. So. But you're  not one of the regular people. Look at   you. You're a southern belle. You're like in  a Tennessee Williams play. And you're the.   I've always depended  on the kindness of strangers.   All right. They're killing us. They are  killing us. The vaccine is killing us. We really   need to take this head on, because this. This  will not go away. This talking point will not   go away. Has even a single person died from the  Covid vaccine? I'm open to the possibility that   someone has in the sense that when millions and  millions and millions and hundreds of millions,   maybe billions of people get a vaccine, there are  different adverse reactions. And could someone die   from an adverse reaction? Sure. But I've been  looking everywhere for instances where someone   died from the Covid vaccine. I just haven't found  a single instance. Right. We start looking into   the data. There have been rare cases of serious  side effects. The JNJ vaccine was associated with   a rare blood clotting disorder, specifically women  under 50. The AstraZeneca vaccine wasn't even used   in the United States associated with those issues.  But have any actual deaths been attributed to   it? I wasn't able to find any in terms of more  generally. There's this idea that if you're 80   and you get vaccinated and you die three months  later, that that's a vaccine death. And a lot   of the vaccine deaths reported in the Vaya system  are things like that. But can we attribute even a   single one to the vaccine? I haven't been able  to find a single one with any vaccine. You can   have an anaphylactic reaction and it seems with  the Covid vaccine, it was happening in five out   of every million doses administered. It's a severe  allergic reaction. It can occur after a flu shot   or whatever. From what I've been able to find.  No deaths from anaphylaxis were reported. There   were studies done of other sorts of reactions.  The myocarditis, the pericarditis. Uncomfortable   certainly can be serious. I have been able to  find no evidence that anybody actually died from   it. Now, you might. You might be able to find  something. Hey, here's two people that we know   died from a reaction they had to the vaccine.  Okay. Send it to me and I will look at that.   But Tucker Carlson pulled this as well, saying  the vaccine could be killing thousands, hundreds   of thousands of us. I still have not been able  to find any evidence of that. And importantly,   there have been population studies of large groups  of people. Just here's a group of people the same   age. One group was vaccinated, one wasn't. The  vaccinated group had a lower rate of all cause   death in the period following the vaccine. So I  would love it if someone presented some of the   evidence. Roseanne Barr certainly didn't. Tucker  Carlson certainly didn't when he brought it up.   If someone in the audience has the evidence,  please send it to info at David packman.com.",0.4860167610167611

80,Ph6wsRHMbQo,Are vaccinated people dying from COVID-19?, oh folks dr ashton here she's answering your question let's see doc what we're going to start with first are there cases of vaccinated individuals dying from COVID19. absolutely there are and people need to remember the context the perspective here vaccination against COVID19 or any other infectious disease for that matter is not 100 but think of it like a seatbelt it does as much as you can possibly do to help prevent a death uh than compared to not doing it so we do have data from november and december in this country that people who are unvaccinated were 15 times more likely to die of COVID19. now that was kind of as omicron was just getting over here so that my number might change and we're trying to pin down an absolute risk which is much more difficult to get so if i could say tj if you're unvaccinated your risk of death is one in fill in the blank that number we really don't have yet but absolutely there are cases but i want to be crystal clear they are working to reduce the risk of severe illness and death and it is by far the most important thing we can do to prevent death from covenanting you know we've seen studies that those who the number of people who have died from COVID19 who were vaccinated had so many other risk factors that's right not just one two comorbidities correct so again bottom line vaccines are working all right next question here what can you do doc to help alleviate stress related headaches tension and gastrointestinal issues well i love the fact that this question included gastrointestinal issues because there's something called the brain gut connection or axis and people who are stressed upset nervous can frequently have gastrointestinal issues so it's not just about musculoskeletal tension or headaches the key the root cause try to alleviate the stress find out what is causing you stress so whether that's with meditation or behavioral changes if necessary and these these effects are really bothering someone medication is indicated but you really want to try to target the root cause all right drastic thank you as always folks we thank you for the questions keeping coming to dr ashton on her instagram at dr jay ashton well hey there gma fans robin roberts here thanks for checking out our youtube channel lots of great stuff here so go on click the subscribe button right over right over here to get more of awesome videos and content from gma every day anytime we thank you for watching and we'll see you in the morning on gma,0.5680033416875522

report from the guardian indicates that research credibility is at an all-time low as a rash of fake papers made their way into the academy into prestigious journals of medicine and other categories of science according to the guardian tens of thousands of bogus research papers being published in joural in an international Scandal it's worsening every year scientists have warned medical research is being compromised drug development hindered and promising academic research jeopardized thanks to a global wave of sham science that is sweeping Laboratories and universities the concerns over the veracity of scientific inquiry come as a new study indicates that some concerns about vaccine related injury may not have been all that far-fetched per Fox News the largest covid vaccine study to date by the global vaccine Data Network in New Zealand analyzed 99 million people who received Co vaccinations across eight countries the study found that the vaccine was linked to a slight increase in neurological blood and heart related medical conditions on the note of covid related maladies new Research into long covid indicates that there may be a connection to brain damage and the disorder per science alert analyzing 203 patients hospitalized with COVID19 or its Associated simp symptoms and comparing the results with 60 people without the infection researchers noted elevated levels of four brain injury biomarkers Key signs of biological change in those infected with COVID19 what's more two of those signs of brain injury persisted into the recovery phase suggesting that they continue Even After The COVID19 Infection has gone so there's which I want to start at the top of this well starting just with that that last one you know we when long Co comes up on the show there's often the critique that because of the nature of the symptoms and as you point out the population that disproportionately seems to be complaining about long covid it's easy to write it off as a kind of psychological issue where people are told that they have a problem and they have a kind of a psychosomatic response and that there isn't really a there there and what's interesting about this study is that because of that skepticism about long Co they specifically look for biomarker so like biological changes that are observable um scientifically and recordable and measurable and they have found a number of biomarkers associated with people who have been hospitalized with covid and more alarmingly that at least some of those biomarkers persist after the virus has been cleared suggesting that there could be long-term effects AKA long Co particularly for people who were sick enough with Co initially to be hospitalized I think that's I don't have any doubt that that if you are if you're hospitalized with Co that there can be long-term damage and I it's important to for scientists to evaluate what could be a potential you know to look at potential treatments and cures and those sort of things for people who are still suffering these long-term effects I yeah I I don't doubt that and we need to get more information about it um but the article we discussed at the top here is very worrisome indeed um it looks like a lot of um frankly it was a problem in a lot of other countries including China and India where um um young doctors trying to make careers for themselves are coming up with fake papers that there's a whole industry of writing fake papers paper mills that are again just utterly false they're not valid at all not just like exaggerated or you actually did the research and you reached to the wrong conclusion but are deliberately like made up like you know cheating on your research paper in college level like and being accepted by prestigious journals and then being treated as as fact there's not enough peer review there's not enough skepticism this problem has been well known well a slightly different problem in the in the social sciences psychological Sciences for uh a long time we've heard talk about the um um reproducibility problem it's diff so many papers I think some estimates are as many as 50 percent although that could be from a paper that's also frul but that a a high number of papers on social science behavioral observation papers that are accepted for publication um when they subst try to do a subsequently try to do a study to reproduce the same finding they cannot reproduce the finding at all and a lot of those make it through um yeah it also makes me think of the this is even more serious this is the harder Sciences sure I makes me think of the case that we talked about with respect to VI ramaswami where the allegation is that he was able to make a lot of money off of his first uh business venture by basically following an finding an abandoned um Alzheimer drug his mother is a doctor that specializes in geriatric disease maybe geriatric oncology I can't remember um but geriatric medicine uh and she basically writes a paper that suggests some potential application and promise to the drug which did not pan out but that enabled Vic to remarket it as um the next big thing and basically do a sort of a pump and dump make a lot of money off of selling this drug that had been because research had demonstrated that it didn't actually have that much promise so there's certainly a lot of manipulation that goes on in this industry and there are some serious questions about how you can restore public trust in what is some legitimate science when there is so much illegitimacy out there especially when as many people were pointing out in light of the um reporting about the vaccine effects how suppressed any discourse around that was earlier in the Arc of this pandemic right at very least allowing there to be some level of push back and mooding and debate of these sorts of issues I think would engender more trust in what the scientists are saying and that taking the exact opposite approach I think has led people to believe that all they can trust is their selves or what they see on their Facebook feed sometimes to to really bad effect because the way skepticism was treated by um governmental Medical Health authorities during the pandemic I just think ended up being really counterproductive you remember Fouch famous I am the science and how dare you mistrust me you know at a time where he was making claims about um about mass that have subsequently been you know he made several different conflicting claims about those that did not pan out being true in terms of how uh how totally satisfactory the the lower quality Mass were perfectly good um remember earlier early promises about how good the vaccines would hold up in terms of not just preventing severe disease and death and mitigating symptoms but actually to preventing the spread was a line that they uh they clung to for a long time um the denial of of a of a um infection acquired immunity um saying that was no good for so even though it became obvious that people once they had had covid had some level of protection akin to the level of protection you get from the vaccine frankly and you weren't like allowed to discuss that in po company and that's without you know getting into any of the origins of Co stuff as well which is some of the that has fared the worst of all um people you know people were demonized for having some rational skepticism and uh that's been that's been very damaging now we and we see from reports like this there's you know every reason you can be too skeptical you can you know reject absolutely everything because you just want to be contrarian or something that's not healthy either but you need to at least you know consider a variety of sources explore which questions have you know legitimate and respected people on the other side saying well wait a minute about this and that's how we get a more thoughtful and more informed public I mean I also think that that you need to have scientific literacy and the same way that some people talk about a crisis of Journalism and fake news and they think the answer is controlling what news is out there no I think that treating teaching people media literacy is really important and I think that a lot of folks on all across the political Spectrum who've wanted to control the American Mind Over years understand how integral education and media literacy and scientific literacy is to being able to think for yourself and push back against authoritarianism and I've worked over time to limit people's access to education and getting those skills and so I would also be very skeptical of anybody who wants to ban books make it harder for people to go and get education make it harder for

83,NDuaiYf8WDQ,Try Guys Debunk COVID Vaccine Conspiracies With Dr. Fauci,"  Guys he's like gonna jump on in like one minute.  I know, he's almost here. I have the participant window open, and I get to allow him to enter.  It's weird, I'm gonna be smiling, 'cause I'm just excited to see him.  Some nervous energy.  He's a busy man. He's doing lots of world saving.  We were 45 minutes early.  Okay. Ready? He's here, I'm admitting him right now. Here we go.    Hey, hey, hi guys, how you doing?   Hi, Dr. Fauci!     On December 14th, the first vaccine for COVID19 in the U.S. was administered, beginning our nationwide rollout.  Now there are a lot of questions and misinformation out there, and today, we are having the one person who can debunk all of the conspiracy theories joining us.  Although there's a lot of misinformation out there, today, we're talking to Mr. Information.  Today, we're speaking with Dr. Anthony Fauci, a physician and immunologist. I certainly have a crush on him.   He's the most important man of the last year.  The Beyonce of medicine.  Right?  He is the Beyonce of medicine.   Immunologist, Dr. Anthony Fauci.  Dr. Fauci.  Dr. Fauci.  There's nothing more important than him doing his job.  I'm Dr. Anthony Fauci.  My name is Dr. Tony Fauci.  During the course of the pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci has been the physician most Americans have relied upon for their information.   Fauci graduated first in his class at Cornell Medical College. His career spans six presidents and over 30 years of research.   Not only did Dr. Fauci foresee this kind of pandemic, scientists at the NIH have spent years preparing for it.  We're gonna use public health measures to help us safely get to where we want to go.  Hey.  Hi, Dr. Fauci.  Hello.  Hi, everybody. Hi, guys, how you doing?  We're so good.  Wonderful.  Doing well, thank you.  Good.  We love you.  So Dr. Fauci, this is the fastest vaccine in human history. People wanna know, did we undermine the safety of the vaccine because it was done so fast and without long-term studies?  Okay, so that's a great question. It's the most commonly asked question. There was no cutting corners. Safety was not compromised. Scientific integrity was not compromised, and I think people need to understand that the speed was related completely to the breathtaking scientific advances that had been made over the previous 10 or more years, where you can get the genetic sequence of the virus, which then take that sequence and insert the appropriate gene into these very new and unbelievably efficient vaccine platforms, and that didn't sacrifice any safety at all. That was purely a technological advance. Then the Moderna trial was 30,000 people. The Pfizer trial was 44,000 people, and it happened to be taking place in the middle of a ferocious outbreak. So when you're trying to prove a vaccine works, and there are just a few infections here and there in society, it could take seven years to get a vaccine. There was so many infections that we went from sequence to getting the vaccine in people's arms in less than a year. That is historic, but it's historic from a scientific standpoint. There was absolutely no cutting of corners at all.  So you're saying that there's no chance that there's some weird side effects that are gonna pop up three years down the road?  The chance of that happening is spectacularly low, and let me tell you why. If you look at the history of all vaccinology, and you say when did these so-called longer term effects occur? The overwhelming majority, 90 plus percent of them occur between 30 and 45 days after the vaccine trial ends. That is the reason why the FDA said that in order to make an emergency use authorization, you had to wait 60 days from the time 50 percent of the people in the trial got their last dose. So if you wait 60 days, you're already beyond when essentially all of the long-term effects occur. I've never seen one, where I get vaccinated in 1982, and I get a toxic effect in 1986. I mean, it just, I've never seen that happen with any vaccine.  Mm, mm-hmm.  Wow, that's amazing. Okay, I'm gonna ask you a question here. Can I still infect someone else after I get the vaccine and do I have to keep wearing a mask after I get it?  The answer is yes, and I'll explain why. It is still conceivable that you could get infected and be asymptomatic, and even though the vaccine protected you from getting sick, it didn't protect you from getting infected. So you may not even know that you're infected and be completely asymptomatic, and then spread it to somebody else.  I think that's been the scariest part of this whole pandemic, is that I could totally have it and not know, and that terrifies me.  We can pull back on masks when we get such an overwhelming proportion of the population is vaccinated that there's herd immunity, which means that the level of virus is so low that it's not a threat.  What percentage of people need to get the vaccine for us to achieve that?  You know, we don't know the exact number, but we can make a back of the envelope calculation that it's somewhere between 70 and 85 percent of the population needs to be vaccinated to get herd immunity.  Here's, you know, some people, there's a lot of people talking about things out there. Some people think maybe it'd be easier to just achieve herd immunity by letting the virus spread rampantly through the population. What do you think about that?  Okay, well that's maybe the worst idea.    Okay.  I don't want to compare it to anything. I don't want to insult anybody.  It's not my question. It's just a question that I have read, and I'm relaying to you because you're the expert.  Did you read it on Facebook, Keith?  I did read it on Facebook.   The general level of herd immunity right now in the country, the last time the CDC looked at it, was like 10 percent, 12 percent. Some cities like New York, it was 22 percent, because New York got hit so badly in the beginning. So let's say that the level in the country today, let's say is 20 percent. So with 20 percent of the people infected, we've already had 352,000 deaths. To get to 80, you'd have to have four times as many people. So are you willing to accept 1.2 million deaths in order to get to herd immunity? I don't think so. So the road to herd immunity is a vaccine, not just letting people get infected.  And how soon after getting the vaccine would I be immune?  So let's say you get vaccinated, and then 21 to 28 days later, you get a boost, anywhere from 10 to 14 days following the boost, you can consider yourself protected.  Dr. Fauci, a new COVID variant has been reported in over 40 countries and is said to be more transmittable. Will that make the vaccine irrelevant?  That has a mutation, which is causing the virus to be much more easily transmissible from person to person. According to the Brits, who've looked at it very carefully, and we will also be doing the same thing, they find that the mutation does not make people sicker or even more people dying, nor does it seem to interfere with the protection that's afforded by the vaccine. So the only thing that's functionally different, it appears to spread more easily.  My fiancee, Maggie, she actually got the vaccine already at work. They've been prioritizing nurses. For me, there's like a lot of contrasting information out there. Like I'm immunosuppressed, and I don't know, am I supposed to get it?  You can take a vaccine. The only time an immunocompromised person should not take a vaccine is when it's a live attenuated vaccine, because the virus can then replicate a lot in you, and not stop replicating the way a person who has a normal immune system would be. But you should get vaccinated, because even though the immune compromise may not get you to have as robust a response, a less than robust response is better than no response. So go get vaccinated.  Some protection is better than no protection, yes.  I learned that in college.   Stop guys, stop, stop.   I have a newborn child. We just got his two months' vaccines for all of the other stuff, but I've been really worried about COVID. When can my kids get the vaccine? Do they need to get it?  They do, but let me tell you what the strategy has been for decades and decades and decades with vaccines. Children and pregnant women are vulnerable. So the general policy has been you do not vaccinate children or pregnant women until you've proven that the vaccine induces the same sort of response that it induces in normal adults and protects them. And you do what's called a bridge. You bridge the immunogenicity study in the children and the pregnant women with the efficacy study that you've already completed, and you make a determination that it's okay to give it to children. We're gonna start that likely towards the end of January, we'll be doing that in children.  Oh, that's soon.  So Dr. Fauci, we know that the vaccine doesn't instantly make everything better. So what can you tell us about what the next few months look like?  By the time we get to April, I think it would be open season. Namely, anybody can get vaccinated. There's no restrictions on it at all, because all the priority people have been vaccinated. If we then vaccinate at a very good rate, President Biden has made the announcement that he's gonna try and get 1 million doses a day, so that a hundred million in the first hundred days. If we do 1 million a day, by the time we get to the end of the summer, we will have reached that a percentage of herd immunity. So that in the fall, if everybody gets vaccinated that should get vaccinated, we can start approaching a degree of normality. That doesn't mean nobody wears a mask, but that does mean kids can feel secure at school, you can go to a sporting event, you can go to a restaurant and have dinner, you can go to the theater, things like that. The critical issue is that we wanna really make sure that this vaccine hesitancy that we see around gets overcome by the truth, that the vaccine is safe and it's efficacious, and it will protect you, your family, and ultimately all of society. So go out there and beat the bushes. Tell your friends to get vaccinated.  Dr. Fauci, you've been interviewed by the best of the best the world has to offer, but never by four idiots at once. Next up, we have a lightning round. Are you ready?    Lightning Round  These are some of the most widely believed COVID vaccine conspiracy theories on the internet.  Okay, Dr. Fauci, are you lying when you said you got the vaccine?  No.  Right here.   Lightning Round.  Does the COVID vaccine cause COVID?  Absolutely impossible.   Lightning Round.  Are the vaccine ingredients more toxic than COVID19 itself?  Absolutely not.   Lightning Round.  Will the vaccine change my DNA?  Absolutely impossible.   Lightning Round.  Well, do the vaccines deliver a microchip barcode into my arm to keep a track of me wherever I go?   No, it doesn't.    Lightning Round.  And Dr. Fauci, one final question. Will coupons that are redeemable for one vaccine shot be called Faucers?   I hope not.  Think about it.  That's a good idea. You know? You can run with that.  Dr. Fauci, we wanna thank you so much for your time. Is there any one last thing you would say to people who do not want to get the vaccine?  Yeah, I think they really need to examine carefully in their mind the reasons for that. If it's really based on a lot of people talking about hoaxes and things like that, you really gotta take a look at the risk that we're going through. We're going through a real historic challenge, the likes of which we haven't seen in 102 years and all of this nonsense about fake news and hoax and all that, I mean, that just results in more people dying.  We wanna thank you so much-  Thank you so much.  For everything you do.  Yes, it's been a real pleasure.   Go get vaccinated, everybody.  You bet! Do it.   Bye, Dr. Fauci!  I love you. Oh, he hung up.  Guys, thanks so much for watching. We hope you are taking this as seriously as we need to take it. When you can get vaccinated, you should get vaccinated. There's gonna be some links in the description below with more information and thanks again, Dr. Fauci. What an amazing experience for us and for you. We all basically got to hang out with him for a few minutes and that's pretty awesome.  Ned, you made him laugh.  I know.  Whoa!  I made him horrified.    He didn't hear that I loved him.  Well, he'll watch. He watches all our videos, so he'll see it.  Oh, okay, good, good.  Yeah, he has, he's actually a Sapphire Triceratops. ",0.5033447901305046
84,VaSDSdR4R-E,Does the COVID-19 Vaccine Cause Long-Term Effects?,"We have had dozens and dozens of vaccines available for the last many decades, and we have seen absolutely no long-term side effects from any of these vaccines. And we're more than a year out from the first people who got vaccinated against COVID, and we still have not seen any long-term effects from them. But the real risks that we've been hearing about, the inflammation of the heart and the blood clots that are possible, have happened in a tiny fraction of people who have gotten the COVID vaccine. We're talking maybe five per million. And when you look at the risk of what COVID does to you and the risks of dying, which are much greater than that, a tiny risk from the vaccine is certainly something that you want to overcome.

Stephanie? Mark and Erin, this just came down a couple of hours ago. We are now learning from state health officials that Dr. Kenneth Inchelik asked a nurse to drop the vaccine and not give it to him when he was practicing at pro health physicians. The nurse refused and reported him. Then the chief medical officer for pro health physicians filed a complaint with the examining board. This is all part of the report. He was fired back in January of 2022. Now the state just agreed and he agreed he will not practice medicine in Connecticut. He now lives in New Hampshire. We also reached out to pro health physicians about all of this and we have not yet heard back. Stephanie Simone, Channel 3 Eyewitness News.",0.1848935786435786

87,zBObkBFMcyo,Ramaswamy: Lack of Free Debate Spurred COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates,"The Trump administration and private industry developed a COVID vaccine in record time. The program protected the drug companies from virtually all lawsuits over vaccine injuries. The government has a program to compensate for such harm, but critics say it is a black hole of bureaucracy. 12,000 claims filed, 10 percent decided, only eight payouts so far in a forum with no right to counsel, no hearings, no appeals. Mr. Trump says he's very proud of Warp Speed. Should he be? This question specifically on liability goes back to actually Reagan. And Reagan is a president who I admire, many of us do. I think that reviving that spirit is in many ways going to be good for this country in so many ways. But one of the areas where he erred was this special form of lobbying to say that one kind of manufacturer, a vaccine manufacturer, cannot be sued for their product liability. So I have pledged it is part of my legislative agenda. We will repeal that, just like we will repeal every other form of crony capitalism. People who have been harmed by those vaccines deserve accountability. They cannot be forgotten Americans. And I think one of the top lessons we learned from that COVID pandemic is that free speech in this country is most important in those alleged times of emergency.

91,Mdr2rLWGXiE,Could COVID vaccine technology cure cancer? | DW News, the International Community is marking World Cancer Day cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide but now thanks to a Cutting Edge COVID vaccine technology we might just might be closer to stopping cancer Germany's biotech is launching a trial in the United Kingdom of personalized cancer vaccines this Autumn more on the technology in this upcoming report during the COVID19 pandemic vaccines were rolled out within a year faster than most experts believed possible and messenger RNA vaccines were among the first to gain approvals they work by giving the body's immune system a preview of potentially dangerous Invaders a dose contains many copies of a short stretch of precise genetic information the messenger RNA it induces cells to start making proteins that are otherwise only found on a specific pathogen like the proteins that stud the surface of sarsko V2 the virus that causes COVID19 then when the immune system encounters the virus it quickly recognizes the Invader and wipes it out categorically messenger RNA vaccines have proven to be exceptionally effective they have proven to be able to protect people against severe and life-threatening disease and consequently saved millions of lives there are different types of RNA but all of them are coding molecules and that code can be Rewritten that's why many drug developers describe RNA as medicinal software vaccines that use this software have a major advantage over other platforms their codes can be easily altered to also make other proteins found on other disease-causing microbes teaching the immune system how to fight them as well and RNA can encode for proteins found not just in infectious diseases but also for instance in cancers in addition to messenger RNA a range of other rnas play key roles in metabolism and health so they also have potential as medicines cancer application is quite interesting because it is not a vaccine that will prevent cancer but rather it is a therapeutic vaccine it is a vaccine directed custom tailored to the cancer of the of the patient which enhances and directs the immune response to more efficiently clear the tumor around 20 RNA treatments have been approved so far globally and dozens more are in trials in a wide range of diseases and for more on this we are joined Now by Dan Milner the executive director of access to oncology medicine's coalition thank you for joining us sir there's been as we've been hearing high hopes for this mRNA cancer treatment how different just to begin would it be from the Technologies we now use to cure cancer so great question so currently the technologies that we use are largely directed at killing the tumor using you know either General targets which is classical chemotherapy or targeted therapies which we have for example for lung cancer but in those targeted therapies these are still molecules or antibodies that are manufactured and don't use the body's own immune system naturally our bodies can fight cancer many cancers off and we never develop those cancers because our immune systems take care of them so we're moving away from the traditional approach of attacking the cancer with something exogenous to moving to an RNA or an internal approach where we actually use the body's own immune system to attack those Cancers and Destroy them uh Mr Miller we saw of course uh how during the COVID19 pandemic how quickly vaccines could be ruled out once they were discovered can we hope for similar speed with cancer I I think so but I think there is a major barrier which we did not do not have with infectious disease and that's choosing the target for an individual patient as you have was described in the piece before this the ability to Target an infectious disease is quite easy because it's a foreign molecule it's a foreign piece of material that's not naturally in the human body but when we talk about cancer and personalizing the vaccine what we're talking about is finding some piece of the tumor that's been mutated or changed enough that we can then Target that protein or that molecule with the vaccine and destroy it and so we have to pick through all of the bits of the tumor using sequencing or other very robust processes to find the target pull it out and say yes this is the best one for this patient and then use it and that process at the moment is still rather tedious and difficult and expensive to do for each patient and again our concept is personalized so we want to do it for each patient so that's the bear really have to overcome is rapid Target selection for patients with cancer and just if we put the cost in the individualized treatment challenges Assad for a moment uh how long you think we'll have to wait for a wide scale rollout well I think that you know the agreement that the British government just signed with bioin tech for 10 thousand patients by 2030 is very promising there was also the agreement personality signed with moderna using their sequencing platform I think these are signals that this is coming much more quickly than it would have you know we've been working on these vaccines for more than a decade for cancer with very little progress but now that we've sort of gotten through all the hard Parts with covid we've taken the vaccine to scale we've distributed Etc now we can focus in on what is the one last barrier and I think these kinds of Agreements are going to speed this process up I would say that there are four trials reporting this year one on melanoma two on influenza and one on herpes and that melanoma trial will be really crucial to see the results because I think if that is a positive trial we'll start to see more trials on the back end and we'll see more results coming out that are moving this forward for patients okay thanks for that good news to Ann Milner from the medicines Coalition thanks so much,0.4813872717320994

anybody that is surprising to me so please do get your details to Stephen and the team and I will happily take that away of course you should be able to speak about your experience what's happened to you and as I said we have a compensation scheme in place for that and I'll make sure that we're working through that obviously I think you'll appreciate it's hard for me to comment on your specific circumstances just not knowing them and those things forgive me sir we haven't got a microphone on you so our viewers and listeners won't be able to hear I the the last thing I'd say is you know we went through a pandemic like everyone else at the points when it came to the vaccine those decisions were always taken on the basis of medical advice from our medical experts to tell us as politicians who are obviously not doctors about how best to roll out the vaccine what was in the public health interest the priority order how that should be done who should be eligible that was something that the doctors recommended on and that's something that we followed now obviously if there are individual circumstances which haven't worked out then that's why we have the compensation scheme in place and I'll make sure that we follow up on your cases okay prime minister thank you jents both of you do give us your details we will get that to the Prime Minister and as he said he will I'm sure look at that for you now that is an issue that's haed you a little bit because you were quite Pro vaccine weren't you AB I'm sorry uh what I said was I was Pro the choice it's an individual choice we were the first people to say you shouldn't be vaccinating young people or children and here's the point I commit and I don't think any other party will I commit we need an inquiry into the vaccine in vaccine injuries and that is my commitment here this evening for the first time to you that will be in our contract with the people there has to be an inquiry you heard it from those gentlemen I'm hearing up and down the country Ser so okay let's just have this rise so reform UK If voted will immediately have an inquest into the vaccine injured I'm absolutely right we need that and it needs to happen quickly and there need to be proper interim payments made to those who have been injured",0.4875271512113618

97,ButW2kNe564,COVID-19 Vaccine: What you have to do to get a religious exemption and how you can be denied.,"As more and more employers require employees to be vaccinated against COVID19, many workers are pushing back citing religious beliefs against getting it. But what does the law say and how does an employer decide? ABC 10's Kurt Rivera explains in tonight's cover story. At Destiny Christian Church in Rockland, And it's on the form, all the scripture references, A pastor signs exemption forms, citing religious beliefs as protection from the need for a COVID19 vaccine. For us who choose not to, we put our faith in the Lord. But how does that hold up in the workplace? According to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Employers must provide quote, reasonable accommodations for workers who have quote, sincerely held religious beliefs. It doesn't mean that they have to grant all exemption requests. Michelle Mello is a Stanford Law School and Health Policy Professor for the University School of Medicine. She says in the past, employers have granted a quote, fairly large birth for religious exemptions. But with COVID, that has changed. In this context, there are some distinct challenges because many of the people who are filing religious exemption requests have never refused vaccines before. This is the only vaccine that they object to. And the nature of their objection isn't truly religious. It's more of a personal belief exemption that they're trying to shoehorn into their religious exemption channel. And she says under the law, employers are allowed to question the employee about their exemption. It doesn't require that you've tithed to a recognized denomination or that you have a letter from your clergy person. It does require that you articulate an argument that is religious in nature and not more generally just about your personal beliefs. And then there's a portion that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says gives the employer the right to deny a religious exemption on what's called undue hardship. That's defined as quote, more than a de minimis or minimal burden or cost to run an employer's business. It could lead to an employee getting fired. For certain industries, there isn't a reasonable accommodation and the employee is going to be faced with a hard choice. And healthcare is certainly one of those industries. Education is probably another where remote work is not really feasible. And some of the other accommodations that the employer might think about just aren't going to do the trick in terms of reassuring everyone that they can operate a safe workplace. San Joaquin County Public Health Officer Dr. Maggie Park says quote, The California Department of Public Health guidelines stress religious exemptions should be based on sincerely held religious beliefs. San Joaquin County Public Health Services continues to reach out to our faith based organizations to help answer questions about the COVID19 vaccine and making the shots readily available to the community. And the federal labor code also allows an employer to grant a different religious accommodation than what the employee is asking for if it poses undue hardship to the business.",0.3726797862001943
98,OJJbm8JuRvs,How to Keep Young Kids Calm When Getting COVID-19 Vaccine,"For every parent who's been desperate to get their child protected against COVID, today's a great day. Now that the FDA and CDC have given the go-ahead for kids ages 5 to 11 to get vaccinated. Now if they could just help kids get over their jitters about needles. Millions of kids are about to get a COVID vaccination shot. And it's fair to say a lot of them are not looking forward to it. 63 percent of children fear needles. It even has a name, trypanophobia. These youngsters in Hartford, Connecticut were the first in the nation to get the shot late last night, moments after the CDC gave the green light. This brave girl is staying calm by holding her friend's hand. It's one of the many tricks kids can use to overcome their fear. It's also important to tell the truth to kids and be honest. Be honest about what is going to happen and explain what is going to take place, prepare them. Other tricks? Try a distraction. A toy, a book, a beloved comfort stuffed animal, or it can be electronics, it can be an iPad, it can be a phone. Six-year-old Elise Langvin squeezed her favorite toy tight as she got her shot today. She was not happy, but the promise of a treat made it a little better. How about some ice cream? Another tip, use numbing cream or a topical pain patch, it numbs the injection site. Don't expect long lines at your doctor's office. Just 27 percent of parents say they will vaccinate their kids right away. 33 percent are going to wait and see. 5 percent say only if required. And 30 percent, almost one-third, say no how, no way. Thank you for watching.",0.653857142857143

There was one month in January of 2022, he was actually getting two shots per day on most days of that month, one in each arm. Now they started to look at him when he was toward the end of this, around 214 shots in. And what they found is that he did have more immune cells in terms of antibodies and T cells than a comparator group who just got three vaccine doses. But his immune response wasn't any better or worse necessarily than that control group. Importantly also, he didn't report any vaccine related side effects, which is kind of hard to believe. But that is what they say in this paper. And he never got COVID, although they say they don't know if that's because of all these vaccinations or because of his behavior or something else, guys.

one standout viral moment my name is John W and I'm one of the covid vaccine injured in this country I want you to look into my eyes soon I and I want you to look at the pain the trauma and the regret I have in my eyes we have been left with no help at all why are the people who are in charge who told us all to do the right thing have left us all to ro so there is a vaccine compensation scheme that's in place as you alluded to in the NHS obviously everyone individually will work through their cases it's difficult for me to comment on anyone's individual case I'm sure well John's comments actually got a round of applause from the audience and a massive reaction online so that man is John wat who had I believe three vaccines and developed a heart condition that nearly killed him before I was fit and healthy and used to do boxing H would do CrossFit you know do a lot of weight weight training and you know keep myself in good shape when I had my fight that's my world just toally crumbled yeah I mean he ended up in a wheelchair it it nearly killed it okay he is a voice for the vaccine injured and those who are sadly no longer here to make their voice heard he thinks people have been lied to and betrayed over vaccine safety and he wants the government to take responsibil I'm very pleased to say that he joins us now to tell us his story John thank you very much I know we've spoken a couple of times today and it's taken it out of you especially considering your condition could you just explain to our viewers and listeners exactly what went on with you then in terms of the vaccine please man I'd be here all night if I was to tell you what's happened to me but um just like you said I was bed ring for 14 months in a wheelchair um had numerous conditions um poorts poort orthostatic tardia syndrome H stomach issues NE I've got neurological issues now so people may have seen me moving back and forth in the video and they think you know that unfortunately that's my problem now when I'm when I stand up I feel like I'm dizzy and I'm off balance so if you see me moving about or anything like that unfortunately it's how I cope with things now for me doing that last night it's adrenaline and a heart issue does not go well Patrick and it took a lot out me to do that and drive down there and I seen an opportunity and unfortunately I had to take it Well you certainly did and you were still being demonized okay and earlier on today uh Kevin Maguire is a journalist well he he said this we'll play the clip I think he would but didn't you watch the the bit where some antia went on and on and on that's I think the two of them I think why would K starm subject himself to that yeah John I mean how does that make you feel being called an antivaxer first of all who is that guy I don't know who he is but anyway what is an antivaxer Patrick can somebody tell me can somebody elaborate what an antix us because I I took three of them I took three of these Vine so does that man have any idea how how stupid he sounds at this point in time by saying that it's you know this is the the terminology the language people are using just now saying Ana and all this nonsense to be completely honest with you the narrative is safe and effective in my opinion is no longer because to be honest with you Patrick I ask anyone and I call anybody in this matter someone show me the data to show that this saved one single life I'm asking anybody because since the roll out there has been a massive increase in people dying and one of the reasons I spoke out Patrick is because I'm not going to be a died suddenly statistic and that's the honest answer and these debates and everything need to be spoke about and the vaccine injured and bed need to be heard and I just can't believe that that's where we at you know you call me a antiva honestly I don't want to use the wrong language here you know but yeah okay well look as you know you the government goes well it's it saved many lives Etc but can I get your views on the compensation scheme and where you're at with it because that was one of the things you were really trying to hammer home to the Prime Minister wasn't it because you feel completely left behind and completely forgotten about and that it's been left to you actually really and and other people like you to really Bang the Drum to try to get Justice yeah I mean where I'm with it I've recently just got my doctor's notes it's taking about six months to get those doctor's notes but I know certain people who have you know I speak to all the vaccine injured in the UK there's only been a very very small percentage that have had a payout and I'm talking about people that have had spinal Strokes you know people who got heart conditions now what is 60 percent look we're no further for we're no further forward wew a year ago we're EXA we're in the exact same position where we were a year ago Patrick and it's it's ridiculous and when I stood there in front of him yesterday and I told him look me in the eye you you know Rich you've never been notified that we exist it's not the first time mate and see to be honest with you this goes to all the politicians because this is a political issue this is this is a message to you all because the long as you leave you B your head in the sand this isn't gone away you want to talk about the post office Scandal this is bigger this is global it's getting bigger and bigger you know it's getting worse and to be honest with you you can't run away from it any longer yes all right and look

stage right okay let's get the thoughts of my panels GS presented and qu Ser of MP for sto on Trent North Jonathan gullis an author and broadcaster am Niel Turner Jonathan I've got to ask you you know why is your government so slow to give these people payouts then look I think John gave a very moving account and I'm very sorry to hear the situation that he's found himself in that I was one of those who proudly promoted the vaccine because ultimately we were told by the scientists that this was going to help stopping the spread and ultimately build our resilience to the fact that if we did Catch Co that it would prevent ending up in hospital I think that was entirely the right thing to do and as you heard that 144 million of those have gone out to date but I don't deny the fact that there's huge frustration I think John was right fair in pointing out that with the post office Scandal and the payment scheme that's meant to be happening there that clearly bureaucracy is getting in the way I'm more than happy to sit down with people like John to hear firsthand about why payments aren't happening quick enough because ultimately it's about up to 12,000 that people are entitled to if they're entitled to it they should be getting it I mean people like John are demonized they're called antivaxers which ridiculous because they three of the things for stars he's obviously not an antivaxer yeah um people like him are are demonized and and they will feel I mean shunned from society laughed at scoffed by people who maybe have had a vaccine and are fine and that's not the case for everybody no they they absolutely shouldn't vaccine injured are very real they're very much there but in the same way nothing is risk-free planes crash those people are real that have been involved in that plane accident but we still see flying is safe the vaccine is still safe compensation or insurance I think the problem with the compensation is probably because it's extremely difficult to prove that the vaccine um caused that stroke that came five years later it's probably extremely difficult to prove that and I imagine in the cases where it's cut and dry like in John's case it he will get and he deserves every single penny he gets um but we can't get away from the fact that vaccine hesitancy is far more dangerous than getting the vaccine of course it mil doses there going to few that had but the thing is we were told we were we were told oh if you if you if you get this vaccine it's going to stop transmission uh you're not going to be able to give it to anyone it's going to stop you from getting Co and to be fair that wasn't true well you see that's the thing so I was like Jonathan I was you know an advocate for the vaccine I encourage people to get vaccinated because I thought you'd be protecting others and and yourself and so on and so forth and I do feel a bit duped at that point because I was working helping the government out and everything else like that and the reason I feel duped isn't because I know obvious see terribly and tragically some people died and some people got injured but I feel do because it wasn't true it didn't prevent transmission at all we learned that it doesn't so one of the main premises of me ensuring that others around me were vaccinated was that and seeing as that didn't turn out to be true it kind of It kind of irritated me a little bit but I do admit vaccines are good but you just have to look Patrick these type of topics are the things that the co inquiry should be focusing on and sadly at the start we to focus on personalities when actually I'm far more interested in understanding the science and decisions behind that science okay all right all of you thank you very much and thank you to John as well for coming on there and getting his story out there",0.5407784477427335

108,2Ruq3o7iZho,Doctor Addresses Your COVID Vaccine Concerns | Pregnancy? Infertility? Miscarriage?,"  Hey, y'all welcome back. I'm mama Dr. Jones, a Board Certified ObGyn, a mom to four, and today I'm giving you an update on COVID vaccination as it relates to pregnancy and fertility. I recently made an update video on COVID19 and its effects in pregnancy, If you'd like to check that out I will link it in the iCard, or in the description box below. This information is up to date to the best of my ability as of the day of filming, which is August 31st, 2021. In this video we're covering are COVID19 vaccination safe in pregnancy? Do the COVID19 vaccinations cause infertility? Does COVID19 vaccination lead your body to attack placentas? Aren't you concerned about the long-term effects of the vaccine? And whether antibodies are transferred through the placenta and through the breast milk to the baby. If you're new here and you'd like to subscribe, we would love to have you. I talk about all things, periods, pregnancy, period products, gynecology, and everything in between. Hit that subscribe button, turn on notifications so you never miss an upload. I promise you'll leave with things to tell your friends.  Are COVID19 vaccination safe in pregnancy? We now have sufficient data to say that COVID19 vaccinations are safe to be given during pregnancy. This means the outcomes and people who are pregnant and not vaccinated, are similar to people who are pregnant and they get vaccinated. And people who are pregnant and get vaccinated have better outcomes if they contract COVID19 during the pregnancy, than people who get COVID19 during pregnancy and are not vaccinated. Please, please, please get vaccinated, even if you are pregnant. The recommendation to get vaccinated during pregnancy, if you have not already been vaccinated, is not just coming from me. This is from every major medical organization and expert that is tasked with taking care of people who are pregnant, or who have recently had a baby. Please, please, please consider this, and if you have any questions bring them up with your doctor or midwife. Does the COVID19 vaccination even work in pregnant people? Yes, we have very good data now to indicate that COVID19 vaccination is not only safe, but also effective if you are getting it during pregnancy. It does decrease the risk of COVID19 infection. Does COVID19 vaccination cause miscarriage or stillbirth? There is absolutely zero evidence to indicate there's an association here. I know this is one of the things that goes around on the internet as disinformation, and it is not true. JAMA recently released a review of V-safe data that indicated that these risk rates fall within the expected range for the baseline population, and are not increased in people who are vaccinated. In fact, the rate of pregnancy loss in the largest data review that we have on people who are vaccinated for COVID19 during pregnancy, indicates that their pregnancy loss rates rank at the lower side of the range that we see in people in the general population for pregnancy loss. Based on this data we can say there does not appear to be any increased risk in miscarriage, stillbirth, pregnancy complications, growth restriction, congenital anomalies, or neonatal death or complications in people who were vaccinated for COVID19 during pregnancy. As always, I've linked these sources in the description box below if you'd like to check out the data. I will, once again, here repeat. Many of these things are significantly increased in people who have COVID19, especially severe COVID19 during pregnancy. The vaccine reduces the risk of COVID19 in pregnancy, as well as severe infection in pregnancy, and thus reduces your risk if you are to contract COVID19, even if you have a breakthrough infection. Please, please, please understand that this can be very dangerous and devastating at baseline, but especially if you are pregnant. Does COVID19 vaccination cause infertility? This is another one that is spread over and over as misinformation on the internet. Why? Because it's effective and it scares people. So, what do we know? Earlier this year I did a video about where this idea originated and why it was biologically completely implausible. The idea that these two proteins are so similar that your antibodies could mount an immune response is a bit of a extremist claim. They do have some similarities, a lot of viruses have similarities. They would need to be extremely similar, and we're just not finding that when you actually look at the genetic sequencing of the spike protein and the syncytin-1 protein that they're talking about. I also discussed in that video that the person who is spreading the information has no expertise in pregnancy or birth, and has no understanding of basic pregnancy physiology based on the fact that they presumed that COVID19 antibodies would attack the placenta and that this would cause infertility. I probably have a very large viewership right now going, ""That doesn't make any sense because if it attacks the placenta, that wouldn't cause infertility it would cause pregnancy loss."" And you're right. Why? The placenta is not even functioning until nine weeks into the pregnancy, so if this theory was true, it's not, it would actually cause miscarriage not infertility. But there is no evidence that COVID19 vaccination causes either of those. Despite the lack of biologic plausibility we studied it anyway, and this study revealed that if you compared people going through IVF treatments and having an embryo transfer, and you looked at a group of people with no antibodies, natural antibodies from a previous COVID infection, and antibodies from a vaccination, there were no difference in pregnancy rates across these three groups. Meaning, neither COVID infection in the past nor vaccination in the past, decreases your chances of pregnancy in the future. Additionally, we also can review the data from the original studies on the vaccination, the number of unplanned pregnancies did not differ between the patients who had received the placebo and the patients who had received the COVID vaccine. There was no difference. If these vaccinations were affecting fertility you would expect to see a far lower number of accidental pregnancies, and a far lower number of pregnancies in the IVF study in the people who had been vaccinated. So, we've established that theory has no biologic plausibility, no data, and sufficient data to say it is nonsense. Of course, once this person was proven wrong by my biologic possibility information in the original video several months ago, and now with hard data, they decided that they would change their tune and say, ""Well, it may not cause infertility but COVID vaccine antibodies definitely cause placental attack, which could lead to pregnancy complications and miscarriage."" Fortunately, we expected this, people who spread misinformation when they're proven wrong they switch and they spread it in a different way, especially if the campaign was effective the first time. So, we studied this and even almost before it could come out of this person's mouth, we proved it wrong. Now we have a study that looks specifically at the histology of placentas and compares placentas from people who were vaccinated to people who were unvaccinated at the time of delivery. And what that study found, based on four histological markers of placental damage, is that there was no difference between histological indicators of placental damage in the group which was vaccinated and the group which was not. Interestingly, there was actually an increased risk of inflammation in the placentas which came from unvaccinated people. However, the relevance of that information at this point is completely unclear, so we're not going to talk about it at length. As I said earlier, we've already figured out that based on the data we have there is also no increased risk of miscarriage or pregnancy loss, based on a huge review of the currently given vaccinations in people who get the vaccine while pregnant. All of these studies are linked in the description box below if you would like to review them. What do I have to say to the people who say, ""We don't know the long-term effects of the vaccination. You can't say this until we have three years of data or five years of data.""? This is arbitrary. You can't just come up with an arbitrary amount of time for long-term complications. We need to look at this from a historical perspective, as well as an absolute and relative risk perspective. Never in the history of vaccinations has there been a vaccine which was safe and effective early on, and then three years later we found a random severe side effect that just suddenly popped up, MRNA, specifically, is what people seem to be worried about. MRNA is degraded in your body within hours to days, and certainly is gone within a couple of weeks. And all that remains is your body's response, meaning antibodies to protect you against COVID19. Vaccine side effects are known to occur mostly in the first few days but maybe up to a couple of months after you get the vaccine. So, no, we do not have to wait three years or five years, or some other arbitrary number that someone who has no idea what they're talking about comes up with, to decide that COVID19 vaccinations do not cause infertility. We have the data, we have historical precedence for this. And even if we didn't, I think it is extremely important to look at this from a relative and absolute risk standpoint. In the short-term COVID19 is dangerous, it can cause extreme illness and death in higher amounts, by far, than any vaccine side effects that we are seeing. In the short term vaccines are known to be both safe and effective at preventing these problems. In the long-term we know that a history of COVID infection can cause major issues, we also know that historically many viruses have complications which go on long-term or pop up later on in life. Vaccinations have never done that, and there is absolutely no data to indicate that that will be different with this vaccination. When you are weighing the relative risk and benefit for somebody who is either wanting to be pregnant, currently pregnant, might ever be pregnant, or even doesn't even wanna get pregnant but just is concerned about the things that people are saying, the vaccine outweighs the virus by magnitudes as far as safety goes. Please, please, please protect yourself and protect your fertility by staying alive and getting vaccinated. Are antibodies transferred to the baby through breast milk or the placenta? We now have really good data to say that, yes, antibodies do go through the placenta to the baby and through breast milk to the baby. As far as how much protection this actually provides, we aren't sure yet. Step one is figuring out if it happens, which we know it does. Step two is figuring out what the level is that is needed for protection, and if this antibody transfer actually conveys that amount and protects the baby after birth, either through transfer through the placenta or breastfeeding. We are working on that. Step three is figuring out how long this protection lasts and the optimum time for a baby or child to be vaccinated, and that's something that we're working on as well. I do think it is incredibly encouraging that we are seeing the antibodies transferred through the placenta and through the breast milk to the baby. I hope that you learned something today. If you did, please leave a like, send this to a friend, give a comment, anything to help it get out to more people and combat the misinformation that we are seeing everywhere on the internet.

It's a story that made national headlines.  And tonight there's a new development doctor Mary Bowden announced today with supporters right behind her that she plans to file a lawsuit against the hospital system. KPRC two's Mario Diaz live in the upper Kirby area. But this legal move and his high profile story. Mario.  Daniela the attorney for doctor Bohdan reached out to me here the last 30 minutes he says that the lawsuit has been filed. He doesn't expected to post until tomorrow, though officially due to the doctor King holiday. But this all comes in response to what doctor boating did 2 months ago and now was speak up and questioned the way the covid treatment and vaccination process was being handled.  Doctors can't be scared to question the narrative. This is the position doctor Mary Bowden says she and over 16,000 other doctors worldwide have had over covid vaccines part of a shifting movement developing. She says involving doctors who feel differently about the approach to early covid treatment.  I think ivermectin need to stop being such a dirty I don't understand why this because it's such a safe drive. Understand how it's become so controversial. Doctor Bohdan believes in ivermectin. So much. She had her latest recipient stand beside are at a news conference this morning.  Fully recovered after recently providing her high dosage tablets designated for humans. The only people I work my patients and I treat them the way I would want to be treated now. Too much removed from or suspension by Methodist and a resignation for publicly revealing her beliefs surrounding covid treatments and vaccines. Doctor Bohdan announced she is filing a lawsuit against Methodist because they have not. I responded to my request for information. I decided to take legal action against Methodist. The cases to be filed within the next 24 hours according to Bolton's attorney and it boils down to Methodist not being transparent over covid cases and the stats they have compiled involving the vaccine 2 of their key core values are integrity and accountability if they want to share their data with us.  And Houston Methodist had no comment with regards to the pending lawsuit when we reached out to him this afternoon. Now, doctor Bowden is an ear nose and throat specialist. But her practice has transformed a bit during the course of covid. She tells me that she has helped more than 2000 patients during this process. I asked her if she has lost any",0.4247721806812715

112,TW5BttKUlZo,Nurse speaks out after being subject of anti-vaccine conspiracy theory,"Few Americans know what it's like to be the target of a conspiracy theory, but since the day nurse Tiffany Dover Fainted while getting her covid vaccine life has never been the same and tonight She's speaking out for the first time in an exclusive interview with NBC's Brandi's a drosni Tiffany Dover wants the world to know one thing my message is simple. It is that I am alive. I'm well That's it. I Hope they believe it They are the massive online community of conspiracy theorists who've been convinced. She's dead for more than two years I made a whole podcast about it. Tiffany wasn't ready to share her story then but now I'm ready to just put my story out there own my story that story begins in 2020 Tiffany was working as a nurse manager at CHI Memorial Hospital in Chattanooga Putting in grueling hours on a covid unit when vaccines arrived that December Tiffany became one of the first people at her hospital to get the shot I felt okay during that then she stood up to answer questions. I'm sorry I Ended up passing out So that created the opposite effect of what I would have liked but you got right back up I did and This is something that's happened to me my whole life. I do have Episodes where I pass out but in that moment a conspiracy theory was born People thought that I was dead people thought that I was an actress paid to do this that I was paid off by Big Farm It was completely overwhelming to be honest. It snowballed Fast I people showing up at my house. I had people reaching out to my friends my family I even received death threats. Were you afraid for your family? Absolutely. Yes through it all Tiffany kept silent and that only made the online frenzy worse. Why not come out and dispel these rumors? initially, that was exactly what I wanted to do and Unfortunately, I was told that that absolutely would not happen the hospital told you not to speak out correct Yes, it would be Irrecoverable damage is what I was told if I was to speak out and have another episode Instead the hospital put out this video intending to show she was alive But the so-called Tiffany truthers picked it apart and used it as fuel online Anti-vaxxers and that movement are sort of using you as their poster girl it's hard to think that you are being used to detour somebody from getting the vaccine and That that was really hard for me to cope with Are you saying you blamed yourself? Yes, absolutely. I wish that we would have used it as a platform to speak out on the fact that People do pass out after getting shots vaccines, but that is not a reason to not proceed with getting them CHI Memorial has repeatedly denied knowledge of any directive asking Tiffany not to speak or post including in an interview for our podcast I'm not aware of anything that Asked Tiffany not to respond the hospital recently telling NBC News. We have no new information a year ago Tiffany left CHI Memorial and while she hopes to work as a nurse again one day for now She's focused on reclaiming her life Even after all of this there will be people who say We don't believe you What then at this point, you know, I've done what I needed to do I've put it out there that I'm alive.

113,6z4oAgRCySc,"If Covid vaccines saved so many lives, how do you explain Africa?", hi good evening I'm Dr Philip McMillan thank you for joining me and today I'm sharing with you the wonderful news from the wh that covid vaccines have saved 1.4 million lives across Europe it's remarkable how you can understand how successful this is but can't explain how people get severe disease well from my perspective from the scientific view I'm interested in how patients die and therefore if I understand how they die I can then explain the nuances like for instance how did Africa not get decimated with COVID19 they had low vaccination rate so if you can't explain that how then can you go on to make claims and credit for everything else so today what I'll be going through I'll give you a quick quick insight into what the topics are here I'll be talking about The Who and the fact that um this is the uh the the media coverage that they've had I'll go through that quickly I'll also be talking about what has happened in Africa with regards to vaccine coverage I'll also be looking at our worlding data and the vaccine doses being done in one specific area which is Zambia and I'll quickly mention something about the prevalence of pre-existing serological cross reactivity for SARS COV 2 additionally I'll be linking you in to some of the research that I've done which breaks down why you get severe disease and who is actually at risk for severe COVID19 so that's essentially what I'll go through quickly in a minute or two before I start I just like to remind everyone who may be interested coming up in a few days or if you've missed it you will see a link for it is our nitric oxide and covid presentation so nitric oxide and covid potential strategies for improving outcomes again being creative with research and science to come up with unusual patterns that may help to prevent severe disease Additionally you can join us on our huming heroes where in collaboration with Lena and putting together a book that will hopefully clarify some of the ideas around mucosal immunity and how nitric oxide could help join our Kickstarter on the link below so and why is this now an important topic so I've got here the World Health uh uh organization statement and this is from uh January 2024 and what they've said here is COVID19 vaccinations have save more than 1.4 million lives in the European region a new study finds uh firstly I couldn't yet find the study I'm not sure if it's peer-reviewed as yet but it's relevant in terms of these are likely to be computational models where they are anticipating the reason that they so many lives were saved and you can see here and as they pointed out since the introduction in December 2020 COVID19s have reduced deaths due to the pandemic by at least 57 percent saving more than 1.4 million lives in the wh Eastern European region now what is what I'm clarifying here is not that covid vaccines may have reduced deaths from severe disease but to say 1.4 million when you don't fully explain the mechanism of severe disease and you don't explain what has happened in Africa how do you explain Africa now let's just break that down into a little bit more detail and then I'll come back to why it's so important to understand the science so what I've got here is the Africa dashboard and this here is showing the CDC COVID19 vaccine dashboard and they're looking at all of Africa and they have delivered one um technically 1 billion doses of vaccines 1.13 7 and they've covered 51 percent 51.8 percent of Africa and they've shown it here by member State and which vaccine they have given that link is in the description the first thing that I will say is that I am very disappointed that Africa didn't take the lead on COVID19 by far they had the best outcomes up until probably certainly 2022 even after Omicron they had by far the best outcomes from the pandemic how do you explain that because they also had the lowest vaccine coverage now those numbers when I show you 51 percent I'm going to break it down because the timing is actually very very important so here you have a situation where you first have to ask what was happening in Africa and I've picked one country in Africa I've picked Zambia just because they've done a significant amount of vaccination and this is from our world in data and I've I've got here these are the peaks in terms of deaths daily new con confirmed COVID19 deaths and this is from the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 all the way out till now and you can see here that in August 2020 they had a peak then in February 2021 they had another Peak and that's uh and that um that was probably the the beta variant and then you had the Delta variant here this peak now what's important to note is that even though this was a peak you are talking about just about 250 deaths so this is not a lot of numbers compared to what was happening in the rest of the world this is a tiny number then they had a little bump here with regards to Omicron and then it ended so that was the situation of Africa now what you have to then do is look carefully at what they then did around vaccination because that's the bit that I was trying to understand they had a brilliant response low deaths in terms of Zambia yet they have gone to vaccinate most of their population I'm not talking about just a high-risk care who that could make sense but trying to Target your whole population I'm trying to understand the logic in it so here you have the daily COVID19 vaccine doses administered and you can see here again this is in uh 2021 because they didn't really get anything prior to April 2021 they started to get some vaccines low amounts all the way into December this was one of the horrific situations in the pandemic is that if covid was as lethal we would have left Africa to die but anyway here they're plotting along still getting some vaccine doses and then at this point here and this is just about May 2022 so that's after Omicron you see one big Surge and then they have another surge here in October 2022 let it be clear this was probably after the rest of the world had been not taking their vaccines so there was vaccines left over it's important for Africa to know you are not the priority here just reminding you this is what was after what was left that you were given why did you doubt your results in the first place and again you can see here from our world in data you can see for Zambia as I said you can see this is the number of people who had at least one dose you can see it was plotting along here until in about May 2022 you see the surge this is after they had faced Omicron and therefore had broad population level mucosal immunity why didn't they take the lead they had the best results the best outcomes why didn't they say why don't you explain why we have done so well with poor health infrastructure huge rural populations and limited access to vaccines how did Africa as a whole do so well so here is now the science and I'll try and explain this science to you as simply as I can the first thing you have to understand is what causes severe disease in COVID19 in truth we knew this from the data or the research that was done in about 2016 with SARS C the mechanism of disease is technically the same and it's all about the interferon response if you have a disregulated interferon response you're going to get severe disease this is Most Fascinating look at this carefully here this dark blue is interferon and what it's showing you here is that and green here represents the viral load so when someone gets infected if they have an early interferent response that means that the immune system the mucosal immune system recognizes it they have mild disease they don't end up with severe disease and again even when you have a huge surge of virus in Co and in SARS COV if they had a poor interferent response that means if they were immune supressed if they were old very frail again they had mild disease what caused severe disease was a delayed strong interferent response now that's just the science and it explains why some people even very frail people with comorbidities didn't die from COVID19 and this leads me to another very very important slide I think that I I put together just to try and explain this if you get this you understand severe COVID19 you have a number of factors that need to come together so I've created this ven diagram one you need to have have the representative age obesity comorbidities if you have this in theory you're at risk of severe COVID19 so this was a cohort who probably would have benefited most from vaccination additionally interferon Auto antibodies our problem was we didn't know which people who could be younger had interfer and auto antibodies the other thing was a strong systemic immune response that means me that that's the delayed interference so if you had weak immunity and this is talking about the first and second waves it's a bit different now but if you had strong systemic immunity that's what predisposed you to severe COVID19 in combination with all of this plus critically no recent exposure to any Corona virus I didn't say sarov 2 any Corona virus any cold virus would have caused the mucosal immunity to give an interferent response which would have prevented severe COVID19 unless that person had interfer on all to antibodies that's the science if you understand the science you can then understand why it was that some areas probably did so well and you can see as well in Africa and this is a paper that um I pulled up here they recognized that from 2021 there was high prevalence of preexisting serological cross reactivity against SARS kov 2 in subsaharan Africa so a lot of people were exposed to other Corona viruses and therefore they had high levels of mucosal immunity which would have prevented severe disease you can look at the paper it's not a big study but it's still quite relevant additionally in many parts of Africa they have been using at population level a number of drugs that are not considered to be relevant with COVID19 if we had been thinking about the science and if we had just been looking for answers the scientific Community would have gone back to look at Africa and say how did they have such a good outcome with regards to COVID19 and they would have looked at every option including the drugs that they were using at population level that could have had an impact and we could have been in a completely different place than we are now so taking it from another angle just a reminder in terms of my slides I've put this together to try and see if I can help somebody understand it first question have you got prior exposure to any Corona virus if if the answer is yes the next question is do you have interferon Auto antibodies if you don't you have more protection but if you have interferent autoantibodies that that disregulated that interferent response you are at risk and on top of it if you have the comorbidities and a strong systemic immune response you're at much higher risk of severe COVID19 so a weak immune response initially was almost protective you wouldn't get severe COVID19 what's remarkable is this has changed since we have done broad population level vaccination that those people who seem to be at lower risk are no longer the same so people who are immune suppressed in the first wave are no longer as protected subsequently these are important scientific questions that we really really need to answer so the point is this in order to make that claim and this is why I think the science is so important so I'll take you back to what that claim was that more than 1.4 million lives were saved if they don't include in their analysis the fact that almost 90 percent of the population was already exposed to any Corona virus and would not have a delayed inter response then those numbers are unlikely to be inaccurate but who am I this is coming from our lead organization so just a reminder as to what I said anything that delays this interferent response is likely to lead to severe disease and so whether it's interferon Auto antibodies or no prior exposure to any Corona virus or COVID19 you are at higher risk of SARS uh severe disease just remember at this point almost everybody has been exposed to um Omicron and so there is going to be only a small number of people if any who don't have mucosal immunity and therefore wouldn't respond in that way to interferon and so seeing severe COVID19 as an illness is unlikely to occur at this point unless there are other mechanisms at Play and so what we have to prepare for now as excess deaths remain up especially across highly vaccinated regions the question that needs to be asked is are we moving into a different phase of the pandemic where different mechanisms leading to severe disease are now extremely important to understand this is a different phase but just remember if we had taken or let Africa Take the Lead it's very unlikely the world would be where it is now we still have challenges in front of us and there no amount of um hiding those facts is going to change that reality have a good  evening ,0.484406263164027

115,JhfrBLQIVCs,24-Year-Old Unvaccinated Father Who Encouraged Vaccines Dies Of Covid,"I would not wish this stuff on like my worst enemy at all. 24 year old COVID patient Patrick Bershia had been hospitalized just over a week when we first met him earlier this month. Oh, sorry, what's the? Deep breath. Yeah, take a breath. He struggled to breathe, but he wanted to keep talking to share this message. As soon as I can, I'll get the vaccine. And I highly recommend anyone who has it to do it, because this is a very scary situation. Do you regret not getting the vaccine? Absolutely, I 100 percent regret it. Specifically, what were some of the things you were hearing? That the vaccine was not a real vaccine, that it was like a tracking chip the government was trying to use on us. Patrick was in the ICU at Billings Clinic in Montana, which was already seeing its highest number of COVID patients since last year. This is the ER. They've set up overflow beds in the hallways. Nurse Chrissy Baxter was among those caring for Patrick. Is it exhausting? It is, it's exhausting. I've had days where I've thought, I don't know that I can get up and continue to do this job. And I've been a nurse for 30 years. I believe passionately in what we do. I wanna make a difference for patients, but I never thought I would be there. But I've had days that I thought, I don't know that I can continue to do this. Since then, she says, things have gotten worse. The hospital has limited ECMO treatments, external machines that can function as a critical patient's heart and lungs. Administrators have also discussed how best to get ready for what's known as critical standards of care, essentially guidelines for how to ration resources. This is heartbreaking. This is something I have never prepared myself for or never anticipated. And since we met, Patrick took a turn for the worse. He was placed on a ventilator and died this weekend. Every time we moved him, we weren't sure if the end was gonna be in that moment. And so I just wanted to be there to hold his hand. In just one week, Patrick would have turned 25. He now leaves behind a young son. I, much like a lot of people of my age group, did really have a whole lot of proper information. I was hearing a lot of propaganda, saying, oh, like COVID's a conspiracy theory. It's not real. Just a whole bunch of crap. Is it true? It's very real. It's very scary.

116,wosyaWiDR2U,Woman Dies 4 days after getting COVID Vaccine | Post Vaccine Deaths," Kassidi Kurill a 39 year old single mom her  family describes her as healthy happy and having   more energy than most she had no known health  problems unless you count trigeminal neuralgia   she took botox for that she also took birth  control she worked as a surgical tech for local   plastic surgeons she gets the moderna covid  vaccine her first shot goes without incident   other than a sore arm second dose not so much she  gets her second shot on february 1st which is a   monday later that evening she has a sore arm  nausea and fever that's not unheard of after   someone gets the vaccine some people get a sore  arm fatigue body aches slight fever and chills   especially after the second shot and especially  in younger people now when this happens people   can take tylenol or ibuprofen no big deal right  unless they take too much she did take tylenol   aka acetaminophen but we don't know how much she  felt a little better the next day but by wednesday   she's not able to pee despite drinking lots  of fluids she says it's the worst she ever   felt thursday morning 6 a.m she tells her  parents she needs to go to the hospital   in the er she immediately starts throwing up  blood tests come back and doctors say she was very   very sick and her liver was not functioning  blood tests showed that her liver is not working   this entails severe elevations of her ast and alt  enzymes this also means an elevated inr so what   is going on here this is acute liver failure  aka fulminant hepatic failure or full minute   hepatitis the doctors give her iv fluids they  also give her a drug to counteract the effects   of tylenol on the liver it's called knack or  n-acetylcysteine but the damage was already done   around this time she becomes incoherent and this  is because acute liver failure causes the brain   to swell called cerebral edema if it's severe  enough it can result in coma at this point her   only chance of survival is with a liver transplant  so she was flown to a transplant hospital but when   the liver completely fails it causes other organs  to follow suit especially the kidneys in brain   and soon after the heart and the lungs she's put  on full life support including a breathing tube   even if there was a match for a new liver she's  too unstable to undergo the operation she dies   about 30 hours after she first arrived at the  er she leaves behind a young daughter who wants   people to hear her story and if you want to  contribute to her gofundme page i'm putting   a link below this video a lot of people will  conclude that the vaccine caused her death   but timing by itself does not prove causation  and a lot of people want to know did the vaccine   cause her death and if not then what caused it a  utah medical examiner completed a full autopsy but   the results remain private the medical examiner  said the autopsy did not show a link between   vaccine and death which is hardly surprising if  a vaccine caused someone to die shortly after   receiving it how would it do so the only medical  explanation would be an immunological reaction   meaning an allergic reaction so far in the  u.s there have been over 200 million doses   of the vaccine given no one has  died from a severe allergic reaction   as a result of the covid vaccine and in her case  it's obvious that she did not have an allergic   reaction for example there was not swelling in  the face or the tongue or tightening of the throat   deaths after COVID19 vaccinations are reported  to the vaccine adverse event reporting system   between december 14th and middle of march there  have been over 109 million vaccine doses in that   time frame in the united states now of those there  have been less than 2000 reports of death on the   var system which is 0.0018 percent a reported  death in the var system doesn't mean the vaccine   caused it if someone dies of a car accident on the  way home after they get the vaccine what was the   cause of death so the big question in Kassidi's  case is what caused her acute liver failure in   the u.s acetaminophen accounts for 40 of cases  in 18 of cases there is no identifiable cause   13 are due to idiosyncratic drug reactions  meaning medications other than tylenol the   general recommended dose for acetaminophen in  healthy people is no more than 4 grams per day   sometimes people end up taking more than  they should sometimes it's intentional   overdose sometimes it's accidental overdose  regardless this accounts for almost half of   the cases of acetaminophen-induced acute liver  failure acetaminophen toxicity it presents in   three phases the first phase involves nausea and  vomiting in the first 24 hours in the second phase   during hours 24 to 72 there's a dramatic rise  in liver enzymes seen on the blood work elevated   ast and alt in high ast to alt ratio during this  phase acetaminophen causes kidney damage as well   the third phase our 72 through 96 consists of  encephalopathy here the brain is not working right   because it's swollen there's confusion or lethargy  this often progresses to coma there's usually   jaundice at this point as well the treatment  for acetaminophen toxicity is a drug called an   acetylcysteine knack can be life-saving the  sooner it's given the better the outcome if   it's given within 10 hours of ingestion there's a  95 percent chance of survival acetaminophen levels can be   checked in the blood work increased levels help  make the diagnosis but even if they're normal   it doesn't rule out the possibility of toxicity  why because it's possible that the liver already   metabolized the acetaminophen in fact it's not  the actual acetaminophen that destroys the liver   instead it's one of its breakdown products it's a  metabolite called napqi which turns the liver into   mush here's a picture of what i'm talking about  this is liver necrosis and this is what a healthy   liver looks like when you look at it underneath  the microscope this is what you get napqi it also   damages the kidney and when the kidneys aren't  working people stop peeing this is why it's so   important that people make sure they're not taking  too much acetaminophen this drug is often combined   with other drugs and toxic levels can sneak up  on people for example over-the-counter cough   medications percocet vicodin they all have  acetaminophen in them medicine is complex it   always comes down to risk versus benefit whether  that be tylenol or other medications the risks   of the virus versus the vaccine that's why it's  important to stay in the know thanks for watching you",0.4140160158128909

119,VHCQ3cM02DQ,President-elect Joe Biden gets first dose of Covid-19 vaccine,"We just are getting some breaking news. We've got a live shot there of President-elect Joe Biden getting his COVID19 vaccine. He and incoming first lady Dr. Jill Biden both doing this publicly, receiving their doses, their first doses of the COVID19 vaccine in Delaware. Following in the footsteps of Vice President Mike Pence and the second lady, who we also saw as the death toll, Dr. Joe Kalin, this disease nears 300,000 people in the United States. This is going to be a big part of his administration's task, which is distributing hundreds of millions of vaccine shots in the early part of his administration. And we're just watching here the live shot. Obviously, they're doing this in a sign of confidence and in a show that this is safe. And to listen to the experts and the scientists, as some people are skeptical. And to that end, Sarah, the president-elect had said that he would get the vaccine whenever Dr. Anthony Fauci, who he has appointed as his chief medical adviser, recommended that he do so. And shortly after he suggested that, Dr. Fauci said that it was in President-elect Biden's interest and the interest of the country from a national security and continuity of government perspective for him to get it as soon as it was possible and as soon as it was available to him. You have also seen leadership on Capitol Hill in both parties receiving the vaccine and being very public about having gotten the vaccine, trying to show that this is not something as polls indicate is something that one party would support and another party would not support, trying to say this is something that every American should get as soon as it is available. Yeah, the problem is it's not that widely available yet. And there are also a lot of people who still cannot get it. Mario Gabelli, we are sorry to cut you off there on the stock picks, but we are watching and taking this live shot. Yeah, but that's an important part. Every living president should have a shot at the same time on that television set. So just continue that visibility. And it's happening. He's double-masked that it's the president-elect Biden. Couldn't hear you. Yeah, the former presidents have all said that they would also be getting this vaccine as well. And remember, this is a president-elect who has tried to keep some people. Despite that, there have been some small clusters of cases. There was a member of the expanded press pool who tested positive last week and also Cedric Richmond, member of Congress, who will be his incoming senior adviser testing positive for COVID last week after appearing at the same campaign event down in Georgia for the Senate runoff with the president-elect. But the transition said they were distanced, they were masked, they are not considered close contacts. But even that being said, there have been so many of these close calls for Biden, who is in his late 70s, in just recent weeks since the election. So certainly, and let's listen in as he's talking right now if we can get some higher audio from the president-elect right now. Available to take the vaccine. There's nothing to worry about. I'm looking forward to the second shot. So is Jill. She's had her shot earlier today. She loves shots, I know. But I've had so many. But at any rate, that's for me to... My next visit. And what the important thing is that it's worth stating that, you know, this is just the beginning. It's one thing to get the vaccine out, and now Moderna is going to be on the road as well. But it's going to take time. It's going to take time. In the meantime, I know I don't want to sound like a sour note here, but I hope people listen to all the experts, from the Dr. Fauci's arm, talking about the need to wear masks during this Christmas and New Year's holidays, wear masks, socially distance. And if you don't have to travel, don't travel. Don't travel. It's really important because we're still in the thick of this. It's one thing to have the vaccine show up at a hospital. There's another thing to get the vaccine from that vial into a needle, into an arm. And there's millions of people out there that are going to need this, front-line workers first. But I just want to thank everyone for all that they've done. They're some real heroes, some real heroes. And you're among them. Thank you. Happy New Year! Shepard Smith here.

122,DCzmtt5-b3A,Study compares COVID vaccine with immunity from infection,"   ARE, AND WHO YOUR ENEMIES ARE.  SO YOU COME TO NEW YORK AND  PICK A FIGHT.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.   A NEW STUDY FINDS THAT  COVID19 IMMUNITY, THE NATURAL  KIND CAUSED BY GETTING THE  VIRUS AND BEATING IT, CAN BE  JUST AS PRODUCTIVE AS GETTING A  VACCINE.  THE STUDY FOUND INFECTION  GENERATED IMMUNITY CAN CUT THE  RISK OF HOSPITALIZATION AND  DEATH COVID19 BY UP TO 88 percent FOR  UP TO 10 MONTHS.   A DISTINGUISHED CHAIR AT THE  UNIVERSITY OF IOWA JOINING US  NOW.  THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.  YOUR BIG TAKE AWAY FROM THE  STUDY?   FIRST, THANK YOU FOR HAVING  ME.  MY TAKEAWAYS FROM THIS STUDY  ARE REALLY THAT NATURAL IN  ACTION WORKS PRETTY WELL IN  PREVENTING HOSPITALIZATION ON  SUBSEQUENT RECHALLENGE.  THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE  SURPRISE.  THIS IS WHAT WE EXPECT IT TO  DO.  THE PARTS OF THE STUDY THAT I  THINK RAISE QUESTIONS OR THAT  ARE INTERESTING, IS THE QUESTION IS HOW IT COMPARES TO  VACCINATION AND WITH THIS STUDY  DOES IS IT COMPARES PROTECTION  FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN  IMMUNIZED WITH THE BASIC TWO  SHOT SERIES VERSUS REINFECTION  AND THE REINFECTION DOES A  LITTLE BETTER.  AS WE ALL KNOW NOW, PEOPLE HAVE  RECEIVED BOOSTERS, PARTICULARLY  THE FIRST BOOSTER IS IMPORTANT  FOR PROTECTION AND THE SECOND  BOOSTER MAY HELP SOME,  ESPECIALLY AGAINST THE OMICRON  TYPE VARIANCE.   IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE  BUILDING TO IT.  THE BOTTOM LINE, DO PEOPLE  STILL NEED TO GET BOOSTERS AND  VACCINES IF THEY'VE ALREADY HAD  THE VIRUS?  AND THEREFORE HAVE IMMUNITY?   I THINK THAT IS THE QUESTION  AND IT HAS TO BE A NUANCED  ANSWER BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW IS  FOR MANY PEOPLE BEING INFECTED  AND BEING READ BOOSTED BY  GETTING THE INFECTION AGAIN,  MAY PROTECT THEM, BUT THERE ARE  GROUPS THAT THIS IS NOT TRUE.  PEOPLE NEVER INFECTED OR  VACCINATED CAN GET SEVERE  DISEASE AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER, THIS WAS A STRATEGY THAT WAS  USED IN SWEDEN INITIALLY AND  WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING IS  PEOPLE ENDED UP DYING.  WE STILL HAVE 500 PEOPLE A DAY  DYING IN THE U.S. MOST OF THOSE  PEOPLE ARE EITHER BABIES WHO  ARE NEVER VACCINATED OR OLDER  PEOPLE WHOSE IMMUNITY IS IN  GRADE OR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE  A GOOD IMMUNE SYSTEM.   THE STUDY DID NOT INCLUDE  HYBRID IMMUNITY WHICH I  UNDERSTAND COMES WHEN SOMEONE  CONTRACTS A VIRUS AND IS ALSO  FULLY VACCINATED.  IS THAT THE IDEAL LEVEL OF  PROTECTION?   I DON'T KNOW WHAT IDEAL IS,  BUT IF ONE IS VACCINATED, AND  WHAT HAS BEEN INSPECTED AND  DONE WELL IN THEM VACCINATED,  THAT SEEMS TO WORK WELL.  THE REVERSE SEEMS TO BE GOOD AS  WELL.  THE CHALLENGE WITH THIS VIRUS  IS IS EVEN WITH IMMUNITY,  WHETHER IT BE FROM NATURAL  INFECTION OR FROM VACCINATION,  PEOPLE ARE STILL GETTING  REINFECTED.  SO, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO THE  HOSPITAL OR DYING, BUT THERE  ARE STILL LOTS OF INFECTIONS ",0.4731427174975562

124,-3EBnIsDqao,13 Year Old Boy Dies 3 Days After COVID Vaccine | Post Vaccine Deaths," welcome to another video for those of you  who don't know me my name is doctor mike hansen   and in this video i'm going to be talking  about a 13 year old boy in michigan who died   three days after getting the pfizer vaccine the  cause of death is being investigated by the cdc   and according to the patients on on twitter  the preliminary autopsy report showed that he   had fluid around his heart so what caused his  death before i tell you my thoughts on that it   first helps to understand what the background  on what myocarditis is it's inflammation of the   heart muscle and pericarditis is inflammation of  the pericardial sac that's where the heart sits   in there sometimes pericarditis can cause fluid  to build up within the sac but around the heart   muscle and this is called a pericardial effusion  the first reports of myocarditis after COVID19   mrna vaccines that involved u.s military  patients and patients from israel the israeli   cohort identified a male predominance with an  incidence of one out of every twenty thousand men   aged eighteen to thirty we know that the covid  vaccines from pfizer and modern can cause it but   actual covid infection is a much more common  cause the cdc has received 1226 preliminary   reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following  about 300 million total doses of the pfizer and   moderna vaccines myocarditis is most common in  the ages of 12 to 30 and it's more common in boys   among people 12 and older there were 267 reports  of heart inflammation meaning myocarditis after   one dose of vaccine and 827 after the  second dose and 132 after an unknown dose   so overall the number of cases of myocarditis  related to the covid mrna vaccines is very low   and for those who do get it it's usually a small  amount of heart inflammation that lasts for about   a week or so requiring minimal treatment in fact  not only is myocarditis way more common from covid   the risks to the heart from infection can be  more severe take a look at this ultrasound   of the heart aka an echocardiogram this is  of a young patient with covid myocarditis   this is a poorly pumping heart this is why the  cdc still recommends vaccination for those 12 and   older now there's three recent studies that came  out that looked at specific cases of myocarditis   that developed after getting the covid mrna  vaccines pfizer and moderna in the first study   in the journal pediatrics they reported on seven  cases of myocarditis from the pfizer vaccine   all the patients were seven otherwise healthy male  teenagers all of them tested negative for covid   none of the patients met criteria for multi-system  inflammatory syndrome in children or misc   all had an elevated troponin level troponin is a  protein in heart muscle cells and whenever there's   heart tissue damage as occurs with either a heart  attack or inflammation of the heart that troponin   ends up being leaked into the bloodstream the  higher the troponin the more heart tissue damage   an echocardiogram which is great for looking at  how the heart is functioning was normal in all but   one patient cardiac mri which is especially great  for looking at detailed structure of the heart   especially when looking for heart inflammation  showed myocarditis in all of the patients   three patients receive nothing more  than nsaids meaning non-steroidal   anti-inflammatory agents this includes things like  ibuprofen or the more powerful toradol aka ketorolac   these drugs not only help to suppress  inflammation or fight inflammation   but they also help to alleviate pain four patients  received iv ig meaning intravenous immunoglobulin   and they receive steroids and all of them had  their symptoms resolved in less than a week for   the one who did have an abnormal echocardiogram  let's take a closer look at his case so he's a   14 year old previously healthy male who gets the  pfizer vaccine one day later he develops a temp of   38.3 celsius and one day after that starts getting  shorter breath and he has pleuritic chest pain   pleuritic chest pain meaning it hurts more when  he takes a deep breath or hurts more if you cough   or sneeze so he goes to an urgent care clinic ekg  shows st segment elevation st elevation can mean a   lot of different things depending on the clinical  context sometimes it means there's a heart attack   sometimes it happens with myocarditis and then  sometimes it happens with pericarditis especially   when you see it in most of the leads and that's  what he had and his ultrasound showed mildly   depressed left and right ventricular systolic  function meaning his left ventricle and his right   ventricle weren't pumping quite as strong also  he had an elevated troponin eye level of 22.1   ngs per ml which normal range for that hospital  was noted to be less than 0.045 ngs per ml now   in hospital day 3 cardiac mri showed some areas  of heart muscle swelling meaning edema as well as   some areas of scarring he was treated with nsaids  first it was toradol and later with naproxen he   was also treated with a diuretic called lasix aka  furosemide they later repeated the echocardiogram   which showed improvement and he was discharged  from the hospital after four days on follow-up   13 days later he appeared well but he did have  chest pain with exertion despite instructions   to avoid strenuous exercise now an ekg showed  non-specific changes at that time and a third   echocardiogram was also done at that time which  was back to normal so overall the seven cases   of COVID vaccine myocarditis in this study had  good outcomes then there was this study which had   eight patients that were hospitalized with chest  pain within two to four days of receiving either   the pfizer or the moderna vaccine all of them were  otherwise healthy males between the ages of 21 and   56 so older age range in this group all but one  patient developed symptoms after their second dose   most had chest pain within a day or two of the  vaccine and all had elevated troponin levels and   myocarditis seen on cardiac mri two of them had  slight reduction in their heart function one of   them did undergo a heart biopsy and the pathology  results didn't show any abnormality all patients   had resolution of their chest pain and they were  discharged from the hospital in stable condition   then there was this study that involved seven  patients hospitalized for acute myocarditis-like   illness following covid vaccination all were men  less than 40 years old six patients received the   mrna vaccine either moderna or pfizer and then  one received the johnson and johnson vaccine   all the patients presented within three to seven  days after they got the vaccine they all had acute   onset of chest pain and it's basically more of  the same as the other patients that we just talked   about the one patient in this study that did have  a heart biopsy done it didn't show any evidence of   myocarditis when they did the pathology study now  although the heart biopsy was normal that doesn't   necessarily mean that there wasn't myocarditis  present in a different part of the heart because   trying to hit that right spot is like throwing  darts blindfolded when doing an autopsy though   this changes because you can look at essentially  the entire heart underneath the microscope and   finally there's this case report this is a 52 year  old man who developed myocarditis shortly after   the moderna vaccine and was ultimately discharged  from the hospital they had special permission   from the patient to test him for just about every  marker of the immune system that you could think   of all these different cytokines and chemokines  and so forth they're trying to identify an   immunological pattern but the authors were unable  to identify a characteristic profile so back to   the 13 year old boy in michigan who died three  days after getting the pfizer vaccine according   to the patients on twitter the preliminary autopsy  report showed that he had fluid around his heart   now the cdc is investigating this but there is  no official autopsy report but one of the biggest   questions is what did the pathology show when they  looked at the heart underneath the microscope did   it look normal or did it show that there was an  inflammatory infiltrate like either one of these   regardless people especially males between the  ages of 12 and 30 who get the mrna covid vaccines   should be aware especially aware  of the possibilities of myocarditis   especially after the second dose even though it's  still very rare getting covid is still far worse   compared to the vaccine including adolescents  aged 12 through 15. so right now pfizer is the   only one approved in this age group between  12 and 15 and studies with the other vaccines   in younger children are underway covid is  less severe in children compared to adults   but the risk of getting misc following  acute covid infection plus the risk of   severe disease in children who have underlying  medical conditions and the general desire to   prevent covid in children they're all valid  reasons for vaccination of children also because   misc is associated with immune dysregulation  that's precipitated by covid immune related   side effects following vaccination in children  has to be closely monitored so that's all for   this video thanks for watching and don't forget  to like it if you liked it and if you haven't   done so already hit that subscribe and bell  notification

Census released the Covid vaccine and booster in the medical community and the U. S government as safe and effective. But despite the voice of confidence from the experts, there are those who continue to reject the vaccine and booster shots. I am definitely against it. Me and my family because there's just too many complications with it. They want us to take a vaccine they made in less than three weeks. No it's saying the shots of causing strokes took my third booster side lost my taste and smell. So what's the benefits of me? Keep taking more sets? Cardiologists at core? Well East, formerly Beaumont say they hear the concerns. I believe it's coming from the fact that we know that the vaccination in the booster, especially the Moderna is associated With a very small but real risk of my own card itis, also known as inflammation of wall that can cause heart failure and even cause someone to die. Therefore we have to review the risks of that vaccination. So what I'm hearing from you is that there is a real possible connection between Cardiac arrest and the covid vaccine. Is that correct? Well what I would say is there is a definite association. But doctors still question if other factors could be involved, So could it be from the covid vaccine itself, causing that risk of myocarditis and therefore sudden cardiac arrest? Could it be from the coronavirus? Itself which caused long term effects, or could it be the lack of medical care patients received during the lockdown when people had to stay home? We don't have the full story Let It Rip in the next few months, we will have a better understanding as long as that data is published, So should you get the vaccine and booster shot at this point? I think it's irresponsible to say Don't get it. I think it's irresponsible to say definitely get it Its seek information about the vaccine. Through an Internet search or social media.

I'm the first person in the US to trial a COVID19 vaccine. Jennifer Haller was injected on March 16th with the experimental vaccine by Moderna. My arm was sore the next day. I had two doses of the vaccine four weeks apart and each time my arm was pretty sore In September Lafayette resident Daniel Horowitz was injected as part of Pfizer's COVID19 vaccine trial. The trial is double-blind so Horowitz is not sure if he received the vaccine or the placebo but his side effects are similar to those of a flu shot. I got a little achy in my muscles like hmm I just don't feel right and it went away after that day. For side effects Moderna points to this graph which include fatigue, chills, headache, muscle pain and pain at the injection site. UCSF's infectious disease specialist Dr. Peter Ching-Hong says these are normal vaccine symptoms. 25 to 50 percent of people might feel some mild side effects after the first dose. Are these vaccines safe? These vaccines as we know it are safe they're not live virus they're bits of protein. Both Pfizer and Moderna announced the clinical trials show their vaccines are more than 90 percent effective with over 70,000 people on the trials combined. Now as to long-term side effects. But usually these occur within two months and so far they haven't had any problems with either the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccine. In San Francisco, Luz Peña, ABC 7 News. you",0.5328483245149911
132,It7VNzhAqOs,Blood Clots after COVID Vaccine," Hello, welcome to my channel Medicine with  Dr. Moran. I'm Dr. Keith Moran. Today I want   to talk about additional research in regards to  vaccine-induced thrombosis which has been well   documented with the adenoviral vector vaccines in  other words the AstraZeneca and J & J. It's highly   likely to be present in the other adenoviral  vector vaccine such as the Russian vaccine   Sputnik. I have previously talked about the  possible pathophysiology of how these adenovirus   vector vaccines lead to blood clots and ultimately  low platelets. Now low platelets occur through a   mechanism where the platelets get consumed in  the clot so when we measure the platelet values   they're quite low. Now this condition similar  to what we call heparin-induced blood clots   and low platelets. Heparin is a blood thinner  that we use to prevent and treat blood clots.   Now this week some new additional information on  the pathophysiology of vaccine-induced blood clots   was reported in the journal of Science Advances.  There's a link to the research paper in the   description below. Now understanding how the  mechanism that is how these vaccines induce   blood clots which can be fatal is important not  just to prevent the outcome but also to treat it.   We also need to understand this because  we use adenovirus viral vectors to deliver   treatments. Now just a quick recap on this  particular condition the frequency is on the   order of one in thirty thousand to about one  in a hundred thousand. A review at the end   of July in the journal Blood reviewed the  United Kingdom experience with AstraZeneca   and the U.S. experience with J & J up to  sometime in July. As you can see on the slide   there are a number of cases of cerebral vein  thrombosis. This is an unusual kind of blood   clot that we can see involving the veins of  the brain and these veins drain the brain   and of course if you get blood clots in there  it will not drain the brain properly. It's an   unusual diagnosis I must say I've only managed a  couple of people with this in my 30-year career.   Blood clots also were being found in other  areas which were not usual including the   abdominal blood vessels. The majority of the  blood clots were seen after the first dose.   18 percent of people in the Uk group died and 11 percent in the  U.S. group so pretty significant mortality. Now   previous studies which I've reported on previously  highlight the role of platelet factor 4 which we   know is what happens with this heparin-induced  blood clotting. It can occur in veins as well as   arteries just like the vaccine-induced condition  I'm talking about. Here's the research paper. The   researchers studied three different adenovirus  vectors which have been deployed as vaccination   vectors in the different Sars Cov2 vaccines. This  model of the AstraZeneca viral vector they had to   determine. They had to elucidate where there might  be binding with platelet factor four and how it   actually would bind and whether it was plausible.  They ultimately showed that the adenovirus vector   combined with platelet factor four via an  electrostatic interaction something like   something electrically positive joining was simply  electrically negative. In other words opposites   attracting. They showed that a stable complex gets  formed with the vector and platelet factor four.   Now platelet factor four is only present in the  bloodstream so this kind of interaction does not   occur in muscle cells where the vaccine might  be. They did look at a common medication called   Fondaparinux which is an anticoagulant that  I've used many times for both acute coronary   syndromes such as heart attacks as well as  blood clots in the leg and the lung and they   found that this medication reduces the number of  binding events with the adenovirus vector surface   from AstraZeneca and platelet factor four. So it  ablates this electronegative potential between   there and inhibits the binding suggesting  that this might be a plausible treatment.   Now their study was performed in test tubes  on the bench in the laboratory not in humans   but they did show that platelet factor four does  contact the surface of this adenovirus vector   when allowed to freely move around in simulations.  Vaccine-induced blood clots typically occur 5 to   24 days after vaccination which is the time frame  where you're going to get an antibody response.   Now complete elucidation of what truly happens  has not completely been worked out but this   schematic provides the best evidence that we have  as to what's happening so far. Now first someone   will get vaccinated and somehow the vector enters  the bloodstream either by an injection that does   not truly go into the muscle in other words  it goes into a small blood vessel directly   due to injection technique or more specifically  lack of aspiration and the needle is actually in   the blood vessel when the injection occurs. If  there's damage to tiny capillary blood vessels   as the needle is inserted where small amounts  of the vaccine might be able to gain access to   the bloodstream even though the vaccine might  be placed correctly into the deltoid muscle   this could be the case as well. Perhaps there's  another mechanism which I haven't thought of where   some vaccine particles can actually access the  bloodstream. Then in schematic two as you can see   there is that electrostatic positive and negative  attraction of platelet factor 4 to the vector   and the complex then gets engulfed by other  cells because they see it as being foreign.   They send it to one of your lymph nodes which  then stimulates the b cells in the lymph nodes   to generate anti platelet factor four antibodies  or antibodies against the whole complex. Now these   antibodies then activate platelets and a number of  factors are released which causes more platelets   to clump together in more platelet factor four  ultimately it causes clot formation and thus the   syndrome of vaccine-induced blood clots and low  platelets. Again the platelets are low because   all of the platelets are bound within the clot and  they're not freely circulating in the bloodstream.   Now this is important research for many reasons  as I mentioned earlier. This key feature   is that this happens in the bloodstream and while  we can't definitively say that this happens due to   vaccination technique it could certainly be. It's  obviously important when injecting the needle into   the deltoid muscle that you deliver the vaccine  into the muscle and not into a tiny blood vessel.   As I mentioned previously on this particular  video this does happen based on surveys of nurses   that have given intramuscular injections  over the years. Many of them have said   that they have aspirated blood just before they're  about to inject the intramuscular injection and so   they always check before they inject. Now it would  be terrible to find out down the road that this is   something to do with side effects that's the lack  of aspiration when it could have been preventable.   Of course we don't know that that's definitely the  cause there's lots of vaccinations going on and a   randomized trial would be interesting and could  definitively answer the question. It wouldn't be   that difficult to do. You would obviously need  a lot of patience given the low frequency of   the side effects involved but of course we  are vaccinating a lot of people right now.   I have told my patients who have encouraged  vaccination to make sure that they ask the   person doing the vaccination to aspirate before  injection. It's such a small accommodation of only   about three seconds. It makes me think about all  the requests that my patients often ask me for,   reasonable requests. I think of things like  medications that they may or may not want before   a procedure or at other times sometimes they have  requests of getting them positioned in a certain   spot for their endoscopy just before I'm about  to sedate them they might want an extra pillow   or a pillow between their knees to make sure that  their back is comfortable while they're asleep for   20 minutes. If their accommodations are reasonable  and not harmful, I always follow their wishes.   Often it doesn't take any additional time  but it shows that I care. It shows people   that I'm listening to them and it allows for  shared decision making which is crucial in   the doctor-patient relationship. It ultimately  means that they will be happy and so will I.   Asking for someone to aspirate before injecting  as I did before both of my vaccinations is not   much to ask for even if it's not the usual way  that the vaccinator might perform their task.   Healthcare providers should always be receptive  to those that they're delivering care to   being inflexible or emphatic in their beliefs  and deciding that it's their way or the highway   so to speak that has no place in medicine. Thanks  for joining me today on Medicine with Dr. Moran.   I'm Dr. Keith Moran. Get healthy and stay healthy.",0.530831094193163

138,A60-U9R3vVc,&#39;Do You Agree That The Covid Vaccine Saves Lives?&#39;: Sylvia Garcia Relentlessly Grills GOP Witness,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On July 16th, 2021, a reporter asked President Biden what his message was to social media platforms when it came to COVID19 disinformation. He replied, quote, they're killing people, end quote. I know one of our missing witnesses referenced that quote earlier, but I can't ask him about those questions because he's been excused. Now, if you look at the chart behind me, this represents the consequences of vaccine signs denialism. The arrow points to May 2021, when the vaccine became widely available in the United States. The deaths to the right of the arrow represent the continued wrath of COVID on our country, mostly among unvaccinated people in Texas and the southern US. And as you can see, 200,000 lives could have been saved. That's how many people were killed. Now, we use the same formula that means that 15,000 lives could have been saved in Chairman Jordan's state of Ohio, or 5,000 lives could have been saved in Chairman Johnson's state That's a lot of people. Many communities across the United States have been utterly devastated by COVID. Y'all know I represent parts of Houston, a big city, but I was born and raised in a small Texas rural community. In Duval County, where I was born, one out of 151 people died of COVID. In a similar community like Lamb County, Texas, nearly one out of every 100 people was killed by COVID. This death rate was one of the highest in the country and three times that of the nation of a whole. In fact, across the country, rural America's death rate has been nearly 40 percent higher than that of those in cities. This is tragically sad, and I believe it's vaccine denialism that costs these American deaths. Only 56 percent of rural residents are fully vaccinated versus 67 percent of their urban counterparts. In my home state of Texas, it's estimated that 2,000 lives could have been saved if we had reached the vaccination levels of places like Vermont or Connecticut. Mr. Sauer, you signed the Missouri v. Biden's plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction. That motion claims that Biden's statement that the social media companies are quote, killing people by letting vaccine disinformation spread was somehow illegal censorship. I frankly could not disagree with you more strongly, but I have a simple fact question for you today. Mr. Sauer, do you agree that COVID vaccine saves lives? Just a yes or no, please. Mr. Sauer, I ask for a yes or no. Yes, two simple words. Yes or no. So you're Harvard trained, you pretend to be an expert here, and you cannot answer the simple question of whether or not you agree that COVID vaccine saves lives. Gentlemen, Mr. Sauer, can you put the microphone on? Mr. Sender, will you answer my question since it looks like our Harvard colleague over there cannot? Yes, I believe vaccine save lives. Thank you. Mr. Sauer, you also signed the Missouri versus Biden second amended complaint, which criticized Twitter for removing content suggesting that quote face masks do not work to reduce transmission or to protect against COVID19. Well, as a journalist in Texas did a lot of the work that apparently you haven't and compiled 49 studies all showing that masks effectively reduce the rate of COVID transmission. Mr. Sauer, yes or no again. Do you agree that face masks stop the transmission of COVID? I refer you to the the yes or no question. Again, Congresswoman, I refer you to no question, sir. I refer you. It is my time. I want a yes or no. If that's too hard for you, then I'll just move on. So I'll ask you, Mr. Ziegerman, do you agree that face masks stop the transmission of COVID? My understanding is the scientific evidence is yes, it does. Right. So Mr. Sauer, your motion for preliminary injunction claims that even US Department of Health and Human Services efforts to gather information about how widespread COVID19 disinformation could somehow be censorship. Knowing how the American people are being liked to is not censorship, but I guess you might be scared what the data will show. Mr. Sauer, again, a yes or no. Do you believe that public health experts need data about the impact of disinformation in order to stop people in places like rural Texas from dying from this pandemic? Federal officials should not be demanding data about people's political and social opinions expressed on social media. Yes or no, please. I reiterate what I say. Under the First Amendment, answer my question. Under the First Amendment, federal officials should not be demanding that. Mr. Ziegerman, do you agree that data on disinformation is necessary to help stop these lies from spreading? Yes. Thank you. You're an actual expert on disinformation. Ladies, time is expired. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Thank you. Chair, I now recognize the gentleman from North Dakota, Mr.",0.3285714285714285

140,YhMlZczq4Ns,Which COVID Vaccine Booster is Best? Pfizer vs. Moderna vs. J. Johnson (Update 137)," Welcome to another MedCram COVID19 update. Here's  the question that everyone seems to be asking and   that is: which booster should I take? Well in true  MedCram form, we're going to look at the data   and make a decision. Recently there's been a study  that's come out that has not been published or   peer-reviewed, but is on this pre-print server  that was conducted by a number of experienced   researchers out of a number of universities  across the country and also in medical schools   across the country, including the NIH, and also  major hospital systems like Kaiser-Permanente,   and this study was performed in the United  States, and it looks at just that question.  So it takes a look at people who have been  vaccinated with Moderna, people who have been   vaccinated with Johnson and Johnson, and people who  have been vaccinated with Pfizer, and they waited   about 12 weeks and they randomized them to receive  a Moderna booster, a Johnson  and Johnson booster, and a   Pfizer booster. In each one of these categories,  there were about 50 in each of these groups,   and they split it evenly, so that 25 in each  group was less than the age of 55 and 25 were   greater than the age of 55. And as it turns out,  there was 154 in the Moderna group, 150 in the   Johnson and Johnson group, and 154 in the Pfizer  group. So a total of 458 subjects in this study.   And what these scientists wanted to ask is what  was the safety data like for each one of these   categories, and what was the efficacy data like in  terms of the ability to mount an antibody response?   Well, let's take a look at the data. So let's look  first at the safety data, and what we see here   is we see the cohort that had Johnson  and Johnson as the original vaccination,   and then were boosted with the Moderna vaccine, but  notice that in this study they used the full dose   Moderna vaccine, because that's what they  had available to them. Currently, though, if   you were to go and get a booster shot with the  Moderna vaccine you would get the 50 microgram   dose or what is known as the half dose. Be aware of  that Moderna is the only one out of these three   that have reduced the dosages for the booster shot . Also notice that there are three different colors   here in terms of the graph. There is the light,  which is mild. There is the darker, which is the   amount of moderate reaction, and then there is  the darkest which is the most severe. So what   we're going to do is we're going to look back  and forth here at the different slides, because   if you have had the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, we  want to see how these side effect profiles look. If   you were to have the Moderna vaccin,e if you were  to have the Johnson Johnson vaccine as a booster,   or if you were to have the Pfizer vaccine as  a booster. So this is what it looks like, here, if you focus on this first box, is if you were  Johnson and Johnson getting the Moderna booster,  and this is what it would look like if  you had Johnson and Johnson and gotten   the Johnson and Johnson booster, again as  the second shot, you can see that there are   a little bit more severe reactions here under  malaise or fatigue and the amount of pain   and tenderness at the local site has gone up  just a little bit, which is perfectly normal   and acceptable for a vaccine side effect, and  let's also remember that a lot of these symptoms   are the results of the immune response that we're  hoping to get with the vaccines in the first place.   And here is the boosting with the Pfizer  vaccine. You can see a little bit less   in the way of severity, but still a little bit on  the higher side, so not much difference in terms   of which of the three would give you the more side  effects. Okay let's concentrate now on those that   got Moderna as their original vaccination and look  and see what would happen if they got a booster   with Moderna. You can see here that there  is a side effect profile that you can see.  There is more moderate symptoms here as you can  see with Moderna what would happen if they got the   Johnson and Johnson as a booster. Here you can see  also some moderate side effects, especially in the   headache, myalgia, and fatigue category. What about  if Moderna patients got the Pfizer booster? And   you can see here that there seems to be a little  bit more mild reaction to those who get the Pfizer   booster who had Moderna originally. Okay let's  finally look at those who got the Pfizer vaccine.   In this case, those who got the Pfizer vaccine and  get the Moderna boost, you can see that there is   some side effects there in terms of moderate  myalgia, malaise, headache, etc. When I say side   effects, I'm referring to the effects that we would  expect to have happen if somebody got a vaccine,   but would be considered a negative on the face of  it, but something completely expected in this case.   For those who had the Pfizer vaccine and get  the Johnson and Johnson booster, you can see   that there's also a little bit higher levels in  this area of malaise and headache, but not much   different. And finally those going for their third  shot of Pfizer, that would be the Pfizer booster   for those that had Pfizer before, you can see  here again a very similar type of profile and   while these symptoms after the vaccine boost were  quite frequent, most if not all of them went away   quite shortly after the boost. Now, let's talk about  efficacy, and here again we're going to be looking   at very similar types of situations in this graph. e We're looking at the IgG binding to s2pwa1 which   is basically using spike protein as a surrogate  for immunity. So in other words, what we're looking   at here is, how well do the antibodies or the IgG  that's made after the booster, how well does it   bind the spike protein that we see in SARS-CoV-2?  And in this case, it's a surrogate of   the actual viral spike protein, so the higher the  numbers here, the better the immune reaction from   the booster shot. And what we're looking at here is  looking at the amount of IgG binding on day one, so   that's basically the baseline and you can actually  get a lot of information just by looking at all   of these different day ones on all of these  different graphs. And so what we have here is   those with the Johnson and Johnson here in the  first column getting a Moderna boost, those here   Johnson and Johnson getting a Johnson and Johnson  boost, and in the first column Johnson and Johnson   getting a Pfizer boost, but before we go to that,  looking at the boost. Let's just take a look at   where things stand. On the first day, you can see  here that the antibodies from the Johnson and   Johnson is considerably and consistently lower  than the Moderna and or the Pfizer, and this goes   along with what we've seen clinically in terms  of prevention of hospitalization. So I do believe   that this surrogate marker is actually predictive  of clinical outcomes. So the higher this goes,   potentially, the better protection one would get  from getting a booster. Also remember too that this   scale here on the y-axis is logarithmic, so the  higher up you go, the bigger the differences are.   Now again, I want you to remember that this is the  full dose for Moderna, not the half dose that you   might pick up when you went to go get your actual  booster shot. Let's talk about what happened. So   those who get the J and J shot, what happens  when they get a Moderna booster? You can see   that there's quite a rise in those antibodies. What  happens when J and J gets a J and J booster? Not much   of a rise in comparison to the full dose Moderna.  What happens when a Johnson and Johnson gets a Pfizer   booster? You can see there that there is quite  a bit of a jump. So I would say for a J and J   person, they should either get the Moderna or  the Pfizer booster. What about those that have   Moderna to begin with? You can see here that out  of all three, typically the Moderna recipients   have the highest binding antibody levels, so  the question is, what happens when they get   a booster of the three different types? A Moderna  being boosted by a Moderna does go up even still.   A Moderna going up with a Johnson and Johnson  does actually go up, and if you compare   the 29-day in both cases, it's actually not too  different. A Moderna however being boosted with a   Pfizer seems to go up even higher than either one,  and the reason again why we don't have day 29 data   on the Pfizer boost there on the far  right is because this is a preliminary   data release, and that data has not yet come  in. So one can make the judgment here that   when you compare this to this one even still a  Moderna vaccinated with the Moderna gives you   the highest antibody levels anywhere on this chart.  And so it could still be reasonably argued that   even though you've had Moderna before and you're  gonna get a booster, it might be best to get   Moderna for a third shot, but again we're still  missing this data. We don't know where this is   going to go afterwards. Let's talk about those that  have had the Pfizer vaccine. So those that have   the Pfizer vaccine and get the Moderna do go up  significantly here. Those that get the Pfizer and   boost with Johnson and Johnson don't seem to go up  as much, and those that have the Pfizer and boost   with the Pfizer do seem to go up as much as those  with the boost for Moderna. Remember, we don't have   some of this data and also this is full dose that  we're testing here, and what's actually available   for a booster is the half dose. Another way of  looking at this is looking at the neutralizing   antibody titers in the same situations that  we looked at before, and as you can see here   the results were nearly identical to looking at  the IgG binding to the spike protein surrogate.   So of note, if we're interested in looking at the  efficacy of a booster on top of a fully vaccinated   person, then the question is what does a randomized  placebo-controlled trial show and the results of   such a randomized placebo-controlled trial was  published as a press release on October 21st   from Pfizer. This has not been peer reviewed  or published as yet, but Pfizer's record in   terms of releasing data in press releases has been  pretty good, and the numbers have turned out to be   pretty accurate. So because of that, we shared  these numbers here, so what they basically did   is they took fully vaccinated patients with two  shots of the Pfizer vaccine and there was about 10,000 subjects in this study, which was randomized  one to one with a third shot of the Pfizer vaccine   and placebo and the participants in this study  were 16 years and older, and remember now that's   a little bit different than what the FDA recently  allowed for boosters, but again this is the trials,   the phase three trials, for the booster and in  terms of the ages you probably want to know   how many of these were in what age category.  What they have told us is that the median age   was 53 years of age and that 23 of the people  in this cohort were above the age of 65 years.   Again, they've told us that there were 10,000 in  this study, so we're assuming that there were about   5,000 in each arm since it was a one-to-one study  and they began looking for symptoms seven days   after the shot. They finally reached the end point  in the study with five cases in the intervention   group. The people that got the third shot of the  Pfizer vaccine the booster and there were 109   cases of symptomatic COVID in the placebo group.  So again we're looking for symptomatic COVID19.   And because of those cases, they're saying  that there was a 95.6 percent efficacy   of the vaccine to prevent symptomatic  COVID19 in patients who have already had   two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Now I'm going to  make some assumptions here that if there were 5000   in both groups and the mean follow-up time was  about 2.5 months, which is important to understand,   and that means if they had five cases in 5,000  that would mean that there was a .00  chance of having symptomatic COVID  in the intervention group, and about 0.0218 chances of having COVID with just two shots  of the Pfizer vaccine. So you can see these are   pretty low. Here you have a one in one thousand  chance as the absolute risk, and over here you   have about a two percent absolute risk. So the  real key that we need to know in terms of the   value of an intervention is what is the absolute  risk reduction? The absolute risk reduction is   simply one minus the other, and in that case  the absolute risk reduction is 0.0. Now you'll know from statistics that if you want  to prevent one person from having symptomatic   COVID19, how many people need to get the booster  to prevent one of those people from getting   symptomatic COVID19? That's known as the  number needed to treat or in this case the   number needed to vaccinate and that's simply  the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction,   and in this case that's about 48. And to give  you an idea of what this means, to prevent death   in somebody with a stroke TIA or myocardial  infarction, giving an aspirin to them daily   given to 67 people, in fact, will prevent one death,  and that's a little bit less effective than what   we're seeing here in terms of the number of people  that need to get one immunization to prevent one   of these people from getting symptomatic COVID19  is 48. That's actually not too bad, but remember   of course that it actually could be even better  than 48 because the follow-up time here was only   2.5 months, and I think most people agree that  the vaccine shots, well we don't know how long   they last, probably last longer than 2.5 months.  It'll be interesting to see once this paper   gets published and peer-reviewed what the final  conclusions are, but I thought I'd bring this up   in terms of the data out there and what it is  looking like. Some might be wondering whether   or not this has a higher effect in those that  are older versus younger. Pfizer did say in the   statement that multiple subgroup analysis  of the efficacy were performed and there   was no difference of other core morbidities.  They also mentioned that the adverse events   were consistent with all of the patterns  that had been done before with the initial   vaccination schedule. As always there'll be more  data to come and analyze. Thanks for joining us.",0.4637423312883436
141,RyT3veZRMcg,Program to pay for COVID vaccine injuries seeks $15 million to fix problems," Well, the pandemic, as you know, is over, But thousands of people say they're still struggling with injuries from the COVID vaccine and other treatments. Tonight, our Rebecca Lindstrom investigates the push to fund the federal program that promised to make it right. Lawmakers across the country say our investigation prompted them to demand answers about why it's taking the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program or CICP, so long to process claims. I appreciate you bringing to everybody's attention Congressman Mike Collins saw 11 alives investigation on frustrations. All of this is paperwork mounting with the CICP. People like Collins story recovering from a cascade of health problems after receiving the vaccine. 2 years later, he still has no idea if his claim will be approved. They keep asking for more. It's just roadblock after roadblock. It seems like Collins sat down to talk with the program's director and says part of the problem. Is technology. They did not even have a computer system in place, a software system to handle people making requests or even inquiring about what their status was, which was what you were talking about and and and and Y'all's reporting. The CSEP has asked Congress for $15 million to enhance communication and substantially increase its capacity to review at least 2000 claims, but with nearly 11,000 claims waiting. It would take more than five years to get through them, especially when you consider the CICP has only processed 706 so far. A third of the federal employees have been working from home, and that just doesn't work very well. The budget request asks to hire 42 fulltime employees and claims 34 positions were funded last year. But to date, the CICP has not answered our fundamental question. How many people are actually working? You're asking the same questions that we ask in every agency up here. Isn't that crazy? They don't know how many people they employ. Of the process cases, 684 were denied, only 22 were eligible for compensation, and the average payout so far is $1500. The story say they have a box full of receipts and haven't even started to add them up. His prescription last week was 600. You know, out of pocket. That was out of pocket upfront and you couldn't get it if you didn't have $600.00 upfront. The CICP has recently created an online portal to track claims, and while it may take years to get a response, people who feel they have been injured only have one year to file a claim.",0.4873309817754262

150,lNYnIc94kdM,First Covid Vaccine Given In U.S. As Distribution Begins | NBC Nightly News,"In every corner of the country, Americans have been rolling up their sleeves today. Frontline medical workers in ERs, ICUs and COVID units who've seen firsthand the pandemic's horrors. Among the first, Sandra Lindsay, a critical care nurse in New York. I feel hopeful today, relieved. I feel like healing is coming. Because minor side effects can cause some people to miss a day or two of work, hospitals are staggering who gets it when. All done. Not too bad. At Methodist Health in Dallas, Teresa Mata, who cleans rooms at the hospital, was at the front of the line. They tell me I am the first person to take the vaccine. So, woohoo! Across the country, hope that this is a game changer. Once we get enough people to get vaccinated, we can kiss COVID goodbye. After overnight rush deliveries, the FedEx and UPS shipments began arriving early this morning. FedEx's first delivery was at 5.53 a.m. to a hospital in Boston. UPS's first was at 7.23 a.m. in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Nationwide, 145 sites received shipments today. By the end of the week, 2.9 million doses will arrive at 636 locations in all 50 states. The first priority, medical workers and nursing home residents and staff. Next up, teachers, firefighters, police officers and food handlers. Then those 65 and older or with pre-existing conditions. About to turn 80, Dr. Anthony Fauci expects to get his shot within a week or two. I had been saying by my calculation, sometime by the end of March, the beginning of April, that the normal healthy man and woman in the street who has no underlying conditions would likely get it. Vaccination started today in hard-hit New Orleans. NBC's Sam Brock talked to ICU nurse Macy O'Quinn. In the last nine months, how many times do you think you've cried tears of pain? A lot. Hundreds? Yeah, I could do it right now. The most ambitious vaccination program in history is only just beginning. Vaccinations at nursing homes should begin next week. Meanwhile, Moderna's vaccine could receive FDA approval within 10 days. Thank you for watching.",0.417708834375501

154,9ZfkqBuPePA,Should pregnant women get the Covid vaccine? - BBC News, i think it's understandable to be a little bit confused a little bit anxious about it and just not sure what to do if you're pregnant breastfeeding or just thinking about having a baby then the advice from the experts is you should be offered the COVID vaccine i'm dr stephanie ue i'm a gp and i had my baby during first lockdown there is a history of having vaccines given to pregnant women every pregnant woman is recommended to have the flu vaccine and whooping cough vaccine and those are known to be safe in pregnancy research from the usa involving more than 90 thousand pregnant people who had mainly the pfizer or moderna shot found no safety concerns and now we're beginning to see similar data here in the uk all the data that we've had so far suggests that there is not an increased risk of miscarriage and in fact there is no biological mechanism by which that could happen because we don't think that the vaccine actually crosses the placenta and affects the baby but in the uk only the pfizer and moderna shots are being recommended so far but that may change in the future the experts say you can have your shots at any stage of your pregnancy as you can become ill with covid at any time however a lot of women do feel more vulnerable in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy so i don't think there's any problem in delaying um your vaccination until after 12 weeks if you feel more comfortable to do so so if you decided to wait until after your 12-week scan then you would still be able to get your second shot before entering the third trimester which is the period where kovid is more likely to cause the most harm your baby's not helping you at that point because it's stopping the diet from moving your lungs aren't working in the way that they usually would and so then if you get a an infection a bad infection on top of that it can cause more significant problems what if you've already had a dose of oxford astrazeneca and you were fine well then the recommendation is you still go get your second dose because if you're fine the first time you should be fine the second time as well it's okay to have questions about the vaccine and talking to your gp or your midwife will help you make a decision that's right for you you know it's not like pregnant women are being told you must all have the vaccine ultimately it's your decision you do what you feel is right for you and you're making sure you're getting your information from the right resources you,0.5359167476514415

It's not just a decision that affects you. It's okay to have questions about the Covid vaccine. That's normal. It's good to talk about them though with your doctor or community leaders or even friends and family you trust who have received the vaccine already. Vaccines have been tested rigorously and they've been found to be safe and to prevent people from developing symptoms and getting seriously ill with Covid-19. But now we're starting to see research which suggests a vaccine can prevent people from spreading the virus too. You're vaccinated and your friends and colleagues are vaccinated. That will substantially reduce the risk for everybody. That makes sense. If you're not coughing or sneezing, then it's harder to pass the virus on. If we spread less Covid-19, fewer people get sick and the pandemic will be over sooner. So the current thinking is if you choose to get the vaccine, you're choosing to look after yourself and everyone you come into contact with. If you don't, then you and those people won't have that protection. But scientists say they need to gather more data on this issue before we can be certain that vaccines reduce transmission. But even if it turns out to be true, if too many people don't get their shot, then that makes it easier for the virus to find a way to spread, meaning more people will get ill and die. And if it turns out the vaccine doesn't stop you from spreading the virus, then it's even more important that everyone gets their shots. There is only one victor in a world where a vaccine has and a vaccine has not the virus itself.",0.5592063492063492

160,xLTTAmXkVYg,YouTube Bans Anti-Covid Vaccine Videos After Misinformation Spreads To Vaccines In General,"YouTube says it has had enough of vaccine misinformation on its site. Well, the company is taking down anti-vaccine videos and banning major accounts because it says it needs to quote, remove egregious, harmful content. NBC News senior reporter Brandi Zdrosky joins us now. Brandi, thanks so much for being with us. What was the final straw for YouTube? Why is the company acting right now? Yeah, anti-vaccine misinformation has always really thrived on YouTube. Really, for over a decade, anti-vaccine creators have moved there after traditional media decided to no longer cover them. And the content was actually so rampant that pro-vaccine advocacy organizations, they were actually forced off the platform as far back as 2008. So the difference now is obviously COVID. YouTube explained it to me in a blog post, and they said, this is a quote, we've steadily seen false claims about the coronavirus vaccines spill over into misinformation about vaccines in general. And we're now at a point where it's more important than ever to expand the work we started with COVID19 to other vaccines. So we know then that YouTube is taking down some of the big names in the anti-vaxxer community. What about the smaller channels that are still out there, that are still operating? Yeah, this is a challenge. I heard the good doctor say that we need to take down the big disinformation agents. But a lot of this smaller anti-vaccine misinformation is still there. Listen, banning all anti-vaccine content, it's not going to be easy. It's a complicated content moderation problem because anti-vaxxers are very good at evading the platforms. And so we're just going to have to wait to see how well they do. It's important to note that anti-vaxxers have been very open about the fact that they were going to use COVID as a way in to raise money, to grow their base, and they're not just going to go away now. All right, Brandy Zdravzny, we appreciate your reporting on this. Thank you. Thanks for watching our YouTube channel.

161,nucCr7Sywgc,Second COVID Vaccine Shot Side Effects," This episode was filmed on February 9th, 2021. If we have any updates about COVID19  vaccinations or the pandemic in general, they’ll be in the playlist  linked in the description. [♪♪♪] With the COVID19 vaccines finally  getting into people’s arms, you might’ve heard that your second dose  might feel a little rougher than the first. And it’s true. Participants in clinical  trials, plus the recently vaccinated public, saw more frequent and more intense side  effects on their second jab than their first. This is actually a sign that the  vaccines are working properly. So while you should prepare to feel crummy  for a couple days, it’s a good thing overall! And it might hint at the  possibility of more good news: that people who’ve recovered from  COVID19 could only need one shot! The key thing to understand is  that these reactions to vaccines, things like fever, chills, and other side-effects,  aren’t really from the vaccine itself. They’re natural byproducts of your  immune system learning to fight the germ the vaccine is teaching it to spot. And that response is stronger  after the second shot because the first shot did  what it was supposed to do! To understand what I mean, let’s have  a quick refresher on how vaccines work. In general, vaccines teach your  immune system to spot a pathogen by giving it some harmless version  or just part of it to study. That way, if ever encounters a real  deal, it’ll know how to fight it. We call this adaptive immunity —  but it doesn’t happen immediately. It takes weeks to fully develop the strong,  targeted response that vaccines are aiming for. So the first time a vaccine introduces  your immune system to a new pathogen, any discomfort you feel is something  else: your innate immunity kicking in. This is a generalized first line of defense that  attacks anything the body perceives as a threat. And it can definitely have some  uncomfortable side effects. For instance, within a few hours,  you can have local reactions, which are things like pain and  redness at the injection site or tenderness in the armpit of the  arm that received the injection. You can also have systemic  reactions that point to a more widespread activation of your immune system. These are symptoms like fatigue,  headache, and all over muscle pain. But often, these side-effects are  minor, or maybe not noticeable at all. What matters is what’s  happening in the background. While your innate immunity is doing its thing, the immune cells that do the  heavy lifting in adaptive immunity   are studying the foreign material and building up targeted weapons like antibodies. That way, by the time you get  your second dose of the vaccine, your adaptive immunity has the  tools it needs to fight the invader. And it does. That, too, can set off local  and systemic reactions. So following your second shot, you get both  innate and adaptive immunity acting at once! Which is why the side effects  are often more severe. This strong, dual immune  reaction also ensures your body takes the threat seriously and ramps  up its defenses against it even more. So as much as we dislike  the potential side-effects, the result is lasting protection from the virus. Now, some people get the  short end of the stick here. Thanks to their unique  experiences and genetic makeup, they really feel it when their immune  system gets riled up, while others don’t. And we don’t totally know why. But, if you’re going to feel crummy, the odds  are higher it’ll happen in dose number two. And that’s not news—that’s exactly what was  seen in the clinical trials for these vaccines. For example, across all age  groups in the Moderna trial, more participants reported some  kind of local or systemic reaction on their second dose of the vaccine. And something similar was seen with the BioNTech  vaccine, now being distributed by Pfizer. While pain at the injection site was  more common after the first dose, the researchers noted more redness  and swelling after the second dose, as well as more body-wide reactions  like fatigue, fever, and muscle pain. Thankfully, in trials, these effects almost  always went away after two or three days. There’s also nothing really special  about the side effects occurring now. You’re hearing about them because lots of  people are getting vaccinated all at once, and this is a really big deal,  and everyone is talking about it. But these side effects are on  par with what’s seen following other multi-dose vaccines given to adults. Take Shingrix, for example—a shingles vaccine  you might get if you’re over 50 years old. Most people get a sore arm, while some  feel fatigue, headaches, or muscle pain that lasts a couple of days. That said, some people who’ve already had  COVID19 are reporting something different: they seem to be having those stronger,  “second-dose” side effects after dose one. That may be because the disease itself  can act kind of like a first vaccine dose, in that it teaches the immune  system to spot the virus. So, the first dose of the vaccine may be having  similar effects to everyone else’s booster. What’s nifty about that is that it  could mean they only need one dose. To be clear, the vast majority of the  clinical trials for these vaccines have only used a two-dose vaccination strategy. So no one has tested this one-vaccine hypothesis! But two recent preprint articles  concluded that we might be able to reallocate the limited doses of the  mRNA vaccines being distributed by Pfizer and Moderna without compromising safety. One found that people who had  recovered from COVID19 developed at least ten times as many  antibodies after one dose of an mRNA vaccine as previously  healthy people who got two. And the other found that healthcare  workers who had previously had COVID19 had antibody levels on par with folks  who got two doses of the mRNA vaccines but had never been infected. That might mean that previously  infected individuals might only need one shot to protect them long term! And if that’s the case, we may be able to  give that second vaccine dose to someone else, and hopefully get people vaccinated even faster. Now, each of these studies only  had a few hundred participants, and neither has been peer-reviewed, so we  can’t start making sweeping statements yet. And there are no changes in policy or anything. So, in the meantime, keep doing what your  medical professionals tell you to do! Still, if you have had COVID19, be warned  your first vaccine shot could be the rough one. And for everyone else, it might be helpful  to set your expectations ahead of time. Yes, there’s a good chance you’ll feel  bad after your second dose in particular, and need to take a day or  two to rest and recuperate. But it’ll be worth it, because these  expected temporary side effects are way less intense and debilitating  than getting a bad case of COVID19, and we all just want to get through this  pandemic so we can relax a little bit.

COVID19, a virus orders of magnitude smaller than a particle of dust, has turned daily life on earth into something deeply unfamiliar. In the ten or so months since it first emerged, the virus has settled at a steady clip of killing 5,000 people per day, or nearly a million total, currently. It has played havoc with the world economy, plunging the globe into the worst economic crisis since World War Two. It has interrupted an era of mounting globalization, and pushed us into a more insular, nationalistic state. The effects of this virus are truly all encompassing and consistently dreadful, but time has bestowed upon us a reward for our patience. We are potentially nearing the beginning of the end, meaning we could now be at the end of the middle. That end of this virus will take far longer than the beginning—we’re likely far from halfway through the pandemic in terms of time—but the slow decline in dreadfulness is potentially on the horizon. That’s because a vaccine is coming. There was previously a period of doubt on whether an effective vaccine could be developed, it’s never a sure shot, but all indications currently suggest, given the unprecedented extent of scientific effort, that it is indeed coming. The only and paramount question is when. Right now, in September, 2020, all attention is focused on the late-October, early-November timeframe. That’s the earliest possible moment when any of the frontrunner vaccines, from major manufacturers including AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Moderna, could enter regulatory review. If all the data confidently point to the vaccine exhibiting an acceptable level of safety and effectiveness, it is possible that one of these will then be granted emergency use authorization by the American FDA, or its equivalent by other major national regulators. It’s worth noting that this is far from a sure-shot, but experts do say that having a vaccine in 2020 is a less-than-long-shot possibility. However, it is almost certain that you will not be injected by a COVID19 vaccine in the year 2020. It is possible, but for the average person, when you actually get a dose of a COVID vaccine has much less to do with when it’s approved, and more with how fast it is manufactured and distributed. The full effects of the pandemic—health, social, and economic—will not end until a critical mass of people are vaccinated. That means that when we get back to normal life has much more to do with when the last person is vaccinated, rather than the first. This is why some have said that the fast distribution of a vaccine will be an even greater challenge than the development itself. This process, this challenge of getting the majority of the world's population vaccinated, can quite legitimately be described as the most daunting and consequential single logistical challenge ever. The stakes have never been higher, but the challenge has also never been greater. Let's look at why. First and foremost, it's a scale problem. Shipping and administering one vaccine to one person is not difficult, but shipping and administering five billion vaccines to five billion people is. That’s because there just isn't enough room in our world's logistics network, as it is now, to do that. Making it even tougher, there’s more chance than not, based on the current leading candidates, that the first major vaccine to be approved will require two doses administered 21 or 28 days apart. That doubles the challenge. Distributing ten or more billion doses of a vaccine would be difficult enough in normal times, but these are far from normal times. With international travel all but nonexistent—currently sitting at more than 90 percent down—passenger airlines have dramatically cut back their international route networks. Now, this is an issue because traditionally, some 50 percent of pharmaceuticals are shipped in the belly-hold of passenger aircraft, rather than on dedicated freighters, as this can help get them closer to their final destination faster. With limited passenger service, overall cargo capacity is down about 30 percent, while cargo demand is only about 15 percent down, meaning there is already a supply crunch. This has led to existing dedicated freighter aircraft being used more, additional dedicated freighters coming into service, but still, due to constrained supply, a dramatic increase in shipping costs. Even already, before the COVID vaccine comes into the global logistics network, pharmaceutical manufacturers have had to come up with new techniques to ship their goods including, for example, flying their product to where shipping rates are cheaper and trucking them to their final destination or charteri ng private planes. Of course, the world already experienced a massive logistics challenge this year with the distribution of personal protective equipment, and shippers were able to scale up for that reasonably successfully, but there’s one simple reason why it won’t be so easy this time around: the cold chain. Vaccines are temperature-sensitive. Most all of them have to be stored in a highly precise, climate controlled environment in order to stay safe and effective. So, the cold chain is the supply chain suited to shipping goods that need to be kept cold or frozen, such as meat, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Of course, the difficulty with the cold chain is that everything used has to be specialized—the origin warehouse, the truck, the plane, the en-route warehouse, and the final destination each need to have the equipment to keep the goods at the specified temperature or the goods have to be shipped in packaging that keeps them at the specified temperature. Both options are complicated and complication compounded by other complication is what makes a true logistical challenge. It doesn’t end there, though. One of the leading vaccine candidates, Pfizer’s BNT162b2, must be stored and transported at around -90 °F, or -68 °C. That is far, far colder than the requirements of most vaccines, which can ship either at refrigerated temperatures or a wider range of freezing temperatures. A thermal requirement such as this is a whole different ball-game, and it means that they'll be able to use only a subset of cold chain infrastructure, which is already a subset of the overall logistics infrastructure. Beyond the issue of actually getting such a vaccine to a distribution site, most hospitals don't even have facilities to keep a vaccine at such a temperature, let alone clinics or pharmacies, meaning that even finding places that can receive this vaccine is a challenge. Part of the reason why this obstacle has come up is that traditionally, vaccines are thoroughly tested to determine what sort of storage and shipping conditions they can endure while still staying safe and effective, but with the breakneck pace of development for these COVID19 vaccines, there likely will not have been enough time to conduct these tests before distribution, meaning they'll have to keep the standards at what's already proven. So, to reiterate, already, a likely vaccine will only be able to be shipped through a subset of a subset of a subset of an already strained logistics network, to a subset of sites, and it'll need to happen many billions of times, but even the solutions to these challenges present additional challenges. Pfizer, for example, knowing that the unique distribution requirements of their vaccine could limit its commercial success, has developed a partial solution. It’s essentially a highly specialized stand-alone box that can, with the use of dry ice, keep the vaccine at the required temperature for up to ten days. This means that, hypothetically, the vaccine could be shipped through a more traditional logistics network, however, this box has highly specific requirements. For one, upon arrival, it can only be opened twice per day, not more than one-minute at a time, in order to keep the vaccines at the required temperature. That means that a distribution site would need to accurately predict how many doses they would need in a given day before that day—if they take out too little, they’d be slowing the process by not vaccinating everyone they can, but if they take out too much, they’d have potentially life-saving vaccines go to waste at the end of the day. Also, this box can only carry vaccines in multiples of a thousand, and keep in mind that it only keeps cold for ten days. So, how, for example, do you go about getting the vaccine to a clinic that can only vaccinate fifty people in a day—like a rural clinic in a small town. Even if shipping was instantaneous, they could only vaccinate five-hundred people in ten-days, meaning half their vaccines would go bad. Pfizer is apparently developing a smaller temperature-controlled box to solve this problem, but that means adding a whole other type of distribution, which increases complexity, which slows the process down. In its scenario planning, the American CDC mapped out a distribution process for if both Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines are approved and, if this happened, the Pfizer vaccine would be directed to only large distribution sites that would either have the facilities for ultra-cold storage, or the capacity to vaccine enough people that the short shelf-life of these vaccines wouldn't be an issue. Then, the Moderna vaccine, which only requires traditional freezer temperatures, would be directed to smaller sites with less advanced facilities. This would certainly create a scenario in the US, and likely elsewhere, where the Pfizer vaccine would be primarily distributed to people in cities, while the Moderna vaccine would be the vaccine of choice for rural areas. Another challenge that needs to be confronted is the order of operations for distribution. The Coronavirus affects different people in different ways. This means that if we want a vaccine to save the the most number of lives possible, the first person in line should be that who is most susceptible to COVID19, and the last person in line should be that who is least susceptible. One set of research modeled two scenarios—the first where, of the first 3 billion doses available, 50 high-income countries buy up 2 billion of them. The second was where the first 3 billion doses were distributed to countries proportionally based on their population, regardless of wealth. In this model, twice as many people died overall with the first scenario—the wealthy countries first scenario—than the equitable, proportional approach. However, for vaccination purposes, it is the least wealthy countries, arguably those that need the vaccine most, that are toughest to distribute to. Poor countries tend to have limited cold chain infrastructure, let alone normal logistics infrastructure, and fragmented, poorly-funded healthcare systems. Distributing and administering a complex vaccine like Pfizer’s will already be tough enough in the wealthy countries like the United States, but just imagine how difficult it will be to get a vaccine from distributor to someone’s arm in rural Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, in ten days, while keeping it at -90 °F. How soon a COVID vaccine is administered will quite directly correlate to how many lives are saved. Every day of delay will, with certainty, lead to more death and despair. The manufacturers are working as fast as they can, they are already producing millions of doses of their vaccines before they’re approved so they can be distributed as fast as possible, and regulatory agencies have been preparing for months for an unprecedentedly fast review process, so it is now truly down to every member of the global logistics network to save lives. Of course, many of those that will be involved, especially once we get to wide-scale distribution, will be companies, not governments or nonprofits, and for them, this presents a massive business opportunity—in addition to the positive public relations potential. UPS, for example, has built two freezer farms in Louisville, Kentucky, and Venlo, Netherlands, near their hubs, which can each hold 48,000 doses and can go down to the temperatures required for the Pfizer vaccine. DHL and FedEx too are reportedly massively upscaling their cold-chain infrastructure to be able to handle some of the surge in demand, while other lesser known logistics companies are too. Ultimately, though, its tough to find someone in-the-know who doesn’t admit that shipping will be a bottleneck. We already know it’s not going to go perfectly, so right now, it’s about doing as much work as possible to make sure the process goes as well as it can be. This will come down to making sure that as much planning work as possible is done now, before the vaccine is approved, so that distribution can happen as fast as possible when that does happen. Now is the time to figure out how and where the vaccine will be distributed. If you are a healthy, relatively young person thinking selfishly, you should care tremendously about the distribution process, because you are at the back of the line. When you get your shot, when you get to start letting your guard down, has everything to do with how fast everyone in front of you gets theirs, and how fast they get theirs will also impact how many of them will die. We know this process will not be perfect, and it wouldn't be reasonable to ask for perfect given the complexity of the challenge, but if we truly put every effort into planning and preparing for this now, and create a system that orders people by need, rather than wealth, we can at least know, at the end of this, that no lives could have been saved if only the vaccine got to them faster. For our collective consciousness, looking back far in the future, this moment will be defined not by when we get to go back to concerts or parties or the gym, but rather by how many lives we saved when confronting what is hopefully the greatest global challenge of this generation.

166,w_5zQzIb5Uc,How does Moderna&#39;s Coronavirus vaccine work?, it all started with isolation of the virus from an infected patient in china the coronavirus was sequenced and its genetic information was uploaded to a public database working together scientists at the nih and moderna identify the sequence for a key protein on the surface of the virus called the spike protein as a good vaccine candidate  the instructions for making the spike protein were then encoded into an instruction molecule called mrna which could be administered directly to patients as a vaccine the vaccine is injected just like other vaccines the mrna is taken to immune cells where it instructs cells to make copies of the spike protein as if the cells had been infected by the coronavirus other immune cells shown here as red and orange figures are then able to learn about the spike protein and develop ways to protect the person if they ever come into contact with the actual coronavirus what makes this approach different is that you don't need to make the virus itself to make a vaccine a time-consuming and intensive process instead you use the information from the virus and administer the information directly to the patient essentially the patient makes their own vaccine this cuts out the middleman using this approach nih and moderna were able to go from sequence to a vaccine ready for human testing in record time just 42 days,0.4416666666666666

It's been almost 40 years since HIV was first identified, yet there remains no vaccine, while a COVID vaccine was developed in record time. In a single person who has HIV, they have many, many variants just within their own body. UIC infectious disease director Dr. Richard Novak says HIV mutates rapidly and hides in a body for a long time, which makes vaccine development very challenging. But, he says, there is hope. We've learned a lot over the last 30-some years of trying to develop a vaccine, and we understand better what kind of immune responses we need to generate. Novak has spent his career working on HIV vaccine trials and treatments. UIC is currently enrolling participants for a Johnson & Johnson HIV vaccine trial to begin in July. While Dr. Novak says the HIV vaccine looks promising, don't expect it to have the same efficacy as COVID vaccines. Novak says 50 percent would be considered successful. HIV advocates hope the worldwide cooperation, collaboration and funding for COVID vaccines will help with an HIV vaccine. After all, researchers say COVID vaccines were based on research already done for HIV vaccines. The fact that there has been so much interest and that your everyday person is chatting about vaccines and epidemiology sitting on their couch, like, that's a really good thing. We can harness that. But Jim Pickett, an advocate with AIDS Foundation Chicago, says there have been great scientific advancements with treatments and prevention that have kept people alive, including himself. I tested positive in 95. I really expected to never see my 50th birthday. Scientists and researchers are confident the tools are finally in place to end the HIV epidemic soon.

170,wWCLBraM4gE,Covid vaccine: First &#39;milestone&#39; vaccine offers 90% protection - BBC News, we're going to bring you right up to date with our breaking story this hour that announcement that trials carried out by the u.s pharmaceutical giant pfizer and the german manufacturer bioentech suggests they have created a coronavirus vaccine which is more than 90 percent effective our health correspondent anna collinson joins me now anna we've been hearing uh from the ceo of pfizer saying this is a great day for science and humanity and a significant step forward it feels that way is it yes definitely it definitely feels like a huge milestone you know with with these vaccines they're one of the greatest tools that we have to get out of the lockdown restrictions that some of us are living in the social distancing not being able to see our loved ones vaccines are seen as a tool to help us get there and this is a huge moment so this vaccine has jointly been developed by the u.s drugs corporation pfizer and the german company by in tech and it's the studies enrolled more than 43 thousand people from across six different countries and they say the vaccine so far with as part of ongoing trials is ninety percent effective in preventing COVID19 infections and they say there's no serious safety concerns but they do have to keep collecting data these two companies are now calling for the ability to have emergency licensing so they can get this vaccine out to the general public as quickly as possible ideally before christmas and that is the big question what needs to happen now so that it can become available quickly well while this data is extremely encouraging and this does feel like an extremely positive moment the trials are still ongoing and what's most important with when you are thinking about a vaccine is safety there are also lots of caveats that come with this vaccine so for example it's reported the vaccine would need to be kept at -80 degrees so there are issues about how you would roll this out to places you know we're talking about in england nhs england are talking about preparing gps and pharmacists to administer a vaccine how are they going to be able to store that vaccine in a minute there's not enough cold storage well exactly exactly how are you going to get that out across across the globe to everywhere and have that stored appropriately you're also battling attitude certain people don't want to be vaccinated they don't trust it they don't believe in it um and also it's also important to point out that this vaccine probably almost certainly won't work for everyone multiple different types of vaccines will be needed like what we see with a seasonal flu for example and also it just won't work for some people so other measures will still be needed so when they say it's 90 effective have they broken that down does that mean across every age group because obviously there's more concern for the elderly and the vulnerable so what we have at the moment and as you know this story's only broken in the last hour or so as they are saying 90 across the board but they have covered a wide range of groups of people people as young as 16 uh people with hiv and hepatitis c so and they've covered people from across six different countries so they do have a real overview of what's going on but another question that often springs up and we're talking about vaccine how long would it be effective for do we know that well again this is this is it you know they're trialling a vaccine that up until now it's it's however old you know it could be working up to this point but we don't know so it's all about trying to um get as much data as possible and uh being as hopeful as possible getting it out as quickly as possible and testing and making it sure it's as safe as possible but yeah the hope is that it would uh deal with the symptoms the concern is it may not completely tackle the infection okay anna stay with us we're going to bring in dr sophie harman who is global health expert and professor of international politics at queen mary university london sophie your reaction to this news from pfizer well of course it's very exciting i think you know the world has been waiting for this vaccine so i think it's a testament to how pharmaceutical companies scientists governments have been working together however let's not get carried away as your correspondent was just saying there is an issue of safety scale we still don't know a lot about it but there is a pause for thought this does come with some cautions though this shouldn't be a reason for us to take you know the foot off the pedal with in terms of getting the basics right around tracking the virus test and trace and things like that we still need those vaccines are not a silver bullet and again we have this wider question of trust and access and i think these are the two issues that are going to really come into play globally what needs to be done about that issue sophie because actually in the past 10 minutes we've heard from the german health minister as well and he has said we're really going to need a high level of acceptance of a vaccine like this for it to be effective what can the health professionals governments do to you know ensure that that exists amongst the public well this is a huge challenge and i think the one thing is there is good will towards science and public health so trying to increase transparency around the trials i think having a lot of volunteers participate also helps so people can understand that this isn't science happening somewhere in a laboratory it involves us as citizens as well but of course it's about countering these false narratives around concerns around vaccines it's about not necessarily dismissing people but meeting where the kind of unease is and trying to explain it it's also about community mobilizing so we know that in previous anti-vaccination issues actually having building trust within community among community leaders is huge so it's not just about world leaders or public health officials you know making announcements around the safety of vaccines it's about looking at community healthcare workers and community politicians really driving home that message of trust you mentioned world leaders they do have a very big role to play though and the news today that joe biden is setting up a task force straight away that is his main priority as he is president-elect now of the us what do you make of that sophie and the importance of that moment of saying i'm making upper task force it's going to have scientists experts republicans democrats but you know we're going to tackle this and science is going to be you know the main argument that we use now yeah absolutely so joe biden was consistent on the campaign trail that he was going to follow the science and you know day one as president-elect or working day one he's come out with this task force now remember there were scientists and public health officials on trump's task force for COVID19 but it was led by vice president mike pence not the case with biden he's got three scientific scientists and public health officials leading this and not only that he's saying right you tell me what to do i'm going to follow you now that's not the whole case because of course biden is going to have to do some really sophisticated political bipartisan support to back his plan we know that the us is divided we saw that with the election results and if he's going to get his strategy to have americans wear masks as a mandatory intervention he's going to need to get the republicans on side well it also just helped though sophie in terms of global cooperation around tackling the pandemic if we have joe biden in charge in the white house his attitude for instance towards the who and other organizations just may change the whole tone of discussion oh yes very much so so i think on saturday you could probably hear the sigh of relief coming from geneva from the world health organization that biden was going to become president-elect he has been very explicit in saying that he will recommit the us to the world health organization but he has also noted that the who is you know it's not without its flaws so he's going to be a supporter of it but this doesn't mean he's not going to be a critical supporter of the who but really when it comes to global health security we're seeing a reset to 2016. we're seeing global health security directorate reset up in the white house more money towards the centers for disease control and as you say a commitment to multilateral institutions like the who what's going to be important is to see what biden does around kovacs now kovacs is the organization around vaccines and ensuring equitable access to vaccines in lower middle income countries trump has shown very little interest in that so let's see what biden says dr sophie harmon great to have you with us thanks so much for joining us sophie they're talking about kovacs i wanted to ask you well as well anna about availability and distribution of the fisa vaccine it's not the only one in development there are other vaccines bring us upstairs in terms of where they are at and then what happens which countries get which vaccine how does that whole process work yeah sure so i mean there's hundreds of vaccines sort of in the pipeline and around 12 that are at this stage and fizer's the one that sort of beat those other to the post with this big announcement today another vaccine that has been in the running particularly the uk's had their eye on is a vaccine from the university of oxford and astrazeneca now they are all in a similar stage to uh pfizer and as i say as the the data from pfizer is looking particularly encouraging we still have to wait to the end of this trial to see how that turns out and it's the same with the other vaccines that are also in the pipeline uh so yeah so as i say this this vaccine has sort of taken the lead at this point but it could be that as time goes on other ones overtake that certain vaccines have um are more useful for treating a certain type of people a certain group of people and so it's really still so much to play for but a huge moment thank you so much for being with us anna and i

171,IGqDGeDssmY,The Unstudied Link Between the COVID Vaccine and Periods, after getting vaccinated people had a pretty good idea of what to expect the CDC warned the public about headaches fevers and muscle aches but some people started noticing something different I was texting with another friend who had been vaccinated on the same day as me but a couple of days later we both were complaining about period symptoms that were unusual for us and then I reached out to Kate just to ask if anybody had talked to her it was interesting it piqued my curiosity for a moment there and I actually also had um pretty significant period symptoms and I decided to take to Twitter and that was where I was really surprised how many people said you know until you said that I hadn't made the connection between the vaccine and the fact that I had a really rough period this time some people wrote in saying they were having a period even though they'd already started menopause others said their period wasn't due for weeks but came days after the shot and a number of trans folks said that despite being on testosterone they had period symptoms and it became very clear very quickly that this was an emerging issue that it was understudied That vaccine trials had not thought to explore it at all and if anyone was going to pay attention it was going to be us Clancy and Lee studied biological anthropology through a feminist lens which makes their work pretty unusual in clinical research at large we have not historically studied menstruating people because menstruating people are also people who could get pregnant a lot of the time and it is now that girls start to menstruate menstruation as a result we have not really explored the massive immune effects that could exert the effects on that system which again came from a sort of a paternalistic protection instinct protecting people with ovaries stems back to 1977 when the FDA issued guidelines Banning most women of quote child-bearing Potential from participating in clinical research studies time that made sense a series of medications had been linked to birth defects so testing out new ones was considered an unnecessary risk it took nearly two decades for the FDA to reverse that policy but scientists had gotten used to studying people who didn't have fluctuating hormonal Cycles which bonus made their jobs easier it's completely unacceptable and it has been accepted practice for decades how many ideas like brilliant ideas that scientists have about things that might contribute to the neurobiological underpinnings for example of Alzheimer's disease or autoimmune disease or cancer or anything else that would have worked in women and don't work doesn't work in men and it was never even bothered to test on females because it didn't work in males some medications haven't been thoroughly tested on everyone a recent study found that women have bad reactions to drugs almost twice as often as men and in 90 of cases side effects like nausea headaches and seizures are way worse for women and drug reactions aren't the only problem how many times as women do you go to the doctor and they're like I've never heard of that before you're like I'm having this side effect or like I'm feeling this way and they're like wow that's weird you know so it's like they're reading these medical journals and a lot of these doctors they're trying to do their best for their patients and I'm sure it's exhausting for them to not have answers for women and it's always us we're always the ones who have these things and nobody's heard of before so people are sometimes left to find information on their own which can lead them to misinformation some parents are asking surrogates not to get vaccinated and one private school banned vaccinated teachers from getting too close to students we have a teacher here who herself was with a roommate who was fully vaccinated she's never had a late period in her life never not once but instead after being around her roommate her period was 10 days late and she experienced enormous blood clots this is her real life experience Clancy and Lee are now collecting responses for the first formal survey of how the COVID19 vaccine has affected menstrual cycles a small step that's already having a real effect I think a lot of people felt really validated by the fact that there were multiple people sharing their experiences and I think they were validated by the fact that some scientists were expressly saying wow this happened to us and we want to look into it please,0.5438475554577249

173,yPlhRUF2aXA,Sesame Street: The ABCs of COVID Vaccines,"   Oh, oh! Oh, is it time for the Town Hall already?   Hi.  Hey there.   Ola!  Hi, everyone.  Hello there!  It's soo good to see all of you.  Oh, it really is, but Elmo, why are you dressed... Is it like a clown?  Oh, yes! Oh, it's kind of embarrassing.  Elmo was having a virtual play day with Abby. Yeah, we were being clowns.  It's a lot of fun, but...  You know, it's kind of hard to move around in these big shoes.   I can see that Elmo, but I have to say, it's wonderful to actually see all of you. It also sounds and looks like you and your families have been staying healthy.  Oh, oh, oh! I have a way I've been staying healthy, Dr. Sanjay. Look!  Aw, does Rosita have a boo-boo?  Oh, oh, no, Elmita. This is from my COVID vaccine. My mammy and my pappy took me to get it this morning. Mm-hm.  Oh, oh, oh!  Oh, Rosita, that's great. Getting the COVID vaccine is a great way to stay healthy.  Sí. My mammy and my pappy said that it will help keep me, my friends, my neighbors, my abuela all healthy.  [Dr. Sanjay] Your parents are absolutely right. You know, COVID vaccines are now available for children five years and older. And the more people who get them, the better we're gonna be able to help stop the spread of COVID and keep everyone healthy.  Sí. And in three weeks later, I have to go back to the doctors and get my second shot. And Kitty... Oh, let me show you.  This is Godito. Will be coming with me to take that shot too. (Dr. Sanjay chuckling)  Good for you Rosita and Gatito. (Dr. Sanjay and Big Bird chuckling) Yeah, you know, you're gonna be considered fully vaccinated two weeks after your second dose. So, that means that kids that are getting their first dose today, they should have really good protection by mid December.  You know, my Granny Bird says that, since I'm six years old, I can get the vaccine.   Oh yeah, that's right Big Bird.  But well, I have a lot of questions. Like, what is a vaccine? And does it have to be a shot? And will I still need to wear my mask?  Those are such great questions Big Bird and it turns out lots of kids and families have questions too.  So, over the next half hour, we're going to be answering your questions. Talking with experts and giving you the information you need about vaccinations for kids.  Oh, um, ah, you know what,  Elmo better go change.  See you later.     Oh, come on!  It's time for the Town Hall! Yay!  Yay!    Welcome to The ABCs of COVID Vaccines, a CNN, Sesame Street special Town Hall about COVID vaccines for children. They're now available for kids ages five and up. Joining me as always, Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Sesame Street's Big Bird.  Hey Erica. Hey Big Bird.  Hi everyone.  Hello there.  Oh and um... Oh, oh!  Oh, hi everybody.  Oh, hi Granny Bird.  Oh my goodness! Is that Dr. Sanjay and Erica? Oh, it's so great to see you. Oh now, go ahead and ask your question grandson.  Okay Granny Bird.  Mm-hm.  All right, my question is, my granny bird said that I might get the vaccine and well, what is a vaccine?  Well, that is a good place to start, right? Think about it like this Big Bird. Your body has a lot of these teeny tiny helpers that are there to protect you. What the vaccine does is train those helpers to fight the virus. That way, if you ever get COVID germs, your body knows just what to do to beat it. And that can help you from getting sick. You know, you've been getting all kinds of vaccines since you were a little bird, probably.  Yeah. Let's turn to another expert to learn some more about vaccines.   Turn, turn, turn, turn!  Yes, I am an expert, and I am turning.   Super Grover?  Ah, yes Dr. Sanjay. It is I, Super Grover! Once again, here to save the day.   Oh, perfect timing. So, you're going to tell us about vaccines, Super Grover?  Yes, vacuums. Oh, I would love to talk about vacuums, sucking up all those little crumbs with that hosey thingy and... Yeah.  Super Grover, no. Not vacuums, vaccines. The COVID vaccine.  Oh! Wow! Are you sure you do not want to talk about vacuums?  No.  Nope. (Dr. Sanjay and Erica chuckling)  Huh, alas! A life of vacuum knowledge wasted. Have no fear though! I can still help, by finding you a vaccine expert. Um, hello! Hello, any vaccine experts around?   Don't worry Super Grover. We do have a real vaccine expert here. Please help us welcome Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett. She actually helped develop a COVID vaccine. Hey Dr. Corbett.  Hello. Hello.  Good to see you.  We are so excited to have you here.  It's so nice to see you guys too.  We have soo many questions, Dr. Corbett, as I'm sure you can imagine. Let's start off with our first one. This comes to us from Lucy in California.  How did the scientists make the vaccine?   And here we have a scientist who helped make one of the vaccines. How did you do it?  Wow! That was a really good question, Lucy. Oh, with so much work, but you know, scientists found out over tons of years of research that if you put two components together, you can make a really good vaccine. So, the first component is just a message. It is a message that goes to your body, to tell your body how to make a really good response in order for you to fight COVID. And the second component is a ball of fat. So, you get a message wrapped in a ball of fat. And that ball of fat just allows for that vaccine to go into your arm very safely, to go to the cells that it's supposed to go to, so that we can prevent you from getting COVID.  Dr. Corbett, we've got another question. Now, this one coming from Zoe in Tennessee.  Can I get the vaccine similar to the flu shot, as a mist in my nose?  A pretty common question. Dr. Corbett. Does it have to be a shot?  Right now, the vaccine has to be a shot. But don't fret, there are a lot of scientists all over who are working on making a vaccine that you can get, like the mist in your nose. But today, the vaccine that you will get, so that you can be protected by Christmas time will be a shot into your arm.   The good news is, it's quick, right? Those shots are just barely a pinch.  It is so quick.  You know, a lot of kids I know also wanna know why it has to be two shots. Sanjay, you have a little demonstration for us.  Yeah. So that you know, they call this the prime and the boost. So think of it like this. This umbrella, the first shot is sort of your prime. You get some protection against getting wet and then the boost, which gives you stronger, longer and wider protection. So, that's the one shot versus two shots. Hopefully, the shot then, the protection lasts a long time.  Ah, which is always good stuff. We also have our friend Ernie, from Sesame street, who's joining us. Hey, Ernie.   Oh, what's that rubber ducky?  Oh! Someone has a question?   How do we make sure the right dose is administered to our kids?  That is such a great question. You know, the right dose is determined based on just the color of the vial. The color of the container that the vaccine is in, so that the doctor or the pharmacist or the nurse that gives you your vaccine, can be sure that you're getting the right vaccine for your age group.  And they test, obviously different doses to make sure that the right dose makes sense for kids versus adults. We got another question, Dr. Corbett. This one from Asher, in New York.  My question is, how does the vaccine fight the germ? (Dr. Sanjay chuckling)  Oh!  Love these questions?  Ooh, this is a good question. You know, actually it is you and your body that is going to fight the germs away. The vaccine just teaches your body or those little helpers, like Sanjay said, to learn how to fight those germs away. So the vaccine goes in and it basically gives your body a class, so that your body can learn how to see the COVID19 germs.  I love that explanation. I'm learning so much here this morning. We also have a question here from, five year old Kinleigh.  Is the vaccine a superhero from the villain, Co-virus?  Is the vaccine a superhero? Okay. Well, you know what, I like to think about it like you being the superhero. The vaccine is just your training camp for you to become the superhero, so that you can fight away the virus.  That is a great way to look at it. Dr. Corbett, I'd like to think of you as one of our superheroes too. You and the other scientists who worked so hard to make these vaccines possible. You are really superheroes.  Thank you so much for having me. And you know what, I am so proud to be called a superhero, but I'm even more proud of all of the kids that are gonna get their vaccines, so that they can become superheroes too.  Oh, Dr. Sanjay, I have some questions too.  Sure Granny Bird. I mean, I know there's lots of parents and guardians with questions around their kids receiving the vaccine. So, you know what, here to help us answer them is the Surgeon General of the United States, Vivek Murthy. Doctor, thanks for joining us.  Of course. Hi Granny Bird. How are you?  Hi. Oh my stars! Hello Surgeon General. Oh my goodness! I was wondering if, could you tell me, is the COVID vaccine safe for my little... Oh, well, my big bird? I mean, how do we know it's safe?  Well, Granny Bird, that's a really good question. And you know what, I'm a parent also, and I've got a kid that's close to Big Bird's age. So, I've been thinking about this too. Here's what I would tell you. There are two big questions that we always ask before we let children have a vaccine. One is, does the vaccine work? And the second is, is it safe? And the good news is that thousands of people have been thinking about this. Hundreds of scientists have been looking at the data and they've found that this vaccine really works to protect our kids against COVID. But it's also very safe. The only side effects that they're really seeing, that have pop up, are soreness, you know, in the arm where you get the shot. And some people have had headaches and felt a little tired afterwards. So, those are the most common side effects. But you know what, they only last for a day or two. And what you're left with is protection against the virus. That's what we want for our kids.  Oh my goodness, well, thank you for that. But you know, I've been hearing, all this time and I thought that COVID19 didn't make kids that sick.  You're right, that our kids thankfully do a lot better than older adults when it comes to COVID. But we've also seen over the last couple of years that COVID has taken a big toll on our children. And so, we wanna do everything we can to protect our children from this virus, even though they're at lower risk than adults. They're still at risk. And this vaccine gives us a chance to make sure that they're safe and protected. That's why I'm gonna be taking my child to get vaccinated as soon as possible.  Oh, well that makes me feel better. And that's very helpful to know that you are feeling the same way and protecting your little ones.  Yeah, and I should add as well, you know, kids can also play a role in passing the virus on to others, like siblings and parents and grandparents as well. So, you know, getting kids vaccinated, especially as we go into the cooler months here, it's gonna be really crucial to protect them as well as the other people in their lives Granny Bird.  Well, thank you Dr. Sanjay and thank you Surgeon General Murthy for taking the time to talk to me today. You have really helped this granny bird make a decision.  Oh, well, it's so good to hear that Granny Bird. You take care and give my best wishes to Big Bird too.  I will. Thank you so much.  It's so great when we can ask our questions. And we'd really love to help some other parents and guardians just like Granny Bird with their questions. So, our first question comes from Maddox and Mason in Texas.  Was the vaccine trial for kids long enough to determine if there're long-term side effects?  There're soo many parents concerned about long-term side effects when the vaccine seems very new. What do we know?  Well, here's the good news. We know that in these trials that were done to study the vaccine, which were specifically designed for kids, with a specific dosage, just for children, that what they saw was overall a very strong safety profile. But they did not see any serious side effects and they followed the children for two months. And why is that important? Because the vast, vast majority of side effects that we see from vaccines happen in the first few weeks. Now, on the other hand, what we do know about the virus is that if our kids are not protected and they get COVID19, that there's a significant risk of them getting seriously ill. We've seen over the last 20 months that millions of children have gotten infected. Thousands have ended up in the hospital. Thousands have also developed something called a multisystem inflammatory condition, which involves multiple organ systems being affected, including the heart. So, we wanna protect our kids from all of these side effects of COVID, if you will. And one of the most effective ways we can do that, is to get our children vaccinated.  We also have our friend Abby Cadabby, who is here. Abby?  The letter of the day is Q. Q is for question and here's another question.  If enough people in our school are vaccinated, can we stop wearing masks?  When can the masks come off? (Dr. Sanjay chuckling)  Well, that's a really good question. I know all of us want to know the answer to that. I certainly do as well from my kids. Look, what I'd say is, the CDC is currently still recommending that people wear masks, whether they're vaccinated or not. When they're in public indoor settings, and that would include a place like a school. But what they're looking at, is that they're gonna see what happens with cases. They wanna make sure the cases come down and they stay down. And the more people who get vaccinated, the more likelihood we have of getting cases to come down and stay down. And if that happens, then the CDC may reevaluate.  Surgeon General Murthy, thanks so much for helping us with our kids and good luck with your kids as well.  Always good to see you.  Now, it looks like we have a question for Elmo.  For Elmo?  Yes Elmo. This one comes from six year old Avery in Alaska.   Hi Avery. What's your question?  Will Elmo get the COVID19 vaccine? (Dr. Sanjay and Erica chuckling)  That's a great question Avery, but Elmo doesn't know. Can Elmo get the vaccine?  I think I can help with that Elmo. So, right now the vaccine is only for children five and older. So three and a half year old monsters kids like you are probably gonna have to wait a little bit longer until the new year. But scientists are working hard right now to make sure that you can get the vaccine as soon as possible.  Does that mean that Elmo can't play with Rosita or Big Bird?  Oh, no, of course not Elmo. You can still play with your friends. But everyone needs to keep doing their part to stay healthy. So, keep wearing your mask around lots of people and also make sure you keep washing your hands regularly.   Okay. Elmo will wear his mask and wash his hands before he eats, after he plays outside. Oh, and after he goes to the potty.   That's great Elmo.  We have a lot more to talk about, including what to do if you feel a little scared about getting a COVID vaccine.  Yep. Yep. And Rosita is gonna be back to tell us how your favorite stuffed animal might be able to help. Well to answer more of your questions, we'll be right back.    Hey Bert.  Yeah?  Knock, knock.  Who's there.  Woo.  Woo who?  Wow, someone's excited to be back at The Town Hall?   Hey, that's pretty good Ernie. Take it away, Erica, woo-hoo!   Thanks Bert and Ernie. You're watching the ABCs of COVID Vaccines, a CNN and Sesame Street special.  Hey Granny Bird, question. Have you decided if Big Bird's gonna be getting the vaccine?  Well, yes I did. I asked my questions and I got my answers and I've scheduled an appointment for my grandsonny. We're leaving in a few minutes. Now, I just need to get one last thing before we go to your appointment, Big Bird.  Oh, okay.  I'll be right back.  All right. Uh, I have one more question.  Oh sure Big Bird. What's that?  Well, I'm a little scared to get the shot because I don't like needles. Will it hurt?  Oh, it's okay to be scared and to have some of those big feelings, Big Bird. Can I tell you something? I'm a grownup and I don't really like needles either. In fact, even as an adult, I don't like to look when the doctor puts that shot in my arm.  And I'm the same way too Big Bird.  Well, but you're a doctor!  Yeah. But you know, even some doctors don't like getting shots. Luckily there are ways that we can manage some of those big feelings.  Oh yeah. You know, one thing that I find, is maybe singing a song to distract yourself. Maybe the ABCs while you're getting your shot.  You know, what I like to do, I like to bring something from home that might make me feel safe. Like a favorite toy maybe. I also take three big breaths. (Dr. Sanjay inhaling) And then, think about all the fun things I can do after I get the vaccine.  Oh, you know who else we could ask Big Bird? We could ask Rosita. Remember, she just got her shot. We could ask what she did.  Okay. Hi, Rosita. Did it hurt when you got the vaccine shot? And were you scared?  I was a little scared, Big Bird, but my mommy and my pappy helped me. And little Godito helped me too.  Oh, Godito! Rosita is that your lovely?  Sí. Sí, when I was getting ready for my vaccine, I sat in the chair and I held Godito over my belly like this. And I watched Godito move in and out on my belly. Mm-hm. And you know what, before I knew it, the shot was over and I had this cool vaccine, you know, bandaid on my arm. Mm-hm.  Really! That was it?  Yep. Yeah. I barely felt it, yeah. And you know, my arm only hurts a little.  Hm, well gee, thanks, Rosita. Oh, that makes me feel a lot better.  Oh, and look what I have here is what we needed for your vaccine shot.  Oh, Radar!  Mm-hm.  Oh!  Yes. It's time to go Big Bird.  Oh!  Good luck Big Bird. We're rooting for you.  You're gonna do great Big Bird. We'll see you when you get back.  You've got this Big Bird.  Oh!  Okay, Granny Bird.  Let's go Honey.   Joining us now, to talk about coping with those feelings and our fears, are our friends, Dr. Rosemarie Truglio, Senior Vice President of Curriculum and Content at Sesame Workshop, which is nonprofit behind Sesame Street. And Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a primary care pediatrician at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. It's so good to have you both with us this morning. So look, we know Big Bird isn't alone. We got so many questions from kids who were worried about getting a shot. Take a look.  Will the shot hurt?  Will it hurt, because I'm sure tire.  Is it gonna hurt or bleed?  Will it hurt? (Dr. Sanjay chuckling)  Oh, will it hurt? So Dr. Rosemarie, I know you have some great tips for kids who are nervous that it might hurt.  Yep. And we are all nervous or scared. To get your mind off of your arm, right, and don't look at it. Maybe you could then focus on whoever's holding your hand and focus on how that their touch and how they're comforting you. Take those deep belly breaths and focus your attention, maybe on your feet. Maybe wiggling your toes. The whole point is, we wanna get your attention off of the shot and off of your arm. And before you know it, it's all over. And it's only gonna hurt just a little bit.  Dr. Edith, what is your advice to grownups about talking to their kids about getting the vaccine?  So, the first thing Sanjay that I would say is to actually go ahead and talk to their kids about the vaccine. I can't tell you how many parents bring their kids to my office without having told them that they're getting their shots. And then it sort of, you know, shocks them and it's a surprise and it scares them even more. So, let's go ahead and make space for those big feelings and talk about this and be honest. It might feel like a little pinch and then a little burn. Take those breaths, count to five, and it'll be over. But make space for those feelings and for those conversations.  Guess what, Super Grover is back. Take it away, Super Grover!  It's a bird! It's a meatball sandwich! No, it is someone with a question.  When I get my shot, do I have to miss school?  You know, Dr. Edith, I think a lot of parents are worried about side effects overall. What should parents consider when they schedule the vaccine?  I think the first thing I would say, is that we have to remember that the dose that we're giving children is smaller than the dose that we're giving adults. And that is because we want it to minimize those side effects. So it's very possible that when you take your kids to get this vaccine, they're not gonna have any side effects or if they do, they're going to be very, very mild. Now, you always have the option of giving them an anti-fever medication, anti-pain medication. And with that, they actually should feel a lot better. They should perk right up and be able to go to school. So, no. The answer is no. They don't have to miss school, and those side effects are going to be mild, if at all.  Which is great news.  Rosemarie, we got some really interesting questions, including this one from Oliver in California.  I'm worried about some of my friends who probably will not be vaccinated. What should I do? What should I say?  You're a very kind friend to be caring about your friend's health. And all families are making different decisions. And you're doing your part by being vaccinated. You're protecting yourself and you're protecting your friend and others around you. The most important thing is to continue to be a good friend and have those play dates, but be mindful that your friend isn't vaccinated. So, wear a mask, make sure your hands are washed and keep a little bit of a safe distance.  Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, Dr. Rosemarie Truglio, thank you both so much. It's so great to see both of you this morning and thanks for all of your expertise.  Thank you.  Thank you guys.  [Dr. Sanjay] Hey, Big Bird. How did it go?  Yeah. How are you feeling?  Oh, well I feel okay. My wing hurts a little bit, but that's okay. You know, I was scared, but it did go by really quickly. And Radar and my belly breathing really helped. And look, I got this sticker from the doctor and I put it on Radars tummy, right there.    Oh, you both did great. And by getting the vaccine, you'll be helping keep yourself, our friends and neighbors and me safe and healthy. Now, your wing may hurt for a day or two Big Bird and you might feel a bit tired, but oh, I'm so proud of you, my grandsonny.  Oh! And I'm proud of you Radar. You did great.   Yeah.  You know, it looks like some other friends just got their first dose of the vaccine too.      Our ABCs of COVID Vaccines Town Hall is coming to a close. Thank you so much for sending in all of your questions and also thank you to our experts and our friends from Sesame Street for joining us today.  I really hope that we answered your questions today, but if you do have more questions about your children receiving the COVID19 vaccine, reach out to your own healthcare provider.   Oh, oh, hello everybody. Elmo found he's new favorite dress up costume. Dr Sanjay.   Whoa! I think I'm seeing double.   Elmo, I'm so flattered. I gotta say, I really love the outfit.  Oh, thank you Doctor. Well, Elmo's playing pretend Dr. Sanjay with his Baby David.   That's fantastic, Elmo.   From all of us at CNN.  And Sesame Street.   Bye bye.  Elmo love you.  Okay Baby David, let's see. Mm-hm, mm-hm. ",0.4824387395996431
174,JmakP_qaKSA,Unheard concerns: WHO investigating possible link between COVID vaccine and hearing issues,"The World Health Organization is recognizing hearing loss and ringing in the years as potential rare side effects of the COVID19 vaccines. For months now, the ABC 15 investigators have shared stories for people who got the vaccine then developed hearing issues. Now the WHO is recommending more studies and alerting health care professionals around the globe. Investigator Melissa Blasius is live in studio with a major update on these unheard concerns. And Steve, they are unheard no more. The leading public health agency in the world is listening and taking action with a report in this pharmaceutical safety newsletter. This is finally the kind of recognition so many people have been hoping for. It was louder than the car radio. We first met Robert Edmonds in July last year when he was seeking treatment from a specialist after developing tinnitus bringing in the ears shortly after getting his COVID19 vaccination. I'm aware of thousands of people like me across the world who have been struggling to get their doctors to work with them, to try and provide treatments or study them. Now the World Health Organization has published a report identifying hearing loss and tinnitus following the COVID19 shot as a preliminary signal. That means there's a possible causal relationship between the auditory problems and the vaccine. If we want to have vaccine confidence, we have to be transparent in all that we do. If there are concerns over these issues, then the best thing to do is understand them and their relationship. The WHO's research looked at reports from vaccine recipients in 10 countries, including people who received the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines. More women than men reported with the median onset time of one day and they tended to be young healthy people. According to the report, many experienced a quick recovery although some found relief with steroid treatment. It's overdue but yeah it's helpful and once we acknowledge it, we can start thinking about the mechanisms and possible ways to prevent and treat the disorders. The WHO encourages more study but debate remains. Here in the U.S., the CDC and FDA have repeatedly said they did not find tinnitus or hearing loss to be associated with COVID19 vaccines and while Johnson & Johnson has added tinnitus to its list of possible COVID19 vaccine side effects, Pfizer and Moderna have not made any connection. It feels almost like the international community is more willing to consider this possibility than the U.S. Robert wonders if his hearing will ever return to normal but he wants other people who develop tinnitus after getting vaccinated to learn from his experience and have hope. Whether it is or isn't related, I want them to be able to go to their doctor and be able to know to get treatment as soon as possible. And as we've said throughout this investigation, these sudden hearing issues reported after the vaccine are rare. According to the CDC, there's only about 15,000 Americans who've made official reports about tinnitus problems compared to hundreds of millions of shots administered. Health officials still strongly recommend getting the COVID19 vaccine for most people and if you have any questions or concerns you should consult your medical provider.",0.5357954545454544
175,qgJcvTZyUng,Biden administration withdraws COVID vaccine mandate for businesses, well the biden administration has officially withdrawn a mandate that would have required workers at big companies to get vaccinated or face regular COVID19 testing requirements the mandate was announced in november for companies with more than 100 employees the mandate would have impacted more than 80 million u.s workers but the u.s supreme court struck down that mandate earlier this month saying the president overstepped his authority however the court left in place a vaccine mandate for health care workers companies who set their own vaccine mandates are not impacted by the decision,0.3707264957264957

178,sPOMCrV3dG4,Why This Woman Got 5 COVID-19 Vaccine Shots,"She's not just boosted, she's triple boosted. Stacey Ricks has had a total of five COVID vaccine shots. Two Moderna, one J&J, and two Pfizer. The 49-year-old from Spring, Texas got her first Moderna shot last January. She got her second shot four weeks later. After each shot, I did not develop antibodies. So in June, before anyone was getting boosted, she got the J&J vaccine. Still nothing. Oh my goodness, so you had two Moderna, then the J&J, still your body's showing that you had no antibodies. Nothing measurable, yes. And then I got the two Pfizer, and it wasn't until after the second Pfizer dose that I developed any measurable antibodies. Stacey is vulnerable to the virus because she had a kidney transplant in 2016 and is immunocompromised. Do you feel safe right now? No, and now with the new variant, no.",0.3127508854781582
179,bpzd74_gZJk,UK stopping covid primary vaccinations, well welcome to this talk Tuesday the 23rd of may now it looks like in the United Kingdom we're finally finally winding down our COVID vaccination uh program let's just look at what's been publicized over the last couple of days this is from the government sites first and second doses of COVID19 vaccines will end for many 30th of June checking book now or again says much the same I think so it looks like this is now um winding down for many quite what that means we don't know the full details of now this is happening on the ground people are voting with their feet let me show you what I mean here so here we have the graphic of the um this actually our world in data daily COVID19 vaccination doses administered per 100 people now of course it was high during the pandemic but as of late it's been really quite low as we see down here and if we look at a more recent time frame we can see that the amounts of people taking the vaccine now are remarkably low now for some strange reason New Zealand seem to have had a bit of a blip there um looks like New Zealand have got a slightly different view of the risk to benefit analysis for the COVID vaccination if this data is accurate but all other countries basically very much winding down now United States Canada Australia Ireland and uh Denmark um Denmark being the lowest now um that is uh encouraging and of course the pandemic is essentially over now which is good I think the World Health Organization said it was essentially over didn't they now um let's have a look at what they are saying here so this is being publicized on Twitter in various places like that UK to stop primary COVID vaccination courses the first and the second dose but the UK Health Security Agency here surprisingly um if you had and I had the first or second dose of the covid vaccine please come forward for them so they're inviting people to still come forward for them who were unvaccinated so just to clarify uh on the 23rd of May 2023 the UK Health Security Agency is still encouraging people to come forward for COVID vaccination do with that information as you see fit um but this is what they're saying that I took this from Twitter just this morning actually uh book now to make sure you get the jobs before the offer ends so it makes it sound like a supermarket sale doesn't it anyway um getting the first and second dose of the COVID vaccine now I think this has to be distinguish from the booster doses because the booster dose is in the Autumn campaign where you backpedaled when I say we the United Kingdom backpedal to over 55s then for the spring campaign it back pedal to over 75s and those with particular risks but this is still what is on their website at the moment um anyone aged over five on or before the 31st of August 2022 can get a first second dose of covid vaccine so according to the UK regulations you can have your six-year-old vaccinated and some might think it's incredible that this is still uh this is still available and the situation in the United States um is is actually uh is is pretty similar as well I haven't got the CDC one that I thought oh no I've got the CDC on it's there um this is the CDC one here everyone six months in order should get a COVID vaccine but as we've seen from the very low update figures of late in the states people are voting with their feet against this this possibility so that's that's the link there for the uh United Kingdom uh site still advising it um the boosters of course are currently over 75 or those with comorbidities just talking about the first and second dose and that was the CDC advice as of today so really quite incredible um CDC as of today everyone over everyone six months and older should get a COVID19 vaccination that is what they're advising but not many taking it up now um Johnson and Johnson in the United States withdrawn now of course now I was just reading today the um the stocks of Johnson and Johnson the uh adenovirus Vector vaccine kind of similar to our AstraZeneca vaccine in this adenovirus Vector vaccine the saying that the stocks they have that have now expired they've no plans to make new ones and they're going to dispose of all the stocks that they have so that one seems to be completely out now don't seem to read much about why it's not being used in the states anymore whereas in the United Kingdom we know that the AstraZeneca has had a lot of issues with uh um what's the word there's a word rare rare adverse reactions um so that's the Johnson Johnson one but 19 million people have had more than 31.5 million doses um let's hope there's no uh no further Adverse Events now uh this is December 21 for the United Kingdom we were pretty slow really to really recognize the dangers from the AstraZeneca a spokesman from The Joint Committee of vaccination immunization the results of the Cove boost trial conducted during the summer of 2021  um proved good evidence provided good evidence that the MRNA vaccines our most effective option for the UK's booster program so the jvci was saying here when when they moved away from the um AstraZeneca vaccine that's because the other ones were better they're not saying it's because the other ones had Adverse Events they seem to be same because it's the other ones were better um I really think the British public is old enough to be able to handle the truth and on objective explanation for changes but that's just a quote from a popular news Outlet in the UK the full link for the uh communication from the jvci is there for perusal to be fair they do admit rare very rare side effects adverse reactions of the vaccine Denmark of course more on the ball stopped AZ in April 2021. now this article here from the British medical journal and just there patients launch legal action against AstraZeneca over its COVID19 vaccine what's this about um well AstraZeneca has been sent to a pre-action protocol letters apparently by the legal people acting and the first step seems to be like it seems I don't know is this a test case or something I don't know but 75 claimants so far some have survived now this is direct quote from the British medical journal article some have survived with catastrophic injuries following blood clots relative representing others who suffered adverse reactions so some people um who had uh injuries from the vaccine are making claims on their behalf other people who had other adverse reactions from the vaccine um other adverse reactions serious adverse reactions are unable to make their own claims um so relatives are making it for them and I don't think I'm allowed to tell you more than that the claim is under the consumer protection act um and uh they must show that the vaccine was not as safe as the public were entitled to expect now I would have thought I would have thought that they could give evidence to that effect I would have thought so of course there'll be counter argument but um just as a matter of personal opinion do you think that the vaccine was as safe as the public were entitled to expect let me think about that tell me what you think now the vaccine damage scheme in the United Kingdom it's limited to 120 thousand thousand pounds per applicant to prove Sierra severe disablement or indeed people who can no longer make the application themselves but rely on relatives to make that application for them would just be entitled to that same amount um the Stafford Ministries administering this scheme have gone up from four to eighty so there's now 80 people administering this scheme in the United Kingdom um Freedom of Information requests why do things always have to come by Freedom of Information requests NHS bursary Services Business Services by the 6th of March 2023 so it's by the 6th of March 2023 scheme had received 4017 claims 622 concerned AstraZeneca 348 the Pfizer 43 the moderna vaccine and 344 of these claims were for a severe adverse reaction where the person that suffered the adverse reaction is no longer in a position to make the claim for themselves and the claim has to be made by the relatives now this is not just the UK this is this seems to be an international phenomenon let me just give you one example here from Australia population is only 26 million in Australia remember but they've had a 3 374 claims to their equivalent uh equivalent scheme and I got that from this um Senator Babette speech in the Australian Senate which we might look at more detail but I'll put the link if you wanted to watch that for yourself so um the adenovirus vector vaccines well and truly now um part of the past it looks like um I've got a video here somewhere um is this it of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine in um in in Oxford here it is it's in it's in a Showcase in uh in Oxford here there we go this is in one of the Oxford colleges they're kind of showing it off so this is the Adeno now to be fair I don't know that that's still there it may well have been removed from public display it's a couple of months probably since I was there but it's an artistic uh representation of the uh what you're actually looking at here of course is the uh this is the adenovirus vector with the DNA inside of it that codes for the so in just a few months ago or a couple of months back whenever I was there they were celebrating this as a major scientific success in one of their Museum colleges um if you live in Oxford um do let me know if it's still there or whether it's been removed I'd just be curious to know that so first of all we moved away from the uh adenovirus Vector vaccines to the MRNA vaccines now we're seem to be uh downplaying all of those so hopefully we can look forward to a position in in the not too distant future where these vaccines are not required and already we've seen that people are not taking up the vaccines or uptake of the vaccines is now really remarkably remarkably low I'll just show you that video again at that clip again actually um if I can get that yeah there we go people just aren't taking the vaccine aren't taking the vaccine up anymore looking like the public has made its own um risk benefit analysis that's all we'll do for now um tell me what you think and uh thank you for watching,0.396459021607048
180,8aAk36PovnU,Paralyzed after 2nd COVID shot,"Now news to at six. Good evening everyone and welcome to news two at six. I'm Haley focus and I'm Bob Mueller. New tonight, a Nashville woman is speaking out tonight from her hospital bed, unable to walk less than 24 hours after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine. She was unable to move from the neck down as news to Alex Dennis shows us. She is encouraging others to advocate for their health. It's just like the worst nightmare I can ever imagine. Brandi Parker McFadden is confined to her hospital bed at Vanderbilt. Can you walk right? No, I can't walk less than 24 hours after receiving her second Pfizer COVID shot. She explains she lost her ability to move from her shoulders down. I thought maybe if anything I'd probably get like flu like symptoms because I'd already had covid but I never in a million million years thought I would never be able to get up and go to the bathroom or get up and walk to the other side of the room or stand up and hug my kids. The usually active mother of three is speaking out, not with the intent of causing fear and not saying don't get your vaccine. I'm just saying that covid is really real and still really new. She continues, including the vaccine, which is why she feels any possible adverse side effect should be investigated, even if it is extremely rare. There's been, I don't know how many people have been vaccinated and been fine, right? But we have to tell everything. Otherwise we will get nowhere in this thing of covid. Brandi advocates for women's health on a daily basis. Following a diagnosis of epilepsy, she created a nonprofit called My Epilepsy Story. Now her fight has shifted from her hospital room warning of other women with similar symptoms to hers. We do know there's been a couple of cases, a couple other women. Um, but those women did not have epilepsy. She applauds the investigation into the johnson and johnson vaccine, which involved six women and rare blood clots, and she's hoping research will be done into these cases of paralysis. This is why I say we need government funding and N. I. H. For all these things. Her husband James is also encouraging anyone with rare reactions to speak up. This is something that is personally affecting our family and us, but this is bigger than us. In the meantime, Brandi is focused on the positive. I have gotten some movement in my toes, which is great. She will start intensive physical therapy this week. Alex Dennis News two. We reached out to Pfizer. The company spoke to us by phone. They said they are closely monitoring side effects and released a statement, which reads in part to date, more than 200 million people around the world have been vaccinated with our vaccine. It is important to note that serious adverse events that are unrelated to the vaccine are unfortunately likely to occur at a similar rate as they would in the general population.",0.4962587547953401
181,z8cYMT3ds4o,Why You Can Be Forced To Get The Covid Vaccine,  record numbers of americans are getting vaccinated against the coronavirus the us the most vaccinated large nation in the world dozens of countries are now working to vaccinate their populations in an effort to end the global pandemic president biden says that by the end of his first 100 days the united states is aiming to have administered 200 million doses and by may 2021 every american adult who wants one will be eligible to get in line for a shot that said 30 percent of u.s adults still don't want to get the COVID vaccine but they may not have much of a choice the federal government can can require vaccination and things like that for coming in and out of the country both the state and city can have vaccine laws based on their legislative authority requiring a vaccine is a health and safety work rule an employers can do that bonnie jacobson knows us all too well the brooklyn resident was recently let go from her job after refusing to get inoculated i was sitting at home and i all of a sudden just opened an email sitting on my couch and it said basically while we respect your decision at this time your employment has been terminated so can you actually be forced to take the COVID19 vaccine against your will in the united states  to be clear the white house's chief medical advisor has already said that he doesn't think the federal government will ever make the colvin vaccine mandatory however powers at the city and state level not to mention the legal rights granted to employers under u.s labor law may make it pretty difficult for some americans to evade inoculation against the coronavirus this isn't as unprecedented as you might think there are a lot of required inoculations which are easy to take for granted just take the chickenpox all 50 states and the district of columbia have laws requiring children entering child care or public schools to have some sort of provable protection against the disease whether that's a vaccine or evidence of immunity in fact schools from preschool through university typically require a battery of inoculations before you can step foot on campus when i was a health commissioner in washington d.c we had passed laws that required anyone who went to a school to be vaccinated against certain preventable diseases there are religious medical and philosophical exemptions that vary state by state but for around 170 years america's schools have done a pretty thorough job controlling vaccine preventable disease in the u.s the very first school vaccination mandate was in massachusetts back in the 1850s it was to protect against smallpox transmission by the start of the 20th century almost half of all states required students to be vaccinated before matriculating in the early 1970s schools with a measles vaccine mandate had incidence rates that were up to 51 percent lower than states without the laws and from there school vaccine mandates expanded over the next few decades  the while schools had been requiring vaccines since the mid-19th century states didn't explicitly have that same power to roll out universal inoculation rules for all residents for another 50 years in 1905 the supreme court case of jacobson versus massachusetts set the legal precedent which now allows states to require vaccines the supreme court said yes you can limit individual rights to protect the public health and one way you can do it in that case is require vaccination we've seen states exercise this authority to varying degrees in the year since take for example the 2019 measles outbreak in new york new york imposed the mandate it imposed an mmr mandate but it limited it to the neighborhoods where the measles cases were high and it was accompanied by a one thousand dollar fine for those who did not have mmr legal experts say that narrowing the vaccine mandate to particular zip codes made it easier to justify in court rather than a statewide mandate but critics warn that these types of targeted requirements may lead to discriminatory practices in general these things are done at the state level but big cities for example also have vaccine laws when i was the city health commissioner in washington dc although that certainly functions as a state we also have vaccine laws in the in washington d.c so far no cities or states have made the covid vaccine mandatory though some places have started the conversation in november 2020 the new york state bar association recommended making the shot mandatory for all residents except those with a medical exemption and then of course there's the biggest rule maker of them all the federal government which in this case actually has pretty limited powers expressly spelled out in the constitution there isn't in the constitution the power to protect the public health well the federal government doesn't mandate vaccines um what they do is they make recommendations there are however software powers at the federal level that have been used before to incentivize mass inoculation the federal government has acted in the public health in the past using other parts such as its commerce parts so it could for example mandate vaccines before you travel in the interstate channels or before you engage in interstate commerce if you're a truck driver that drives across state maybe the federal government can mandate that you'll be vaccinated the power of the purse is another key tool in washington's arsenal it can pass a law saying states will give you three million dollars if you mandate the vaccine but that's up to a limit it can't do it to the degree that's cursive the federal government could also theoretically impose it as a condition of getting a passport so states and cities can require vaccines and the federal government has a lot of influence as well but the big question is whether the government will actually go through with rolling out a universal mandate the first challenge is we won't have enough vaccine doses for people who want them you can't require vaccines that's not available that people can't get another major factor to consider none of the three COVID19 vaccines in circulation here in the u.s are fully licensed by the fda instead they are all cleared under something known as an emergency use authorization or an eua until they are officially approved mandates seem to be off the table and then there's the even bigger question of enforcement mandates to some degree this depend on pretty widespread compliance you can't enforce a mandate if 40 of your population is fighting back if the problem is widespread mistrust mandate won't fix it you need communication you need education you need to earn the people's trust by by transparently showing them that the vaccine is safe and effective by explaining to them the process of approving it and so forth and keep in mind if any city or state did implement a mandate the kinds of repercussions we're talking about are relatively tame no one is floating the idea of jail time or coming to your house and holding you down while they administer a shot refusal would probably just mean a fine or maybe some sort of other tax or penalty experts say it may also mean you are barred from entry to concerts or can't book a seat on certain airlines in israel for example they use the green passport to allow access to businesses like hotels and restaurants to those who have been vaccinated against the virus or have already had kobit 19. implementation though might be tough here in the u.s so how will this actually play out experts tell me the most likely scenario is a repeat of what we've seen in the past once the copit vaccines are fully approved by the fda a vaccine may eventually be a requirement for school-age children in both public and private institutions starting at daycare and extending to universities let's say the city where you live decides against requiring the COVID vaccine does that mean you're free from mandatory COVID inoculation not necessarily your employer may not be willing to take no for an answer jacobson was a waitress in brooklyn and served patrons all through the pandemic she told nbc new york that while she isn't an anti-vaxxer she did have concerns about getting the shot because she's trying to get pregnant my general manager has told me multiple times it wasn't going to be mandatory when her former employer red hook tavern asked if she planned to get the vaccine now that it's available for restaurant workers she shared those worries over the last couple months i had just heard a few things about how it can affect fertility and pregnancy and i just wanted to have a better understanding of that and do a little more research i said that once i had more information i would definitely be willing to change my mind on getting the vaccine i expressed that you know i understand why they're important i think that the vaccine's a good thing i'm not against them within a few days she received an email from her employer saying that they respected her decision but they would be terminating her employment because of their new policy to maintain a safe working environment you know i've made it clear to my lawyer that i want to go in whatever direction i think will help the most amount of people have this same situation not happen to them cnbc reached out to red hook tavern for comment and we didn't hear back as of the date of publication jacob's inspiring appears to be totally legal here in the us i spoke with lawyers across the country and they all say that their clients are reaching out to them in record numbers to ask what they should do about the vaccine clients of mine that are most interested in making a mandatory vaccine a condition of employment are brick and mortar operations that have a lot of foot traffic from their customers they view it as a selling point look you can come to our business location and it's safe because all employees have been vaccinated that's particularly important for restaurants bars gyms and salons and so my clients in that segment of service industry are particularly looking hard at making it mandatory as a sales point to their customers while this is in part a pr tactic it's also totally within an employer's rights to roll out this kind of requirement legal experts say private businesses have pretty extensive rights requiring a vaccine is a health and safety work rule employers like some hospitals already require employees to get the annual influenza vaccine so there's precedent that under the law an employer can force an employee to get vaccinated and if they don't fire them there are a few ways that employees could apply to be exempt from a blanket requirement if a workforce is unionized the collective bargaining agreement may require negotiating with the union before mandating a vaccine anti-discrimination laws also provide some protections now other employers think that incentives are the better route to widespread inoculation in the workplace that could mean that if you get the vaccine you don't have to wear the same level of ppe in the office or have your temperature taken every day there's also talk of offering financial perks many of my clients who are struggling with this issue have said well while we think it's a good idea to make it mandatory we are going to make it voluntary but we're going to try to offer economic incentives bonuses as well as paying for the vaccination and offering optionally if the family wants to have the vaccination to pay for that too also because an eua is not a license there is a legal question as to whether you can mandate an emergency authorization well they're not a fully licensed product so the ability to to require your employees to be vaccinated will be highly controversial in fact i would argue that an employer cannot require you to be vaccinated with anything other than a fully licensed product mandatory vaccination protocols therefore may have to wait until the fda completes the entire approval process for the COVID19 vaccines ultimately a big part of whether the u.s achieves herd immunity against the coronavirus comes down to whether the population buys into the science pfizer and moderna built their coven vaccines with a new kind of technology that's never before been licensed in the u.s mrna vaccines are pretty revolutionary in the world of medicine but they also signify a natural progression of science so far it does seem that a concerted effort to educate the general public about covid vaccine safety and efficacy is working a 2021 pew research survey published in march showed that 69 of us adults have either already gotten the vaccine or they intend to dr fauci says that if 75 to 80 of americans are vaccinated then by the end of the summer of 2021 we may be able to achieve herd immunity if this polling bears out over the coming months we'd certainly be trending in that direction and mandates may not even be necessary,0.4018440656565659
182,3XTzk9RouSY,Prosecutor who opposed COVID vaccine mandates dies after contracting virus,"Orange County Deputy District Attorney Kelly Ernby has died of complications from COVID19. She was a vocal critic of vaccine and mask orders. KKL9's Sarah Dotsche got reaction from Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer. I'm Kelly Ernby. I'm running for the state assembly in the 74th district. Kelly Ernby, a rising star in the Orange County Republican Party and Deputy District Attorney in Orange County, has died after contracting COVID19. Just a phenomenal prosecutor and a great, great friend. She worked as part of the Orange County District Attorney's Environmental Protection Team, prosecuting those accused of polluting the environment. Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said Ernby had been out of work for several days and that his office was shocked to learn the news of her death. There were literally people who took a knee to the floor. I mean, they, it was like they were sucker punched. So today we're walking in Huntington Beach where I live, we're knocking on doors, meeting the voters. Ernby ran for an Orange County State Assembly seat in 2020, earning key endorsements from her party, but ultimately losing to the incumbent. She instead worked with the Orange County GOP as a committee member. The organization remembered her in a statement Tuesday that said in part, the Republican Party of Orange County is greater because of Kelly Ernby and her passing leaves a giant void for all of Orange County. While Kelly is no longer with us, her fighting spirit will live on through our entire OC GOP family. Ernby had been a vocal critic of COVID19 vaccine mandates and restrictions during the pandemic. It was unclear if she was vaccinated herself. Her colleague said Tuesday they were frustrated by what they described as cruel responses to her death being posted online. I don't know quite frankly, whether she was vaccinated or not. Quite frankly, it's none of my business, but I can just tell you this. Some of the comments and, you know, dialogue on my county web page regarding Kelly have been just cruel. Ernby was 46 years old and is survived by her husband. She was outspoken about a lot of issues, including vaccinations, but none of that, none of that takes away from the beautiful person she was.

185,KkYLXX-zYWA,Will Covid Vaccine Impact Fertility or the Health of Your Baby if You Are Pregnant or Breastfeeding?,"My name is Tyson Bell. I'm a critical care and infectious disease physician at the University of Virginia. There was a day I was in the ICU and I was talking to one of my nurses about the COVID19 vaccine and then I noticed that there were many other nurses who were kind of coming and crowding around and I actually decided to just do a chalk talk and just talk about the COVID19 vaccine for my staff. And I think what was kind of a barrier was this assumption that if you're a health care worker, if you're a nurse, then you shouldn't have questions about the vaccine, that you should just take it. And these were nurses who were working in the COVID19 ICU and we were taking care of pregnant women who were coming in very sick on mechanical ventilation or the breathing machine. So they knew first and forehand how severe COVID19 could be if they were to get infected, but yet and still they had a lot of questions about the vaccine. So that was a moment where I understood that the nurses who were working here have questions and almost everyone probably has his questions. And so we just decided to talk about it. What do we know about the vaccine and its potential to affect your fertility? It's a potential to affect the health of your baby, if you're pregnant or if you're breastfeeding and really to get into that. Now what's frustrating about the trials is that they did not include women who were pregnant during a time of enrollment, but what we know is that there were women who became pregnant during the course of the vaccine. We know that based on the ingredients in the vaccine that they break down relatively quickly. There's nothing that's expected to cause any harm to the fetus or to the mom. The Pfizer and Moderna have both done trials in animal models to demonstrate that there's no danger to both the developing fetus and to the mother itself. So we have plenty of data points to show us that this is a safe and effective vaccine. But we also talk about what is the risk of being a woman of child bearing age and getting COVID19 because we've seen data showing that it's associated with higher rates of miscarriage, higher rates of preterm labor and higher rates of women getting sick with COVID19 and going to the hospital. And so we balance those two effects and when I talk to women that were pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant and really thinking through what are the risks versus the benefits, particularly if you are in the community and potentially getting exposed, it really weighs towards protecting yourself, protecting your health, protecting the health of the baby and getting the vaccine. So for my family members, I have family members who are thinking about getting pregnant, some who are pregnant, I'd advise them all to get the vaccine because I want them to be safe. But I think for each person who has to put yourself on that decision journey, you want to make sure that you have accurate and good information knowing that over 10,000 women have been vaccinated now who have been pregnant and we've had no signal that there's anything concerning about that. But we do know that those women are now protected from having bad outcomes from COVID19. That's the message that we have to get out there. That this is a safe thing to do for yourself and for your baby. Speak with your physician as always. But we're really leaning towards making sure that women are protected. you",0.5706065759637189

187,kQ13Jx2cxCw,"CDC changes COVID isolation guidelines and COVID vaccine dose schedule with Sandra Fryhofer, MD"," Unger: Hello, and welcome to the AMA Update video and podcast. Today, we'll hear the latest from ACIP, the CDC'S Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and also talk more about the CDC's new isolation guidelines for COVID. Back with us today to share all the details is the AMA's in-house vaccine expert, ACIP liaison and immediate past board chair, Dr. Sandra Fryhofer in Atlanta. I'm Todd Unger, AMA's chief experience officer in Chicago. Dr. Fryhofer, it's great to have you back. Dr. Fryhofer: Hi. Thanks for having me back. Unger: Well, ACIP had a two-day meeting at the end of February, and it looked like a packed agenda with lots of presentations about many vaccines, including flu, pneumococcal, polio, RSV, and a word I never thought I would say-- chikungunya. And hopefully, I got that right. Dr. Fryhofer, tell us about some of the highlights from the meeting. Dr. Fryhofer: Yes, it was a packed agenda, but ACIP's new recommendation for COVID vaccines was the major headline of the week. ACIP voted in favor of an additional dose of the updated COVID vaccine for all adults 65 and older. CDC director Dr. Mandy Cohen agreed and quickly endorsed the new recommendation. Also last week, CDC also relaxed its isolation guidelines for those testing positive for COVID. You no longer have to isolate for five days. CDC issued a new 25-page guidance for COVID and other respiratory viruses, including flu and RSV. The new guidance says, stay home while you're sick, but you can return to work when you're feeling better and fever-free for 24 hours without taking fever lowering medications. But do wear a mask and try to physically distance from others for the five days that follow. This is especially important if you're going to be around someone at high risk for severe  and those 65 and older and those with weakened immune systems. And to repeat, CDC now says everyone 65 and older should get an additional dose of the updated COVID vaccine this spring if and when they're eligible. Unger: So why don't you tell us just specifically about that word ""eligible""? What exactly does that mean? Dr. Fryhofer: The additional dose for those 65 and older should be given at least four months after the first updated dose. So getting an additional dose implies you've already received a first dose, and many people have not. Uptake of the updated vaccine has been disappointing. Unger: Dr. Fryhofer, in terms of uptake, what are the numbers looking like right now? Dr. Fryhofer: Only 13 percent of children have received a dose of the updated vaccine, and overall, only 22 percent of adults 18 and older have received the updated shot. This new recommendation only applies to those 65 and older. And nearly 42 percent of them have already received an updated dose. But that means 58 percent have not, and that's far from ideal. Unger: Dr. Fryhofer, I think it would be helpful then if you could review the timeline of when the updated vaccine first became available and how this new recommendation fits in. Dr. Fryhofer: The updated 2023-2024 COVID vaccine is an XBB .1.5 monovalent version. It first became available last fall at the end of September 2023. That's when the updated COVID vaccine received a universal recommendation for everyone six months and older. Those six months through four years old need multiple doses, including at least one dose of the updated vaccine, to prime their immune system to protect them. For those aged five and older, a single dose was all you needed to be up to date and to protect against serious illness. Back in September, additional doses were allowed for patients with immunocompromising conditions. They could receive an additional dose at least two months after their last updated dose as well as more doses if recommended by their physician. The additional dose recommendation for those with immunocompromising conditions still applies. This new ACIP recommendation expands access to additional vaccine doses to all adults 65 and older. But the interval is four months after the first dose. Some of this older age group are now four months out from their first updated dose, so they can get an additional dose now. But others still have not received their first updated vaccine dose, and that's where physicians can really make a difference. Adults who are vaccinated or definitely plan to get vaccinated were more likely to report a health care provider recommended they get a COVID vaccine. This highlights the importance of physician recommendation. Unger: Absolutely. Question for you, Dr. Fryhofer-- Why are additional doses only recommended for adults in the older age group? Dr. Fryhofer: Well, simply put, this extra vaccine dose will provide additional protection for those at highest risk. Most COVID deaths and hospitalizations are in those aged 65 and older. Risk increases with age. People aged 75 and older have the highest COVID mortality rates. We're in a much different place than we were in 2020. More than 98 percent of people have at least some type of immunity from vaccination, from prior infection, or both. Hybrid immunity from both vaccination and previous infection is the most protective, and older patients have tended to isolate more during the pandemic. So there's a higher prevalence of vaccine-only immunity in older adults as compared to younger adults. We know vaccine-induced immunity tends to fade with time. Additional vaccine doses provide incremental benefit in boosting protection. Another reality is immunosenescence. Our immune systems don't work as well as we get older. And immunity wanes more quickly in older age groups. This means more frequent vaccine doses are needed to maintain protection in this older population. Unger: All right. Also a question for you, because it might surprise some people, about having this done in the spring-- what about the timing, the spring? Dr. Fryhofer: Well, this is actually the third year in a row a spring COVID vaccine dose has been recommended. Flu and RSV outbreaks surge in the fall and winter. COVID does, too. We've seen increases in COVID during the respiratory virus season. COVID hospitalizations peaked in late December, early January. We've also seen COVID surges in the spring and summer. So COVID seems to have year-round transmission. Hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID continue throughout the year, and rates are highest in those 65 and older. Each week, there are still about 20,000 new hospital admissions and 2,000 deaths due to COVID. And 95 percent of those hospitalized this past winter with COVID had not received a dose of the updated vaccine. The updated vaccine provides protection against JN1 and other circulating variants. Vaccine effectiveness is expected to wane. Additional doses are needed to restore protection. This additional spring vaccine dose can do just that. Unger: All right. Thank you. Dr. Fryhofer, I understand there was quite a discussion about the precise language that was used in the new recommendation. Can you give us a little background about that? Dr. Fryhofer: Well, you got that right. Words matter, and there was much debate about whether the recommendations should say older adults ""may"" or ""should"" get an additional dose. Now, for full disclosure, I'm a member of the COVID Vaccine Workgroup, and our workgroup had suggested the softer language, that those 65 and older ""may"" get an additional dose. This is also called shared clinical decision-making, meaning you and your patient have to discuss and decide. At the meeting, ACIP voting members went back and forth about ""may"" versus ""should,"" but after reviewing the most recent data for those 65 and older presented at the meeting, ACIP voting members decided on the stronger wording. Everyone 65 and older ""should"" get another dose. Unger: That's clear. Dr. Fryhofer, many older adults have multiple medical conditions. Did that factor come into play in terms of making the stronger recommendation? Dr. Fryhofer: Yes. Older patients and those with multiple underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of bad outcomes from COVID-- heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, neurological conditions, and obesity are some of the most common underlying medical conditions in those hospitalized with COVID. And as we know, many older patients have multiple medical conditions. COVID continues to circulate. And although COVID hospitalizations are down 75 percent and COVID deaths are down 90 percent since January 2022, there's still more than 20,000 hospitalizations and 2,000 deaths each week due to COVID. Most are in the 65-and-older age group. The ultimate decision by ACIP voting members was, everyone 65 and older should get a dose. This stronger language is crystal clear and demonstrates ACIP's confidence in the importance of an additional dose of the vaccine in keeping our most vulnerable Americans protected. And I think it was the right call. Unger: Thank you. What about the idea of booster fatigue? What role does that play in getting people to agree to vaccination? Dr. Fryhofer: Well, we're trying not to call them boosters anymore. It's now called the updated vaccine. But sure, we all have vaccine fatigue. People are tired of masks. They're tired of testing. CDC surveys say less than 50 percent of people who get sick are testing themselves for COVID. We're all sick and tired of COVID, but the virus is still here. It's still circulating. Some people are still refusing to get the vaccine. Many have not received a dose of the updated vaccine, but others really want to stay protected. And with this new recommendation, they can. Some people who have not been vaccinated may not like the strong language. But understand this language is meant to inform, not to offend. COVID is here. It has not gone away. People are still being hospitalized. People are still dying from COVID. ACIP's strong recommendation for an additional dose is a wakeup call to get a dose now to restore protection for those 65 and older. This new recommendation allows the most vulnerable to restore their protection. Another silver lining of this strong recommendation-- if ACIP recommends it, insurance companies have to cover it. The vaccine is already in pharmacies. All you have to do is sign up and show up, and of course, roll up your sleeve. And there's no shortage of the updated vaccine. Unger: Well, that's good news. And although it seems like a long way away, the fall will eventually be here. And I'm curious what the plans are for getting ready for next year and thinking about what we might expect this fall season. Dr. Fryhofer: The virus keeps changing. Last September, when the updated vaccine first became available, the rollout was rushed. It was sort of a mess. No one was ready. Pharmacies didn't have the codes. Insurance coverage wasn't initially updated on a lot of the pharmacy software. Some who wanted it got turned away. Many became frustrated. We need to do better, and that's why ACIP's review process for the next COVID vaccine, if there is one, will happen sooner. FDA's VIRBAC will likely meet mid-May to discuss any needed vaccine strain changes. And just like for flu vaccines, updated COVID vaccine strain changes do not require any new human data. ACIP will then meet in June to review and finetune any recommendations. That's the plan, at least for now. Many of the patients I talked to still don't seem to realize they're supposed to get a dose of the updated vaccine. So having more lead time to develop clearer messaging and communication will be helpful. Public health officials sort of know what to expect. We now have four years of epidemiological data to predict a likely COVID peak in the winter of 2024-2025. And we need to be ready. Unger: Absolutely. This has been an amazing amount of information. Dr. Fryhofer, any final thoughts? Dr. Fryhofer: The updated COVID vaccine continues to be effective against JN1, which became dominant in January. But the virus keeps changing. For those 65 and older, remember, there's a four-month interval before you can get an additional dose. Try to get your second dose before June, if you can. That way, if the vaccine is updated again for fall, you won't have to delay getting the most up-to-date COVID shot. This timing issue was actually pointed out by FDA's Dr. David Kaslow at the ACIP meeting. And finally, don't underestimate the power of physician recommendation. Physician recommendation matters. Our patients listen to us. They trust us. Physician recommendation is vital for vaccination success. Unger: Absolutely. And thank you, Dr. Fryhofer, for that update. And one of these days, we'll have you come back to talk about how the new ACIP recommendations for the chikungunya vaccine will work. Dr. Fryhofer: I'd love to come back, Todd. Unger: And I'll look forward to saying that word again. Dr. Fryhofer, that wraps up today's episode. Thanks again for joining us and keeping us informed.

189,2XVCPdPAUbA,Law professor on whether employers can mandate the Covid vaccine," K TRADING IN PERSON ON IN THE  OPERATIONS WHERE THEY THINK NEE  CRUCIAL WHERE PEOPLE NEED TO BE  FACE TO FACE  LOOKING AT THOSE LEGAL  REQUIREMENTS JOINING US NOW FROM CALIFORNIA WHERE SHE'S A MEMBER OF THE  VACCINE EDGE CASSIE AND POLICY THANK YOU FOR JOINING US IT SEEMS LIKE SOME GRAY AREAS. IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, IT  DOESN'T SEEM THAT GRAY THERE'S PLENTY OF LEGAL  PRECEDENT FOR OTHER TYPES OF VACCINES AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF  THE ISSUES WHERE IT DOES GET STICKIER I'M THINKING MORE PUBLIC SCENARIOS AND MAYBE COLLEGES AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WITH MINORS WHERE IT MIGHT GET A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT IN TERMS OF LEGAL  EASE  AS YOU'VE SAID, IN THE WORK PLACE, WE HAVE A HISTORY OF  VACCINE MANDATE. WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS REQUIRING VACCINES SOME RESTAURANTS REQUIRE H HEPATITIS A VACCINES THE EMPLOYER CAN PROVIDE THE REQUIREMENTS ONE PLACE WHERE THESE ARE STILL  UNDER EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION  WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION CAN  YOU MANDATE UNDER THE EMERGENCY  AUTHORIZE. THAT IS A LITTLE UNCLEAR BUT IT IS EASY TO SAY THAT UAI ACT ONLY LIMITS THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT AND DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING TO PRIVATE EMPLOYERS. THAT'S WHAT THE RECENT FEDERAL COURTROOMED.  PROFESSOR, IT SEEMS YOU CAN MAKE THE CASE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IN THIS CASE MAY HAVE TO GIVE UP SOME OF HIS RIGHTS  FOR THE COLLECTIVE GOOD, FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF EVERYONE. I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT. AT THE SAME TIME, AND I THINK A  LOT OF FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE WELL INTENDED AND DO THEIR VERY BEST. IT DOES SEEM LIKE THE INDIVIDUAL IS CEEDING SOME OF HIS RIGHTS  AND TRUSTING THAT THEY WILL NOT  CUT CORNERS OR THEY COULD BE JUST WRONG ABOUT THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS. AND I'M THINKING PEOPLE UNDER 18 WHERE PARENTS FEEL THE RISK/REWARD THE RISK OF THE  DISEASE WHATEVER THEY PERCEIVE,  WHATEVER THESE ARE YOU ARE CEEDING AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF AUTHORITY TO THE GOVERNMENTS THAT GOING TO DO ITS BEST BUT THE SCIENCE MIGHT NOT ALWAYS BE WHAT YOU THINK AT THE  TIME  YOU ARE RAISING THREE REALLY  IMPORTANT THINGS THE FIRST IS A QUESTION OF IF  THE EMPLOYER MANDATES THE  VACCINE, IS THIS A MANDATE OF  RIGHTS RIGHT NOW, WE ARE NOT TALKING  ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT YOU ARE TALKING PRIVATE  EMPLOYERS. YOU DON'T HAVE RIGHTS WITH THE EMPLOYER YOU MAY HAVE LEGAL RIGHTS  BECAUSE OF DISABILITY. WITH TWO PRIVATE ACTORS, THE EMPLOYER ALSO HAS RIGHTS PART OF THE BARGAIN OF THE WORK  PLACE IS, YOU AGREE TO OBEY THE  WORK PLACE RULES AND YOU GET THE SALARY THAT DOES MEAN YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE WORK PLACE RULES AREN'T  SOMETHING YOU LIKE, YOU ARE NOT  GIVING UP YOUR RIGHTS. YOU ARE MAKING A CHOICE. IS THIS WORK PLACE WORK IT THE OTHER POINT, IT IS AN  IMPORTANT ONE, DO WE HAVE A  PROPER REGULATION OF VACCINE AS YOU ARE SAYING, NO REGULATION IS GOING TO BE 100 percent PERFECT. WE HAVE THE MOST ROBUST  OVERSIGHT THAT WE HAVE ANYWHERE  ELSE WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE AGENCY LOOKING AT IT AND TWO EXPERT AGENCIES LOOKING AT IT AND FOUR  SYSTEMS TO COLLECT DATA ON THIS. AGAIN, THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE KNOW EVERYTHING NOW WE NEVER KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING BUT WE HAVE DATA FROM OVER 160 MILLION AMERICANS WHO GOT THE VACCINE. AS YOU ARE SAYING, WHEN  SOMETHING COMES UP, WE TEND TO IDENTIFY IT. EVEN IF IT IS RARE THE MYOCARDITIS CASES ARE RARE AND WE IDENTIFIED THEM THE J&J BLOOD CLOTS WERE RARE  AND WE IDENTIFIED THEM THE OTHER THING YOU MENTION IS MINORS THESE ISSUES DON'T GENERALLY APPLY TO MINORS. THEY DON'T GO TO WORK. DOWN THE LINE, WE MAY HAVE MANDATES FOR SCHOOL. WE ARE NOT THERE YET SCHOOLS ARE STATE MANDATES PRIVATE SCHOOLS MAY REQUIRE JUSR KETH",0.529917328042328

TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. AND A WARNING, AS THE NUMBER OF CASES INCREASE. BE ESPECIALLY CAREFUL THIS MOTHER'S DAY WEEKEND. SO FAMILY GATHERINGS DON'T TURN INTO SUPER SPREADER EVENTS. IN NEW YORK CITY, THE SEVEN-DAY POSITIVE RATE IS NOW 6.5 percent, WITH MORE THAN 2800 NEW CASES. THIS COMES AS THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED STRICT NEW LIMITS ON THE JOHNSON & JOHNSON VACCINE BECAUSE OF RARE SIDE EFFECTS. NOW, J&J IS ONLY RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T OR WON'T GET ONE OF THE OTHER SHOTS. CBS 2'S JESSICA MOORE SPOKE WITH A WOMAN WHO SAID SHE WISHES SHE KNEW ABOUT THE SIDE EFFECTS SOONER.   FROM SMILING WITH HER FAMILY TO AN AGONIZING HOSPITAL STAY, 51-YEAR-OLD NICOLE ADIA SAYS THE JOHNSON & JOHNSON VACCINE SENT HER INTO A PHYSICAL TAILSPIN.  I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR SIX WEEKS, OUT OF WORK FOR 10. AND MY LIFE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. AND THAT STINKS.  TWO WEEKS AFTER GETTING THE J&J SHOT, SHE HAD A STROKE. HER HAIR FELL OUT IN CLUMPS. AND DOCTORS INJECTED HER WITH MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF STEROIDS.  WHEN YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL? WAS THERE ANY PART WHERE YOU THOUGHT I MAY NOT MAKE IT OUT OF HERE?  I HAD A FEERVE FOR FIVE WEEKS STRAIGHT.  60 CASES OF A RARE BLOOD CLOT CONDITION CALLED TTs HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED. THE FDA IS NOW RECOMMENDING PEOPLE NOT GET THE SINGLE-SHOT VACCINE, UNLESS IT'S THE ONLY ONE AVAILABLE, WHERE THEY WON'T OTHERWISE GET VACCINATED.  WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM THE FDA IS WE DO KNOW OF THIS VERY, VERY RARE SIDE EFFECT, CALLED TTS. AND WHAT THIS IS A CLOT THAT HAPPENS IN SOME PEOPLE. IT'S ABOUT THREE IN A MILLION.  YOU'RE HEARING THE FDA RECOMMEND MOST PEOPLE NOT GET THE J&J VACCINE. HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?  LIKE A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT. I WISH I KNEW THAT.  THE FDA IS NOW STRONGLY SUGGESTING PEOPLE GET PFIZER OR MODERNA. BEGGING WAS ENOUGH TESTING DONE?  A BAD SIDE EFFECT IS FAR RARER THAN THE SIDE EFFECT FROM A DAILY ASPIRIN. IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASILY PICKED UP IN A CLINICAL TRIAL.  THE DOCTOR SAYS PEOPLE WHO GOT IT A WHILE AGO SHOULDN'T WORRY. THE RISK OF BLOOD CLOT VANISHES WITHIN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS EVER INJECTION.  I WANT MY HAIR BACK. IT'S COMING BACK. I WANT MY LIFE TO BE WHERE IT WAS. IT NEVER WILL BE.  AUDIA SAYS SHE STILL STRONGLY SUPPORTS GETTING VACCINATED, BUT WISHES SHE HAD KNOWN THE RISKS BEFORE GETTING THIS SHOT.

192,Ea4cUAlZhY8,India to begin exporting COVID-19 vaccines within weeks,"India is preparing for a national COVID19 vaccine drive but all eyes are now on its vaccine export plans. Despite earlier reports that authorities had banned a local developer from exporting its vaccine, officials say that's not true. COVID19 shots will be supplied to developing countries within weeks. Neha Ponyar with this report. India is a vaccine powerhouse. It produces 60 percent of the world's shots and it's this strength that the government is hoping to leverage in the next few months. Earlier this week the government was forced to clarify that there is no ban on the export of the COVID19 vaccine. The head of the Serum Institute of India, the firm that is bulk producing the Oxford shot here, was quoted as saying that the government will not allow the export of vaccines for months. The company, which is the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, later clarified that their chief was misquoted. The government also called this For months now, Prime Minister Modi has pitched India as a country which will play an important role in the global vaccination program. Within a fortnight of the start of India's own immunization drive, vaccine exports to South Asian neighbors could begin. The first countries to get an India-made vaccine are likely to be Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, the Maldives and Sri Lanka. South Africa has sought 1.4 million doses and Brazil has also put in a request. The Serum Institute says it will also provide vaccines to Saudi Arabia and Morocco. Officials say it's likely New Delhi will supply the vaccine at the same discounted price that it's buying the shot for. Some countries could also be given the COVID19 vaccine as a gift, with India paying for those doses. Right now the government's reportedly negotiating buying the Oxford jab for less than three dollars a shot. Experts want India will have to balance its own vaccine needs with its bilateral commitments. The country will need enough shots to vaccinate 300 million people alone in the first phase itself, but many are warning that exports should not come at the cost of India's own vaccine requirements.
