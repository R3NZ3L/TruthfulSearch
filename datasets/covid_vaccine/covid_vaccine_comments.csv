20,LfmhYVCCGhc,"""I'm just some idiot who tells jokes for a living. Nobody should listen to me."" -Joe Rogan"
21,LfmhYVCCGhc,Dr Campbell here in the UK started off being in favour of blanket vaccination.  He changed.  Study from Australia - myocarditis and pericarditis went up by 65% after vaccination.      This was before covid actually entered Australia.    I'm super happy if you think the vaccine is great and suggest you keep on taking them.
22,LfmhYVCCGhc,"If you completely ignore VAERS and every other database worldwide and live in an alternative reality, then yeah, these covid injections are the best and safest vaccinations ever."
23,LfmhYVCCGhc,How much are you getting paid to toe the state line?
24,LfmhYVCCGhc,"I did the moderna vaccine twice and had chest pain and breathing symptoms for almost a year. My mom was working, very active and independent, had a stroke several months after the vaccine. The research evidence is overwhelming that there are risks to vaccines, and the historical record is undeniable that the risks were underplayed or dismissed."
25,LfmhYVCCGhc,Do you know why Rogan said this? Because a lot of vaccinated people died suddenly after they had a covid vaccine.
26,LfmhYVCCGhc,I‚Äôm 72 and have every vaccine available.  I‚Äôm FINE
27,LfmhYVCCGhc,"Some young people did actually die from the Astra Zeneca vaccine. It caused blood clotting that led to heart and brain issues. In Australia, young people had to sign a waiver before choosing to take that particular brand."
28,LfmhYVCCGhc,It's crazy how many people drank coffee and then died suddenly
29,LfmhYVCCGhc,No recourse with vaxx companies should tell us something
30,SU_SSfiYtfM,"i love the phrase ""fall arsenal,"" like it's a seasonal fashion collection of vaccinations"

50,8oHP5tmCUZU,20 years in the army and 14 of those in SF and my refusal to get the jab is what took me out of the military. Smdh.
51,8oHP5tmCUZU,Contractor on the east coast here- what he said about corralling sailors and harassing them about the shot is absolutely TRUE. They relieved officers of command and told pregnant sailors they don‚Äôt actually know what it does to the baby. Utterly disgusting how the OICs rolled over on their sailors with legit concerns.
52,8oHP5tmCUZU,Never forget or forgive what they did to us .
53,8oHP5tmCUZU,When the Navy Seals realize they've been serving under Nazis.
54,8oHP5tmCUZU,"This has been the case for awhile. In 2002 we were forced to start anthrax and small pox vaccines. We didn't feel good about it but had to have atleast 3 shots before deployment and the remainder overseas. The guys that refused it not only seperated under dishonorable but were sent to the brig. Not sure of the specifics, but i heard of a few officers at lejuene refused and given the shaft  quick. Guess they didnt wanna let marines see officers reject it and follow as we were getting prepped for war. What makes me mad is i had 5 shots before we left, while doing a predeployment medical screening a week out. Corpsman came back anf told a handful of us we only recieved 3 shots. Crazy because we all went as a platoon and did it together. My Gunny argued with them, but because we didn't have it in the record, we ended up getting 1 more that day and 1 a few weeks later. Then the second small pox dose and malaria pills overseas also"
55,8oHP5tmCUZU,"I respect this man for actually standing for his beliefs. I know a lot of my coworkers said they wouldn't take it, but when it came to time, they bent their knees so fast I was shocked. I didn't take it and one other coworker on my shift. It taught me a valuable lesson on who I could trust and depend on"
56,8oHP5tmCUZU,My father fought in WWII.  I served in the Army from 88-94.  My son is now 16 and yesterday I told him I don‚Äôt want him to join the military.  The current military is not the one my father and i served.  My son will not fight for a group of people that don‚Äôt care about its soldiers/sailors.  He asked me what a draft.  I told him we would cross that bridge if/when we get to it.  I don‚Äôt want my son to be in the service and then have to face American citizens if ordered to treat them as the enemy.
57,8oHP5tmCUZU,They better never question why people don‚Äôt want to join! NEVER
58,8oHP5tmCUZU,Imagine starting wars while simultaneously alienating a whole generation of GWOT vets
59,8oHP5tmCUZU,The biggest injustice ever in our country‚Äôs history. Thank you for your service üá∫üá∏
60,t1fboB1YdEQ,ARE YOU GOING TO REPORT THAT THE US IS STILL PAYING AND SUPPORTING THE CHINEESE RESEARCH?
61,t1fboB1YdEQ,"Call it what you like. It‚Äôs a bio weapon, just like the first one. Period."
62,t1fboB1YdEQ,If you ever doubted that the original strain was created in a lab then this is your wake up call.
63,t1fboB1YdEQ,"We followed the science and it simply wasn't there, we then followed the money and found the science."
64,t1fboB1YdEQ,Guess RFK was right about warning us about bio weapons all along.
65,t1fboB1YdEQ,This is crimes against humanity!!! What can we do???
66,t1fboB1YdEQ,"It should be illegal in every country to do this types of ""research"""
67,t1fboB1YdEQ,Insane that this isn't being stopped and in fact has arguably been accelerated since the start of the pandemic. People continuing this gain of function research around the world are playing with all of our lives.
68,t1fboB1YdEQ,"Let's get to the bottom of this!  Quick Robby, get the facts from Dr. Fauci again!

73,mkZ1MabMEZw,Favorite VAERS factoid is how one entry says a vaccine turned the recipient into the incredible hulk.
74,mkZ1MabMEZw,Would love to hear your take in a Nuremberg trial setting.
75,mkZ1MabMEZw,My friend died the day after she had the HPV vaccine and there was nothing wrong before
76,mkZ1MabMEZw,"My dad had a bad reaction and then collapsed 48 hours after receiving the booster. 
Cluster of skull fractures, bleeding in the brain, seizure upon arrival at the hospital, flown by helicopter to different hospital where he remained for 1 1/2 months. 
He‚Äôs now using a walker, trying to get back on his feet. His memory and general mental condition is coming back well, but he‚Äôs still messed up.. He‚Äôs 67 years old, had no serious health issues his entire life, was on no medications, a runner that was doing 6+ mile runs 2-3 times a week. Ran the NY marathon when he was younger."
77,mkZ1MabMEZw,"Since most VAERS entries are entered by doctors or pharmacists, we can conclude the entries are accurate.  Since it takes nearly an hour to complete a VAERS report, we can also conclude the VAERS data is a small proportion of the actual events since most doctors will not spend the time to report."
78,mkZ1MabMEZw,You should also say that most doctors didn‚Äôt even KNOW about this site and are being bullied/fired for bringing up red flags about this.

80,sNUpmYtEWtI,"Rather than a home isolation analogy, what about the seatbelt analogy?  Seatbelts don't guarantee that you'll never get in a car accident, but they do drastically reduce your chance of getting injured.  Hence why we all wear one, and why it's also not an excuse to go driving like a maniac.  We still check our blindspots and use turn signals when wearing a seatbelt, like wearing a mask even while vaccinated."
81,sNUpmYtEWtI,Oh no look what the Florida surgeon general is saying now and hes not the only one
82,sNUpmYtEWtI,"2 years on, I wonder if you are starting to feel like a piece of Schmidt"

94,ukwmdCJ8VAw,All of the anti vaxxer conservatives in this comment section are MAD üíÄ and it‚Äôs very funny.
95,ukwmdCJ8VAw,Just to give background- this video is from when Covid was on the rise and we were just wrapping up the lockdown.  A lot of medical offices made vaccines required for employees or they couldn‚Äôt work.  In our office we highly encouraged it (didn‚Äôt make mandate) and all our patient facing staff got it by their own will. This was one of our back office staff member and dr ibrahimi was only teasing her.

104,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"My sister (a nurse) had 4 jabs now. She had blood clot in lung and pneumonia last year. She‚Äôs developed asthma too. She‚Äôs always having to take time off with sickness. Her health has steadily declined over past two years. Prior to that she had a healthy immune system and often said herself, just how robust she was. Sadly she thinks I‚Äôm a conspiracy theorist and won‚Äôt listen to anything I try and put in front of her. I‚Äôve had to just step back and let her find out the hard way. The thing is, the hard way could very well cost her her life. She‚Äôs only 57"
105,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"Prof. Robert Clancy is an international treasure. Humility, humor, compassion, curiosity and of course great knowledge and skill. In a time of confusion, ignorance and pettiness it is a relief to hear him talk, giving hope to many people suffering with debilitating illness. Long may he live."
106,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"The end... "" You don't vaccinate people with chronic fatigue syndrome, you are just putting petrol on the fire""   THANK-YOU !!  This was me in April 21. I'd been ill since Mar 20 and In April 21 had Chronic Fatigue. My vax invite came in April 21, I had 11 invites actually. Didn't do it. I'd been ill for over a year, no answers from Drs or Consultants and well my gut instinct was telling me if spike protein does this to me already, didn't seem like the best idea to ask my body to make more. I don't even want to think what may have happened. And I had to put up with people telling me ""Just get the jab""  ""Don;t be silly""  etc. The look of disgust from some people when I said I wasn't vaccinated and one was a male nurse at my local hospital , gave me a proper lecture. I wasn't;t well and didn't;t want to get into an argument as his made was well and truly made up.  Thanks you John and Robert."
107,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"I'd suffered with CFS for 15yrs at the time of the onset of the pandemic. My gut feeling told me not to get the vaccination, but I was given a really hard time about it. Thank goodness I listened to my gut! So thankful for this information üôè"
108,-Ea3UwYZnrA,Thank you Dr John and Prof Clancy for a very informative discussion.  I live in Australia and took the only jab available to me which was Astra-zen due to the severe mandates in the state I live in.  A few weeks after my 1st jab in late 2021 I lost my ability to walk unaided and have remained with worsening paralysis of my right leg with no definit diagnosis.  I have never had a covid infection and the fact that Astra-zen is now banned in most countries including Australia speaks for itself.  Forcing untested vaccines on people that have the potential to do so much harm is a crime against humanity
109,-Ea3UwYZnrA,I've struggled with chronic fatigue for 29 years. This is the first time I now understand what is happening in my body.
110,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"i'll never forget how people treated me when i told them to avoid the vaccine.. i was already disollusioned with the world before 2020, and what followed just confirmed my disdain. glad theres still some people out there taking it seriously and talking about it"
111,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"This is by far the best double act, not only on YouTube, but currently around. Great moderation again  by Doctor John , and Prof Clancy always delivers his information in such an enthusiastic and accessible way. Thank you very much  to both of you gentlemen, for this and the previous videos and long may you continue."
112,gPHgRp70H8o,"When he said ""You, Mike, in Baltimore. Get the vaccine"", I took that personally. I already got it, John. Go bother Steve in Annapolis. He's being hard headed about getting the vaccine."

115,gPHgRp70H8o,"I wonder if John discussed the egg bit with his wife beforehand, or just let her discover it organically. 

I've seen enough episodes of this show to know is definitely the second one. I can imagine the text messages from her friends about eggs, shes confused at first but then remembers who she married, accepting her future and the inevitable egg jokes."
116,gPHgRp70H8o,"That egg bit. Something about it screams ""this is a joke,"" but I'm genuinely worried that he actually wants to be egg. It was way too convincing."
117,gPHgRp70H8o,How did John keep a straight face during the vaccine cicada bit? A true professional. I couldn't stop laughing.
118,gPHgRp70H8o,"Spring of 2020: ""Why the hell is it taking so long for these scientists to make a covid vaccine!?!""

122,85ZicYaZsbQ,"This is gaslighting. Trying to tell her that her friend‚Äôs injury was random and there was no causal relationship to the kool-aide, gaslighting."
123,85ZicYaZsbQ,Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
124,85ZicYaZsbQ,"By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid."
125,85ZicYaZsbQ,I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
126,85ZicYaZsbQ,"The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it."
127,85ZicYaZsbQ,THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE

134,1m_iclAMXLo,He changed his mind when 30 year olds suddenly starting dying having heart attacks on an alarming rate. Fair play on him for speaking out.

136,1m_iclAMXLo,"It‚Äôs really simple.  He made it available to those who wanted it but made sure no one was FORCED to get it.  He is loved in Florida,‚Ä¶even in Democrat run Dade County.  Best Governor EVER!"
137,1m_iclAMXLo,Making vaccines available and making it mandatory are completely different.
138,1m_iclAMXLo,"Honestly, people that spread misinformation should be held accountable for the deaths they caused."
139,1m_iclAMXLo,The left wing and the right wing belong to the same bird

222,i9JLZuhqRuU,"Addendum:
Two questions asked frequently.

Was the deceased in the first paper tested for SARS-CoV2 infection?

Answer: The paper states, ""but no positive laboratory or clinical diagnosis of the infection.""  The paper never states that the patient received a test and the result was negative.   Some have stated that as the patient was admitted to Charit√© Hospital in Berlin and their protocol for admission requires testing prior to admission.  However, it is unclear of the current website policy was in place when the patient was admitted.  Regardless, the policy states the following:  (https://www.charite.de/en/clinical_center/themes_hospital/main_topic_coronavirus/)

""At present, the following patient groups must show proof of a negative rapid antigen test (within the past 24 hours) or PCR test (within the past 48 hours) upon arriving at any Charit√© outpatient facility:

Vulnerable patients, such as those receiving hemato-oncological care or otherwise immunocompromised patients
Patients receiving daily inpatient care: Testing for SARS-CoV-2 is required at least twice weekly for those visiting Charit√© daily. It is important to test after the weekend or any other interruption in daily inpatient treatment (for example, the patient must show proof of a negative test every Monday and on one other day of the week).
Patients who are in the outpatient clinic for a longer period, for example for preoperative evaluation/preliminary examination
Patients participating in outpatient clinical studies""

Please note that a simple rapid antigen test (which is not designed to determine past infection but rather infectiousness) could have been the test that allowed the patient to be admitted to the hospital if it was negative.  But a negative antigen test would never be taken as proof that the patient had NEVER been infected with the SARS-CoV2.  

It is unfortunate that one has to this type of digging to find the ""answer"" which actually leaves more questions.  It is possible that the author did not realize how important this issue would be when originally writing the paper.  However, given the fact that a lack of nucleocapsid protein is not, in fact, the 
sine qua non of vaccine damage but also infection it now focuses on this question: how tight was the testing for SARS-CoV2 at the end of the deceased life?  The false negative rate is very different between self-administered tests and other more standardized tests.  In addition the patient could have spike proteins long after the RNA was detectable by PCR or protein by antigen testing making the results of the test moot.  Given this uncertainty, retrospectively, it is understandable that the author would have simply stated that the patient had ""no positive laboratory or clinical diagnosis of the infection.""   We wish this were clarified and if I was the peer reviewer I would have asked that this be fleshed out in the paper itself. 

Second Question:
What was the vaccination status of the deceased in the second paper?  

Answer: Unknown but it would be unlikely that all would have been given that a high proportion of COVID-dead were unvaccinated.    However, we do not have to remain with this answer.  A case series was published in November of 2020 (before C19 Vaccines) which showed the same result:  Nucleocapsid proteins were not seen to the same degree that spike was seen.  For instance the paper states regarding the brain: ""In the 16 (40%) cases positive for SARS-CoV-2 proteins on immunohistochemistry, spike protein was detected much more frequently (14 [88%] cases) than nucleocapsid protein (seven [44%] cases)."" https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(20)30308-2/fulltext#seccestitle170

Also note that a separate Lancet article from 2020 (before vaccine) also showed similar results (see page 7) virus present in heart in only 3/11 subjects) https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2666524720301440-mmc1.pdf

226,i9JLZuhqRuU,Biggest mistake of my life was taking the shot to get my wife out of lockdown. 2 years later and I still have heart problems and thrombosis in my legs. F the entire medical mafia.
227,i9JLZuhqRuU,Risks you say? Well when businesses were mandating it for people to work without them knowing the risks. I'm just so grateful that I never took the vaccine even though I lost my 20 year career at a hospital. I'm still alive. Had covid 14 months ago . No problem. My symptoms were less than my friends that are vaccinated.
228,i9JLZuhqRuU,"I am an 68 year old woman. The last time I was hospitized was in 1960, right after the Polio vaccine , I developed Viral Encephalitis post Chicken Pox! I NEVER take the flu vaccine, rarely got the flu. If I did get the flu ,I treated it with Homeopathic remedies. I was a US Navy Nurse Corps scholarship student in college. I left nursing, got an Honorable Discharge and became a Special Education teacher for 37 years! When I retired from teaching I had 300 Unused Sick Days. I take ZERO prescription drugs. I use ONLY vitamins & some herbs. I am recovering from Covid-19. The very first time I ever got it! I have relatives who were vaxed and had Covid 19 three times!!!!! I didn't get vaxed! When I got Covid 19 , I was NEVER hospitized. I was given a drug to reduce nausea! I am recovering at home!"
229,i9JLZuhqRuU,People should have had the choice and discussion rather than censorship and gas lighting.
230,i9JLZuhqRuU,"My best friend's husband, a healthy hockey trainer, ended up having to get a pacemaker due to unexplained heart issues after the 2nd shot.  They tried doing it through the vein, but too many clots.  After that, he had multiple mini-strokes.  Poor guy can't remember anything.  We went on vacation together.  He remembers going but can't tell you anything about the week.  I try to talk to them about it, but they won't hear it.  He even got a booster after all of that.  So sad."
231,i9JLZuhqRuU,"A friend with diabetes, high blood pressure and depression in her 50's completely vaxed and boosted decided to quit her medications for the first two issues ( she refused to admit she was depressed). Christmas 2022 she had a massive stroke and was taken to the emergency room. The pain in her head was so severe she was pounding her head with her fists. The emergency room staff waited to treat her until after their shift change. She went into a coma with swelling on the brain. The hospital transfered her 3 times within two months saying they needed her bed. The family wanted to keep her on life saving procedures to give her a chance to recover. The hospital not so much. Her insurance coverage ran out and she was transferred to an independent care facility. She is now being transferred from facility to facility as her insurance benefits expire. She can now recognize her name and follow people in her room by moving her head. I have read that the Vax passing the blood brain barrier can also cause dementia. It's plausible that the vaxing and boosters caused her to become more mentally ill which could be why she thought it was okay to quit her life saving medications. 
The medical system corruption is another story."

273,I9S2jooTxkQ,"In April 2021, I had shots 1 and 2 of Pfizer. I am a 25-year MS patient.  I was walking FINE prior to this. Within 1 HOUR of shor 2, I was not walking. 
I then did not walk for 15 months, had Covid 3 times, and shingles twice. Fought through and fired 4 neurologists who all said I had gone progressive with my MS until FINALLY getting a full head-to-tail MRI, which showed my scans were the same stable scans that I have had for the last decade. 
It is not my MS. It was neuroinflammation from the vaccine. There are a whopping TWO doctors that I will trust...  MANY want to silence us the vaccine-injured."
274,I9S2jooTxkQ,"Im a nurse practitioner and was essentially forced to take the jab due to the company I worked for requiring it. I reluctantly gave in and got vaccinated in May 2021.

I am an ICU nurse with MS. When the vaccine came out, everyone was like are you getting it? Aren't you in immunosuppressive drugs?
I said actually until I can see that is proven to not cause relapse I will not.

I fought with my employer against vaccination for 2 years and finally won having a permanent exemption. Because there are case study of severe relapse.  So glad I am a heath care worker and know how to stand up for myself and to think for myself."

281,I9S2jooTxkQ,"In April 2021 I was a healthy 60-year-old woman and wanted to have a little bit of life back. I decided to get the Pfizer vaccine and I told my husband to let me go first and see how I do since he has some medical issues. I thought I did fine and got the second one but within a couple of weeks something was very wrong, but I didn't think about the vaccine I thought maybe my age.  My balance was off, I had a tightness around my waist, I didn't want to drive at night, and my personality had changed.  My daughter started googling and said it sounds like MS.  My daughter asked a friend that was a doctor and he said he didn't think so. My age was the main reason. 
I will skip ahead to January 2023 and finally had an MRI and had many lesions. In my report, it said, ‚Äúsomewhat old for this active MS.‚Äù  My next step was a spinal tap and I had the bands in my fluid.  I was finally diagnosed with MS.  In April I started Ocrevus.  My life has changed so much in the last 2 years.  I am 99.999 percent sure it was the vaccine that caused my MS."

322,Z-zWo835gOs,I am with the doctor. Well done. No one should be forced.
323,Z-zWo835gOs,"Anytime a news presenter has the audacity to argue about medical matters without scientific basis to a medical doctor, the World has gone mad!"
324,Z-zWo835gOs,I'm a doctor myself and my issue is the mandating of the vaccine for NHS workers or anyone else for that matter. Compelling people to put something into their bodies that they don't want is a dangerous road to go down
325,Z-zWo835gOs,This is a doctor I trust - good on her for standing her ground!
326,Z-zWo835gOs,"I was worried what the comment section would look like, but it is so refreshing to see people applauding someone for voicing their opinion instead of vilifying them as the reporter is doing."
327,Z-zWo835gOs,"Firstlt, why is a news reporter arguing with a doctor? Ya‚Äôll are not the same. Secondly, why not tell grandpa to get vaccinated instead of blaming other people for putting grandpa ‚Äúat risk‚Äù?"
328,Z-zWo835gOs,The doctor does not have to justify why she hasn't had a vaccine to anyone...and neither do I!
329,Z-zWo835gOs,"I applaud this doctor; she is taking a wise, sensible approach."
330,Z-zWo835gOs,So much respect for this doctor üôå  I'm disgusted by the way she is being treated by this interviewer and how many people who aren't vaccinated are being discriminated against.
331,Z-zWo835gOs,I get to choose what I put in MY body. Fully support this doctor. I never listen to the media or the government. Always using spin. WELL DONE THAT DOCTOR!!
332,Li-oxKhvZy0,The body count between these three men is something truly impressive. And scary.

336,Li-oxKhvZy0,I am sure the true number of dislikes are probably 100k or more.
337,Li-oxKhvZy0,Thinking a politician cares about you is like thinking a stripper really likes you for your personality. We do not want your experimental drugs
338,Li-oxKhvZy0,"So they're still playing scenes in the cemeteries, like when they were young skull & bones playmates."

They died from medical mal-practice and from a denial of early and alternative treatments and being forced onto ventilators."
357,UijQ-6jhVuc,This happened to me! I got my first dose and a few weeks later I was hospitalized and my platelets were VERY low and my red blood cells were EXTREMELY high. The doctor said I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be alive. I had the Pfizer vaccine. I regret I ever got that shot.
358,UijQ-6jhVuc,My sister in law had several strokes after her first booster. She was the healthier member of our family and in her early 50‚Äôs. She said she had felt different after the shots. I‚Äôm grateful I never got vaccinated. Bummed that two of my kids did get vaccinated üôè

512,oMXGGmBfkf8,"Here are the answers to some common questions. Please note that this video is about the scientific basis of mRNA vaccines in general, not about any particular vaccine or manufacturer. This video is not sponsored by anyone and does not represent endorsement of any particular vaccine. The answers below are based on well-known, basic knowledge of mRNA/cell biology and immunology, which can be found in ANY TEXTBOOK. More Q&A may be added later.
Also note: this video was originally intended for our regular audience (med students), so it's more technical. We have a simpler version here: https://youtu.be/XTLYXmgG8DU
For comparison of different vaccines, as well as events of immune response, role of different immune cells (T-cells, B-cells, APC), see this video: https://youtu.be/osRo-yz1VQ8
Q1: How long the mRNA from vaccine will stay in human body? A: mRNA is very unstable, it is easily degraded by enzymes in our cells (RNAses). Average half-life of mRNA in human is around 10 hours. mRNA from vaccine is expected to stay no longer than a day.
Q2: How long the antigen (translated from mRNA vaccine) is expected to stay in our body? A: Several days. Once the immune system is activated, it will see the cells that carry the antigen as damaged and destroy them.
Q3: So from A to Q2, our immune system destroys our own cells, is that bad? A: No. This is the natural way the body detects foreign antigens, just like when an infection occurs ‚Äì infected cells display pieces of the virus to alert the immune system and get killed. The difference is that you can control the dose with the vaccine, unlike a natural infection. And the vaccine does not multiply. The number of our own cells that will be killed with the vaccine dose is negligible. The effect is also limited to the cells around the injection site. Note that traditional vaccines also work this way: the antigen delivered by a traditional vaccine is also taken up by some of our cells, it is then broken into pieces and displayed on the surface of the cell to be ""seen"" by the immune system. This is the only way for the immune system to detect foreign antigens. The body will replace the lost cells within several days. For more details see this video: https://youtu.be/osRo-yz1VQ8
Q4: So now the immune system will produce the antibodies, will it ever stop? A: It's the same process that happens when there is a natural infection. So, upon infection or vaccination, antibodies will take a couple of weeks to be produced, the level will peak for about a couple more weeks and then it will go down, no more production. But now the body remembers the virus because some memory cells are left - when you encounter the real virus these cells will produce antibodies again, this time instantly in response ‚Äì so fast that no infection will occur. If the body does not encounter the virus then, no antibodies will be produced.
Q5: How about side effects? A: All vaccines have side effects, mRNA or traditional. The list of side effects should be available online or at any location that offers the vaccine.
Q6: How mRNA gets into cells? A: It is delivered in lipid covering that will fuse with cell membrane (also consists of lipids) - it's called endocytosis.
Q7: Is this gene therapy? A: No, gene therapy involves replacing your gene with a new one, this vaccine does not touch your genes.
Q8: Can mRNA vaccine change my DNA? See full A in this video: https://youtu.be/XTLYXmgG8DU
Q9: I had COVID and recovered, do I still need the vaccine? A: You probably do not need the vaccine if your infection was recent, at least for now. The question remains is how long natural immunity will last, and how long protection by vaccine will last, we do not yet know the answers. UPDATE: 1 dose of mRNA vaccine in people with previous infection works as well as 2 doses in people without previous infection. Basically: previous infection gives the same immunity as 1 dose of mRNA vaccine."
513,oMXGGmBfkf8,So how does the message sequence stop the spike protein from repeating process multiple times and what is the estimated time sequence remains in manufacturing mode?
514,oMXGGmBfkf8,"I'm just wondering, is this technique has specificity on what cells it will endocytose? Doesn't seem like it will be specific to any as it uses lipid. Also, is it a single layer lipid, lipid bilayer or has the structure like extracellular vesicles."
515,oMXGGmBfkf8,how did the time table shoot from 12-18 months to less than 1 year? Plenty of articles in March/April saying it would be risky pushing out a vaccine quickly..
516,oMXGGmBfkf8,"First of all thank you for the explanational video.
I read also the pinned and answered me a lot of questions.
I have one more and sorry if its somehow explained but as english is not my primary language I maybe missed than.
There are sayings that mrna (for covid) may create autoimmune ilnesses in long term (as its not 100% tested).. is something like that possible?
I am not afraid of immidiate effects I understand how it works (more or less) what I am worried is that it may cause an ilness in future.. is that possible?
Thank you"
517,oMXGGmBfkf8,"Please correct me if I'm wrong. If it is our self cells that are going to express the antigen, then it is going to be expressed by the MHC class 1 right? And only cd8 t cells bind to them and not cd4 t or b cells. We might have some memory cd8 t cells for that but we wont be able to produce antibodies against the virus? Or are we also expecting the lipid nanoparticle containing mRna to be engulfed by macrophages or something?"
518,oMXGGmBfkf8,Where can we see the list of ingredients (active and inactive) utilized to create the vaccine ?
519,oMXGGmBfkf8,"Hey there, nice video, detailed and understandable. When the antigen is displayed on our own cells where it is recognized by the immune system 0:54 I would like to know what will happens as the immune system will start fighting our own cells with this new antigen display on its surface. It might be that the antigen are just release outside the cell, not causing the LT to attack the cells but only the antigen ?
And also if you have time, how does the vaccine target specific cells and will not spread in your body to integrate mRNA in cells like neurons. Thanks :)"
520,oMXGGmBfkf8,"2:53 when the codons are optimized to avoid recognition, how can they be translated correctly to create the right protein?"
521,oMXGGmBfkf8,"Love the vid! Just have a question and im sorry if i sound dumb. Can the cells with the rna of the vaccine still work as usual? For example, if we are altering how the cell detects foreign agents can the immune response to other diseases get  weaker or slower? Thx!"
522,3rIQHrbDguM,"I refused as a coast guard reservist. Had my quals stripped, was not allowed to transfer/promote. Harassed by the command for two years.

523,3rIQHrbDguM,"I walked away from a 140,000 a year job over refusing the shot. I don‚Äôt regret it one bit! I didn‚Äôt feel giving me the ultimatum, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to get the shot or we are going to take your livelihood from you‚Äù was right! It went against my rights as a freeman and patriot. I wasn‚Äôt willing to give up my medical freedom to any demand. Thank you for standing strong!"
524,3rIQHrbDguM,"I‚Äôm a nurse. Got fired from my job for refusing. I recognized the BS immediately. The pressure from other nurses, doctors and my wife was immense. They lied about it all. It makes me happy to hear how many in the military refused."

526,3rIQHrbDguM,"My company tried to make the vax mandatory when it first came out. In the building I was managing they asked me to check with all the employees to see who wanted to go for a free vaccine on company time and that the company strongly felt we must all be vaccinated to keep each other safe. It came back a unanimous ""no thanks"" including myself. The director of operations came into my building first trying to shame me saying i was setting a bad  example and was afraid of a little shot. I told him he was the one afraid desperate to make people get shots over a cold. He then said masks at all times will be mandatory as well as daily temperature checks for those who refuse the vax and those who didn't comply would have to find another job. I got tired of the back and forth and finally told him straight ""Listen, we're not doing any of that. If you keep pressing the issue i'll take the entire staff in this building with me to a competitor and take half your customers with me. Now piss off and go pretend like you have some useful function in the company we're done here"". The issue was never brought up again."
527,3rIQHrbDguM,All you servicemen that refused I have the most respect for you folks are the real deal
528,3rIQHrbDguM,"I know alot of people who got the shot and regretted it, but have never met anybody who didnt get the shot and regretted it."

547,vIG5zTLB3hw,"I understand your anger, John. I was one of many that was fired from a college because I refused to get my experimental pokes, but what makes me angry isn't the fact that the University fired me, but the fact that they forced all the students to take the jabs as well in order to continue their studies and graduate. The school put the demographic that was at the greatest risk of heart problems into a position where they were heavily pressured under duress into taking something that can lead to health complications later in their adult lives and there is no recourse if they are permanently injured."

563,iyo2UNQcdpQ,"My Father (74), had taken 5 jabs, he had been complaining for the last 2 years about chest and back pain, last week he collapsed and passed out, I called the paramedics, they told him he was just having a panic attack, later in the day I took him to the ER because he started to cough up blood. At the hospital they took an X-ray of his heart, gave him a sleeping pill and an injection of some muscle relaxant, they didn‚Äôt take blood or look for clots. We got him around 4:30 AM, I woke up to him in pain, I immediately started the truck to take him to the hospital and when I came back in to help him to the truck he collapsed and died in my arms. The ME wasn‚Äôt going to do an autopsy, but I pushed them to do one. They found myocarditis, several blockages in the arteries around the heart and hemorrhaging in the lungs. The worst part about all of this tragedy is that he trusted our State Funded Media here in Canada and the Government over his own loving family.

564,iyo2UNQcdpQ,"This is all sadly unbelievable, as I sat with my wife and watched this fiasco unfold.  I wouldn‚Äôt allow my wife, or my children to receive any of the shots.  My entire extended family of very well educated people with Doctorates, Masters, and Bachelors, all questioned beyond belief our misunderstanding of the ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù we were missing to save our own lives by receiving a 6 month old ‚ÄúWonder of Science‚Äù, and how could we DARE question ‚ÄúScience‚Äù.  I can promise you, they‚Äôre not lining up any more for their shots, and it‚Äôs strange how silent they are about their shots now!

567,iyo2UNQcdpQ,"I lost my  only child at 49 three days ago. He was born with heart disease but after several surgeries, was healthy. He did not want the vaccine, but his steel mill employer told him he could lose his job. Tuesday evening he had sudden chest pain and was unable to breathe, and fell dead. Probably a blood clot caused by the vaccine. His wife and I did not want him to undergo an autopsy. I blame this wretched government for my son‚Äôs death. They took my everything away from me. May God pour his mighty vengeance upon them."
568,iyo2UNQcdpQ,"Too many ""peer-reviewed"" journals only require a Conflict of Interest statement from the authors, not the reviewers, editors, or publishers.

570,iyo2UNQcdpQ,My mother was a vivid high functioning person who ran an antique store and was an accomplished artists. When Covid hit my mother and father immediately got in line for the shot and every booster they could get! About two months after my father called me and said that they were having health problems. My mother was having a hard time with her memory and him with his general health. My mother is now in hospice and my father is not too far behind. It happened so fast! I know this can happen without a shot but it all seemed to start as soon as they got it.
571,iyo2UNQcdpQ,"Dr. Campbell, you are one of the few people who can differentiate between the individual case and the statistic while keeping in mind that these are still individual cases of tragedy. Your down to earth, unexcited and dry presentation does you credit in this hyper emotionalized debate. Please continue doing what you do. I too will follow the evidence."

587,lEFYYpE_hds,My friends cousin (female) who is 19 went into cardiac arrest 3 days after 2nd vaccine. She just had a heart transplant and has a long road ahead of her. It‚Äôs more common than they are letting people believe.
588,lEFYYpE_hds,"They really need to report numbers and percentages so we can have even a clue as to what an ""increased rate"" is. News channels are so bad at reporting useful information and ambiguous information only increased emotional reactions and conjecture."
589,lEFYYpE_hds,Imagine posting such a story and not stating how many have had these reactions out of how many observed. I guess that's why you don't need a degree to be a news anchor...
590,lEFYYpE_hds,I'm so sorry for all the individuals here that were convinced or cohersed into taking this vaccine. People really need to band together and push back against this.
591,lEFYYpE_hds,"Proudly unvaccinated. Y‚Äôall were flat out brainwashed. Me? I stayed strong. Had my money saved. When my job laid me off for not taking that jab, I was ready. I had over 3 years of rent saved up. I was living good for the past 2 in half years. Get ya priorities straight."
592,P3nXJB5PoBM,My Aunt died three days after having the v. She was an athlete who‚Äôs heart just stopped in her sleep. I know a guy who can no longer walk after complications from the v.
593,P3nXJB5PoBM,"Hey David, you seem like a really smart guy. May I give you a little unsolicited advice? Forget about politics for a moment. Forget about political parties for a day and go out into the world and try to find the truth about this. Do research online. Talk to doctors. Talk to families of healthy young people who just suddenly drop dead. Do some digging and follow the truth wherever it takes you. If you are able to take politics out of your research you will find some semblance of the truth. And the truth is scary."
594,P3nXJB5PoBM,My university professor died right after his 3rd dose. He said he would take the week off for that and that was the last time we saw him. Also my ex-girlfriend is now battling with Von Willebrand disease and has severe heart issues. She had none of that before getting vaccinated.
595,P3nXJB5PoBM,Why does David ask for comments if he doesn‚Äôt read them?
596,P3nXJB5PoBM,"Anecdotally I personally know 7 people who were hospitalized with pericarditis,myocarditis or embolisms within 2 weeks of vaccination. 3 others ‚Äúonly ‚Äú had temporary Bells Palsy within a week of getting the first booster. No one died. I know of 3 deaths from COVID pneumonia and 3 or 4 serious illnesses. The overwhelming majority of the people I know who have had COVID were barely ill. Most were unvaccinated."
597,P3nXJB5PoBM,"A friend had to be hospitalised after the jab. Had serious blood clots. Once he got over that he became paralysed on one side. 
A couple of other people became very lethargic, tired all the time and had to stop working. Blacked out while driving. 
Thing is, we don't really know the longterm effects. If you were to get cancer or heart disease years down the line how do you know if it was from the vax or how much it contributed to your illness?? 
I know many people who still contracted Covid, some very seriously, after receiving multiple jabs."
598,P3nXJB5PoBM,My friend is dead..35 years old .a roofer..said he got the shot to protect his daughter .died of heart attack...so suck it
599,P3nXJB5PoBM,My Dad died of myocardial infarction about 2 weeks after getting the vaccine. He was in his early 60s and quite overweight which definitely contributed (if not the sole cause) but the timing of him dying so soon after the vaccine has left us all with a few question marks
600,P3nXJB5PoBM,"Yet those responsible are walking around free , evading justice and not being held to account ."
601,P3nXJB5PoBM,My cousin had a heart attack after the jab at 33
602,p42FmUNULWg,The fact a doctor does not want vaccine speaks volumes. üòÆ

606,p42FmUNULWg,The smartest among us refused.
607,p42FmUNULWg,"So many doctors didn‚Äôt want this üò¢
Our medical system needs to be renamed more accurately to ‚Äòour pharmaceutical system‚Äô."
608,p42FmUNULWg,This Dr needs a massive raise.
609,p42FmUNULWg,"Medication so dangerous, doctors sacrifice their entire career to avoid it."
610,p42FmUNULWg,"They should not be able to force anyone to inject anything into their bodies.  If a doctor feels that going to these lengths to keep his job, and doesn't feel the vaccine he is being told he must take is safe why force him?  Why not give him the choice,  and respect his decision, especially when he is a doctor? 
Stripping him of his ability to carry on treating his patients, comes across as more sinister than if he doesnt take it he is a public health risk."
611,p42FmUNULWg,This why I didn‚Äôt take it and never will I knew I was right
612,uOxppT3gPpE,It amazes me how people are still in denial simply because their egos can't tolerate how wrong they have been this whole time. And on top of that they feel like they're the intelligent ones.
613,uOxppT3gPpE,Even mentioning this used to get you banned or fired. Was madness
614,uOxppT3gPpE,"It‚Äôs amazing how some people are still so trusting and naive, even after they‚Äôve been lied to. And after they KNOW they‚Äôve been lied to"
615,uOxppT3gPpE,The way this  whole thing was handled has turned me complete anti vaxx. I hope everyone effected gets justice.
616,uOxppT3gPpE,My heart breaks for all the people who felt pressure to take the jab.
617,uOxppT3gPpE,"I'm a simple man. When the Dr. who created the MRNA technology said it wasnt safe, that is all i needed to hear."
618,uOxppT3gPpE,I'm still 17 and took vaccine at 15 yrs age... After vaccine my health got downhill and developed high Bp and heart issues and I'm still youngüò¢üò¢
619,uOxppT3gPpE,This is like when the police investigate the police to find that there was no misconduct by the police.
620,uOxppT3gPpE,"During covid vaccinations: ""Safe, tested, proven, effective!""
After covid vaccinations: ""There is no such a thing as vaccination without side effects""
I sucked it in. This one myself as well! üòÖ Never again! No matter what new pandemic gonna come!"
621,uOxppT3gPpE,"One of my relatives developed pericarditis three days after taking 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine. He was absolutely healthy previously and he is in his early twenties. Kaiser doctors at the beginning were trying to deny any connection to vaccine. He was several times in and out of the hospital now and finally they admitted that it's related to vaccine. Also, my mother-in -law developed bone cancer after the ""shot"". My sister in law's mother just passed away after her cervical cancer returned after long remission after the ""shot"". My other's sister-in-law father developed severe heart issue also right after the shot, to the point that he is dying now. Of course, they are all older people, but what is striking is the timing of this.  I have not taken the shot, neither my child and nor my husband because 10 years ago when we took swine flu vaccine we all got severe side effects, and that is why we did not take any covid shots. My husband developed stroke then ( absolutely healthy 36 year old), I almost died from Guillain-Barre syndrome , my child developed severe neuropathy, and my husbands uncle had a heart attack. Again coincidence? I was very healthy before the flu shot, and now I am almost disabled. I did regain some of my health after the Guillain Barre  , but I am still have severe residual symptoms. I am a microbiologist and have also medical background and I would never take another vax even if threatened. It is a poison, you might not believe me and think it is just all some kind of conspiracy nonsense , but I hope you will heed the warning! Lot of smart people, scientists and doctors spoke against it, but the censorship is very live and strong on YT"
622,r_eFcUpVtqE,"So many of my friends were loudly touting the ""vaccine"" 2 years ago and shaming those who didn't get it. Now they're strangely quiet......"
623,r_eFcUpVtqE,"I remember when India asked to do a independent study of Pfizer's vaccines first before deploying it in India, and they refused. They would rather sacrifice over a billion customer base, than have their product independently examined. That should tell you what the shots have."
624,r_eFcUpVtqE,The damages it has done to people who had received the vaccines is unimaginable!
625,r_eFcUpVtqE,It is criminal what they have done to humanity üò°üò°üò°
626,r_eFcUpVtqE,It made you more susceptible to it by weakening or destroying your immune system.
627,r_eFcUpVtqE,I'm not Vaccinated...Thanks God
628,r_eFcUpVtqE,"My father, my neighbours, my friends parents... strokes, heart attacks, thrombosis, brain inflammation."
629,r_eFcUpVtqE,I‚Äôm retired and presently work as an independent contractor teaching safety related courses. I said if they want to give me this crap they‚Äôd have to dart me like a wildebeest from a helicopter. Many people thought I was crazy then‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. No so many now.
630,r_eFcUpVtqE,It blows my mind to see a real news program ask questions about the jabs. Well done India.
631,r_eFcUpVtqE,I refused the vaccine and so did my daughter.
632,pxKMrcxxjfM,Do you think this requirement will be overturned ? And when do you think this would happen? Because this vaccine is basically not requirement for nothing else except for immigration it's very unconstitutional :(
633,pxKMrcxxjfM,"My friend has a heart problem like palpitation, pvcs, and arrythmia, he has the copy of the result from the hospital, and he did a research and found out that covid 19 vaccine has an ingredient that increases the palpitation, so it may make his  health issue worse. he can't have the vaccine. My question is, the civil surgeon can write a letter to the immigration that he can't take the vaccine, providing the heart result?"
634,pxKMrcxxjfM,If i already take 3 doses covid do i have to take the last update covid??
635,pxKMrcxxjfM,Hello good day. Do we have to be fully vaccinated(covid vaxx) if getting our medical examination at st. Lukes medical center and at USEM? My husband applied me IR1 visa and IR2 for my son(8 yrs old)
636,pxKMrcxxjfM,"We petition my son frm the Philippines he don‚Äôt have schedule yet for interview and medical, but he doesn‚Äôt want to get the covid vaccine, what other option he can have? Or he needs to show and submit religious exemption?"
637,pxKMrcxxjfM,What if the vaccine is no longer available in my country?
638,pxKMrcxxjfM,Does my spouse need a green card to be able to come to America
639,pxKMrcxxjfM,please tell me the approximate price of a lawyer for the Supreme Court to cancel the vaccine for a green card?
640,pxKMrcxxjfM,What about if you been here for more than 20 yrs +..  Never travel outside..
641,pxKMrcxxjfM,Is it still a requirement for the foreign National for a green card?
642,aOInguXymGc,I'm still not voting for Biden.  Robert will always be the better option.
643,aOInguXymGc,Kennedy is the best option in my lifetime that we have had for president. There was no peer reviewed scientific evidence to refute any of the things Kennedy says. Jest ‚Äúhe is a conspiracy theorist‚Äù
644,aOInguXymGc,"I've spent hours listening to RFK JR. All you people do is lie about him.

645,aOInguXymGc,"To anyone buying the spin of this video, try watching any one of rfk's long form interviews and see how this drek holds up"
646,aOInguXymGc,Politifact and CBS calling RFK lier of the year is TOO rich.
647,aOInguXymGc,"I'll be voting for RFK Jr. Kennedy has many solutions to a lot of other issues that affect all Americans. And he wants to rebuild the middle class, make housing affordable again and wants to use some of our military budget to fix these issues, including the decaying infrastructure of America. Kennedy is the best choice for America."
648,aOInguXymGc,"The machine is so scared now, they‚Äôre totally desperate with their lies about RFK!"
649,aOInguXymGc,Kennedy2024! It‚Äôs happening!

I am not anti vax, I have willingly had plenty of vaccines introduced to my body. I just want people to have choice and want for big pharma to be open that things are in a trial phase and not fully proven. No one should be an unwilling lab experiment."

662,Kd-E95tXfsY,Your own immune system is better without interruption.

669,Kd-E95tXfsY,"Can someone please explain to me, if I have already had covid and recovered from it, then my immune system would have made the antibodies, correct? What is the difference between antibodies from natural immunity versus anitbodies from mRNA? Wouldn't natural immunity be stronger than synthetic immunity?"
670,Kd-E95tXfsY,So what happens when the M spike goes through structural changes such as in the case of the new variants?  I assume vaxxed and unvaxxed will be in the same position after a few months.  Simply put we cannot keep chasing these variants by vaccinating every few months. It‚Äôs not practical or good for our overall health.

676,6z4oAgRCySc,"I've been trying to tell people, HAITI had the best Covid outcomes in the western hemisphere according to the WHO data, NO Vax, No Mandates! What does this tell us people?"
677,6z4oAgRCySc,"We had a great time in several East African countries during ‚Äúthat time.‚Äù Tanzania rejected all COV-ID measures - vaccines, masks, shut-downs, all rejected. It was such a great liberating space to be at that time. Spent time in a couple other countries that did the testing but had limited vaccine utilization. We‚Äôve moved to Kenya since. This disease has been more of a political matter than anything else. One trip back to the US and we caught the thing. Arrrrgh! Africa has been way safer for us concerning this context."
678,6z4oAgRCySc,The virus was so deadly that you have to test yourself to know if you were infected
679,6z4oAgRCySc,"Hi Dr. , thank you for your presentations. I am a seventy year old South African and I would like to share with you what happened here.The black peoples of Africa have a culture which is highly family orientated. They all have a deep respect for elders and tribal leaders. There was a massive campaign to force vaccination here, co-ordinated by our corrupt government in co-operation with big Pharma and the large private sector retail and hospital outlets. The staff at most of these were given no option ...take the vaccine or lose your job. Guess what? They opted to lose their jobs, because their tribal leaders ordered them not to take the vaccine. Millions of doses were destroyed and heavy financial losses suffered by  the big deals because they ignored the influence of tribal customs. I know this because I am a pharmacist who works in the retail industry here."
680,6z4oAgRCySc,"RIP president of Tanzania, a true hero who loved his nation and people. His bravery in speaking truth will be cherished forever."

684,EETuOY3JjfM,"I am an athlete. I got my second dose of the covid vaccine 3 days ago. The next day after the vaccine, I couldn't sleep. I had the worst fever ever. Today is my 3rd day after the second shot, I feel normal but my stamina when I workout is not the same. I feel like I get fatigued much faster than before and I run out of breath much faster than I used to. I swear I am not lying."

688,EETuOY3JjfM,"My friend, who is 39, fit and healthy, was hospitalized with stroke-like symptoms yesterday. He received his second vaccine dose 3-4 weeks ago, his wife said he woke up in the morning and complained of his heart racing and difficulty breathing. While they were waiting for the ambulance she checked his heart rate with their blood oxygen finger monitor, his heart rate was at 155BPM. Can someone explain why a guy with no health issues had a reaction like this after getting the covid vaccination? I'm not anti-vax but this scares the hell out of me. I've heard reports of death and heart inflammation after getting the Covid vaccine, I feel like the vaccine will weaken the heart and cause health problems down the line for healthy adults 18-44."
689,EETuOY3JjfM,the human body is amazing the way it fights for your health
690,EETuOY3JjfM,I had my first jab yesterday but I've been nauseous and weak ever since plus got a running stomach. As someone that hasn't fallen sick on a decade this sucks.

My colleague's girlfriend (2 younge kids) is battling breast cancer at 34 for over a year now and she's not out of the woods yet. This isn't a fight she should be fighting; she should be enjoying her two young daughters, and instead, she's worried she won't see another year. This always happens to the best of us humans too.

909,h6potmDg0ek,Wait wait wait‚Ä¶. You didn‚Äôt say it loud enough‚Ä¶.SHE HAD THIS HAPPEN AFTER BEING VACCINATED
910,h6potmDg0ek,"I have a coworker who was born with a congenital heart condition and had to have multiple heart surgeries as a child‚Ä¶ she was afraid to get the vaccine due to the cardiac side effects, so never got vaccinated but ended up getting Covid‚Ä¶ Thankfully she recovered without any lasting effects."
911,h6potmDg0ek,"Doctors tried to amputate my friend‚Äôs leg from the hip due to clotting.. she didn‚Äôt allow it, neither from the knee or the ankle or the toes each time those ‚Äúbutchers‚Äù tried to convince her it was life and death. Years later she sill has her legs thanks to not complying."
912,h6potmDg0ek,"If she was born with a serious heart condition, how is she a ‚Äúhealthy individual‚Äù? I think she is the definition of an individual with serious health conditions"
913,h6potmDg0ek,I can't imagine being a 20 year and losing  legs. God bless her and her family.
914,h6potmDg0ek,"I absolutely feel for her.  Sounds like she is a very strong woman.  I wish her the best.  I encourage people to think outside the box.  Outside the MSM.

I had a close friend that died recently.  She was a fitness competitor.  In her prime and incredibly healthy.  She had no prior health concerns.  Fast forward to post ""covid prevention method"" She began experiencing extreme leg pain.  Her legs began to rapidly swell up.  She went into the hospital, where the clotting continued to get worse.  The doctors had no answers.  The only option was to amputate her legs from the hip down.  After the procedure, she died of a heart attack soon after.  In no way, shape or form was she sick with covid.  

This isn't the only story."
915,h6potmDg0ek,"Yea my mom had a very serious blood clot almost killed her, it did take away her vision but she survived. That paired with elevated heart rate high blood pressure and enlarged heart. All happened shortly after being vaccinated"
916,yhECkm16AGU,A good thing about being called a conspiracy theorist is not having myocarditis ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
917,yhECkm16AGU,Refusing the covid vaccine was one of my best decisions ever.
918,yhECkm16AGU,Bri gets awfully quiet once she realizes this narrative isn't going her way.
919,yhECkm16AGU,The whole thing has been a crime against humanity.
920,yhECkm16AGU,"The CDC didn't Fail, they accomplished exactly what they wanted."
921,yhECkm16AGU,What‚Äôs the difference between the truth and a conspiracy theory? About six months.
922,yhECkm16AGU,Bri is so deep in her vaccine defense stance she just can‚Äôt stand to hear truth
923,yhECkm16AGU,"This information is almost 3 years old for us ""conspiracy theorists"". How did we know? We just followed the doctors and scientists they were censoring; it wasn't that profound or prophetic. Anyway... I guess it's better late that never."
924,yhECkm16AGU,Briahna blinking as she sees her talking points fall apart is priceless. Especially when he discussed the nature of myocarditis in COVID patients vs vaccinated.
925,yhECkm16AGU,Bri looked devastated by the news.   She may have to come to terms with spreading MISinformation.
926,RQwcX-B6luw,"A 120k for severe disability, life totally ruined. That is no justice."
927,RQwcX-B6luw,The fact these pharma companies were given complete indemnity by our government tells you all you need to know
928,RQwcX-B6luw,"The GP had assured us, in a patronising way, that the AZ jab was completely safe and that we were being silly worrying about it, and that Mum needed the jab because of her age (86). 

Two days after her AZ jab in Feb 2021, my mother developed 'flu' symptoms. 5 days later she was in hospital with a suspected pulmonary embolism (according to the consultant). She died the next morning. The only consolation was that I was ""permitted"" to sit with her for her last hour of life. 

I will never forgive the Govt (and GP) for ignoring science and allowing such emotional and physical damage to innocent citizens."
929,RQwcX-B6luw,I am so happy I resisted all social pressure and did not take a jab. Even at the high social costs.
930,RQwcX-B6luw,I wonder how many people who on here are going to tell us about their injuries are the same people who shamed and abused the people who refused it ?
931,RQwcX-B6luw,And those of us who did not listen to our governments were seen as stupid ü§¶üèª
932,RQwcX-B6luw,"It is not about compensation, which is paid by the taxpayer and not astra zeneca.  Its about holding those who lied to us to account for thier crimes."
933,RQwcX-B6luw,"When tens of thousands of NHS nurses refused to take the vaccines even under severe threats of being sacked other people should have taken notice, the whole thing stunk at the time"
934,RQwcX-B6luw,Covid will be talked about for decades to come. The greatest social and science experiment.
935,RQwcX-B6luw,Big Pharma need to foot the bill and be held accountable for what they have done.
936,ButW2kNe564,How come someone's religious belief can be questioned but someone's gender can't. Please make it make sense.
937,ButW2kNe564,You shouldn‚Äôt even have to do this kind of run around with exemptions as a free citizen you should have the right to just say no.

956,7n6Eagn5d78,Love how a high profile married couple can disagree and stay civil.
957,7n6Eagn5d78,Well that was weirdly refreshing. Can anyone actually imagine a fully autonomous and articulate First Lady that has her own views and positions?

994,It7VNzhAqOs,"I have a friend who developed a pulmonary embolism after his second vaccination shot. He was told by his doctor, the hospital and CDC it was not related to the vaccine, but he'd never had that type of an issue before.  And they wonder why people are hesitant to get vaccinated."
995,It7VNzhAqOs,"Notice they never promote natural immunity or antibody treatment, it‚Äôs all about the shots. Glad this doctor is getting the word out."
996,It7VNzhAqOs,"When I had my vac at a pharmacy I asked if they could aspirate and the person said they were not trained to do that, I would have to go to a nurse for vaccination. I find that appalling, a layman trained to give a vaccine but not trained in safety techniques. This is in Australia."

1002,It7VNzhAqOs,"im starting to have my doubts about the whole covid thing , here in NZ anyone who doesnt get a vaccine can be fired with 4 weeks pay which is the same as forcing people to get it , additionally i had a reaction to the vaccine (pzier) that did not get better after 2 months  ,i went to my GP who said there was no mechanism to report long term effects due to covid vax , im now very concerned"

Thank you for spreading evidence-based medical knowledge with a sympathetic and digestible message!"
1016,2Ruq3o7iZho,Never thought I would see a science experience on pregnant women.
1017,2Ruq3o7iZho,"Just had the weirdest realization when she was talking about the placenta. My body has the ability to not only create new human life,  but a whole new organ outside the fetus as well. Never thought about it. And I've given birth twice!  ü§Ø"
1018,2Ruq3o7iZho,"When I got my first shot I had a sore arm, of course, and a bit of a headache, and I was EXHAUSTED. The rest of it cleared up, but the exhaustion only lessened a bit. Which is when I realized I was about five weeks pregnant. LOL! Turns out baby was more to blame for the exhaustion than the vaccine was."
1019,2Ruq3o7iZho,"I‚Äôm happy to see this I got both of my Covid shots back in I believe March and I recently found out I‚Äôm pregnant with my 5th child even though my 4 children are grown up and I‚Äôm a grandmother,  this little one came very unexpectedly and honestly if I didn‚Äôt watch your shows and decide to take a pregnancy test I probably would‚Äôve been on the show I didn‚Äôt know I was pregnant!!  because I‚Äôm 26 weeks and I had no clue once I got my Covid shot I never recovered I was constantly throwing up thinking well I ever recover from getting the shot, and I also have crazy periods so i didn‚Äôt think absolutely anything of pregnancy ,  the only thing I noticed was I was overly emotional constantly crying to the point my eyes have psoriasis, so I said I should take a test and call the doctors sure enough we have a blessing on the way ü§∞üèª even though I have to learn all over again what to buy what the baby needs because it‚Äôs been so long üòä like I said my kids are all grown up graduated . so my fear was when I received the Covid shot did I harm my baby , I won‚Äôt know till next week till I receive my first ultrasound , it‚Äôs been a fear of mine i was thinking did I cause harm birth defects and all of this has helped me . so just wanted to say thank you so much for all your videos and knowledge you have made me feel so much better and also helped me not be on the show I didn‚Äôt know I was pregnant!!! LOL again thank you"
1020,2Ruq3o7iZho,"Much of my decision to be vaccinated back in May was because of information you shared here and on Instagram regarding COVID in pregnancy. Thank you for the update. Our little one is now a month old and she is thriving; our community had very few cases during my pregnancy but now that cases are spiking again, my hope is that my vaccination will be enough to protect her if necessary."
1021,2Ruq3o7iZho,"Thank you so much for not attacking the misinformed. Since I'm not high risk and I had almost no symptoms when I got covid in 2020 I decided to wait until the vaccine was 100% fda approved, although I was still pretty nervous about getting it. Your video has given me more peace about getting vaccinated this Friday and I'm excited to share your information with friends who are concerned about the fertility aspect of things. Thank you so much for not attacking me for having concerns, but for educating me and reassuring me instead!"
1022,2Ruq3o7iZho,I just want to say before I even start watching the video. Thank you for covering this topic. I was just fully vaccinated on the 1st of September and am currently 6 months pregnant. I've been nervous because of all the misinformation.

1051,d3yk1FKFeqI,"And to think, some patients are denied a transplant unless they take the shot. Make it make sense please!!!!"
1052,d3yk1FKFeqI,I took myself off the organ donor list last year.......I refuse to give anything that would go to a vaxxed
1053,KBvys-kcJi0,I would like to thank the D.A.R.E. Program for teaching me to resist peer pressure and not experiment with drugs.
1054,KBvys-kcJi0,I like how they ignore literally allllllll of the other evidence in young people. And only relate it to the latest booster. This is strictly damage control
1055,KBvys-kcJi0,"Some of us have been screaming this for 3 years now....and we were mocked, ridiculed, and silenced on social media. So nice of the MSM to catch up."
1056,KBvys-kcJi0,I don‚Äôt know anyone who regrets NOT getting that poison cocktail.
1057,KBvys-kcJi0,Pretty sad that everyone waits till the tv box says it‚Äôs dangerous.
1058,KBvys-kcJi0,One thing about being a so called conspiracy theorist is that I will not have to worry about any of the side effects

1065,rC6Zs4AtDWY,These people belong behind bars
1066,rC6Zs4AtDWY,"100% safe from adverse side effects

1067,rC6Zs4AtDWY,It‚Äôs a lot bigger than small. Don‚Äôt get it but really it‚Äôs up to you. Most doctor‚Äôs are sold out to the government. I‚Äôm beginning to think mine is. She keeps asking me & say not today. Last time she put on the the paperwork that I refused it. I wasn‚Äôt very happy about that.
1068,rC6Zs4AtDWY,We need to hold these people accountable One day
1069,rC6Zs4AtDWY,"By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid."

1071,rC6Zs4AtDWY,I'm terrified for my friends and family that took the triple you know what.

1073,AeXgV7k4AIk,Throwing 100 million doses away? No ones taking the shots? This is great news! Every shot thrown away is a life saved
1074,AeXgV7k4AIk,India is one of the only nations to actually LEARN from watching the data on these vaccines. Very wise people.

1082,AeXgV7k4AIk,Ivermectim is cheap as roti and you don't have to worry about adverse reaction.
1083,maznTNNkpJQ,There need to be penalties for lying to the public while claiming to be unbiased like Hotez does. Put him in prison.
1084,maznTNNkpJQ,"Everyone in a position of authority that advocates for the taking of these inoculations and boosters should be investigated to determine if they own stock in big pharma.  Transparency, prove it's not a money grab."
1085,maznTNNkpJQ,"The people who never got a COVID ""vaccine"" have nothing to regret."
1086,maznTNNkpJQ,My god‚Ä¶ these things have barely been out and they already have a ‚ÄúBi-Valent‚Äù? That‚Äôs incredibly dangerous and experimental.

1089,maznTNNkpJQ,Oh no its that quack doctorüòÇ nobody ever wanted these lmao. No one I know will even admit to have gotten the clot shot anymoreüò¢
1090,maznTNNkpJQ,Can someone ask Jamie Foxx if he wants to take his booster.
1091,maznTNNkpJQ,I stopped at 2 Pfizer shots didn‚Äôt even get the booster. Because my asthma made a sudden unexpected comeback the same exact day of getting the second shot I‚Äôd say 7 hours in it happened at 10:28 at night I was wheezing suddenly and it made me very tired after. It‚Äôs been a few years since i got the shot and my although my asthma has FINALLY starting to slow down a bit I‚Äôm still wheezing daily so that part hasn‚Äôt stopped years later. All I can hope for is it eventually fades out completely soon and nothing else goes wrong with my health. That‚Äôs my story of why I haven‚Äôt got a booster
1092,maznTNNkpJQ,I never got the first jab and I have no regrets

1109,DEx1GuqAwPk,I'm too young to now struggling with my heart after Covishield shot. Never experienced such health issues ever before.
1110,DEx1GuqAwPk,"I am 37 years old, after taking first, second and booster dose of Covishield I am experiencing lots of health issues, energy level lowered down, often suffering by fever, cough, body ache, pain in waist & leg, palpitation etc. Other member of my family also suffering with multiple ailments. I never experienced such illnesses before taking this vaccine."
1111,DEx1GuqAwPk,"As much information as this video gives- it's equally scary.   A large section of society has got 2 doses followed by a booster dose with the hope that they'll be safe. But after listening and seeing what's happening with people it's horrifying. 
Why weren't such questions raised at the development stage? And why forced people to do booster doses or the govt won't allow travelling?"
1112,DEx1GuqAwPk,I am 24 year old only ......vaccine se pahle kafi energetic tha me .....but vaccine ke 2 shot lene ke bad really mujhe feel hota hai ki body se energy gayab ho chuki hai bilkul .........kafi jyada slow bhi ho gya hu ......mind memory pr bhi kafi effect dikh rha hai

1119,-3EBnIsDqao,"My husband went into the hospital a few weeks ago finding out he had diabetes and pancreatitis. When they asked if he had the COVID vaccine and he said, ‚Äúno‚Äù they were so disrespectful and rude! It was absolutely ridiculous. He also tested negative but I can‚Äôt believe how rude they were. People have the choice to not get the jab!!"
1120,-3EBnIsDqao,I‚Äôm 13. I‚Äôm not getting it. To any parent watching this video but still wants your kid vaccinated shouldn‚Äôt have their kids. I said what I said. I‚Äôm gonna go enjoy the benefits of my immune system.

I went to bed and woke up a couple hours later with chills, fever, and a raging headache that kept me up the entire night and made me call in for work the next day.

1187,zL8tCKEHJ6o,Crimes against humanity!
1188,zL8tCKEHJ6o,"The reason why there is such a huge movement toward organic foods and ""going green"" - is because many people, including experts, know that it is really important for us to keep all types of chemicals and toxins and pharmaceuticals out of our foods and out of our bodies and out of our environment.

1220,byW1GExQB84,"I'm 100% sure this scenario will be a thought/project/thesis exercise in many University classes for decades to come. It's such a complicated, and somewhat morally ambiguous facets of this whole thing, that its an interesting topic."
1221,byW1GExQB84,"Why is literally every part of this pandemic so depressing, like even the solution to the pandemic is still depressing"

You hurt my feelings, Wendover."

1224,RyT3veZRMcg,"No matter how many millions, you can't undo it."
1225,RyT3veZRMcg,Gonna need more than 15 mil. Better get all those billions back from ukraine.
1226,RyT3veZRMcg,NO ONE regrets not getting it.
1227,RyT3veZRMcg,We tried to tell them and they wouldn't listen
1228,RyT3veZRMcg,Much respect to you guys for doing ACTUAL journalism. Including myself I know thousands of people who have been injured. If I alone have come across that many that I guarantee there are millions and these aren't just effects that happen right away. Mine started 3 days after and now I have breast cancer as a result 2 years to the month later. It will likely be 50 years or so before the truth comes out but I'm telling you this is going to affect generations to come. One of the worst mass humanitarian crimes ever committed. And if still keeps going. Thank you for standing up for us
1229,RyT3veZRMcg,"They knew, many scientists and medical professionals spoke out at public meetings and wrote countless letters to politicians advising against the shots."
1230,RyT3veZRMcg,"We tried to tell you. You wouldn‚Äôt listen. You called us conspiracy theorists, kicked us out of the military, fired us from our jobs, tried to restrict our freedom of movement, and shun us from society. You hated us; we prayed for you."
1231,RyT3veZRMcg,I‚Äôve been dealing with severe allergies and fatigue ever since
1232,RyT3veZRMcg,The local news reporting on c19 v a x injuries?? Noooo way!!!
1233,k3VBmXMIEgI,I regret ever being suckered into that shot
1234,k3VBmXMIEgI,If it was so life-saving I‚Äôm pretty sure not so many people would be looking for ways to get it out their system as fast as possible before they die
1235,k3VBmXMIEgI,"I believe her, everytime the truth comes out, those demons push harder to make it false!"
1236,k3VBmXMIEgI,I have took plenty of borax bath and have never had a problem stop lying
1237,k3VBmXMIEgI,"If they are preaching so hard on its danger, it must do some good. I want to see their scientific data."
1238,k3VBmXMIEgI,"Sadly, my mother went behind me and got the vaccine and booster. Since then, she has had trouble speaking and understanding. What pisses me off more is the same damn doctor who made her get it, had the nerve to tell me it may be early onset of Dementia. But none of these effects started until she got this damn thing. Sadly she is in Delaware and I am in Texas. So even with me telling her NOT to get it, I believed they pressured her into getting it. üò°üò¢ She is 74 yrs old and I have been trying to get her moved back here to TX.  But she did not want to move back until she sold her house, and thank the Lord she finally has a buyer.  I am so looking to find a way to detox that damn vaccine out of her system!!! üò¢"
1239,k3VBmXMIEgI,My brother is having terrible symptoms from the poison clot shot.
1240,k3VBmXMIEgI,"You can detox from it just not that way. A magnet over the injection spot within 24 hrs of injection can neutralize the negatively charged particles in the shot. Then generous amouts of vitamin c particularly lipozomal, will remove more of those negatively charged particles. Coq10 will protect the mitochondria of the cell, and chelation therapy with vinegar or zeolites (i recommend both) will bind to the heavy metals so they can be excreted. Pls share this info. Thank you."
1241,k3VBmXMIEgI,I pray for healing for everyone threatened to take the jabs ‚ù§
1242,k3VBmXMIEgI,If they it‚Äôs false it‚Äôs true
1243,YhMlZczq4Ns,"The Pfizer shots and booster all nearly killed me. I lose 2 days of my life per shot, laying in bed with 101 fever and rapid shallow breathing, chills and odd stabbing pains in my abdomen and thighs. I get the massive swollen glands in my armpit and can‚Äôt raise my arm for days."
1244,YhMlZczq4Ns,You may very well have the only doctors handwriting that is understandable in the entire world. Thank you for all you do.
1245,YhMlZczq4Ns,For my healthy tripple vaxxed BF the first one was the last one: he passed away from a sudden heart attack a month after the  booster.
1246,YhMlZczq4Ns,"When I got the first 2 doses of the pzifer vaccine, I had minor aches and pains, headache, and chills which went away within a few hours of getting the vaccine. However when I got the pzifer booster and flu shot, I was miserable, all of those side effects were so strong. Aches and pains, and headache was horrible and lasted for a couple of days for me. Never want to go through that again. Was horrible."
1247,YhMlZczq4Ns,Amazing how you take a complicated subject and make it sooo easy to understand ... wish you were my chem. Bio .anatomy prof in college ...
1248,YhMlZczq4Ns,"I had Moderna shots. My booster was a half dose. I had very mild reactions to all three shots. However I felt the booster the most. I spent a day resting on the couch, drinking tea and napping. Mostly fatigue, some aches and chills. Felt 100% better the next day."
1249,YhMlZczq4Ns,Thanks for another great video Doctor. Amazed at the clarity and level of detail and presented in a way that folks with not too much scientific knowledge can understand.
1250,YhMlZczq4Ns,"Please explain the myocarditis risk for young men, specifically regarding boosters... if you can.  With many thanks."
1251,YhMlZczq4Ns,"Thank you, Meccram !!!  
   **** Could you Please make a video on the myocarditis & related risks with Moderna, and how 3 Nordic countries ( Sweden, Norway, and Finland)  have suspended Moderna  for people under 30 ( in Sweden for men AND women that age.)****
     How safe is Moderna for women in their 40's and 50's? ( Concerned re: myocarditis, blood clots, etc.)....but I'd LIKE to get a Moderna booster, if safe enough ( I got J& J initially.)  THANKS SO MUCH !!!"
1252,YhMlZczq4Ns,What about aspirating the needle no one does it here in the United States? Ty

1254,J9KROxs4uKc,"What about private flights?
Are they also mandated to the same testrictions that commercial flights are doing?"
1255,J9KROxs4uKc,"NO problem for me, i don't fly."
1256,J9KROxs4uKc,"Also take into account how much that COVID test will cost you in an international country! I knew someone traveling back from Spain that paid close to $150 for a test. Whether it was available for free or not, I don‚Äôt know, but she searched and couldn‚Äôt find it for free. Price varies per country."
1257,J9KROxs4uKc,"""Show me your papers"".....just like Hitler."
1258,J9KROxs4uKc,"The guy just said the exception for children still requires them to get a covid test 24 hours before flying...that's the same rule for  adults, so I don't understand why he said there was an exception for children?"
1259,J9KROxs4uKc,So do we need to take the vaccine to travel or just a negative covid test a day before traveling?
1260,J9KROxs4uKc,"700 likes, 60 dislikes, and not a single comment seems to approve of this video. Hmmm... ü§î"
1261,J9KROxs4uKc,They said two weeks ago that starting in the beginning of next year all airports and other countries will have to show your vaccine book in order to travel the world.

1273,z5lJeTjvFHU,Bro my arm is literally in a state of paralysis
1274,z5lJeTjvFHU,"At first it felt like a regular shot but later in the day, my arm felt like it was going to fall off üòÇ

It hurt so badly lol"
1275,z5lJeTjvFHU,"I got my second shot today, it feels like someone punched me in the arm 50 times with a big ass hand! I can barely move my right arm, it really does hurt."
1276,z5lJeTjvFHU,I think ‚Äúa little sore‚Äù is an understatement
1277,z5lJeTjvFHU,yo I thought I was the only one feeling this way lmao I literally can't lift my arm
1278,z5lJeTjvFHU,"For me, I got my vaccine today, early morning. My arm did NOT hurt after. But 5-6 hours later on in the afternoon, my arm is then sore and I can't lift it up!! :'( :'("
1279,z5lJeTjvFHU,My shoulder feels like a restraining order was made against moving.
1280,z5lJeTjvFHU,Yeah... got my first dose of Moderna today. The injection site was sore right after which is to be expected from getting a shot but now hours later my whole arm hurts lol. If this is the worst of my symptoms I‚Äôll count myself lucky. I‚Äôm more worried about the second shot though.
1281,z5lJeTjvFHU,"I got mine today in the morning, I was fine for about 7-8 hours. I thought my arm wouldn‚Äôt hurt but nope. 7-8 hours, it started really hurting. My arm looked a bit swollen too. I had to take Tylenol. Now it‚Äôs a bit better but I can still feel it. I hope this goes away by tmw."
1282,z5lJeTjvFHU,I got the Pfizer shot then right after my dumbass went to bench press my arm feels like it's dead üíÄ

1293,-gq51K9fi_s,Imagine a robber just stole everything from your house‚Ä¶ Now imagine it‚Äôs that same robber who‚Äôs investigating the robbery‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs how ridiculous this sounds.
1294,-gq51K9fi_s,I love how we are supposed to report side effects and yet often are told there is no correlation between a side effect and the vaccine.
1295,-gq51K9fi_s,My heart goes out to his wife and family.

1303,Smfjyy9cgV4,"Regulatory capture, I wonder if they‚Äôll need to threaten peoples jobs again to force compliance."
1304,Smfjyy9cgV4,"Dr Offit said in another podcast that he was covid vaccinated, boosted, and got the virus.  He also said he wasn‚Äôt going to get anymore covid vaccines as he is healthy in his 70s.  I hope he updates us on his decision if he changes his mind. After all, Dr Offit was willing to share this with us a few months ago."
1305,Smfjyy9cgV4,"There is a contradiction here. Does he recommend only for those at high risk or for kids over 6 months? And if he does for kids, why? What is the disease and death rate for younger kids that would warrant it?"
1306,Smfjyy9cgV4,Dr Offit said he would recommend that his 6 month old grandchild be vaccinated then later said that only those at most severe risk should get vaccinated. Isn‚Äôt that a contradiction? Is he saying a 6 month old is at severe risk? Or am I missing something?
1307,Smfjyy9cgV4,Hello and good day. Does this mean to be safe and effective it will require 2 does and 2 boosters like all good mRNA vaccines ?
1308,Smfjyy9cgV4,"Please explain the difference between ""antigenic sin"" and ""imprinting"". In past episodes you stated that antigenic sin was simply the way our immune system works. As a healthcare professional, I walked away from this video confused as to whether a 6 month old should be vaccinated or not? He said his own grandchild should be vaccinated. Not a clear message."

1316,iMx7kmld9sk,"Thank God. Some will be spared.
I took first/only Pf jab and had a heart problem since 4 days later. Then lost my job for not getting the 2nd one. Wish I hadn't given into the pressure at work and just quit instead.
