1,im3otpqYAiQ,Glad I made it through the gaslighting.
2,im3otpqYAiQ,Didn't they destroy doctors careers who said this 2yr ago .. ?
3,im3otpqYAiQ,‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt find anything else that was alarming‚Ä¶.‚Äù This is actually comical. Aren‚Äôt these enough??
4,im3otpqYAiQ,The dude makes it sound like Myocarditis and pericarditis are just minor health conditions. What a joke
5,im3otpqYAiQ,"If you have to be persuaded, reminded, pressured, lied to, incentivized, coerced, bullied, socially shamed, guilt-tripped, threatened, punished and criminalized ‚Ä¶ If all of this is considered necessary to gain your compliance ‚Äî you can be absolutely certain that what is being promoted is not in your best interest.‚Äù ‚Äì Ian Watson"
6,im3otpqYAiQ,Take the number of instances. Multiply by 75000
7,im3otpqYAiQ,Duh we said this on day one and the mainstream news called us conspiracy theorists lol such a joke
8,im3otpqYAiQ,The Truth must be revealed‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Or we‚Äôre doomed to repeat it üòî
9,im3otpqYAiQ,I am so glad I didn‚Äôt get jabbed
10,SkcAZfrYYXM,"Nothing to worry about, they've changed how they count excess deaths."
11,SkcAZfrYYXM,"Just a week since France has made it a criminal offence to even CRITICISE mRNA treatment. Punishable by 3 years prison and or a 45,000 Euro fine. I wonder why this applies exclusively to mRNA treatments? A sceptical person would say that it has something to do with conflict of interest or brown envelopes, but that can't be it. Baffling."

14,SkcAZfrYYXM,‚ÄúVery rare‚Äù from the people who said ‚Äúsafe and effective‚Äù and ‚Äútrust the science‚Äù.
15,SkcAZfrYYXM,Best thing about refusing to get the covid jab...... zero side effects
16,SkcAZfrYYXM,"Remember when breakthrough cases were ""RARE""?"
17,SkcAZfrYYXM,Spoiler: They aren't that rare
18,SkcAZfrYYXM,The only immunity provided by the mRNA injections was to the companies that sold them... that's immunity from liability for any and all deaths and injuries.

24,7MAlEYqWUTk,"never understood ""well it doesn't fix it 100% so why bother?"" because it makes it significantly better???"
25,7MAlEYqWUTk,I had the omicron variant after I didn‚Äôt get my booster and ended up in hospital. I had ‚Äúsuper covid‚Äù where it lingered after the 2 week period and it actually made my asthma escalate so now I have to have 2 inhalers

42,jPs4_MeuX7U,"Just disregard the word ""rare"" because all of my vaxxed patients are injured and suffering."
43,jPs4_MeuX7U,Politicians who pushed these injections should and must be held to account
44,jPs4_MeuX7U,I guess all they so called conspiracy theorist before were right after all
45,jPs4_MeuX7U,What can go wrong when Dr BILL GATES ( by the way who has no medical degree at all ) makes himself the top Epidemiologist in the world ?
46,jPs4_MeuX7U,"This study is seemingly minimising the the number of those affected. I've heard, and it has been stated in the UK parliament by Andrew Bridgen MP, that studies showed that adverse events were 1 in 800!"
47,jPs4_MeuX7U,"Can you imagine how many would not have taken the jab if they knew this, the government cannot be allowed to do this again."
48,jPs4_MeuX7U,"My husband nearly died of a massive heart attack after his second shot,  both our moms and my aunt had strokes, our best friend died from a heart attack,  my brother in law developed AFIB, I developed severe neuropathy and people in our neighborhood have also suffered adverse affects like these...everywhere we go, or random people we meet, or aquaintences all say the same things.  This is no joke!  Shame on them for crimes to humanity!!!"
49,jPs4_MeuX7U,And adverse events are not rare. I know 3 people with vax injuries.

52,mkZ1MabMEZw,"Sure wish doctors were this passionate about getting people off junk food, alcohol, and cigarettes."
53,mkZ1MabMEZw,Favorite VAERS factoid is how one entry says a vaccine turned the recipient into the incredible hulk.
54,mkZ1MabMEZw,Would love to hear your take in a Nuremberg trial setting.
55,mkZ1MabMEZw,My friend died the day after she had the HPV vaccine and there was nothing wrong before
56,mkZ1MabMEZw,"My dad had a bad reaction and then collapsed 48 hours after receiving the booster. 
Cluster of skull fractures, bleeding in the brain, seizure upon arrival at the hospital, flown by helicopter to different hospital where he remained for 1 1/2 months. 
He‚Äôs now using a walker, trying to get back on his feet. His memory and general mental condition is coming back well, but he‚Äôs still messed up.. He‚Äôs 67 years old, had no serious health issues his entire life, was on no medications, a runner that was doing 6+ mile runs 2-3 times a week. Ran the NY marathon when he was younger."
57,mkZ1MabMEZw,You should also say that most doctors didn‚Äôt even KNOW about this site and are being bullied/fired for bringing up red flags about this.
58,mkZ1MabMEZw,"Since most VAERS entries are entered by doctors or pharmacists, we can conclude the entries are accurate.  Since it takes nearly an hour to complete a VAERS report, we can also conclude the VAERS data is a small proportion of the actual events since most doctors will not spend the time to report."

60,geXKovieb1E,It‚Äôs crazy how the majority of the population don‚Äôt have an inner monologue and don‚Äôt question anything.
61,geXKovieb1E,I never took the Jab. Nor did my 85 year old mother. We are both healthier than most people that took the Jab. I guess you can say we are PURE BLOODS.
62,geXKovieb1E,"i did not take vaccine,.. i'm still alive,....!!"
63,geXKovieb1E,A lot of people do not understand that this jab was a bioweapon this was not about protecting people's health but the exact opposite.
64,geXKovieb1E,It was a rushed vaccine and not tested enough.
65,geXKovieb1E,When will media outlets like this grow a conscience ?
66,geXKovieb1E,Yeah benefits...seeing that every day as more and more people are reporting side effects or dying...at least this topic is now open for discussion...
67,geXKovieb1E,The risks are NOT small. Bloody lies.
68,geXKovieb1E,A good friend of mine aged 39 died last March. He hadn't had Covid but he had three jabs to stay employed despite my warnings. He thought I had jumped on some QNON bandwagon and asked me if i was an antivaxxer. I said NO I'd had all my vaccines but wasn't going to take this one as it was untested. March 4th last year he sat down in a chair to read and died. His wife went to talk to him but he had just gone without even a sign or noise! It was heartbreaking but an autopsy showed massive blood clots to his heart and brain. His funeral was horrible and people who had once shunned me are now wondering if they have made a huge mistake. I don't feel superior or even say see I knew it because it was terrible the way they put people through mandates and put pressure on them to 'save grandma!'
69,geXKovieb1E,This doesn't even talk about the turbo cancers and the psychosis.
70,sNUpmYtEWtI,"Rather than a home isolation analogy, what about the seatbelt analogy?  Seatbelts don't guarantee that you'll never get in a car accident, but they do drastically reduce your chance of getting injured.  Hence why we all wear one, and why it's also not an excuse to go driving like a maniac.  We still check our blindspots and use turn signals when wearing a seatbelt, like wearing a mask even while vaccinated."
71,sNUpmYtEWtI,"2 years on, I wonder if you are starting to feel like a piece of Schmidt"
72,sNUpmYtEWtI,"Give it up bud, ain‚Äôt getting it and never will."
73,sNUpmYtEWtI,Y'know I'm glad there are doctors taking the time to educate people about the vaccine
74,sNUpmYtEWtI,Oh no look what the Florida surgeon general is saying now and hes not the only one
75,sNUpmYtEWtI,When you realise non of this worked
76,sNUpmYtEWtI,"This turned out to be complete bs, good job!"
77,sNUpmYtEWtI,"The clot shot does slow the spread,  you can't transmit when you're dead!"
78,sNUpmYtEWtI,This didn't age well
79,sNUpmYtEWtI,I love how you make this information so accessible and easily understandable for lay people.  This is so much easier to understand than all the charts and stats. You‚Äôre doing great work. Science!
80,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"You're brave to discuss possible side effects from the 'Jab', John. I'm downloading this video just in case is dissappears. Thank you, Dr. John."
81,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"I'm in tears here after listening to Dr John Campbell.He is the first person to explain what has happened to me after having the COVID vaccine. I spent all my savings trying to find answers for severe burning and pins and needles and muscle weakness straight after my 2 nd vaccine. (No NHS drs available at that time) Diagnosed small fibre neuropathy. Not one doctor admitted what I was saying all along, that the vaccine had caused this!!"
82,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"i'll never forget how people treated me when i told them to avoid the vaccine.. i was already disollusioned with the world before 2020, and what followed just confirmed my disdain. glad theres still some people out there taking it seriously and talking about it"
83,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"I'd suffered with CFS for 15yrs at the time of the onset of the pandemic. My gut feeling told me not to get the vaccination, but I was given a really hard time about it. Thank goodness I listened to my gut! So thankful for this information üôè"
84,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"I‚Äôm a retired veterinarian. 

I could see from the start that mRNA had the potential to cause constant antigen production.

85,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"Prof. Robert Clancy is an international treasure. Humility, humor, compassion, curiosity and of course great knowledge and skill. In a time of confusion, ignorance and pettiness it is a relief to hear him talk, giving hope to many people suffering with debilitating illness. Long may he live."
86,-Ea3UwYZnrA,Thank you Dr John and Prof Clancy for a very informative discussion.  I live in Australia and took the only jab available to me which was Astra-zen due to the severe mandates in the state I live in.  A few weeks after my 1st jab in late 2021 I lost my ability to walk unaided and have remained with worsening paralysis of my right leg with no definit diagnosis.  I have never had a covid infection and the fact that Astra-zen is now banned in most countries including Australia speaks for itself.  Forcing untested vaccines on people that have the potential to do so much harm is a crime against humanity
87,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"The end... "" You don't vaccinate people with chronic fatigue syndrome, you are just putting petrol on the fire""   THANK-YOU !!  This was me in April 21. I'd been ill since Mar 20 and In April 21 had Chronic Fatigue. My vax invite came in April 21, I had 11 invites actually. Didn't do it. I'd been ill for over a year, no answers from Drs or Consultants and well my gut instinct was telling me if spike protein does this to me already, didn't seem like the best idea to ask my body to make more. I don't even want to think what may have happened. And I had to put up with people telling me ""Just get the jab""  ""Don;t be silly""  etc. The look of disgust from some people when I said I wasn't vaccinated and one was a male nurse at my local hospital , gave me a proper lecture. I wasn't;t well and didn't;t want to get into an argument as his made was well and truly made up.  Thanks you John and Robert."
88,-Ea3UwYZnrA,Dr Campbell is a man of honor. He did not sell out to big pharma like so many other doctors and politicians. I wish you the best of everything. Thank you.
89,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"Thankfully someone is speaking about long vaccine injury. I have been suffering immensely since the first one and each one after. I took the first 2 and the first booster which nearly finished me off! My GP wouldn't have a word said about the vaccine and still won't even though I'm still suffering. Medical gaslighting is real folks, please try and stand your ground xx"

100,zQdzb57fi1o,Not being able to sue should have been a big red flag.
101,zQdzb57fi1o,My teen son's pediatrician shamed me for rejecting the shot. I had to say NO 3 times! Why push me so hard? He's a healthy kid. Im glad i stood my ground.
102,zQdzb57fi1o,"Remember, people lost their jobs for refusing to take this. 
The trucker convoy in Canada was about vaccine mandates, and the prime minister evoked an emergencies act meant for WAR measures, and froze people's bank accounts."
103,zQdzb57fi1o,The only one who got immunity from the shot was the manufacturer.
104,zQdzb57fi1o,I didn‚Äôt care when my circle of friends berated me for refusing to get that stupid thing.  They tried to give me the guilt trip of ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be part of the problem if someone you‚Äôre around gets sick.‚Äù.  My thought was that they aren‚Äôt going to bully me into changing my mind.
105,zQdzb57fi1o,"Dog food was pulled off the market after 35 dogs died, let that sink in."
106,zQdzb57fi1o,Not getting the vaccine was the best decision I ever made for my family.
107,zQdzb57fi1o,"I was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic cancer early during the pandemic. I was on 3 ltrs of 24-hr oxygen, I had 3 sets of radiation, and 18 rounds of aggressive levels of chemo. I completed all treatments December of 22, and today, I‚Äôm still not vaccinated. Despite me being acutely immunocompromised, I was never diagnosed with covid. I focused on strengthening my immune system with supplements, proper diet, exercise, when I wasn‚Äôt weak, and the power of prayer to God Almighty. Today, I‚Äôm alive only because of God‚Äôs grace.

This is so tragic, and my prayers are with this family.üïä"
108,zQdzb57fi1o,Her daughter hid the information from her parents. She had an inkling the jab was something her parents didn‚Äôt want her to have.

109,zQdzb57fi1o,Sounds like this girl turned 18 and she wanted to spread her wings of freedom of young adulthood by making her own life decisions for herself. Prayers for the family and others dealing with this also.

112,RRJqsK0tqc0,P.M still allowing this criminal act ... disgraceful.üò°
113,RRJqsK0tqc0,The pathetic responses to Mr Rennick makes my blood boil.  Infuriating.
114,RRJqsK0tqc0,"I lost my job in NSW Sept 2021working as an admin in a hospital, and unless I have at 2 vaccines I cannot resume
work along with nurses and paramedics so therefore mandates are still in place. Everyday we are living under great stress, we will never forgive and forget what our Government and TGA have done to mandate these vaccines!!"

120,LfmhYVCCGhc,Do you know why Rogan said this? Because a lot of vaccinated people died suddenly after they had a covid vaccine.
121,LfmhYVCCGhc,"To all those who heartily support the covid vaccine and love the science, keep taking the boosters and prove these guys wrong!"
122,LfmhYVCCGhc,Dr Campbell here in the UK started off being in favour of blanket vaccination.  He changed.  Study from Australia - myocarditis and pericarditis went up by 65% after vaccination.      This was before covid actually entered Australia.    I'm super happy if you think the vaccine is great and suggest you keep on taking them.
123,LfmhYVCCGhc,Most ppl who comment here are vaccinated and for them it‚Äôs hard to admit they made mistakes.
124,LfmhYVCCGhc,"Some young people did actually die from the Astra Zeneca vaccine. It caused blood clotting that led to heart and brain issues. In Australia, young people had to sign a waiver before choosing to take that particular brand."
125,LfmhYVCCGhc,No recourse with vaxx companies should tell us something
126,LfmhYVCCGhc,"""I'm just some idiot who tells jokes for a living. Nobody should listen to me."" -Joe Rogan"
127,LfmhYVCCGhc,"Huge rise in excess deaths, and the authorities are totally baffled at what's causing it, while certain it's not the clot shot."
128,LfmhYVCCGhc,But we have increased death rates and loads of people have some new kind of blood clots that can be as long as a calamari. There‚Äôs something going on and obviously no one wants to take the blame so things are being silenced as long as they can.
129,LfmhYVCCGhc,How much are you getting paid to toe the state line?
130,the81FQoAUI,"Are you planning on getting the vaccine when it's available to you? Hopefully this video helps with your decision :)

134,the81FQoAUI,How about a video about how they didn‚Äôt work out too well for the some that are no longer with us?
135,the81FQoAUI,Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
136,the81FQoAUI,Still waiting on part 2 How the Vaccine Side Effects Work
137,the81FQoAUI,"Perhaps you guys can take the vaccine yourselves, and do a daily vlog showing your results. Cheers."
138,the81FQoAUI,You forgot to mention the heart attacks people are getting... Good job at not being biased!!
139,the81FQoAUI,This aged well.
140,vilMNHn4Yh8,A tragedy‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..I still wonder every day why people willingly did this while the rest of us had our guts screaming NO!
141,vilMNHn4Yh8,Fear is temporary. Regret is forever.
142,vilMNHn4Yh8,This must be taken to court as the biggest crime against humanity
143,vilMNHn4Yh8,"It's too late now, the damage is done. You all followed like mindless sheep. I was suspicious from day one and became much more alarmed the moment legal immunity to the manufacturers was mentioned. We'll perhaps never know the true extent of damage, people dying too soon but their families not joining the dots. It's very sad. People still have not learned and will thrust their arm out for the next one."
144,vilMNHn4Yh8,It‚Äôs far worse than they are saying.
145,vilMNHn4Yh8,"my family and church friends called me selfish with no love for others. They rejected me, but my mega disabled son and I are vaxxed free. God gave me the strength even though we spent almost a month in hospital."

151,3GVGd3Ckrxk,The best thing about being a conspiracy theorist is NOT having myocarditis
152,3GVGd3Ckrxk,When will the mainstream media grow a conscience over what they‚Äôve done
153,3GVGd3Ckrxk,"Wasn't this one of the ""news"" outlets encouraging us to get the jab?"
154,3GVGd3Ckrxk,"Whether someone takes the covid vaccine should be a personal decision between the person and a doctor, but even NOW it is mandated in some jobs in Canada"
155,3GVGd3Ckrxk,Let's talk about the unusual rise in excess deaths reported in all countries that had widespread vax deployment.....
156,3GVGd3Ckrxk,The point is vaccines has risks which the policy makers denied. And there should be informed consent. These things should not be forced. People died because known treatment were refused people.
157,3GVGd3Ckrxk,"I happen to be one of the few that got brain fog from the Moderna vaccine.   I got my second shot and 5 minutes later I was incapable of driving.   I also could not read and had nasty headaches on the right side of my brain, making my right eye twitch.  I became lethargic and did not want to do much of anything.   This lasted for 15 months then it started to let up.  I could read again and drive, but I still had the headaches and eye twitch and some fog.  Recently it has gotten better, but I still get a small amount of fog and light headaches with the eye twitching gone.   It's been 3 years.   As a side note I still got a nasty case of Covid months after the shot.  I coughed for 6 weeks and would spit out blood when I woke up in the morning.  I wish I never got the shots.  It was as if was sentenced to prison for well over a year."
158,3GVGd3Ckrxk,Never go to a doctor for health advice.
159,3GVGd3Ckrxk,"Yes everything has risk but some risks are worse than others. You catch COVID, you have a cold for a few days. You take the jab, you could die suddenly at a young age from a heart attack with no previous history of heart issues. It baffles me that officials and MSM are still telling people to get boosters."
160,3GVGd3Ckrxk,Lies!!! Lies!!! They knew what they were doing. I'm so glad I didn't take it.
161,85ZicYaZsbQ,Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
162,85ZicYaZsbQ,"By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid."
163,85ZicYaZsbQ,Nazarin says that they edited this to make her look bad and even swapped her reactions. This would not surprise me at all.
164,85ZicYaZsbQ,THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
165,85ZicYaZsbQ,"The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it."
166,85ZicYaZsbQ,"The only question I'd ask the reporter and anyone else:
*""How can you be suuuure, the vaccine is safe?""*"
167,85ZicYaZsbQ,"This is gaslighting. Trying to tell her that her friend‚Äôs injury was random and there was no causal relationship to the kool-aide, gaslighting."
168,85ZicYaZsbQ,"I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer."
169,85ZicYaZsbQ,Nazarin is a smart girl who has learned to think for herself üëè
170,85ZicYaZsbQ,I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
171,rNaIMC4XMhc,"""The principle of decision making on my body are more important than any title."" immortal words"
172,rNaIMC4XMhc,"Asked him if he was willing to potentially stump his career for his principles, came back in 2023 and won 3 out of 4 slams. What an athlete and what an ambassador.."
173,rNaIMC4XMhc,"Still watching this interview after Novak has a record 23 slams. So satisfying that he stood by his values and principles, and STILL managed to break the Grand Slam record. Elite person and an Elite athlete."
174,rNaIMC4XMhc,"The man is a hero.
BBC will never understand what it means to be a hero."
175,rNaIMC4XMhc,"It brings tears to my eyes when the interviewer asks him if he is willing to let go of the opportunity to be the best tennis player ever and he just smiles and says ""yes"" üò• He should not have to make such a choice üò™ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bless his heart for standing up for freedom. This moment should go down in history."
176,rNaIMC4XMhc,This is what a person of principle looks like.
177,rNaIMC4XMhc,A lot of respect for this guy! There are still people who have principles and values. Gives me hope for humanity! Go Novak!
178,rNaIMC4XMhc,And he won the Australian Open 2023. What a great player.
179,rNaIMC4XMhc,"Such a strong man.
Such integrity.
Such fun.
So much strength.
So much love.
So much faith.
Love this man ‚ù§"
180,rNaIMC4XMhc,Mad respect for this man. A real man. Exemplary.
181,YAl7jHHuG9E,"A $50,000 grant from the Canadian Federal government funded this study. It's stated goal was to encourage people to get vaccinated.
As a Canadian my government embarrasses me on a daily basis."
182,YAl7jHHuG9E,"""For the first time in history the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who refuse to take it."" ~ Dr. Robert Malone"
183,YAl7jHHuG9E,"There should be legislation to force these institutions to disclose their sponsors and funding right down to the major investors of holding companies that would benefit from such pieces in any way. 
Thanks Dr Campbell."
184,YAl7jHHuG9E,"And the virus is so smart, it knows not to attack you when you‚Äôre eating!  This is why we had to wear masks when entering or exiting a restaurant during the pandemic, but could safely take it off to eat! üôÑ  The numbers of people who actually went along with this nonsense is embarrassing. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
185,YAl7jHHuG9E,How you managed to keep a straight face throughout the majority of this is remarkable. Thank you again DJC! üôè
186,YAl7jHHuG9E,"I was recently run off the road by a truck and ended up hitting a sign and damaging my vehicle. The truck driver did not stop, not even sure if he knew he ran me off the road. Wonder if he was vaccinated. The officer who investigated the accident did not ask me about my vaccination status! He asked if I had been injured. This paper is the most bizarre thing I‚Äôve heard in a very long time!!!üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
187,YAl7jHHuG9E,"I‚Äôm from Toronto and we‚Äôve been dealing with this kind of nonsense for three years now, they have made life quite difficult for the unvaccinated, the more the government lies the more ridiculous and tyrannical they look, and the world is watching, we will fight until we win."
188,YAl7jHHuG9E,Two of my ‚Äútreated‚Äù colleagues avoided the perils of driving for a while at least. Their shingles and kidney failure kept them safely and effectively off the roads.
189,YAl7jHHuG9E,ü§£ü§£ this is amazing it just goes to show that any BS can be backed up with some paper to get people to believe the lies and the agenda they want to push to justify the madness to get the population to believe ! Thank you Dr. John.
190,YAl7jHHuG9E,"With studies like these, I can't believe distrust in medicine is at an all-time high!"
191,NGxPkc_9uhY,Hats off to Florida Surgeon General Director Joseph Lapado! He is a courageous man and is taking a stand against the global vaccine mafia!ü•∞
192,NGxPkc_9uhY,"Florida's Surgeon General is correct. The shots have given rise to increased 'turbo-cancers' of all kinds. Many Oncologists are experiencing the increased numbers, especially among young people. This is serious and his concerns for safety should be considered."
193,NGxPkc_9uhY,"My neice died of an aggressive  cancer, she was vaccinated,  my brother in law had continuous strokes and died and my mums partners son had chest pains after getting the vaccine and died 2 weeks later, my friend got blood clots 2 days after and her daughter got cancer which is now cured rank goodness. I have never ever in my life seen so many funerals like I did after this vaccine came out. This doesn't just happen."
194,NGxPkc_9uhY,Avoid the clot shot
195,NGxPkc_9uhY,Thank you for speaking out Dr. Lapado.  We need strong voices.
196,NGxPkc_9uhY,Dont take the poison
197,NGxPkc_9uhY,"Good going, Florida Surgeon General ! It‚Äôs so great to see an HONEST Doctor with a working conscience and integrity speak-out life-vital truth and warnings against these deceptively and evilly pushed/ coerced by threat bio-weapons."
198,NGxPkc_9uhY,They won‚Äôt admit that they are wrong
199,NGxPkc_9uhY,I know nurses who were very angry over the covid deaths and the shots. They knew their patients were not dying from covid but the doctors were putting it down as cause of death.
200,NGxPkc_9uhY,Crap gave my Dad cancer...

219,8oHP5tmCUZU,I served 1990 to 94. The Army treated us like shit. I met some great dudes when I served but the leaders cared less about us.
220,8oHP5tmCUZU,Same. 8 1/2 years in the infantry and 11 1/2 as a Black Hawk pilot. When I realized no one in the DoD cared about the law or their oath then it was time to go. Landed on my feet. God is good.

261,I9S2jooTxkQ,"I‚Äôm a person with MS, when the vaccine came out, I called the manufacturer and asked them about it if there is a adverse reaction with my MS, they said call your doctor and we don‚Äôt know. I called my doctor and he didn‚Äôt know either, so I decided not to get the vaccine."
262,I9S2jooTxkQ,"In April 2021, I had shots 1 and 2 of Pfizer. I am a 25-year MS patient.  I was walking FINE prior to this. Within 1 HOUR of shor 2, I was not walking. 
I then did not walk for 15 months, had Covid 3 times, and shingles twice. Fought through and fired 4 neurologists who all said I had gone progressive with my MS until FINALLY getting a full head-to-tail MRI, which showed my scans were the same stable scans that I have had for the last decade. 
It is not my MS. It was neuroinflammation from the vaccine. There are a whopping TWO doctors that I will trust...  MANY want to silence us the vaccine-injured."
263,I9S2jooTxkQ,"Im a nurse practitioner and was essentially forced to take the jab due to the company I worked for requiring it. I reluctantly gave in and got vaccinated in May 2021. I was diagnosed with MS in June 2022. It was the worst decision I ever made. I have no doubt it gave me MS, but my neurologist and healthcare colleagues think Im wrong. Thanks for covering this. Im suffering for not standing up to my beliefs"
264,I9S2jooTxkQ,"My next door neighbor has now been told she‚Äôs got MS , the last few yrs have destroyed her former self . My mum and her husband both died within a year . I told them to wait but nobody listened , my daughters listened , thankfully üôè"
265,I9S2jooTxkQ,"This is so frustrating.
I am an ICU nurse with MS. When the vaccine came out, everyone was like are you getting it? Aren't you in immunosuppressive drugs?
I said actually until I can see that is proven to not cause relapse I will not.

I fought with my employer against vaccination for 2 years and finally won having a permanent exemption. Because there are case study of severe relapse.  So glad I am a heath care worker and know how to stand up for myself and to think for myself."
266,I9S2jooTxkQ,I was a fit and healthy 28 year old with no prior health symptoms (with the exception of very occasional asthma). I woke up with sudden leg numbness and lack of balance not long after my second vaccine. Multiple sclerosis diagnosis has since followed. I struggle to believe these aren‚Äôt connected. Never again will I be bullied into taking any medical intervention from the government again.
267,I9S2jooTxkQ,The WHO are drip dropping the information.  In that case most people won't suspect the magnitude of damage the vacc caused.
268,I9S2jooTxkQ,"Those of us that never got one üíâüíâüíâare to be congratulated on resisting the biggest media drive/campaign ever perpetuated on humans, and resisted all manner of pressure put forth by all manner of people. IF these people EVER get serious about conducting an authentic study they will have a control group, which they would not have had if we‚Äôd all buckled under the pressure and taken the üíâüíâüíâüíâ. Congrats everyone! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
269,I9S2jooTxkQ,"In April 2021 I was a healthy 60-year-old woman and wanted to have a little bit of life back. I decided to get the Pfizer vaccine and I told my husband to let me go first and see how I do since he has some medical issues. I thought I did fine and got the second one but within a couple of weeks something was very wrong, but I didn't think about the vaccine I thought maybe my age.  My balance was off, I had a tightness around my waist, I didn't want to drive at night, and my personality had changed.  My daughter started googling and said it sounds like MS.  My daughter asked a friend that was a doctor and he said he didn't think so. My age was the main reason. 
I will skip ahead to January 2023 and finally had an MRI and had many lesions. In my report, it said, ‚Äúsomewhat old for this active MS.‚Äù  My next step was a spinal tap and I had the bands in my fluid.  I was finally diagnosed with MS.  In April I started Ocrevus.  My life has changed so much in the last 2 years.  I am 99.999 percent sure it was the vaccine that caused my MS."
270,I9S2jooTxkQ,"My immediate family and I refused (repeatedly) THE shots and we never had c***d!

361,i9JLZuhqRuU,"Addendum:
Two questions asked frequently.

Was the deceased in the first paper tested for SARS-CoV2 infection?

Answer: The paper states, ""but no positive laboratory or clinical diagnosis of the infection.""  The paper never states that the patient received a test and the result was negative.   Some have stated that as the patient was admitted to Charit√© Hospital in Berlin and their protocol for admission requires testing prior to admission.  However, it is unclear of the current website policy was in place when the patient was admitted.  Regardless, the policy states the following:  (https://www.charite.de/en/clinical_center/themes_hospital/main_topic_coronavirus/)

""At present, the following patient groups must show proof of a negative rapid antigen test (within the past 24 hours) or PCR test (within the past 48 hours) upon arriving at any Charit√© outpatient facility:

Vulnerable patients, such as those receiving hemato-oncological care or otherwise immunocompromised patients
Patients receiving daily inpatient care: Testing for SARS-CoV-2 is required at least twice weekly for those visiting Charit√© daily. It is important to test after the weekend or any other interruption in daily inpatient treatment (for example, the patient must show proof of a negative test every Monday and on one other day of the week).
Patients who are in the outpatient clinic for a longer period, for example for preoperative evaluation/preliminary examination
Patients participating in outpatient clinical studies""

Please note that a simple rapid antigen test (which is not designed to determine past infection but rather infectiousness) could have been the test that allowed the patient to be admitted to the hospital if it was negative.  But a negative antigen test would never be taken as proof that the patient had NEVER been infected with the SARS-CoV2.  

It is unfortunate that one has to this type of digging to find the ""answer"" which actually leaves more questions.  It is possible that the author did not realize how important this issue would be when originally writing the paper.  However, given the fact that a lack of nucleocapsid protein is not, in fact, the 
sine qua non of vaccine damage but also infection it now focuses on this question: how tight was the testing for SARS-CoV2 at the end of the deceased life?  The false negative rate is very different between self-administered tests and other more standardized tests.  In addition the patient could have spike proteins long after the RNA was detectable by PCR or protein by antigen testing making the results of the test moot.  Given this uncertainty, retrospectively, it is understandable that the author would have simply stated that the patient had ""no positive laboratory or clinical diagnosis of the infection.""   We wish this were clarified and if I was the peer reviewer I would have asked that this be fleshed out in the paper itself. 

Second Question:
What was the vaccination status of the deceased in the second paper?  

Answer: Unknown but it would be unlikely that all would have been given that a high proportion of COVID-dead were unvaccinated.    However, we do not have to remain with this answer.  A case series was published in November of 2020 (before C19 Vaccines) which showed the same result:  Nucleocapsid proteins were not seen to the same degree that spike was seen.  For instance the paper states regarding the brain: ""In the 16 (40%) cases positive for SARS-CoV-2 proteins on immunohistochemistry, spike protein was detected much more frequently (14 [88%] cases) than nucleocapsid protein (seven [44%] cases)."" https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(20)30308-2/fulltext#seccestitle170

Also note that a separate Lancet article from 2020 (before vaccine) also showed similar results (see page 7) virus present in heart in only 3/11 subjects) https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2666524720301440-mmc1.pdf

434,-O8ItNje4yc,Mark of the beast
435,-O8ItNje4yc,Child abuse
436,-O8ItNje4yc,"So who willingly let's their child be experimented on to provide this ""data""?"
437,-O8ItNje4yc,Crimes against humanity!
438,-O8ItNje4yc,"Oh üòìüíâ No it doesn't..

All of the adults I know who took it now either have clots in their legs or are sick at least once every other month. Women's periods either got worse after taking it or stopped altogether for more than a few months. Babies being born still born. Being born with pure black eyes and able to sit up and move their heads around right away. 

We are not stupid we see what is happening."
439,-O8ItNje4yc,Makes me sick‚Ä¶.
440,-O8ItNje4yc,I would never hold my kid down to give him some bull that's hasn't been tested enough.  I could never forgive my self if my child would die  :/ NEGATIVE
441,H0Y7sUfLFEA,"Being jealous of the US, especially for something healthcare-related, is a weird new feeling."
442,H0Y7sUfLFEA,"As someone who lives in Brazil (with a comorbidity), the fact that you have to beg people to get vaccines in the US is mind blowing to me. I have no idea when I'll be able to leave the house to walk my dog once a day without having a panic attack."
443,H0Y7sUfLFEA,"As a 27-year-old musician, I got my appointment within an hour of them going up this week, because I. WANT. TO. PLAY. SHOWS. AGAIN!!!"
444,H0Y7sUfLFEA,"Hang on, you guys are getting donuts?"
445,H0Y7sUfLFEA,"To all the young adults with anxiety: it is okay if you need moral support for your vaccine appointment. My mom came with me for my first dose, and since she was already vaccinated, they even let her stay with me through the whole process. But even just having a trusted friend or family member in the car with you can be a huge help."
446,H0Y7sUfLFEA,"I had a ""mild"" case back in October, I no longer get winded going upstairs as of last month but my sense of taste/smell is still... Off. Foods just randomly taste rotten some days. Covid sucks, y'all."
447,H0Y7sUfLFEA,"Sent this video to an ""I'll do it later"" friend, now his first appointment is tomorrow at 10 :)"
448,H0Y7sUfLFEA,"As someone who had covid last year and just got vaccinated, trust me, the vaccine side effects are WAY less painful than actually having it."
449,H0Y7sUfLFEA,"I have crippling anxiety about anything medical and health related. My brain is being pulled in two ways: not wanting to get sick, and not wanting to have to get shot. I feel like that sounds like I‚Äôm just a baby but both these scenarios induce panic attacks. My brain feels stuck."
450,H0Y7sUfLFEA,"i wanna get the vaccine so bad but my parents won't let me, but i turn 18 in a month and i am fully ready to get vaccinated then"
451,eFx-d0SvOVg,"Stop using the word ""vaccines"" for those shots."
452,eFx-d0SvOVg,"Bri doesn't want to jump to conclusions and wants more studies, but she was willing to accept vaccine efficacy immediately without question."
453,eFx-d0SvOVg,It hurts my brain listening to Bri still trying to gaslight us.
454,eFx-d0SvOVg,The way they are trying (and failing) to explain how the vaccines are still beneficial is so embarrassing...
455,eFx-d0SvOVg,Robert Malone told everyone this from beginning and has been proven right every step of the way
456,eFx-d0SvOVg,I am greatly encouraged by these comments. So good to see so many people refused to take the jab!
457,eFx-d0SvOVg,Heaven forbid Bri would ever admit she‚Äôs wrong. Wow!
458,eFx-d0SvOVg,"Bri, don't assume everyone is as ignorant about this issue as you are"
459,eFx-d0SvOVg,"Bri went to top schools, got lots and lots of As, was told how smart she was throughout her childhood, and rewarded for her ability to make good grades. It is hard for people like this to admit they could ever be wrong about something."
460,eFx-d0SvOVg,"I got polio, but thanks to my vaccine, it was mild... said no one ever."
461,uOxppT3gPpE,It amazes me how people are still in denial simply because their egos can't tolerate how wrong they have been this whole time. And on top of that they feel like they're the intelligent ones.
462,uOxppT3gPpE,Even mentioning this used to get you banned or fired. Was madness
463,uOxppT3gPpE,"It‚Äôs amazing how some people are still so trusting and naive, even after they‚Äôve been lied to. And after they KNOW they‚Äôve been lied to"
464,uOxppT3gPpE,"I'm a simple man. When the Dr. who created the MRNA technology said it wasnt safe, that is all i needed to hear."
465,uOxppT3gPpE,This is like when the police investigate the police to find that there was no misconduct by the police.
466,uOxppT3gPpE,The way this  whole thing was handled has turned me complete anti vaxx. I hope everyone effected gets justice.
467,uOxppT3gPpE,I'm still 17 and took vaccine at 15 yrs age... After vaccine my health got downhill and developed high Bp and heart issues and I'm still youngüò¢üò¢
468,uOxppT3gPpE,My heart breaks for all the people who felt pressure to take the jab.
469,uOxppT3gPpE,It blows my mind how many people actually took the jab. It was so obvious what was going on...
470,uOxppT3gPpE,"One of my relatives developed pericarditis three days after taking 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine. He was absolutely healthy previously and he is in his early twenties. Kaiser doctors at the beginning were trying to deny any connection to vaccine. He was several times in and out of the hospital now and finally they admitted that it's related to vaccine. Also, my mother-in -law developed bone cancer after the ""shot"". My sister in law's mother just passed away after her cervical cancer returned after long remission after the ""shot"". My other's sister-in-law father developed severe heart issue also right after the shot, to the point that he is dying now. Of course, they are all older people, but what is striking is the timing of this.  I have not taken the shot, neither my child and nor my husband because 10 years ago when we took swine flu vaccine we all got severe side effects, and that is why we did not take any covid shots. My husband developed stroke then ( absolutely healthy 36 year old), I almost died from Guillain-Barre syndrome , my child developed severe neuropathy, and my husbands uncle had a heart attack. Again coincidence? I was very healthy before the flu shot, and now I am almost disabled. I did regain some of my health after the Guillain Barre  , but I am still have severe residual symptoms. I am a microbiologist and have also medical background and I would never take another vax even if threatened. It is a poison, you might not believe me and think it is just all some kind of conspiracy nonsense , but I hope you will heed the warning! Lot of smart people, scientists and doctors spoke against it, but the censorship is very live and strong on YT"

488,aGKPq9OUEP0,"Yep, because the risk of getting myocarditis (and many other side effects) on top of covid is much better."
489,aGKPq9OUEP0,This would make sense if it kept you from getting covid.
490,aGKPq9OUEP0,"My dad has this kind of mentality. The ""don't fix it unless it's broken"" kind of thinking works great, until something breaks horrifically and it takes a huge amount of effort to fix it, or may not even be possible to."
491,ZfPpHkXSTPk,But those who brought up side effects back when these came out and choosing to not get vaxed because one already had natural immunity resulted in job loss/shaming in far too many instances..

562,P3nXJB5PoBM,"Hey David, you seem like a really smart guy. May I give you a little unsolicited advice? Forget about politics for a moment. Forget about political parties for a day and go out into the world and try to find the truth about this. Do research online. Talk to doctors. Talk to families of healthy young people who just suddenly drop dead. Do some digging and follow the truth wherever it takes you. If you are able to take politics out of your research you will find some semblance of the truth. And the truth is scary."
563,P3nXJB5PoBM,"Anecdotally I personally know 7 people who were hospitalized with pericarditis,myocarditis or embolisms within 2 weeks of vaccination. 3 others ‚Äúonly ‚Äú had temporary Bells Palsy within a week of getting the first booster. No one died. I know of 3 deaths from COVID pneumonia and 3 or 4 serious illnesses. The overwhelming majority of the people I know who have had COVID were barely ill. Most were unvaccinated."
564,P3nXJB5PoBM,My Aunt died three days after having the v. She was an athlete who‚Äôs heart just stopped in her sleep. I know a guy who can no longer walk after complications from the v.
565,P3nXJB5PoBM,My university professor died right after his 3rd dose. He said he would take the week off for that and that was the last time we saw him. Also my ex-girlfriend is now battling with Von Willebrand disease and has severe heart issues. She had none of that before getting vaccinated.
566,P3nXJB5PoBM,Why does David ask for comments if he doesn‚Äôt read them?

572,BEp2HPWIsro,Being an american. I'll always stand by my mistrust of the U.S. government for obvious reasons.  I won't be cannon fodder for U.S. wars while fat cats in  congress decides the fate of those who are proud of its country. I won't get myocardities bc I won't be swayed by fear.

593,UijQ-6jhVuc,This happened to me! I got my first dose and a few weeks later I was hospitalized and my platelets were VERY low and my red blood cells were EXTREMELY high. The doctor said I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be alive. I had the Pfizer vaccine. I regret I ever got that shot.
594,UijQ-6jhVuc,My sister in law had several strokes after her first booster. She was the healthier member of our family and in her early 50‚Äôs. She said she had felt different after the shots. I‚Äôm grateful I never got vaccinated. Bummed that two of my kids did get vaccinated üôè

I didn‚Äôt feel giving me the ultimatum, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to get the shot or we are going to take your livelihood from you‚Äù was right! It went against my rights as a freeman and patriot.

604,3rIQHrbDguM,Nobody is regretting NOT getting that VAX  !!!
605,3rIQHrbDguM,"My company tried to make the vax mandatory when it first came out. In the building I was managing they asked me to check with all the employees to see who wanted to go for a free vaccine on company time and that the company strongly felt we must all be vaccinated to keep each other safe. It came back a unanimous ""no thanks"" including myself. The director of operations came into my building first trying to shame me saying i was setting a bad  example and was afraid of a little shot. I told him he was the one afraid desperate to make people get shots over a cold. He then said masks at all times will be mandatory as well as daily temperature checks for those who refuse the vax and those who didn't comply would have to find another job. I got tired of the back and forth and finally told him straight ""Listen, we're not doing any of that. If you keep pressing the issue i'll take the entire staff in this building with me to a competitor and take half your customers with me. Now piss off and go pretend like you have some useful function in the company we're done here"". The issue was never brought up again."

I will not be responsible for someone's death if I can help it."

I am so incredibly thankful for them and all the people helping to end this pandemic and when it‚Äôs my turn I‚Äôll get a vaccine"

640,IxCHv7T_mao,"As someone in the Pfizer trial who has at times felt disheartened, as if I joined this study for nothing because people were just going to reject the science and ignore the vaccine, this video made my day. We have this light at the end of the tunnel and we should be (safely) celebrating. We're going to get through this, and it's not going to take years... we're down to months now. DFTBA."

657,lEFYYpE_hds,"They really need to report numbers and percentages so we can have even a clue as to what an ""increased rate"" is. News channels are so bad at reporting useful information and ambiguous information only increased emotional reactions and conjecture."

721,oMXGGmBfkf8,"Here are the answers to some common questions. Please note that this video is about the scientific basis of mRNA vaccines in general, not about any particular vaccine or manufacturer. This video is not sponsored by anyone and does not represent endorsement of any particular vaccine. The answers below are based on well-known, basic knowledge of mRNA/cell biology and immunology, which can be found in ANY TEXTBOOK. More Q&A may be added later.
Also note: this video was originally intended for our regular audience (med students), so it's more technical. We have a simpler version here: https://youtu.be/XTLYXmgG8DU
For comparison of different vaccines, as well as events of immune response, role of different immune cells (T-cells, B-cells, APC), see this video: https://youtu.be/osRo-yz1VQ8
Q1: How long the mRNA from vaccine will stay in human body? A: mRNA is very unstable, it is easily degraded by enzymes in our cells (RNAses). Average half-life of mRNA in human is around 10 hours. mRNA from vaccine is expected to stay no longer than a day.
Q2: How long the antigen (translated from mRNA vaccine) is expected to stay in our body? A: Several days. Once the immune system is activated, it will see the cells that carry the antigen as damaged and destroy them.
Q3: So from A to Q2, our immune system destroys our own cells, is that bad? A: No. This is the natural way the body detects foreign antigens, just like when an infection occurs ‚Äì infected cells display pieces of the virus to alert the immune system and get killed. The difference is that you can control the dose with the vaccine, unlike a natural infection. And the vaccine does not multiply. The number of our own cells that will be killed with the vaccine dose is negligible. The effect is also limited to the cells around the injection site. Note that traditional vaccines also work this way: the antigen delivered by a traditional vaccine is also taken up by some of our cells, it is then broken into pieces and displayed on the surface of the cell to be ""seen"" by the immune system. This is the only way for the immune system to detect foreign antigens. The body will replace the lost cells within several days. For more details see this video: https://youtu.be/osRo-yz1VQ8
Q4: So now the immune system will produce the antibodies, will it ever stop? A: It's the same process that happens when there is a natural infection. So, upon infection or vaccination, antibodies will take a couple of weeks to be produced, the level will peak for about a couple more weeks and then it will go down, no more production. But now the body remembers the virus because some memory cells are left - when you encounter the real virus these cells will produce antibodies again, this time instantly in response ‚Äì so fast that no infection will occur. If the body does not encounter the virus then, no antibodies will be produced.
Q5: How about side effects? A: All vaccines have side effects, mRNA or traditional. The list of side effects should be available online or at any location that offers the vaccine.
Q6: How mRNA gets into cells? A: It is delivered in lipid covering that will fuse with cell membrane (also consists of lipids) - it's called endocytosis.
Q7: Is this gene therapy? A: No, gene therapy involves replacing your gene with a new one, this vaccine does not touch your genes.
Q8: Can mRNA vaccine change my DNA? See full A in this video: https://youtu.be/XTLYXmgG8DU
Q9: I had COVID and recovered, do I still need the vaccine? A: You probably do not need the vaccine if your infection was recent, at least for now. The question remains is how long natural immunity will last, and how long protection by vaccine will last, we do not yet know the answers. UPDATE: 1 dose of mRNA vaccine in people with previous infection works as well as 2 doses in people without previous infection. Basically: previous infection gives the same immunity as 1 dose of mRNA vaccine."
722,oMXGGmBfkf8,"It is very well done. Sound correct to me with the bio class I had. I had crazy hyper motivate teacher.

726,oMXGGmBfkf8,"Please correct me if I'm wrong. If it is our self cells that are going to express the antigen, then it is going to be expressed by the MHC class 1 right? And only cd8 t cells bind to them and not cd4 t or b cells. We might have some memory cd8 t cells for that but we wont be able to produce antibodies against the virus? Or are we also expecting the lipid nanoparticle containing mRna to be engulfed by macrophages or something?"
727,oMXGGmBfkf8,"Hi, i see you answering all these questions in the comment section, and id like to thank you for the hard work!"
728,oMXGGmBfkf8,"First of all thank you for the explanational video.
I read also the pinned and answered me a lot of questions.
I have one more and sorry if its somehow explained but as english is not my primary language I maybe missed than.
There are sayings that mrna (for covid) may create autoimmune ilnesses in long term (as its not 100% tested).. is something like that possible?
I am not afraid of immidiate effects I understand how it works (more or less) what I am worried is that it may cause an ilness in future.. is that possible?

I feel like I get fatigued much faster than before and I run out of breath much faster than I used to. I swear I am not lying."

He received his second vaccine dose 3-4 weeks ago, his wife said he woke up in the morning and complained of his heart racing and difficulty breathing. While they were waiting for the ambulance she checked his heart rate with their blood oxygen finger monitor, his heart rate was at 155BPM. Can someone explain why a guy with no health issues had a reaction like this after getting the covid vaccination? I'm not anti-vax but this scares the hell out of me. I've heard reports of death and heart inflammation after getting the Covid vaccine, I feel like the vaccine will weaken the heart and cause health problems down the line for healthy adults 18-44."
839,EETuOY3JjfM,the human body is amazing the way it fights for your health
840,EETuOY3JjfM,"I got the first shot of Sinopharm and I am always feeling tired and sleepy after the vaccine, Now I took at least 14 hours sleep in a day but before vaccination I was hardly sleep only for 8 hours."

850,I3kd5SyYHEE,"I'm a 30 year old woman, I got the Pfizer vaccine back in September. After the second dose,  I actually had heart pain and pressure.

Since losing my job I‚Äôve been struggling to support my children. I‚Äôm now waitressing and I‚Äôm grateful but I‚Äôm not making nearly enough. JESUS HELP me. I‚Äôm CRYING OUT TO YOU. I‚Äôm tired! Struggling to buy groceries. Struggling to pay rent. It hasn‚Äôt been easy. But I know God doesn‚Äôt give you more than you can handle. I know all things are possible through Jesus. I WILL KEEP FAITH. No matter how hard life gets. FAITH OVER FEAR!

937,gAxyBMnT8NI,"""Experts divided on the question""  Yeah!! Those paid off and those not in the loop."
938,gAxyBMnT8NI,Ever since this vax my asthma has been unpredictable it literally occurred the same day i got the second one and that was in 2021 it is almost the end of 2023 and im still needing inhaler treatments more frequently than i once did   and im wheezing everyday last night my voice was barley audible which seems to be happening during those bad days i can only last about 2 to 4 weeks sometimes less before i need another inhaler treatment. I yet to recover hopefully i will but part of me is getting a bit worried about my future since it's been going on for about 3 years

945,Ph6wsRHMbQo,Yes. It happened to my friends aunt. I‚Äôve never seen so much gaslighting in my life.
946,Ph6wsRHMbQo,"My coworker just lost his wife a but over a week after they got a third shot. They were perfectly healthy and only mid-thirties. She'd said she felt short of breath. Her heart stopped while she was asleep. 
Most of my friends and coworkers are un-vaxxed, got covid, and only a few had it rough. All recovered."
947,Ph6wsRHMbQo,"I never got vaccinated, I got Covid 3 times. I had chronic asthma and my Doctor told me if I didn‚Äôt get vaccinated I was going to die. I have never felt so great in my 40 years of chronic asthma till now, I have not used my inhaler for the last 11 months. I trust God and I knew that I didn‚Äôt need to get vaccinated or probably won‚Äôt be here to tell my blessings."

952,pp-nPZETLTo,It has been a year. Would you consider creating an update on this discussion?
953,pp-nPZETLTo,Thank the Lord for Dr Peter McCullough
954,pp-nPZETLTo,Please consider revisiting this conversation a year later!!
955,pp-nPZETLTo,I'd like to hear an update 1 year later on the scientific literature sited on this podcast
956,pp-nPZETLTo,"My 42 year old Son was admitted to hospital Feb/2021 for low oxygen, spent a week in ICU, tested negative for COVID, under went many tests. Two months later was put on life support, treated for pneumonia, negative covid, sent to cardiology for treatment and more testing. Aug/21 hospitalized, on ventilator for lack of oxygen, again treated for pneumonia, negative for covid. Upon release was denied oxygen for home for lack of affordability.  He had received two Pyzer  covid shots, one in Mar/21 and second May21. He passed away Dec21, told that autopsy didn't show covid"
957,pp-nPZETLTo,"I experienced several AEs listed on the Pfizer documents (which a judge forced them to share). Whatever happened to informed consent? Had I known of the risks, I would not have gotten the shots. I was healthy, on no prescription meds prior to the shots. My guess is those who are v-injured are under reported because MDs are not reporting to VAERs and/or encouraged not to do so."
958,pp-nPZETLTo,"My father was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in February of 2021, they immediately tried to push the jab on him, I explained it like I was talking to a child because dad has brain damage from a stroke, I talked him out of taking that shit all together and I guarantee if I hadn't dad wouldn't be alive still today, and they had also gave him 6 months to live"
959,pp-nPZETLTo,"Whatever happened to ""herd immunity"" ? That's never discussed anymore."
960,pp-nPZETLTo,Hello! I am one of the few unfortunate people who has had serious adverse effects from the Moderna Covid vaccine. Most of them are neurological in nature now. Prior to the vaccine I had no health issues. I have been trying to get medical care for 10 weeks and the medical community just looks at me blankly. Can you direct me to any resources that could help?
961,pp-nPZETLTo,What about all the sudden deaths of athletes and young healthy people.
962,uZPGZ2mf4g4,I ignore everything the CDC says lol
963,uZPGZ2mf4g4,My own 2cents:  Stick with the same Mfr. you had for the initial shot. Mix and Match is really a reckless approach in terms of monitoring the vaccines independently going forward. It was really a mistake for the CDC to message that.
964,uZPGZ2mf4g4,And they are the ones who need it the most
965,uZPGZ2mf4g4,I got Moderna and am not getting a booster shot yet. This is because I tested my antibody levels and still have strong antibody levels 6 months after getting the second Moderna shot.
966,RQwcX-B6luw,"A 120k for severe disability, life totally ruined. That is no justice."
967,RQwcX-B6luw,The fact these pharma companies were given complete indemnity by our government tells you all you need to know
968,RQwcX-B6luw,"The GP had assured us, in a patronising way, that the AZ jab was completely safe and that we were being silly worrying about it, and that Mum needed the jab because of her age (86). 

Two days after her AZ jab in Feb 2021, my mother developed 'flu' symptoms. 5 days later she was in hospital with a suspected pulmonary embolism (according to the consultant). She died the next morning. The only consolation was that I was ""permitted"" to sit with her for her last hour of life. 

I will never forgive the Govt (and GP) for ignoring science and allowing such emotional and physical damage to innocent citizens."
969,RQwcX-B6luw,I am so happy I resisted all social pressure and did not take a jab. Even at the high social costs.
970,RQwcX-B6luw,"When tens of thousands of NHS nurses refused to take the vaccines even under severe threats of being sacked other people should have taken notice, the whole thing stunk at the time"
971,RQwcX-B6luw,And those of us who did not listen to our governments were seen as stupid ü§¶üèª
972,RQwcX-B6luw,No one regrets not taking it.
973,RQwcX-B6luw,I wonder how many people who on here are going to tell us about their injuries are the same people who shamed and abused the people who refused it ?
974,RQwcX-B6luw,Covid will be talked about for decades to come. The greatest social and science experiment.
975,RQwcX-B6luw,Big Pharma need to foot the bill and be held accountable for what they have done.

979,Vgu1bkZC49s,"This was not a scandal, it was done on purpose. They knew what they were doing. You should be waking up."
980,Vgu1bkZC49s,Lets not forget Sunak bought shares in Moderna before the Government signed a multi million pound contract with the company.
981,Vgu1bkZC49s,How could a vaccine injured person be anti vaxxer?
982,Vgu1bkZC49s,Its not a scandal ITS the biggest crime against humanity
983,Vgu1bkZC49s,I've been to 7 funerals in 15mths. Every person who died was under 60. Many at these funerals were talking about the elephant in the room and were scared as they had taken the juice. I hadn't but didn't feel superior or more intelligent. I just felt sad and upset that the bastards had reduced us to this. Decent friends and family dying when they were told they were doing the right thing.
984,Vgu1bkZC49s,"Question, why is the tax payer paying for the vaccine injury ? Why the hell isn't the manufacturers paying for this ?"
985,Vgu1bkZC49s,"I am an anti vaxxer for 15 years now, and have never been ashamed about it. When people choose to label me, i just feel sorry for them."

989,Mdr2rLWGXiE,"very encouraging to hear.
I find cancer is a scarry word. I know too many people whose lives are in limbo far too young. My colleague's girlfriend (2 younge kids) is battling breast cancer at 34 for over a year now and she's not out of the woods yet. This isn't a fight she should be fighting; she should be enjoying her two young daughters, and instead, she's worried she won't see another year. This always happens to the best of us humans too.

anyway...I'm hoping this forges new paths that ensures kids and young adults don't leave us before they can enjoy a full life."
990,Mdr2rLWGXiE,This is what humanity should be working on instead of constantly fighting.
991,Mdr2rLWGXiE,This is so exciting. The human mind never cease to push further what is possible.
992,Mdr2rLWGXiE,"Man, scientific progress never stop to amaze me."
993,Mdr2rLWGXiE,Doesn‚Äôt cancer have way too many mutations within one tumor to even target properly??
994,Mdr2rLWGXiE,"A barrier for rolling these treatments out in cancer that is not mentioned is that, although there are short-term cancer treatments outcomes like response (partial or complete remission to mention two), the real tangible, non-negotianble outcome is 5-10 year survival rates, and these cannot be known before this time passes..."

1000,V9Z325DYJJc,The real question would be how the chart would look like if you compare the vaxxed to the unvaxxed in the same age group. That would really clear the debate. But there's a reason why they don't show you that. Isn't it so?
1001,V9Z325DYJJc,These people deserve capitol punishment for pushing this on humanity
1002,V9Z325DYJJc,Anytime I see ‚Äúfact checked‚Äù I know it‚Äôs a lie coming next.
1003,V9Z325DYJJc,"But if the vaccine worked, even the old shouldn't be dying. In fact, the whole point of the vaccination warning was mostly for the vulnerable old people. The old people were ALWAYS the ones who died at the higher rate, even before we had a vaccine, and we see now that that is STILL the case."

1028,0E-InXxJYfc,Bring back the dislike button
1029,0E-InXxJYfc,"I appreciate the research presented in this video because it really helps put the benefits and risks into perspective. I know many people who refused to vaccinate themselves and their children. The COVID pandemic seemed to bring out a surge in medical information being spread through social media and news platforms. There was a lot of misinterpreted or incomplete data being shared in the process and it resulted in a lot of people who have now turned their backs on medical practices like vaccinations and there is a rise in distrust in the medical field. I would imagine that the best doctors can do is inform patients about the statistics and safety of these vaccination. I am sure that it is very frustrating for pediatricians and family doctors when their patients refuse vaccinations due to something they read on Facebook, but I think that this is a great example of the medical ethics principle of autonomy. Patients are informed about the efficacy and risks associated with the COVID vaccine and all other vaccines, but at the end of the day it is their choice whether or not they are their child receives the vaccine. I think that it is especially hard when medicine and politics intertwine because I know that there were many things that were politicized during the COVID pandemic, including vaccines and masks. Mask mandates were placed throughout the country but I personally feel that these are a violation to patient autonomy. I guess people still had the choice of going out or staying home and if they truly did not want to wear the mask they had the option to stay home. I don‚Äôt recall any vaccine mandates being put in place but I do know that for some time vaccination proof was required for travel or for large gatherings like sporting events and concerts. I also remember the uproar this caused because people felt that their freedom was being violated. I think that the issue of medical autonomy is a very serious one and should never be taken lightly. It is not easy to get people to all be on board with public health measures, especially when they are receiving conflicting data from multiple sources. I think that one of the most important things that can be done in regards to situations like this is to encourage people to check their sources and rely on real data to make informed decisions."
1030,0E-InXxJYfc,"If taking a medication multiple times and still getting the disease is what they call effective, WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY MEAN BY ""SAFE""?"
1031,0E-InXxJYfc,"I can't count how many times this channel has underlined the importance of absolute vs relative risk reduction; just so they end up concluding ""a prevention of death"" on a study that can't even measure either, and without even trying to estimate absolute risk reduction.
Why? (this is a sincere question, I'd like an answer)"
1032,0E-InXxJYfc,"Found a meta-analysis, thought I'd share and add to the comment section. ""In conclusion, our research shows that the current COVID-19 vaccine for children is effective and safe, and is more effective than the adult COVID-19 vaccine. There is a gap between the effectiveness of attenuated and inactivated vaccines, and the effectiveness of inactivated vaccines is the highest. We found that the inactivated vaccine is less painful at the injection site and is more friendly to children and adolescents. More carefully designed further studies based on risk factor adjusted estimates are necessary to confirm our findings."" - Wencheng Xu et al. (2022), Journal of Infection"
1033,0E-InXxJYfc,Dude's on record for saying that.  He needs to be sent a court date.
1034,0E-InXxJYfc,"Dr. Carroll, are there any data that indicate how protected a child is after one dose of Pfizer, or two? Just protection after the full course?  How much more careful should I be with my 60% vaxxed one-year-old?"

Fast forward to post ""covid prevention method"" She began experiencing extreme leg pain.  Her legs began to rapidly swell up.  She went into the hospital, where the clotting continued to get worse.

Common side effects perhaps in a vaccine company's survey of test subjects. Another thing to ask about this data is, how long after receiving these vaccines was the survey done? 5 minutes, hours, days, years?"

Which is when I realized I was about five weeks pregnant. LOL! Turns out baby was more to blame for the exhaustion than the vaccine was."

Our little one is now a month old and she is thriving; our community had very few cases during my pregnancy but now that cases are spiking again, my hope is that my vaccination will be enough to protect her if necessary."

In addition, the Soviet program also saw the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova, in 1963 and the first spacewalk in 1965. Other milestones included computerized robotic missions exploring the Moon starting in 1959: being the first to reach the surface of the Moon, recording the first image of the far side of the Moon, and achieving the first soft landing on the Moon. The Soviet program also achieved the first space rover deployment with the Lunokhod programme in 1966, and sent the first robotic probe that automatically extracted a sample of lunar soil and brought it to Earth in 1970, Luna 16. The Soviet program was also responsible for leading the first interplanetary probes to Venus and Mars and made successful soft landings on these planets in the 1960s and 1970s. It put the first space station, Salyut 1, into low Earth orbit in 1971, and the first modular space station, Mir, in 1986.

1163,5UPLDYc4O80,"We need some journalists to start asking the tough questions. How the hell can you create a vaccine for cancer? Is cancer really the abnormal/mutated growth of cells or rather the contents of what your body is innately trying to quarantine (tumur being a biological casing and inside it, the real cancerous material)?... If the latter is the case how would this cure cancer? Most cancers are as a result of the junk we eat, pollution, the chemicals we use in our hair, under our arms, in food production, Chem-trails, and our individual bodies reaction to various diets, environmental factors and said chemicals that is not wanted by the body. So does this vaccine alter the genetics to respond differently to ""cancer"" and how?  So let's say we aren't supposed to consume for example, vegetable oil or what ever other foods that create the environment for cancer in the body, after taking this vaccine will the rules change? Will we really be able to just guzzle oil and whatever else as food, without getting cancer once we take this vaccine?"

Irregardless of whether or not he is or isn't elected as our next president and this lovely lady our first lady, I am inspired by their marriage and family. I wish them only the best throughout thier lives. May God bless them and keep them, may they continue to do good works for  those around them who are lucky enough to cross paths with them. These are good people doing good works and should be set as an example of how to live life."
1210,7n6Eagn5d78,What a beautiful and educated woman. Vivek is a very lucky man to have her.
1211,7n6Eagn5d78,"Vivek's a lucky guy. She's beautiful. intelligent, supportive and has a great sense of humor ."
1212,7n6Eagn5d78,"For someone who has not been trained in political speech techniques formally by the nature of their profession, Apoorva is extremely articulate and lightfooted around questions intended to procure concrete answers. Not only is she excellent during this interview and demonstrating the profoundness of her mind, but I cannot help but also notice that she is stunningly physically attractive. The total package!"
1213,7n6Eagn5d78,This is what an actual First Lady doctor looks like.
1214,xfZuMQmyb30,"We need to go after all who promoted, pushed and advertised it.
Hold them all accountable"
1215,xfZuMQmyb30,Wow! I never thought I'd see the day when a vaccine would be banned. More of this needs to happen üíö

 Turnaround in Switzerland: The Federal Office of Public Health no longer recommends the Covid vaccination.  Doctors who continue to vaccinate are liable for possible side effects."

1222,xfZuMQmyb30,I think this is absolutely terrific and incredibly courageous
1223,xfZuMQmyb30,Punish the manufacturers.
1224,AeXgV7k4AIk,Throwing 100 million doses away? No ones taking the shots? This is great news! Every shot thrown away is a life saved
1225,AeXgV7k4AIk,India is one of the only nations to actually LEARN from watching the data on these vaccines. Very wise people.
1226,AeXgV7k4AIk,Tremendous move üëè.  All other countries should follow their lead. And dump gates with it.
1227,AeXgV7k4AIk,"100 million lives saved India by dumping the clot shots...well played India, well played!"
1228,AeXgV7k4AIk,Every shot thrown out is a life saved!

1230,AeXgV7k4AIk,Ivermectim is cheap as roti and you don't have to worry about adverse reaction.
1231,AeXgV7k4AIk,The US won't throw it away they will just add it to the hundreds of ingredients that we already have in our processed foods. Not kidding.

1234,TW5BttKUlZo,Took two years to find a good body double. Nice try CIA
1235,TW5BttKUlZo,RIP to the real Tiffany
1236,TW5BttKUlZo,Everyone take notice: this is a blatant hit-piece against anyone who questioned why she went missing for 2 years. Textbook gaslighting
1237,TW5BttKUlZo,That is so obviously not the same person.
1238,TW5BttKUlZo,The fact that her husband changed his marital status to single is enough proof that she is no longer with us
1239,TW5BttKUlZo,"who gives death threats to someone who is ""dead"""
1240,TW5BttKUlZo,"It took two years to find a body double and she isn't even that good. 
Shamefur dispray"
1241,TW5BttKUlZo,Finally after two years they found a doppelganger
1242,TW5BttKUlZo,"I love the part where she does housework in high heels in a brand new, unused house üòÇ"
1243,TW5BttKUlZo,This is not the girl who collapsed.
1244,OjbSWebA3Ko,She is one of THEM
1245,OjbSWebA3Ko,I wonder how many people Dolly is indirectly responsible for their deaths.   What a traitor.
1246,OjbSWebA3Ko,"That hasn‚Äôt aged well and nobody (nobody‚Ä¶) will ever be able to forget her singing her jingle.  Oh, boy‚Ä¶"
1247,OjbSWebA3Ko,Never forget what these people did.  Never.
1248,OjbSWebA3Ko,"I was a huge enthusiastic listener for decades. With this performance, it's over forever! I'm not buying any more records from her!"
1249,OjbSWebA3Ko,She called antivaxxers cowards??!!
1250,OjbSWebA3Ko,Shameful. Every single one who helped push this should be held accountable..
1251,OjbSWebA3Ko,It‚Äôs called ‚Äútowing the line‚Äù... The one thing worse than getting duped is not accepting that you have been duped.
1252,OjbSWebA3Ko,"Dolly: ""so how are the long term studies and any current issues with the shots?""  

Doctor: ""oh were still writing up the script for the long term studies and nope.... no issues at all, everyone is fine taking this!"""
1253,OjbSWebA3Ko,SO SAD how easily these people will SELL THEIR SOULS.
1254,o2HLkFi4Qtw,"After reading tons of side effect stories, I think I'm one of the lucky ones, only suffered mild pain in the arm for one day."
1255,o2HLkFi4Qtw,I think the most important thing you shouldn't do after getting the vaccine is to expect that you are going to be immune or protected! I think they forgot to mention that one.
1256,o2HLkFi4Qtw,"After my first vaccination ,I suffered only mild arm ache. Thank you Lord."
1257,o2HLkFi4Qtw,One thing you should do first - PRAY !
1258,o2HLkFi4Qtw,Before vaccine PRAY & after vaccine PRAY üôè
1259,o2HLkFi4Qtw,Why would someone want to get a Tattoo‚Ä¶ after a covid shot‚Ä¶ ‚ò†Ô∏èüíÄ
1260,o2HLkFi4Qtw,"6.  ""Don't report any adverse events because that would reveal truths we wish to conceal."""
1261,o2HLkFi4Qtw,The main thing: don't expect to live longer than 2-3 years üò¢
1262,o2HLkFi4Qtw,Thanks for the post handy and informative video my family members had 3 doses or vaccinations. We felt normal as usual and everyday routine continuous as always. I workout at the gym as usual 5 times a week no problemoüëå medical student Malaysia üëç

1264,o-yTrL5aszM,How does one qualify for a waiver?
1265,o-yTrL5aszM,And good luck getting ‚Äúthe waiver‚Äù! Lol
1266,nhb1zIYXUP8,Is she really ok? Why isn't someone so passionate about the vaccine coming back on camera to tell everyone it's safe?
1267,nhb1zIYXUP8,"It was done safely and ‚ÄúCORRECTLY‚Äù that‚Äôs why she fainted, if it was done incorrectly she would‚Äôve been just fine."
1268,nhb1zIYXUP8,Strange how there is no footage of her 'back on her feet'.. 'moments later'.
1269,nhb1zIYXUP8,"This seems suspicious that they would allow a nurse with ""a history of fainting"" to be the focal point of a vaccine push. They no response to hundreds of Facebook messages on her profile. The bit about privacy seems odd given that she stepped up to be the 'face' of the vaccine promo video. Surely a simple quick interview could confirm she is still alive?"
1270,nhb1zIYXUP8,I call b.s.. If they knew she had fainting problems. They wouldn't have chosen her for a live injection.
1271,nhb1zIYXUP8,"Everyone is missing the point.   She has not been infected with ""UNNAMED INFECTION"" since this shot, so it works, yes?"
1272,nhb1zIYXUP8,It's amazing that they say this is ok. People are literally giving up free real estate in their bodies and experience muscle death and nerve damage and this is somehow ok?
1273,nhb1zIYXUP8,Let‚Äôs hear that from her on camera in a safe place
1274,nhb1zIYXUP8,Can you please show the whole clip of this? Where she (the nurse) says she is prone to fainting? And that this is NOT the vaccines fault?
1275,nhb1zIYXUP8,She didnt faint. The chip was rebooting her.
1276,It7VNzhAqOs,"I have a friend who developed a pulmonary embolism after his second vaccination shot. He was told by his doctor, the hospital and CDC it was not related to the vaccine, but he'd never had that type of an issue before.  And they wonder why people are hesitant to get vaccinated."
1277,It7VNzhAqOs,"When I had my vac at a pharmacy I asked if they could aspirate and the person said they were not trained to do that, I would have to go to a nurse for vaccination. I find that appalling, a layman trained to give a vaccine but not trained in safety techniques. This is in Australia."
1278,It7VNzhAqOs,"Notice they never promote natural immunity or antibody treatment, it‚Äôs all about the shots. Glad this doctor is getting the word out."
1279,It7VNzhAqOs,Aunt had a heart attack a week after her second shot. They said she had a damaged artery. Three months prior she had a full medical and was in perfect health.
1280,It7VNzhAqOs,"We have a moral duty not to comply. No to discriminatory vaccine passports and mandates, it is an utter disgrace. This must not happen England. Say no to this disgraceful dystopian tyranny."
1281,It7VNzhAqOs,"Still blows my mind that for a 99.7 recovery rate people are flocking to get this exper i ment. 
I'm equally shocked that this very informative, great video has survived 3 days on this platform."
1282,It7VNzhAqOs,For the first time in history the ineffectiveness of a vaccine being blamed on those who haven't taken it.
1283,It7VNzhAqOs,"My doctor in the UK laughed at me when I asked him to aspirate the injection, telling me there‚Äôs no major blood vessel he could go into, basically I was been silly, it‚Äôs disgusting they won‚Äôt do it!"
1284,It7VNzhAqOs,"Same message that Dr. John Campbell in England has been sending for months now.  Aspiration should be standard practice for covid vaccinations.  WHO, CDC and others who recommend against aspiration are guilty of medical malpractice."
1285,Mnn4ZqeKxVM,"When I watched the Dark Horse with Steve and Dr Robert Malone, I decided that I would never take the vaccine no matter what. I am 76, vaccine free and I never got the virus. Thank you, Steve for your hard work to educate the us."
1286,Mnn4ZqeKxVM,If Trump gets in he needs to replace those over the FDA and CDC
1287,Mnn4ZqeKxVM,"STOP THE CLOTSHOTS,  MAKE NUREMBERG TRIBUNALS GREAT AGAIN."
1288,Mnn4ZqeKxVM,Prosecutions are required!
1289,Mnn4ZqeKxVM,"My mom got covid a week after she got a Moderna shot, and collapsed on my table, a week after that! My mom's health  has never been right ever since!!!"
1290,Mnn4ZqeKxVM,"""Safe and effective"" quickly turned into ""sudden and unexpected"".

Do NOT forget about the unprecedented levels of coercion these monsters perpetrated onto the human race."
1291,Mnn4ZqeKxVM,This man (Steve Kirsh) a rockstar for sharing. So unbelievable  that folks are still in denial.....thank you Tucker
1292,Mnn4ZqeKxVM,"VAERS is garbage. My wife, a RN, was a travel nurse during covid. She worked at 7 different hospitals. NONE of them were reporting adverse events, citing it took to much time from administrators. She retired, after 29 years, last June. She had enough. I retired, after 32 years, as a high level Tactical Paramedic, last February."
1293,Mnn4ZqeKxVM,"You should talk with the French Professor Raoult he should be happy, he already is fired for saying the same conclusion."
1294,Mnn4ZqeKxVM,Thanks for standing up for truth!  Disabled for 2 years.  Doctors ignore us.
