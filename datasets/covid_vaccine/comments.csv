0,2IXl4qJGrRk,That is one Guiness Book of records that will never fall.
1,2IXl4qJGrRk,He's now the strongest man in the world.
2,2IXl4qJGrRk,He got more vaccines than all Texans together!
3,2IXl4qJGrRk,"The researchers analyzed his blood chemistries, which showed no abnormalities linked to his hypervaccination. They also looked at various markers to evaluate how his adaptive immune system was functioning, according to the study.

The adaptive immune system is the subsection of the immune system that learns to recognize and respond to specific pathogens when you encounter them throughout your life, Miller said. There are two main cell types in the adaptive immune system, T cells and B cells.

In chronic diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis B, immune cells can become fatigued from frequent exposure to the pathogen and lose the ability to combat it effectively, Schober said. Hypervaccination, in theory, could have a similar effect.

However, that’s not what the researchers found. Hypervaccination in this case increased the quantity (the number of T cells and B cell products) but did not affect the quality of the adaptive immune system, according to the study.

In total, the man got eight vaccine formulations, including mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, a vector-based vaccine from Johnson & Johnson and a recombinant-protein vaccine from Sanofi.

While very interesting from a scientific perspective, individual case studies like this must always be taken with a grain of salt, Miller said. Public health recommendations, which are based on very large, randomized control trials, are what people should look to for guidance, she added.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends Covid vaccination for everyone ages 6 months or older in the United States, following the vaccination schedules outlined on its website. Last week, the CDC updated its guidance to recommend an additional dose of the current Covid vaccine for people 65 and older.

Less than a quarter of adults and only 13% of children in the US have gotten the most recently recommended Covid vaccine, according to CDC data.

Covid hasn’t disappeared, and neither have vaccination conspiracy theories.

CDC drops 5-day isolation guidance for Covid-19, moving away from key strategy to quell infections"
4,2IXl4qJGrRk,this man is more vaccine than he is human
5,2IXl4qJGrRk,That’s the difference between Germany and America: man receives 217 Covid shots vs man gives 217 gunshots.
6,2IXl4qJGrRk,I would love to hear the response from vaccine sceptics who predicted the end of time for people who accepted one vaccine!
7,2IXl4qJGrRk,Doesn't he know you need 218 vaccinations to be really protected. 😂 🐑
8,2IXl4qJGrRk,There are two factors helping your immunity with a vaccine. Temporary heightened immune response to all infections and later an immune response to the specific infectious agent.
9,2IXl4qJGrRk,"Wow, this dude’s 5g signal must be off the charts!"
10,HtTalpY-J-M,It's good to know the vaccine is safe to use.
11,HtTalpY-J-M,Strange kink. Though not gonna judge him for it.
12,HtTalpY-J-M,"no proof, no identity, just words."
13,HtTalpY-J-M,"In todays late news..He exploded 3 minutes after this footage was doctored...err, filmed."
14,HtTalpY-J-M,Wasn't this video supposed to be posted on April Fools Day?
15,HtTalpY-J-M,So this how we were making sure there's enough vaccines for third world countries.
16,HtTalpY-J-M,😂😂😂😂 I can't stop laughing . Tell me more. That's what fear does to ya!
17,HtTalpY-J-M,Oh god !! How can it be possible??
18,HtTalpY-J-M,"AND THE DOCTORS WOULD ALLOW HIM TO DO THAT??? 
PLEEEZE...B.S"
19,HtTalpY-J-M,So one example is the base for leftist science now?
20,jPs4_MeuX7U,"I love being a conspiracy theorist.  Maligned, slandered, hated....but still right 😎"
21,jPs4_MeuX7U,Politicians who pushed these injections should and must be held to account
22,jPs4_MeuX7U,"Just disregard the word ""rare"" because all of my vaxxed patients are injured and suffering."
23,jPs4_MeuX7U,"Dr John Campbell has constantly pushed for the truth, hopefully other nations news stations will follow 🤙"
24,jPs4_MeuX7U,I guess all they so called conspiracy theorist before were right after all
25,jPs4_MeuX7U,"My husband nearly died of a massive heart attack after his second shot,  both our moms and my aunt had strokes, our best friend died from a heart attack,  my brother in law developed AFIB, I developed severe neuropathy and people in our neighborhood have also suffered adverse affects like these...everywhere we go, or random people we meet, or aquaintences all say the same things.  This is no joke!  Shame on them for crimes to humanity!!!"
26,jPs4_MeuX7U,What can go wrong when Dr BILL GATES ( by the way who has no medical degree at all ) makes himself the top Epidemiologist in the world ?
27,jPs4_MeuX7U,They forced you to choose between heart failure or Lose your job.
28,jPs4_MeuX7U,"""Benefits outweigh the risks.""  Yes, the benefits of not getting shot outweigh the risks of getting it."
29,jPs4_MeuX7U,"Can you imagine how many would not have taken the jab if they knew this, the government cannot be allowed to do this again."
30,WhiBpmH1mE4,Crazy!   I'd love an update on him several years from now.
31,WhiBpmH1mE4,"He’s fine, he’ll probably live to 💯"
32,WhiBpmH1mE4,"He is now a property of, make and model, and is patented to what ever company decided to participate in this study. 

I’m joking but not at the same time."
33,WhiBpmH1mE4,Wow! 😳. That is crazy !  Thanks Dr. Jen ! I appreciate you always dear. Good night 😊🙏💝
34,WhiBpmH1mE4,"DO NOT DO THIS....EVER!!!!!!    repeat
DO NOT EVER DO THIS!!!!!"
35,WhiBpmH1mE4,I just want to say I never had Covid-19 and only had one shot which I was forced into!! This my Covid-19 story Dr. Jen👌🏾👍🏾👍🏾
36,WhiBpmH1mE4,"An old and wise African American man once told me. "" You can write anything thing on paper, don't make it true!"". So I'd take this with a grain of salt. If true, let's see how he is in a year or two. He should have got a six shooter and played a game of Russian Roulette, same thing IMO🤔"
37,WhiBpmH1mE4,Let’s talk to this man in a year!
38,WhiBpmH1mE4,"Ferrets have one of the closest immune type to humans.
UK has roughly 500000 (half million) Ferrets.
Ferrets spread influenza to humans.
Not a single case of 1 Ferret contracting, spreading or dying of Sars Cov2.
Which animal has been chosen to test model CV19 vaccines on?

The Ferret."
39,WhiBpmH1mE4,"How was he able to get all those vaccinations, and why would you want to? 🤪"
40,LfmhYVCCGhc,No recourse with vaxx companies should tell us something
41,LfmhYVCCGhc,"Joe Rogan is right ! 
Imagine defending Phizer in 2024…"
42,LfmhYVCCGhc,But we have increased death rates and loads of people have some new kind of blood clots that can be as long as a calamari. There’s something going on and obviously no one wants to take the blame so things are being silenced as long as they can.
43,LfmhYVCCGhc,If you dont see theres a problem at this point you never will
44,LfmhYVCCGhc,The fact that Joe Rogan is correct.  The ignorance of people that don’t do their own research 🤦‍♂️
45,LfmhYVCCGhc,There has been a sharp rise in excess deaths worldwide since about mid 2021. Just baffling what could be causing this. Any ideas anybody ??
46,LfmhYVCCGhc,Unfortunately the people that have died can't comment in this section
47,LfmhYVCCGhc,In western Australian the death rate went up dramatically after the vaccine rollout. That was before covid reached that state.
48,LfmhYVCCGhc,"If you completely ignore VAERS and every other database worldwide and live in an alternative reality, then yeah, these covid injections are the best and safest vaccinations ever."
49,LfmhYVCCGhc,Most ppl who comment here are vaccinated and for them it’s hard to admit they made mistakes.
50,oFDOQ9Pn-XM,Dude wants to join the X-men but he’s gunna be the guy that just turns into water.
51,oFDOQ9Pn-XM,"""And showed no side effects.""
Yet."
52,oFDOQ9Pn-XM,You mean he didn’t get the autism and his heart hadn’t exploded?
53,oFDOQ9Pn-XM,"“He administered the shots himself” 😂

And that’s how you know it’s all bullshit"
54,oFDOQ9Pn-XM,Three weeks after my 5th jab I had a stroke. I then learned of five others in my area who had strokes at exactly the same time - coincidence ? I don't think so - those vaccinations were rushed through and we have no idea exactly what they contained.
55,oFDOQ9Pn-XM,I have never heard such rubbish?👨🏾‍🎓🙄
56,oFDOQ9Pn-XM,No Side Effects? YEAH That's one of the symptoms 😂
57,oFDOQ9Pn-XM,...and we know this is true because the man said it is. FACTS! 🤣🤣🤣
58,oFDOQ9Pn-XM,Mental illness is a terrible thing.
59,oFDOQ9Pn-XM,I’ve had none and I’m fine… what a scam 😂
60,-Ea3UwYZnrA,Biggest psyops ever perpetrated on human mankind. Great work john.
61,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"I'm in tears here after listening to Dr John Campbell.He is the first person to explain what has happened to me after having the COVID vaccine. I spent all my savings trying to find answers for severe burning and pins and needles and muscle weakness straight after my 2 nd vaccine. (No NHS drs available at that time) Diagnosed small fibre neuropathy. Not one doctor admitted what I was saying all along, that the vaccine had caused this!!"
62,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"i'll never forget how people treated me when i told them to avoid the vaccine.. i was already disollusioned with the world before 2020, and what followed just confirmed my disdain. glad theres still some people out there taking it seriously and talking about it"
63,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"I'd suffered with CFS for 15yrs at the time of the onset of the pandemic. My gut feeling told me not to get the vaccination, but I was given a really hard time about it. Thank goodness I listened to my gut! So thankful for this information 🙏"
64,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"I’m a retired veterinarian. 

I could see from the start that mRNA had the potential to cause constant antigen production. 

Reverse transcription was taught when I went to vet school, 40 years ago."
65,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"Prof. Robert Clancy is an international treasure. Humility, humor, compassion, curiosity and of course great knowledge and skill. In a time of confusion, ignorance and pettiness it is a relief to hear him talk, giving hope to many people suffering with debilitating illness. Long may he live."
66,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"You're brave to discuss possible side effects from the 'Jab', John. I'm downloading this video just in case is dissappears. Thank you, Dr. John."
67,-Ea3UwYZnrA,Dr Campbell is a man of honor. He did not sell out to big pharma like so many other doctors and politicians. I wish you the best of everything. Thank you.
68,-Ea3UwYZnrA,"The end... "" You don't vaccinate people with chronic fatigue syndrome, you are just putting petrol on the fire""   THANK-YOU !!  This was me in April 21. I'd been ill since Mar 20 and In April 21 had Chronic Fatigue. My vax invite came in April 21, I had 11 invites actually. Didn't do it. I'd been ill for over a year, no answers from Drs or Consultants and well my gut instinct was telling me if spike protein does this to me already, didn't seem like the best idea to ask my body to make more. I don't even want to think what may have happened. And I had to put up with people telling me ""Just get the jab""  ""Don;t be silly""  etc. The look of disgust from some people when I said I wasn't vaccinated and one was a male nurse at my local hospital , gave me a proper lecture. I wasn't;t well and didn't;t want to get into an argument as his made was well and truly made up.  Thanks you John and Robert."
69,-Ea3UwYZnrA,Finally a brilliant review by Professor Clancy based on REAL research! All Doctors need to hear this to help their patients!
70,im3otpqYAiQ,Glad I made it through the gaslighting.
71,im3otpqYAiQ,“They didn’t find anything else that was alarming….” This is actually comical. Aren’t these enough??
72,im3otpqYAiQ,The dude makes it sound like Myocarditis and pericarditis are just minor health conditions. What a joke
73,im3otpqYAiQ,"If you have to be persuaded, reminded, pressured, lied to, incentivized, coerced, bullied, socially shamed, guilt-tripped, threatened, punished and criminalized … If all of this is considered necessary to gain your compliance — you can be absolutely certain that what is being promoted is not in your best interest.” – Ian Watson"
74,im3otpqYAiQ,Didn't they destroy doctors careers who said this 2yr ago .. ?
75,im3otpqYAiQ,The Truth must be revealed……. Or we’re doomed to repeat it 😔
76,im3otpqYAiQ,Take the number of instances. Multiply by 75000
77,im3otpqYAiQ,Its a          B I O W E A P O N
78,im3otpqYAiQ,"Slightly is the new buzzword.

You have a slightly higher chance of dying if you enter a polar bear enclosure without protection.

Slightly higher chance."
79,im3otpqYAiQ,No one regrets not getting it
80,geXKovieb1E,It’s crazy how the majority of the population don’t have an inner monologue and don’t question anything.
81,geXKovieb1E,A good friend of mine aged 39 died last March. He hadn't had Covid but he had three jabs to stay employed despite my warnings. He thought I had jumped on some QNON bandwagon and asked me if i was an antivaxxer. I said NO I'd had all my vaccines but wasn't going to take this one as it was untested. March 4th last year he sat down in a chair to read and died. His wife went to talk to him but he had just gone without even a sign or noise! It was heartbreaking but an autopsy showed massive blood clots to his heart and brain. His funeral was horrible and people who had once shunned me are now wondering if they have made a huge mistake. I don't feel superior or even say see I knew it because it was terrible the way they put people through mandates and put pressure on them to 'save grandma!'
82,geXKovieb1E,"i did not take vaccine,.. i'm still alive,....!!"
83,geXKovieb1E,I never took the Jab. Nor did my 85 year old mother. We are both healthier than most people that took the Jab. I guess you can say we are PURE BLOODS.
84,geXKovieb1E,The risks are NOT small. Bloody lies.
85,geXKovieb1E,When will media outlets like this grow a conscience ?
86,geXKovieb1E,"If you have to be persuaded, reminded, pressured, lied to, incentivized, coerced, bullied, socially shamed, guilt-tripped, threatened, punished and criminalized … If all of this is considered necessary to gain your compliance — you can be absolutely certain that what is being promoted is not in your best interest.” – Ian Watson"
87,geXKovieb1E,It was a rushed vaccine and not tested enough.
88,geXKovieb1E,Yeah benefits...seeing that every day as more and more people are reporting side effects or dying...at least this topic is now open for discussion...
89,geXKovieb1E,"Too late, harm has been done."
90,m2skKkRwYj8,Sunak is a national DISGRACE for making that comment!!!🤬 and so are the sheeple politicians that were clapping and bleating their approval😡!!!
91,m2skKkRwYj8,"Let me be unequivocal, Sunak is knowingly lying!"
92,m2skKkRwYj8,Power to Andrew Bridgen putting his 'all' on the line in the name of truth and transparency.
93,m2skKkRwYj8,Disgusting to hear the demented cheers
94,m2skKkRwYj8,"JOHN CAMBELL , ANDREW BRIDGEN , along with several more , need to be applauded for telling the truth especially it’s in government stats ."
95,m2skKkRwYj8,"After everything that’s happened in the last 3 years, anyone dumb enough to continue believing these criminals deserves the outcome"
96,m2skKkRwYj8,"They are so safe 'YOU' had to be threatened to take them, do you remember? No holidays, no job, no seeing loved ones in hospital, no hospital treatment.....do you  remember.???"
97,m2skKkRwYj8,"The moaning and groaning by the majority of members in the House of Commons tells you all you need to know about how concerned they really are about the average UK citizen.
If something is a threat to democracy, it's their complete indifference."
98,m2skKkRwYj8,OMG I am jumping up and down in absolute horror here!!! WHAT a totally appalling state of affairs when our (OUR) MPs have the nerve to mock in this way... Sunak you are a disgrace.
99,m2skKkRwYj8,"Jeez, this guy Sunak, should be charged with corporate manslaughter."
100,YVFAvoeFahI,Those who questioned and didn't get jabbed will never get an apology. But they have peace of mind knowing that they haven't got poison locked within their system.
101,YVFAvoeFahI,I agree with him😎People should be the only ones Who Control their own BODY 💯
102,YVFAvoeFahI,APOLOGY??? I want criminal charges filed.
103,YVFAvoeFahI,"The fact that the drugs quite obviously were not subject to an adequate peer reviewed clinical trial process along with that billions of people were denied informed consent is all kinds of illegal.

The definition of ""conspiracy"" simply means two or more people secretly agreed to carry out an illegal act.

Therefore, the entire thing was absolutely a ""conspiracy""... less the theory part."
104,YVFAvoeFahI,Not rare. Quit saying rare.
105,YVFAvoeFahI,I remember when “natural immunity” wasn’t a thing and if you told anyone they looked at you so strange. I’m glad of my decision now seeing the massive amount of injuries. And as I expected..the injured don’t have a voice. 🤷🏼‍♂️
106,YVFAvoeFahI,"Stuff your apologies, and save it for the people who died!!!! The next life is not going to be bought or anything else that is what you are doing to get through this world 😉"
107,YVFAvoeFahI,I don't take apologies. You are all an enemy to me. You tried to murder me
108,YVFAvoeFahI,I've had covid 4x and it gets easier to fight every time. The first time was the worst but it was just a bad headache and a fatigued body. This was a pandemic of stupidity.
109,YVFAvoeFahI,Apologies not accepted
110,IMRTSwb3hCs,"I didn't get the shots but this whole experience permanently ruined my trust in the system. I don't care how many studies they do, I'll never ""trust the expert"" ever in my life."
111,IMRTSwb3hCs,What about those giant rubbery clots found in cadavers?  Could you please do a report on that?  They've never been seen by embalmers before 2021.
112,IMRTSwb3hCs,"Just watch Dr.John Campbell , he’s ahead of it all"
113,IMRTSwb3hCs,Chris it’s not extremely rare. And you pushed that shot to no end!
114,IMRTSwb3hCs,17 mill around the world rare ..... 🙄 Thats not called rare thats called crimes against humanity
115,IMRTSwb3hCs,I’ve met so many jab injured here in Australia. I don’t think it’s “rare” at all. Many years on they are still suffering.
116,IMRTSwb3hCs,My favorite part about being a conspiracy theorist is not getting myocarditis.
117,IMRTSwb3hCs,IT'S NOT RARE
118,IMRTSwb3hCs,And yet it's still being administratored and no one is being held accountable.
119,IMRTSwb3hCs,Died suddenly

130,sidjKoHS6NE,"96% it’s disgusting! 
I quit my masters of public health at the University of Melbourne because they revealed that a subject was funded by a large pharmaceutical company and the part of the subject I experienced was simply trying to work out how to change policy to allow more people access to said company’s products. I withdrew in disgust! 
Anyone in Australia involved in ‘Health’ promotion and public health in Australia should be very, very ashamed!"
131,sidjKoHS6NE,"I am 68 years old,  not vaccinated, never had Covid and perfectly healthy.  In my county we were put under house arrest, discriminated and pressured worse than in any authoritarian regime but we stood our ground and I a  so happy we did."
132,sidjKoHS6NE,"This whole 3 years of ""covid"" has been nothing short of criminal. Thank you Mr. Campbell...."
133,sidjKoHS6NE,Watching Dr Campbells journey of realizing he's living in a corrupt system of lies and oppression has been magnificent.
134,sidjKoHS6NE,"Please keep all of your records. Never can we let the bastards who forced these jabs on people, knowing they were not safe, nor the practitioners who did not care enough to advise their patients to avoid this injection, get away with saying “we didn’t know the harm they could cause”. We knew - they knew."
135,sidjKoHS6NE,Your utter contempt for our criminal authorities is beautifully expressed at 3.35. God bless you sir!
136,sidjKoHS6NE,"I have serious concerns about the health industry. They fired all those that refused to push medication they had no idea were safe, and all those that did, are still there."
137,sidjKoHS6NE,absolutely criminal. thank you so much Dr. Campbell for your continued bravery in bringing all these important issues to light.
138,sidjKoHS6NE,In your videos you’ve become incredibly good at saying exactly what you want to say without saying anything. Thank you!
139,sidjKoHS6NE,"The fact that my husband and myself who are in our early 50s, have made a pact to NOT GO TO THE HOSPITAL or any HEALTHCARE facility no matter the issue; this is where we are at no trust."

150,KBvys-kcJi0,I would like to thank the D.A.R.E. Program for teaching me to resist peer pressure and not experiment with drugs.
151,KBvys-kcJi0,I like how they ignore literally allllllll of the other evidence in young people. And only relate it to the latest booster. This is strictly damage control
152,KBvys-kcJi0,"Some of us have been screaming this for 3 years now....and we were mocked, ridiculed, and silenced on social media. So nice of the MSM to catch up."
153,KBvys-kcJi0,Still unvaccinated and healthy as ever thank you Jesus ❤️
154,KBvys-kcJi0,I don’t know anyone who regrets NOT getting that poison cocktail.
155,KBvys-kcJi0,Pretty sad that everyone waits till the tv box says it’s dangerous.
156,KBvys-kcJi0,"Still unvaccinated, and couldn’t be happier. ❤🙏"
157,KBvys-kcJi0,The truth is slowly trickling out
158,KBvys-kcJi0,One thing about being a so called conspiracy theorist is that I will not have to worry about any of the side effects
159,KBvys-kcJi0,Pure bloods vindicated
160,P3nXJB5PoBM,The Pac-Man from the video game is smarter than you at this point
161,P3nXJB5PoBM,"Hey David, you seem like a really smart guy. May I give you a little unsolicited advice? Forget about politics for a moment. Forget about political parties for a day and go out into the world and try to find the truth about this. Do research online. Talk to doctors. Talk to families of healthy young people who just suddenly drop dead. Do some digging and follow the truth wherever it takes you. If you are able to take politics out of your research you will find some semblance of the truth. And the truth is scary."
162,P3nXJB5PoBM,"This guy is confident in ""the studies we have"". What studies? Drug company's studies? The government in Great Britain is starting to examine the excess deaths problem, why aren't we doing that here?"
163,P3nXJB5PoBM,My best friends wife will never walk again after she took the experiment.  She was 43 when she got the experiment.
164,P3nXJB5PoBM,"Anecdotally I personally know 7 people who were hospitalized with pericarditis,myocarditis or embolisms within 2 weeks of vaccination. 3 others “only “ had temporary Bells Palsy within a week of getting the first booster. No one died. I know of 3 deaths from COVID pneumonia and 3 or 4 serious illnesses. The overwhelming majority of the people I know who have had COVID were barely ill. Most were unvaccinated."
165,P3nXJB5PoBM,Why does David ask for comments if he doesn’t read them?
166,P3nXJB5PoBM,My friend is dead..35 years old .a roofer..said he got the shot to protect his daughter .died of heart attack...so suck it
167,P3nXJB5PoBM,"David, your fallacious arguments aren't going to age well. Bret has legitimate arguments that should not be dismissed."
168,P3nXJB5PoBM,My university professor died right after his 3rd dose. He said he would take the week off for that and that was the last time we saw him. Also my ex-girlfriend is now battling with Von Willebrand disease and has severe heart issues. She had none of that before getting vaccinated.
169,P3nXJB5PoBM,My cousin had a heart attack after the jab at 33
170,85ZicYaZsbQ,THANK GOD I DID NOT GET THE VACCINE
171,85ZicYaZsbQ,"By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid."
172,85ZicYaZsbQ,"The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it."
173,85ZicYaZsbQ,I am unvaccinated and don't have any regrets.
174,85ZicYaZsbQ,Nazarin is a smart girl who has learned to think for herself 👏

176,85ZicYaZsbQ,"This is gaslighting. Trying to tell her that her friend’s injury was random and there was no causal relationship to the kool-aide, gaslighting."
177,85ZicYaZsbQ,"""Yeah, so after being completely healthy all my life, one day I handled a poison dart frog. Several hours later I started suffering with swelling, nausea and paralysis"".

178,85ZicYaZsbQ,"I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem.

I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer."
179,85ZicYaZsbQ,"Nazarin, thank you! I lost my Mom and Dad both, within 8 months after they both took the shots. Both were pretty healthy before and my Dads heart stopped, and my poor Mother, suddenly got Cancer, everywhere! The lady blames it on our ""emotions "".. Its just like you said, we KNOW what happened.. Were not stupid. I miss my Mom so much, and i wish i could have been there to stop them from taking those shots!"
180,SkcAZfrYYXM,"Nothing to worry about, they've changed how they count excess deaths."
181,SkcAZfrYYXM,Best thing about refusing to get the covid jab...... zero side effects
182,SkcAZfrYYXM,"The rarest side effect of all?

Actual immunity."
183,SkcAZfrYYXM,"Just a week since France has made it a criminal offence to even CRITICISE mRNA treatment. Punishable by 3 years prison and or a 45,000 Euro fine. I wonder why this applies exclusively to mRNA treatments? A sceptical person would say that it has something to do with conflict of interest or brown envelopes, but that can't be it. Baffling."

185,SkcAZfrYYXM,"""Medical science is making such remarkable progress that soon, none of us will be well."" - Aldous Huxley (Brave New World)"
186,SkcAZfrYYXM,The only immunity provided by the mRNA injections was to the companies that sold them... that's immunity from liability for any and all deaths and injuries.
187,SkcAZfrYYXM,Well done to all those who avoided taking that muck
188,SkcAZfrYYXM,The only thing rare about this is that they are actually reporting it

190,I9S2jooTxkQ,"I’m a person with MS, when the vaccine came out, I called the manufacturer and asked them about it if there is a adverse reaction with my MS, they said call your doctor and we don’t know. I called my doctor and he didn’t know either, so I decided not to get the vaccine."
191,I9S2jooTxkQ,"In April 2021, I had shots 1 and 2 of Pfizer. I am a 25-year MS patient.  I was walking FINE prior to this. Within 1 HOUR of shor 2, I was not walking. 
I then did not walk for 15 months, had Covid 3 times, and shingles twice. Fought through and fired 4 neurologists who all said I had gone progressive with my MS until FINALLY getting a full head-to-tail MRI, which showed my scans were the same stable scans that I have had for the last decade. 
It is not my MS. It was neuroinflammation from the vaccine. There are a whopping TWO doctors that I will trust...  MANY want to silence us the vaccine-injured."
192,I9S2jooTxkQ,"Im a nurse practitioner and was essentially forced to take the jab due to the company I worked for requiring it. I reluctantly gave in and got vaccinated in May 2021. I was diagnosed with MS in June 2022. It was the worst decision I ever made. I have no doubt it gave me MS, but my neurologist and healthcare colleagues think Im wrong. Thanks for covering this. Im suffering for not standing up to my beliefs"
193,I9S2jooTxkQ,"This is so frustrating.
I am an ICU nurse with MS. When the vaccine came out, everyone was like are you getting it? Aren't you in immunosuppressive drugs?
I said actually until I can see that is proven to not cause relapse I will not.

I fought with my employer against vaccination for 2 years and finally won having a permanent exemption. Because there are case study of severe relapse.  So glad I am a heath care worker and know how to stand up for myself and to think for myself."
194,I9S2jooTxkQ,I was a fit and healthy 28 year old with no prior health symptoms (with the exception of very occasional asthma). I woke up with sudden leg numbness and lack of balance not long after my second vaccine. Multiple sclerosis diagnosis has since followed. I struggle to believe these aren’t connected. Never again will I be bullied into taking any medical intervention from the government again.
195,I9S2jooTxkQ,"My next door neighbor has now been told she’s got MS , the last few yrs have destroyed her former self . My mum and her husband both died within a year . I told them to wait but nobody listened , my daughters listened , thankfully 🙏"
196,I9S2jooTxkQ,"It screams cover-up when we aren't ""allowed"" to talk about a potential health crisis."
197,I9S2jooTxkQ,"Those of us that never got one 💉💉💉are to be congratulated on resisting the biggest media drive/campaign ever perpetuated on humans, and resisted all manner of pressure put forth by all manner of people. IF these people EVER get serious about conducting an authentic study they will have a control group, which they would not have had if we’d all buckled under the pressure and taken the 💉💉💉💉. Congrats everyone! ❤️"
198,I9S2jooTxkQ,"In April 2021 I was a healthy 60-year-old woman and wanted to have a little bit of life back. I decided to get the Pfizer vaccine and I told my husband to let me go first and see how I do since he has some medical issues. I thought I did fine and got the second one but within a couple of weeks something was very wrong, but I didn't think about the vaccine I thought maybe my age.  My balance was off, I had a tightness around my waist, I didn't want to drive at night, and my personality had changed.  My daughter started googling and said it sounds like MS.  My daughter asked a friend that was a doctor and he said he didn't think so. My age was the main reason. 
I will skip ahead to January 2023 and finally had an MRI and had many lesions. In my report, it said, “somewhat old for this active MS.”  My next step was a spinal tap and I had the bands in my fluid.  I was finally diagnosed with MS.  In April I started Ocrevus.  My life has changed so much in the last 2 years.  I am 99.999 percent sure it was the vaccine that caused my MS."
199,I9S2jooTxkQ,"My immediate family and I refused (repeatedly) THE shots and we never had c***d! Extended family had shots and 2 of them almost died from multiple blood clots, and still have ongoing problems with it! I'm so glad we stood fast while being ridiculed, mocked and condemned on a daily basis! Thank you for  sharing your research and truth!!!"
200,NGxPkc_9uhY,Hats off to Florida Surgeon General Director Joseph Lapado! He is a courageous man and is taking a stand against the global vaccine mafia!🥰
201,NGxPkc_9uhY,"Florida's Surgeon General is correct. The shots have given rise to increased 'turbo-cancers' of all kinds. Many Oncologists are experiencing the increased numbers, especially among young people. This is serious and his concerns for safety should be considered."
202,NGxPkc_9uhY,"My neice died of an aggressive  cancer, she was vaccinated,  my brother in law had continuous strokes and died and my mums partners son had chest pains after getting the vaccine and died 2 weeks later, my friend got blood clots 2 days after and her daughter got cancer which is now cured rank goodness. I have never ever in my life seen so many funerals like I did after this vaccine came out. This doesn't just happen."
203,NGxPkc_9uhY,Avoid the clot shot
204,NGxPkc_9uhY,Thank you for speaking out Dr. Lapado.  We need strong voices.
205,NGxPkc_9uhY,Dont take the poison
206,NGxPkc_9uhY,Thank God for this Surgeon General! 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏
207,NGxPkc_9uhY,They won’t admit that they are wrong
208,NGxPkc_9uhY,Good. Someone standing for the truth🎉
209,NGxPkc_9uhY,Say no to drugs
210,uOxppT3gPpE,It amazes me how people are still in denial simply because their egos can't tolerate how wrong they have been this whole time. And on top of that they feel like they're the intelligent ones.
211,uOxppT3gPpE,Even mentioning this used to get you banned or fired. Was madness
212,uOxppT3gPpE,"It’s amazing how some people are still so trusting and naive, even after they’ve been lied to. And after they KNOW they’ve been lied to"
213,uOxppT3gPpE,The way this  whole thing was handled has turned me complete anti vaxx. I hope everyone effected gets justice.
214,uOxppT3gPpE,My heart breaks for all the people who felt pressure to take the jab.
215,uOxppT3gPpE,"I'm a simple man. When the Dr. who created the MRNA technology said it wasnt safe, that is all i needed to hear."
216,uOxppT3gPpE,I'm still 17 and took vaccine at 15 yrs age... After vaccine my health got downhill and developed high Bp and heart issues and I'm still young😢😢
217,uOxppT3gPpE,This is like when the police investigate the police to find that there was no misconduct by the police.
218,uOxppT3gPpE,It blows my mind how many people actually took the jab. It was so obvious what was going on...
219,uOxppT3gPpE,"One of my relatives developed pericarditis three days after taking 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine. He was absolutely healthy previously and he is in his early twenties. Kaiser doctors at the beginning were trying to deny any connection to vaccine. He was several times in and out of the hospital now and finally they admitted that it's related to vaccine. Also, my mother-in -law developed bone cancer after the ""shot"". My sister in law's mother just passed away after her cervical cancer returned after long remission after the ""shot"". My other's sister-in-law father developed severe heart issue also right after the shot, to the point that he is dying now. Of course, they are all older people, but what is striking is the timing of this.  I have not taken the shot, neither my child and nor my husband because 10 years ago when we took swine flu vaccine we all got severe side effects, and that is why we did not take any covid shots. My husband developed stroke then ( absolutely healthy 36 year old), I almost died from Guillain-Barre syndrome , my child developed severe neuropathy, and my husbands uncle had a heart attack. Again coincidence? I was very healthy before the flu shot, and now I am almost disabled. I did regain some of my health after the Guillain Barre  , but I am still have severe residual symptoms. I am a microbiologist and have also medical background and I would never take another vax even if threatened. It is a poison, you might not believe me and think it is just all some kind of conspiracy nonsense , but I hope you will heed the warning! Lot of smart people, scientists and doctors spoke against it, but the censorship is very live and strong on YT"
220,3rIQHrbDguM,Nobody is regretting NOT getting that VAX  !!!
221,3rIQHrbDguM,"I walked away from a 140,000 a year job over refusing the shot. I don’t regret it one bit! I didn’t feel giving me the ultimatum, “You’re going to get the shot or we are going to take your livelihood from you” was right! It went against my rights as a freeman and patriot. I wasn’t willing to give up my medical freedom to any demand. Thank you for standing strong!"
222,3rIQHrbDguM,"I’m a nurse. Got fired from my job for refusing. I recognized the BS immediately. The pressure from other nurses, doctors and my wife was immense. They lied about it all. It makes me happy to hear how many in the military refused."
223,3rIQHrbDguM,"""When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty.""
Thomas Jefferson"
224,3rIQHrbDguM,"My company tried to make the vax mandatory when it first came out. In the building I was managing they asked me to check with all the employees to see who wanted to go for a free vaccine on company time and that the company strongly felt we must all be vaccinated to keep each other safe. It came back a unanimous ""no thanks"" including myself. The director of operations came into my building first trying to shame me saying i was setting a bad  example and was afraid of a little shot. I told him he was the one afraid desperate to make people get shots over a cold. He then said masks at all times will be mandatory as well as daily temperature checks for those who refuse the vax and those who didn't comply would have to find another job. I got tired of the back and forth and finally told him straight ""Listen, we're not doing any of that. If you keep pressing the issue i'll take the entire staff in this building with me to a competitor and take half your customers with me. Now piss off and go pretend like you have some useful function in the company we're done here"". The issue was never brought up again."
225,3rIQHrbDguM,"I worked for Pfizer for 33 years (Pathology / Histology) in Groton. The amount of proper science that was not done prior to releasing this experiment onto humans was appalling. No GLP primate studies, No GLP repro studies, No long term studies and GLP Bio-distribution studies were started AFTER the compound was released to the general public.... No science project for me. No thank you.
You all did the right thing."
226,3rIQHrbDguM,"I refused as a coast guard reservist. Had my quals stripped, was not allowed to transfer/promote. Harassed by the command for two years. A few of us had nothing to lose and waited them out. Now they act as if nothing happened. Absolutely zero accountability for these little tyrants."
227,3rIQHrbDguM,All you servicemen that refused I have the most respect for you folks are the real deal
228,3rIQHrbDguM,"I salute any person that refused it. Out of principle, it is a fundamental human freedom to choose what goes into our body."
229,3rIQHrbDguM,"Proud of you brother. I was the only CW2 Pilot (ARMY) to refuse the Covid vaccine for my company and haven’t flown a UH-72A since 2021. Was on the hiring pipeline for border patrol, but federal went 100% vaccination. Literally lost everything: relationships, home, assets… but NO REGRETS"
230,fdGj6p2qDdk,"Congratulations on your true endeavors. I'm old enough to remember at a very early age the polio sugar cube to help fight the disease. At that time..we had no fear of an attempt in eradicating the polio virus, no politics involved."
231,fdGj6p2qDdk,"Thank you for saving my mother's life! She was a very high risk person in terms of covid but with the vaccines now I'm not afraid. This is not a fake post, I am not a bad, I'm just a guy living in Switzerland who's glad that his mother is still alive."
232,fdGj6p2qDdk,This is so bizarre. Scripted and fake.
233,fdGj6p2qDdk,"My mother had polio as a teenager, and had to learn to walk again.  She counted Dr. Salk and Dr. Sabin as national heroes for coming up with polio vaccines, saving countless lives and meaning that her kids wouldn't face the same torture she endured, and she wouldn't see her children suffer like she had.  Dr. Kariko and Dr. Weissman should be honored as national heroes, too.  They have saved countless lives, and could have saved more (like my cousin, who gasped out his last breath believing COVID was a hoax) if not for stupid political nonsense."
234,fdGj6p2qDdk,We need more people like them and less people pretending to be important.
235,fdGj6p2qDdk,I am so happy to see  that Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman were appropriately awarded last December!    I am among the millions of grateful Americans who never got covid-19 thanks to their work.
236,fdGj6p2qDdk,"Great people, great story. Sadly, viruses mutate so the battle never ends."
237,fdGj6p2qDdk,"I ended up with mild symptomatic Covid (body aches, muscle weakness, sore throat, etc) but not hospitalized due to these vaccines...thank you for these vaccines. 🎉❤"
238,fdGj6p2qDdk,We should celebrate scientists like this who actually make real contributions to mankind rather than sports heroes and celebrities.
239,fdGj6p2qDdk,They also get credit for Myocarditis.

241,rNaIMC4XMhc,"Asked him if he was willing to potentially stump his career for his principles, came back in 2023 and won 3 out of 4 slams. What an athlete and what an ambassador.."
242,rNaIMC4XMhc,"Still watching this interview after Novak has a record 23 slams. So satisfying that he stood by his values and principles, and STILL managed to break the Grand Slam record. Elite person and an Elite athlete."
243,rNaIMC4XMhc,"The man is a hero.

244,rNaIMC4XMhc,"It brings tears to my eyes when the interviewer asks him if he is willing to let go of the opportunity to be the best tennis player ever and he just smiles and says ""yes"" 😥 He should not have to make such a choice 😪🤦‍♂️ Bless his heart for standing up for freedom. This moment should go down in history."
245,rNaIMC4XMhc,And he won the Australian Open 2023. What a great player.
246,rNaIMC4XMhc,"I never even knew who Novak was, but now he is my hero. A man with a strong body and a strong mind, very rare these days."
247,rNaIMC4XMhc,This is what a person of principle looks like.

250,vilMNHn4Yh8,Fear is temporary. Regret is forever.
251,vilMNHn4Yh8,A tragedy……..I still wonder every day why people willingly did this while the rest of us had our guts screaming NO!
252,vilMNHn4Yh8,This must be taken to court as the biggest crime against humanity
253,vilMNHn4Yh8,"It's too late now, the damage is done. You all followed like mindless sheep. I was suspicious from day one and became much more alarmed the moment legal immunity to the manufacturers was mentioned. We'll perhaps never know the true extent of damage, people dying too soon but their families not joining the dots. It's very sad. People still have not learned and will thrust their arm out for the next one."
254,vilMNHn4Yh8,It’s far worse than they are saying.
255,vilMNHn4Yh8,"my family and church friends called me selfish with no love for others. They rejected me, but my mega disabled son and I are vaxxed free. God gave me the strength even though we spent almost a month in hospital."
256,vilMNHn4Yh8,Sunik stood up in the house and said the jabs were perfectly safe ..2 weeks ago ! I bet his family did not have one !!
257,vilMNHn4Yh8,They say side effects are rare...BS ...everyone who took it has some issue
258,vilMNHn4Yh8,"the worst is, most people with side-effects probably still lie to themselves."

264,Ptrblo96DEI,Unlawful for Everyone!
265,Ptrblo96DEI,The Human Rights Commissioner in Australia must resign immediately and be investigated by the NACC for wilful misconduct and failing to uphold basic human rights in Australia.
266,Ptrblo96DEI,If anyone should be charged and arrested. First person should be now retired Victorian premier Daniel Andrews !
267,Ptrblo96DEI,CRIMINAL ACTS !
268,Ptrblo96DEI,"It should be deemed unlawful for EVERYONE. People got fired from jobs over this and not everyone was a police officer or nurse. Some were in retail, manufacturing, etc."
269,Ptrblo96DEI,"It not only the government should be sued , the MSM should be sued also"
270,xnTVis4scUc,Use this as a Bill de Blasio dislike button.

272,xnTVis4scUc,"Mandates aren't law, mandates aren't enforceable, and I can't wait to see the courts rulings on this new mandate."
273,xnTVis4scUc,And this is the type of government the second admendment was talking about
274,xnTVis4scUc,De Blasio is more determined to destroy his city than anyone I've ever seen
275,xnTVis4scUc,If everyone says’ “NO!” There is nothing they can do. A mandate is not a law!
276,xnTVis4scUc,"With the 'dislike' gone, it's actually more telling to observe the view count and like button contrast 😆💀"
277,xnTVis4scUc,I wouldn't even enforce it. The chances of them auditing a single company is small.
278,xnTVis4scUc,Im really curious to see how this will all eventually play out. What an absolute clusterfuck
279,xnTVis4scUc,They should just ignore him. He's out in like a month anyway

281,UijQ-6jhVuc,My mother died 20 days after her vaccination - 24 hours after vax - she got thrombocytopenia and died a horrific death. Never will forgive for what happened.
282,UijQ-6jhVuc,"I’m not against getting the vaccine , I feel you have the right to choose ! What I am against is the government mandating it and forcing it on everyone"
283,UijQ-6jhVuc,My sister in law had several strokes after her first booster. She was the healthier member of our family and in her early 50’s. She said she had felt different after the shots. I’m grateful I never got vaccinated. Bummed that two of my kids did get vaccinated 🙏
284,UijQ-6jhVuc,After my second Pfizer shot I had. 105.2 fever and convulsions… then pneumonia for 2 weeks… the doctors wanted me to keep my mouth shut and not blame the shot I received
285,UijQ-6jhVuc,I seem to remember the tobacco companies investigating whether cigarettes caused cancer.
286,UijQ-6jhVuc,"I have worked for 8 years in Upstate New York hospitals from 2015-2023. And I did not see one single patient in the ICU, ER or med surg who died as a direct result of SARS 2 covid.
They died from medical mal-practice and from a denial of early and alternative treatments and being forced onto ventilators."
287,UijQ-6jhVuc,This happened to me! I got my first dose and a few weeks later I was hospitalized and my platelets were VERY low and my red blood cells were EXTREMELY high. The doctor said I wasn’t supposed to be alive. I had the Pfizer vaccine. I regret I ever got that shot.
288,UijQ-6jhVuc,Theses leaders all over the world and NHS need to be held accountable for crimes against humanity. 🔒💰🔒😡🌍🙏
289,UijQ-6jhVuc,"My dad almost died after getting his Covid shot. He was hospitalized then eventually moving to a retirement home. He lost the ability to walk after being bedridden for so many months.

Ten days after receiving the vaccine, I was in the Emergency Room with Heart-Attack like symptoms.  An Echo-Cardiogram reveled that my Heart-Ejection-Fraction was only 20%.  Down from a previous diagnosis of 45% by a VA Cardiologist in 2015.

310,uZPGZ2mf4g4,I ignore everything the CDC says lol
311,uZPGZ2mf4g4,My own 2cents:  Stick with the same Mfr. you had for the initial shot. Mix and Match is really a reckless approach in terms of monitoring the vaccines independently going forward. It was really a mistake for the CDC to message that.
312,uZPGZ2mf4g4,And they are the ones who need it the most
313,uZPGZ2mf4g4,I got Moderna and am not getting a booster shot yet. This is because I tested my antibody levels and still have strong antibody levels 6 months after getting the second Moderna shot.
314,Z-zWo835gOs,The doctor does not have to justify why she hasn't had a vaccine to anyone...and neither do I!
315,Z-zWo835gOs,I'm a doctor myself and my issue is the mandating of the vaccine for NHS workers or anyone else for that matter. Compelling people to put something into their bodies that they don't want is a dangerous road to go down
316,Z-zWo835gOs,Dr Robert Malone (One of the founding inventors on mRNA technology) says: 'This is the first time in history that the ineffectiveness of a vaccine has been blamed on those who have not taken it!'

356,eFx-d0SvOVg,"Bri doesn't want to jump to conclusions and wants more studies, but she was willing to accept vaccine efficacy immediately without question."
357,eFx-d0SvOVg,The way they are trying (and failing) to explain how the vaccines are still beneficial is so embarrassing...
358,eFx-d0SvOVg,"Bri, don't assume everyone is as ignorant about this issue as you are"

362,eFx-d0SvOVg,"Bri went to top schools, got lots and lots of As, was told how smart she was throughout her childhood, and rewarded for her ability to make good grades. It is hard for people like this to admit they could ever be wrong about something."
363,eFx-d0SvOVg,I am greatly encouraged by these comments. So good to see so many people refused to take the jab!
364,i9JLZuhqRuU,"Addendum:
Two questions asked frequently.

Was the deceased in the first paper tested for SARS-CoV2 infection?

Answer: The paper states, ""but no positive laboratory or clinical diagnosis of the infection.""  The paper never states that the patient received a test and the result was negative.   Some have stated that as the patient was admitted to Charité Hospital in Berlin and their protocol for admission requires testing prior to admission.  However, it is unclear of the current website policy was in place when the patient was admitted.  Regardless, the policy states the following:  (https://www.charite.de/en/clinical_center/themes_hospital/main_topic_coronavirus/)

""At present, the following patient groups must show proof of a negative rapid antigen test (within the past 24 hours) or PCR test (within the past 48 hours) upon arriving at any Charité outpatient facility:

Vulnerable patients, such as those receiving hemato-oncological care or otherwise immunocompromised patients
Patients receiving daily inpatient care: Testing for SARS-CoV-2 is required at least twice weekly for those visiting Charité daily. It is important to test after the weekend or any other interruption in daily inpatient treatment (for example, the patient must show proof of a negative test every Monday and on one other day of the week).
Patients who are in the outpatient clinic for a longer period, for example for preoperative evaluation/preliminary examination
Patients participating in outpatient clinical studies""

Please note that a simple rapid antigen test (which is not designed to determine past infection but rather infectiousness) could have been the test that allowed the patient to be admitted to the hospital if it was negative.  But a negative antigen test would never be taken as proof that the patient had NEVER been infected with the SARS-CoV2.  

It is unfortunate that one has to this type of digging to find the ""answer"" which actually leaves more questions.  It is possible that the author did not realize how important this issue would be when originally writing the paper.  However, given the fact that a lack of nucleocapsid protein is not, in fact, the 
sine qua non of vaccine damage but also infection it now focuses on this question: how tight was the testing for SARS-CoV2 at the end of the deceased life?  The false negative rate is very different between self-administered tests and other more standardized tests.  In addition the patient could have spike proteins long after the RNA was detectable by PCR or protein by antigen testing making the results of the test moot.  Given this uncertainty, retrospectively, it is understandable that the author would have simply stated that the patient had ""no positive laboratory or clinical diagnosis of the infection.""   We wish this were clarified and if I was the peer reviewer I would have asked that this be fleshed out in the paper itself. 

Second Question:
What was the vaccination status of the deceased in the second paper?  

Answer: Unknown but it would be unlikely that all would have been given that a high proportion of COVID-dead were unvaccinated.    However, we do not have to remain with this answer.  A case series was published in November of 2020 (before C19 Vaccines) which showed the same result:  Nucleocapsid proteins were not seen to the same degree that spike was seen.  For instance the paper states regarding the brain: ""In the 16 (40%) cases positive for SARS-CoV-2 proteins on immunohistochemistry, spike protein was detected much more frequently (14 [88%] cases) than nucleocapsid protein (seven [44%] cases)."" https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(20)30308-2/fulltext#seccestitle170

Also note that a separate Lancet article from 2020 (before vaccine) also showed similar results (see page 7) virus present in heart in only 3/11 subjects) https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2666524720301440-mmc1.pdf

369,i9JLZuhqRuU,Risks you say? Well when businesses were mandating it for people to work without them knowing the risks. I'm just so grateful that I never took the vaccine even though I lost my 20 year career at a hospital. I'm still alive. Had covid 14 months ago . No problem. My symptoms were less than my friends that are vaccinated.
370,i9JLZuhqRuU,"My blood type is (O-) I don't smoke, I don't drink alcohol, I don't take drugs, I live in the Atlas Mountains in Algeria, every day I drink olive oil for lunch and dinner, I didn't get sick with corona and I didn't get vaccinated, and I'm happy with my choice"
371,i9JLZuhqRuU,People should have had the choice and discussion rather than censorship and gas lighting.
372,i9JLZuhqRuU,"My best friend's husband, a healthy hockey trainer, ended up having to get a pacemaker due to unexplained heart issues after the 2nd shot.  They tried doing it through the vein, but too many clots.  After that, he had multiple mini-strokes.  Poor guy can't remember anything.  We went on vacation together.  He remembers going but can't tell you anything about the week.  I try to talk to them about it, but they won't hear it.  He even got a booster after all of that.  So sad."
373,i9JLZuhqRuU,Both my mother and step mother died shortly after 2nd booster  a month apart . Can't believe these two are gone now! Very lonely!

381,Li-oxKhvZy0,The body count between these three men is something truly impressive. And scary.
382,Li-oxKhvZy0,The crazy part is when you start thinking about who’s bossing around 3 former presidents and getting them to stand like kids in a school project delivering these scripts
383,Li-oxKhvZy0,Imagine a virus with its own PR campaign
384,Li-oxKhvZy0,"I have never felt as lied to at this level ever as I did just now, seriously, the level of creepiness of this is UN-President'ed."

393,3GVGd3Ckrxk,"Remember how they advertised it ""Safe and Effective?"" But now they're saying: everything has risks."
394,3GVGd3Ckrxk,When will the mainstream media grow a conscience over what they’ve done
395,3GVGd3Ckrxk,Lies!!! Lies!!! They knew what they were doing. I'm so glad I didn't take it.
396,3GVGd3Ckrxk,"Maybe do a story on doctors losing their license when they advise against. Maybe do a story on how people were shamed, fire and more for wanting to wait for what we now know…that no vaccine is without risk. Why were they punished? Maybe do a story on the excess deaths. What is going on? What can we expect for our medical futures? Are doctors allowed to advise us? We need to know."
397,3GVGd3Ckrxk,The point is vaccines has risks which the policy makers denied. And there should be informed consent. These things should not be forced. People died because known treatment were refused people.
398,3GVGd3Ckrxk,NEVER FORGET how people treated you for refusing this poison.
399,3GVGd3Ckrxk,EVERY ‘so-called’ news outlet has a lot of explaining and apologizing to do. Accountability!

Today is my 3rd day after the second shot, I feel normal but my stamina when I workout is not the same. I feel like I get fatigued much faster than before and I run out of breath much faster than I used to. I swear I am not lying."

428,EETuOY3JjfM,I had my first jab yesterday but I've been nauseous and weak ever since plus got a running stomach. As someone that hasn't fallen sick on a decade this sucks.
429,EETuOY3JjfM,"My friend, who is 39, fit and healthy, was hospitalized with stroke-like symptoms yesterday. He received his second vaccine dose 3-4 weeks ago, his wife said he woke up in the morning and complained of his heart racing and difficulty breathing. While they were waiting for the ambulance she checked his heart rate with their blood oxygen finger monitor, his heart rate was at 155BPM. Can someone explain why a guy with no health issues had a reaction like this after getting the covid vaccination? I'm not anti-vax but this scares the hell out of me. I've heard reports of death and heart inflammation after getting the Covid vaccine, I feel like the vaccine will weaken the heart and cause health problems down the line for healthy adults 18-44."
430,EETuOY3JjfM,I spent about 7 days in the ER due to Covid and I haven’t been vaccinated personally it’s changed my mind about getting it I’m nervous but it felt like I almost died from it and I’m only 26.

472,Kd-E95tXfsY,MRNA turns your body into a spike protein factory and doesn't let up.
473,Kd-E95tXfsY,"Great explanation. Except new data shows spike proteins from mrna can enter cell nuclei, so  there are questions about whether spike proteins really are as harmless as was first thought."
474,Kd-E95tXfsY,Years ago I used to laugh at my friend for prepping for the zombie apocalypse. Guess who's laughing now. 🙁
475,Kd-E95tXfsY,Your own immune system is better without interruption.
476,Kd-E95tXfsY,"I'll take a pass until the long-term human safety trials are complete, which is what's happening now..."
477,Kd-E95tXfsY,"but if it really works, why is that pharma companies producing that COVID 19 evade legal sanctions and no liability if it fails, since they said it is effective (theoritically)..."

481,-92HQA0GcI8,"This video tells a part of the vaccine story few people get to see. Vaccines aren't miracles. They are the products of research, curiosity, and the hard work of scientists. 
Follow me on Instagram and Twitter and let me know what you thought of this video! @DrJoeHanson @okaytobesmart"
482,-92HQA0GcI8,Gosh that PhD student really hit the jackpot of PhDs
483,-92HQA0GcI8,"3 things I still can't get today:
1. covid vaccine
2. PS5
3. RTX 3090"
484,-92HQA0GcI8,"Dude, amazing explanation video. I really wish they would show more of that on TV instead of all those depressing news about covid and political debates about every single decision."
485,-92HQA0GcI8,"7:57 ""Can you play Doom on this thing?"" Responds with: ""Some of our computers, you are able to play at max settings"""
486,-92HQA0GcI8,"Such a fantastic video, thank you! I get really emotional thinking about how much we are capable of solving huge problems if we really put our minds to it. Very grateful to all the scientists, researchers, health workers, and so many more people, who have put in such a tremendous amount of hard work into developing and distributing vaccines in record time."
487,-92HQA0GcI8,Can we please share this with the broader public? This video was so well designed and easy to digest. It answers so many questions.
488,-92HQA0GcI8,Imagine writing your phd and get to study a pandemic first hand...
489,-92HQA0GcI8,"Lots of love and respect to the science community. The media focuses a lot on crappy influencers, royals, actors and actresses , sports people but they forget about the people working anonymously to save and protect lives."
490,-92HQA0GcI8,Your last statement is extremely important. Supporting basic research is so important.
491,RaLxhFiOBYk,What she didn't realize was that the FDA was in on the crime too.
492,RaLxhFiOBYk,"Your not a whistle blower, your a human being with love and compassion for humanity. Thank you for your bravery and for the sacrifices you have made to bring awareness to what’s really going on the world. We need more people like you and I hope others see this and are encouraged to do the same because our lives and future generations depend on it."
493,RaLxhFiOBYk,"Thank you for speaking out. As a frontline medical worker who lost their job to these mandates to force “vaccines” on people, I truly appreciate any time the truth is told. I am not anti vax, I have willingly had plenty of vaccines introduced to my body. I just want people to have choice and want for big pharma to be open that things are in a trial phase and not fully proven. No one should be an unwilling lab experiment."
494,RaLxhFiOBYk,Prison for these pharmaceutical employers.
495,RaLxhFiOBYk,Nothing but respect and admiration for this woman for speaking out. Thank you 🙏
496,RaLxhFiOBYk,"This lady is so brave and smart! Lucky world to have someone with great morals. Out of so many employees at Pfizer and Ventavia, she is the only one who noticed weird things, realized what was happening, and spoke up."
497,RaLxhFiOBYk,"When exposing a crime is treated as committing a crime, you're being ruled by criminals."
498,RaLxhFiOBYk,"With so little intergrity and morals in the world it's somewhat heartening to see people like this putting they're life and career on the line to tell the truth, thank you."
499,RaLxhFiOBYk,"Thank you, Covid-19 Researcher for your integrity ❤️

May God protect you from these criminals🙏"

501,sv0dQfRRrEQ,"I was curious how some other countries were able to achieve extremely high vaccination rates and came across Portugal, where 91% of the population has completed their vaccinations, compared to 64% in the US. (Note: the definition of “fully vaccinated” is shifting as the evolving virus makes boosters increasingly important!) 

Portugal’s strategy was, in part, to give the vaccine effort a non-political face: a military officer named Henrique Gouveia e Melo. He’s very tall, wears a combat uniform everywhere he goes, and enforced a strictly non-political communications strategy. He approached the vaccine effort like a military mission and by all accounts, gained the trust of the nation. It certainly wasn’t the only factor in Portugal’s success, but it made me wonder whether a military-led approach could have helped reduce polarization in the US. 

Let me know what you think in the comments below. 
-Joss"
502,sv0dQfRRrEQ,Its really disturbing that facts and medicine have been somehow integrated into political beliefs
503,sv0dQfRRrEQ,"if we hadn't treated covid as a political issue instead of the health issue it really is, we really would've gotten a lot more done by now"
504,sv0dQfRRrEQ,"I feel like this is just one example of the main reason why I despise modern politics. It has become an Us vs Them thing. It no longer matters what your qualifications are, your experience, your plans or even what kind of person you are. Now all you have to do is say the other side is bad and “they” want to keep you down and you’ll get a significant amount of the vote which can turn the tides for you. Now, everything becomes politicized and that makes people on both sides dumber because they think with emotions rather than their brain."
505,sv0dQfRRrEQ,"I lost my dad to Covid and I’m just 18. I told him many times to get the vaccine, but he was skewed by political views. It hurts a lot to see him gone. Im sorry if you rely on your news station to tell you what’s best for you. It is your decision. Don’t come to a decision and never look back. Stay open minded. Think about those around you. Life is precious"
506,sv0dQfRRrEQ,“There are two diametrically opposed views of what America should be like in in the world.” Wow. This is it.
507,sv0dQfRRrEQ,"My parents (who are very right leaning) got the vaccine before it was required by either of their jobs. They started being ""anti Vax"" once they realised the vaccine wouldn't be the end of masks, social distancing, online schooling, etc."
508,sv0dQfRRrEQ,"Aside from the great content, I am floored by the creative direction on this video. 
It is extremely difficult to create something captivating without using lots of graphics. The use of projector transparency film is genius and the framing of the video calls is amazing too. This video has so much depth of information and clear visual information. Bravo. Really. Great work!"
509,sv0dQfRRrEQ,Joss Fong is an American hero whose hard work in journalism is saving lives through dispelling misinformation. I look up to her so much because of these videos.
510,sv0dQfRRrEQ,"This is really interesting data, and it aligns with my experience. Most of the people I've spoken to who are either vaccine hesitant, or even are vaccinated but lean conservative poltically, have at some point said to me that they thought the severity and/or death counts of the virus were overblown."
511,aOInguXymGc,I'm still not voting for Biden.  Robert will always be the better option.
512,aOInguXymGc,Kennedy is the best option in my lifetime that we have had for president. There was no peer reviewed scientific evidence to refute any of the things Kennedy says. Jest “he is a conspiracy theorist”

515,aOInguXymGc,This video is the lie of the year. Well done 👍
516,aOInguXymGc,"The machine is so scared now, they’re totally desperate with their lies about RFK!"
517,aOInguXymGc,The difference between some conspiracy theories and the truth is time. RFK all the way!

521,lEFYYpE_hds,"I’m not anti vax but when I’m not allowed to ask questions, I ask more questions. Why so defensive? Why so unwilling to have a conversation about it? It’s a red flag to me when questioning something or asking questions gets a strong negative response."

""Yes""
""Tell me why.""
""Because I am not going to take that vaccine...""
*Immediately gets cut off by the reporter and we can't hear why she won't get it*

Well done. Amazing reporting."
523,lEFYYpE_hds,"My roommate who's a 21 year old male contracted myocarditis from the COVID vaccine. He started convulsing in the floor one night and we had to rush him to the hospital. He's been to multiple specialists since then. It's a much bigger deal than people think, one of the risks of myocarditis is sudden death."
524,lEFYYpE_hds,"Reporter - ""So you're willing to lose your job instead of getting the vaccine, tell me why.""
Woman - Begins to explain 
Today show - *immediately cuts her off 😐"
525,lEFYYpE_hds,"It's linked to heart issues in all age groups in my opinion.  As a nurse, I'm seeing a lot of heart issues about 3-4 months after receiving covid shots in people that don't have prior heart issues."
526,lEFYYpE_hds,My friends cousin (female) who is 19 went into cardiac arrest 3 days after 2nd vaccine. She just had a heart transplant and has a long road ahead of her. It’s more common than they are letting people believe.
527,lEFYYpE_hds,"They really need to report numbers and percentages so we can have even a clue as to what an ""increased rate"" is. News channels are so bad at reporting useful information and ambiguous information only increased emotional reactions and conjecture."
528,lEFYYpE_hds,Imagine posting such a story and not stating how many have had these reactions out of how many observed. I guess that's why you don't need a degree to be a news anchor...
529,lEFYYpE_hds,I'm so sorry for all the individuals here that were convinced or cohersed into taking this vaccine. People really need to band together and push back against this.
530,lEFYYpE_hds,A friend of mine went completely 100% paralyzed in response to the COVID vaccine and has been in rehab for over 2 months and can just now sit up on her own.  This is not the only case of this I've heard of either.

541,IxCHv7T_mao,I forgot where they put the title on YouTube videos...which is wild because I don't think it's been on top since like 2012.
542,IxCHv7T_mao,"I am terrified of needles. Normally when I hear people talking about vaccines I get super light headed and sometimes actually pass out. I'm slowly exposing myself to images and videos of vaccines and needles so that, when it comes time,  the process is easier for me. Getting the vaccine was never in question. I will not be responsible for someone's death if I can help it."
543,IxCHv7T_mao,"Hank, you realise the people will demand you recreate your 15 hours in Target video?"
544,IxCHv7T_mao,"i knew the ""yes"" was coming even before i clicked"
545,IxCHv7T_mao,Thanks for clarifying that the vaccine testing regulations haven’t changed. That wasn’t clear to me
546,IxCHv7T_mao,"As a healthcare worker, this is the first time I’ve heard anyone say they would get a vaccine to help me and it made me feel more things than I though it would. Thank you Hank."
547,IxCHv7T_mao,"A little over a month ago I went to the ER and got diagnosed with appendicitis, the cases in my state weren’t super bad at the time and I was able to get care and a same day surgery. Which was good because when they took it out the surgeon said it was close to rupturing. The cases in my state have skyrocketed since and I can only imagine what people are dealing with in hospital. I am so incredibly thankful for them and all the people helping to end this pandemic and when it’s my turn I’ll get a vaccine"
548,IxCHv7T_mao,The old vlogbrothers references made me tear up....idk why or if I’m just emotional but gosh I love this community. Thank you nerdfighteria for changing my life.

550,IxCHv7T_mao,Thanks for this. I’m doing a vaccine trial starting Monday.
551,qVcP3cI64ow,I’m unvaccinated and will continue to thoroughly research and remain unvaccinated.
552,qVcP3cI64ow,My heart said no; my head said no. I said yes to my instinct and said no to the 'vaccine'. Happy and healthy.
553,qVcP3cI64ow,Shame on everyone who coerced or pressured people to take that shot.
554,qVcP3cI64ow,These side effects are not rare. They are underreported.
555,qVcP3cI64ow,"100% safe from side effects, 99.98% safe from COVID death. I think I’ll stay unvaccinated. Let’s Go Brandon!"
556,qVcP3cI64ow,"My 34 yr old step daughter in Critical Condition Hospitalised for 2 Months a Heart Attack and needed Open Heart Surgery.
She was a Nurse…she is no longer ABLE to be a Nurse.

We have now seen 22 of our loved ones suffer…all who were Co£rc£d into being £xp£rim£nt£d on. Thankfully 16 of them are still here and recovering well now…and I have looked after many of them …luckily for them I know how to look after them! 
6 died after Co£rc£d I only 2 years…we have never seen anything like this in our entire lives.

It’s Disgusting.

They are nothing but Criminals and this Man is completely brainwashed !"
557,qVcP3cI64ow,Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab…NOT ONE.
558,qVcP3cI64ow,"People should go to jail for the rest of their lives for this. I’ve never seen a clearer instance of corruption, greed, and flat out evil than this"
559,qVcP3cI64ow,So rare yet EVERYONE knows someone that's had problems with the jab. The fact that they aren't being documented and the truth is being hidden just further supports my decision
560,qVcP3cI64ow,"The pressure I endured from friends and some family members was unrelenting. But I knew deep down this was dangerous! I was prepared to walk away from every relationship and determined to stand my ground.
  Two of my friends developed aggressive cancers who were otherwise very healthy.
  One family member is suffering from heart issues. I fully expect to be at a lot of funerals in the near future.  But the best thing about Covid is it taught me  just how evil our own government is.  I will NEVER trust our government or the pharmaceutical industry, again! Rest assured I’m not the only one."
561,iyo2UNQcdpQ,"Australia 🇦🇺 lost 34k deaths in WW2  servicemen, 30k excess deaths in 2022, yet no one is talking about it. At my sports club, common mention of funerals to go to, but no one connects the dots."
562,iyo2UNQcdpQ,"My Father (74), had taken 5 jabs, he had been complaining for the last 2 years about chest and back pain, last week he collapsed and passed out, I called the paramedics, they told him he was just having a panic attack, later in the day I took him to the ER because he started to cough up blood. At the hospital they took an X-ray of his heart, gave him a sleeping pill and an injection of some muscle relaxant, they didn’t take blood or look for clots. We got him around 4:30 AM, I woke up to him in pain, I immediately started the truck to take him to the hospital and when I came back in to help him to the truck he collapsed and died in my arms. The ME wasn’t going to do an autopsy, but I pushed them to do one. They found myocarditis, several blockages in the arteries around the heart and hemorrhaging in the lungs. The worst part about all of this tragedy is that he trusted our State Funded Media here in Canada and the Government over his own loving family. 

Please don’t stop dissecting data in a fair and honest way. 6:47"
563,iyo2UNQcdpQ,"This is all sadly unbelievable, as I sat with my wife and watched this fiasco unfold.  I wouldn’t allow my wife, or my children to receive any of the shots.  My entire extended family of very well educated people with Doctorates, Masters, and Bachelors, all questioned beyond belief our misunderstanding of the “opportunity” we were missing to save our own lives by receiving a 6 month old “Wonder of Science”, and how could we DARE question “Science”.  I can promise you, they’re not lining up any more for their shots, and it’s strange how silent they are about their shots now!  It’s amazing to me in our modern age how folks can be led to slaughter, and the saddest part is, the most educated are the dumbest."
564,iyo2UNQcdpQ,"The abuse I received from friends and family for refusing to take these vaccines.. The relationships broken forever.. Family members injured..
And I will still never regret my decision"
565,iyo2UNQcdpQ,"My 23 y/o grand niece died in her sleep the night after getting the jab. It was required by the company she had just been hired by, which she was to start the following day. So sad and such a crime to humanity. At 71, I refuse the jab. Blessings to all"
566,iyo2UNQcdpQ,"I lost my  only child at 49 three days ago. He was born with heart disease but after several surgeries, was healthy. He did not want the vaccine, but his steel mill employer told him he could lose his job. Tuesday evening he had sudden chest pain and was unable to breathe, and fell dead. Probably a blood clot caused by the vaccine. His wife and I did not want him to undergo an autopsy. I blame this wretched government for my son’s death. They took my everything away from me. May God pour his mighty vengeance upon them."
567,iyo2UNQcdpQ,"Too many ""peer-reviewed"" journals only require a Conflict of Interest statement from the authors, not the reviewers, editors, or publishers.  Because of this, my faith in getting the truth from these journals has been seriously compromised.  I'm SO glad that you're covering this paper!"
568,iyo2UNQcdpQ,My mother was a vivid high functioning person who ran an antique store and was an accomplished artists. When Covid hit my mother and father immediately got in line for the shot and every booster they could get! About two months after my father called me and said that they were having health problems. My mother was having a hard time with her memory and him with his general health. My mother is now in hospice and my father is not too far behind. It happened so fast! I know this can happen without a shot but it all seemed to start as soon as they got it.
569,iyo2UNQcdpQ,"Slam dunk indeed! Thank you John, I have followed you from the beginning and am very happy to see where you are now! Justice must come to those who perpetrated these evil crimes against humanity"
570,iyo2UNQcdpQ,Many heart attacks gone up 8 fold in young people I'm glad I never let them jab me with that rubbish.The question people should ask themselves is do you 1000% trust our government if the answer is no then you should never let them put anything in your body.great work Dr keep up the good work
571,fdGj6p2qDdk,"Congratulations on your true endeavors. I'm old enough to remember at a very early age the polio sugar cube to help fight the disease. At that time..we had no fear of an attempt in eradicating the polio virus, no politics involved."
572,fdGj6p2qDdk,"Thank you for saving my mother's life! She was a very high risk person in terms of covid but with the vaccines now I'm not afraid. This is not a fake post, I am not a bad, I'm just a guy living in Switzerland who's glad that his mother is still alive."
573,fdGj6p2qDdk,This is so bizarre. Scripted and fake.
574,fdGj6p2qDdk,"My mother had polio as a teenager, and had to learn to walk again.  She counted Dr. Salk and Dr. Sabin as national heroes for coming up with polio vaccines, saving countless lives and meaning that her kids wouldn't face the same torture she endured, and she wouldn't see her children suffer like she had.  Dr. Kariko and Dr. Weissman should be honored as national heroes, too.  They have saved countless lives, and could have saved more (like my cousin, who gasped out his last breath believing COVID was a hoax) if not for stupid political nonsense."
575,fdGj6p2qDdk,We need more people like them and less people pretending to be important.
576,fdGj6p2qDdk,I am so happy to see  that Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman were appropriately awarded last December!    I am among the millions of grateful Americans who never got covid-19 thanks to their work.
577,fdGj6p2qDdk,"Great people, great story. Sadly, viruses mutate so the battle never ends."
578,fdGj6p2qDdk,"I ended up with mild symptomatic Covid (body aches, muscle weakness, sore throat, etc) but not hospitalized due to these vaccines...thank you for these vaccines. 🎉❤"
579,fdGj6p2qDdk,We should celebrate scientists like this who actually make real contributions to mankind rather than sports heroes and celebrities.
580,fdGj6p2qDdk,They also get credit for Myocarditis.

582,iMx7kmld9sk,"Thank God. Some will be spared.
I took first/only Pf jab and had a heart problem since 4 days later. Then lost my job for not getting the 2nd one. Wish I hadn't given into the pressure at work and just quit instead. Can't get my health back.First thing I did was move from Oregon to Idaho, where old fashioned values still exist. Love the governor and the people. Oregon govt was crazy, just like Washington governor defunding police, etc. So glad to be in a sane state."
583,iMx7kmld9sk,It's about time! This bogus technology should never have been introduced to humans.
584,iMx7kmld9sk,Thank Heavens!! About time SOMEONE speaks up!!
585,iMx7kmld9sk,"YES. YES. YES. YES. YES. YES.
JUSTICE."
586,iMx7kmld9sk,"Why has this only had 1K views?
This should be blasted all over the MSM.
Nice to see it's not just Florida taking a long awaited stance.

588,iMx7kmld9sk,This is fantastic!!
589,iMx7kmld9sk,The proposed law doesn’t go far enough. Anyone administering this poison should be charged with a felony.

591,oMXGGmBfkf8,"Here are the answers to some common questions. Please note that this video is about the scientific basis of mRNA vaccines in general, not about any particular vaccine or manufacturer. This video is not sponsored by anyone and does not represent endorsement of any particular vaccine. The answers below are based on well-known, basic knowledge of mRNA/cell biology and immunology, which can be found in ANY TEXTBOOK. More Q&A may be added later.
Also note: this video was originally intended for our regular audience (med students), so it's more technical. We have a simpler version here: https://youtu.be/XTLYXmgG8DU
For comparison of different vaccines, as well as events of immune response, role of different immune cells (T-cells, B-cells, APC), see this video: https://youtu.be/osRo-yz1VQ8
Q1: How long the mRNA from vaccine will stay in human body? A: mRNA is very unstable, it is easily degraded by enzymes in our cells (RNAses). Average half-life of mRNA in human is around 10 hours. mRNA from vaccine is expected to stay no longer than a day.
Q2: How long the antigen (translated from mRNA vaccine) is expected to stay in our body? A: Several days. Once the immune system is activated, it will see the cells that carry the antigen as damaged and destroy them.
Q3: So from A to Q2, our immune system destroys our own cells, is that bad? A: No. This is the natural way the body detects foreign antigens, just like when an infection occurs – infected cells display pieces of the virus to alert the immune system and get killed. The difference is that you can control the dose with the vaccine, unlike a natural infection. And the vaccine does not multiply. The number of our own cells that will be killed with the vaccine dose is negligible. The effect is also limited to the cells around the injection site. Note that traditional vaccines also work this way: the antigen delivered by a traditional vaccine is also taken up by some of our cells, it is then broken into pieces and displayed on the surface of the cell to be ""seen"" by the immune system. This is the only way for the immune system to detect foreign antigens. The body will replace the lost cells within several days. For more details see this video: https://youtu.be/osRo-yz1VQ8
Q4: So now the immune system will produce the antibodies, will it ever stop? A: It's the same process that happens when there is a natural infection. So, upon infection or vaccination, antibodies will take a couple of weeks to be produced, the level will peak for about a couple more weeks and then it will go down, no more production. But now the body remembers the virus because some memory cells are left - when you encounter the real virus these cells will produce antibodies again, this time instantly in response – so fast that no infection will occur. If the body does not encounter the virus then, no antibodies will be produced.
Q5: How about side effects? A: All vaccines have side effects, mRNA or traditional. The list of side effects should be available online or at any location that offers the vaccine.
Q6: How mRNA gets into cells? A: It is delivered in lipid covering that will fuse with cell membrane (also consists of lipids) - it's called endocytosis.
Q7: Is this gene therapy? A: No, gene therapy involves replacing your gene with a new one, this vaccine does not touch your genes.
Q8: Can mRNA vaccine change my DNA? See full A in this video: https://youtu.be/XTLYXmgG8DU
Q9: I had COVID and recovered, do I still need the vaccine? A: You probably do not need the vaccine if your infection was recent, at least for now. The question remains is how long natural immunity will last, and how long protection by vaccine will last, we do not yet know the answers. UPDATE: 1 dose of mRNA vaccine in people with previous infection works as well as 2 doses in people without previous infection. Basically: previous infection gives the same immunity as 1 dose of mRNA vaccine."
592,oMXGGmBfkf8,I got pfizer biontech shot today i can alredystart speaking german.
593,oMXGGmBfkf8,"Hey there, nice video, detailed and understandable. When the antigen is displayed on our own cells where it is recognized by the immune system 0:54 I would like to know what will happens as the immune system will start fighting our own cells with this new antigen display on its surface. It might be that the antigen are just release outside the cell, not causing the LT to attack the cells but only the antigen ?
And also if you have time, how does the vaccine target specific cells and will not spread in your body to integrate mRNA in cells like neurons. Thanks :)"
594,oMXGGmBfkf8,Where can we see the list of ingredients (active and inactive) utilized to create the vaccine ?
595,oMXGGmBfkf8,So how does the message sequence stop the spike protein from repeating process multiple times and what is the estimated time sequence remains in manufacturing mode?
596,oMXGGmBfkf8,"Love the vid! Just have a question and im sorry if i sound dumb. Can the cells with the rna of the vaccine still work as usual? For example, if we are altering how the cell detects foreign agents can the immune response to other diseases get  weaker or slower? Thx!"
597,oMXGGmBfkf8,What about the part that it causes myocarditis
598,oMXGGmBfkf8,"It is very well done. Sound correct to me with the bio class I had. I had crazy hyper motivate teacher. It is sad that gov take for granted our willing to get this and no time to explain how it works like you do. Your comment section is gold for more precise info. I will do more research but you vid is by far the best one that not trigger my education from my old teacher.
Edit for grammar"
599,oMXGGmBfkf8,"2:53 when the codons are optimized to avoid recognition, how can they be translated correctly to create the right protein?"
600,oMXGGmBfkf8,Would people with histamine intolerance have strong reactions to mRNA vaccines?
601,M-7nUxImA18,That's scary. The little kids lined up for their shots. Yet mom and dad couldn't get him to clean up their room. It's amazing the government holds more power than mom and dad nowadays with children

607,M-7nUxImA18,"I’m so happy my parents care for me and give me the vaccine every year or so, i could have had parents who refuse to vaccinate me, but they make sure I’m safe :)"
608,M-7nUxImA18,"👎

its just rarely documented"
622,I3kd5SyYHEE,"""Myocarditis is SIMPLY inflammation of the heart muscle."" Nice bit of fobbing off there, like it's nothing."
623,I3kd5SyYHEE,The side affects are NOT minor or RARE. It can and has been life Ending.
624,I3kd5SyYHEE,It's so rare you only hear about it daily.
625,I3kd5SyYHEE,The music they put in the background to make this seem like a lighthearted issue is media gaslighting at its finest
626,I3kd5SyYHEE,Not rare when it happens to you.
627,I3kd5SyYHEE,a coworker got the second Pfizer shot and he had a really bad case of myocarditis... 8 months now.. he can't work anymore.. he can barely walk around the house.... and Pfizer is not liable..... GREAT HUH????
628,I3kd5SyYHEE,"I'm a 30 year old woman, I got the Pfizer vaccine back in September. After the second dose,  I actually had heart pain and pressure. It's sporadic and comes and goes with weeks in between, but it's worrying. I can't say I blame people for not wanting to get vaccinated, just be sure to look after yourself. There are times I regret getting it, because my heart was fine before."
629,I3kd5SyYHEE,"I’m glad I’ve been anti 💉 since pre Covid years. I do not regret my decision at all. My kids, my husband, my father in law, and myself are healthy as can be. My FILs both brothers got the jab and boosters and both had strokes. We tried to warn people and were called conspiracy theorists. But every single day I see crap like this that makes me not regret my decision. All I can tell y’all… us conspiracy theorists TOLD YOU SO."
630,I3kd5SyYHEE,"It is really common! Just check each countries' sudden, unexplained deaths. Or even heart attacks to young people."
631,10OXhm_rIEs,I served for twenty six years in the army and I can't for the life of me could explain why someone should join now with the current state of our military leadership.
632,10OXhm_rIEs,This is what happens when politics interferes in military needs and soldier status.
633,10OXhm_rIEs,1000% if the Army met its numbers this wouldn’t even be a topic of discussion
634,10OXhm_rIEs,The Government destroyed careers families and soldiers and now wants them back??? Tell them to go to hell!

651,yhECkm16AGU,A good thing about being called a conspiracy theorist is not having myocarditis 🤷‍♂️
652,yhECkm16AGU,"The CDC didn't Fail, they accomplished exactly what they wanted."
653,yhECkm16AGU,Bri gets awfully quiet once she realizes this narrative isn't going her way.
654,yhECkm16AGU,What’s the difference between the truth and a conspiracy theory? About six months.
655,yhECkm16AGU,Refusing the covid vaccine was one of my best decisions ever.
656,yhECkm16AGU,The whole thing has been a crime against humanity.
657,yhECkm16AGU,Bri is so deep in her vaccine defense stance she just can’t stand to hear truth
658,yhECkm16AGU,Bri looked devastated by the news.   She may have to come to terms with spreading MISinformation.
659,yhECkm16AGU,"BRIE, THE ATHLETES COLLAPSING ARE NOT OBESE 😉"
660,yhECkm16AGU,"Yes Brianna, you were lied to. At this point though, you're only lying to yourself. Acknowledge the truth and grow from it."
661,sJhQLdH8Zxc,GO WOODY!!! Everybody should be talking about this if they want their freedom and if they want to 'LIVE'
662,sJhQLdH8Zxc,"Funny how 69% is Americans are vaccinated - but 80% received ONE or more dose. My mom had a severe reaction after the first covid vaccine and had to go to hospital- they said if she got second she might die. My gf’s periods STOPPED after she was mandated by her college to get both. My coworkers mother (in her 60’s post menopausal) started bleeding again after the covid vaccines. There’s something in the vaccines that is negatively affecting people and if some want to bury their head in the sand about it, I can empathize with why bc it’s scary to think about bc a large majority of people have this poison inside them. It probably angers them to know they were fooled and no body wants to hear that but you can only ignore the data for so long. Praying for all those affected to be okay. I’m sorry our government did this to us. May God help the people see truth and may good overcome evil"
663,sJhQLdH8Zxc,"What ""conspiracy theory""? It literally happened.  We were all there. We all lived through it."
664,sJhQLdH8Zxc,You are literally proving his point

667,sJhQLdH8Zxc,How much is pharma paying you to label his speech as a conspiracy theory?
668,sJhQLdH8Zxc,RIP to the people that actually thought the Covid vaccines are safe and effective.
669,sJhQLdH8Zxc,Go Woody!  Someone has to wake these asleep sheep up
670,sJhQLdH8Zxc,I identify as a conspiracist. My pro nouns.  I/told you /so
671,pp-nPZETLTo,Thank the Lord for Dr Peter McCullough
672,pp-nPZETLTo,It has been a year. Would you consider creating an update on this discussion?
673,pp-nPZETLTo,Please consider revisiting this conversation a year later!!
674,pp-nPZETLTo,I'd like to hear an update 1 year later on the scientific literature sited on this podcast
675,pp-nPZETLTo,"My 42 year old Son was admitted to hospital Feb/2021 for low oxygen, spent a week in ICU, tested negative for COVID, under went many tests. Two months later was put on life support, treated for pneumonia, negative covid, sent to cardiology for treatment and more testing. Aug/21 hospitalized, on ventilator for lack of oxygen, again treated for pneumonia, negative for covid. Upon release was denied oxygen for home for lack of affordability.  He had received two Pyzer  covid shots, one in Mar/21 and second May21. He passed away Dec21, told that autopsy didn't show covid"
676,pp-nPZETLTo,"I experienced several AEs listed on the Pfizer documents (which a judge forced them to share). Whatever happened to informed consent? Had I known of the risks, I would not have gotten the shots. I was healthy, on no prescription meds prior to the shots. My guess is those who are v-injured are under reported because MDs are not reporting to VAERs and/or encouraged not to do so."
677,pp-nPZETLTo,"My father was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in February of 2021, they immediately tried to push the jab on him, I explained it like I was talking to a child because dad has brain damage from a stroke, I talked him out of taking that shit all together and I guarantee if I hadn't dad wouldn't be alive still today, and they had also gave him 6 months to live"
678,pp-nPZETLTo,"Whatever happened to ""herd immunity"" ? That's never discussed anymore."
679,pp-nPZETLTo,Hello! I am one of the few unfortunate people who has had serious adverse effects from the Moderna Covid vaccine. Most of them are neurological in nature now. Prior to the vaccine I had no health issues. I have been trying to get medical care for 10 weeks and the medical community just looks at me blankly. Can you direct me to any resources that could help?
680,pp-nPZETLTo,They were pretty wrong

691,3RIAptushYw,I am so suprised there are still people getting vaccinated.
692,3RIAptushYw,“Haaaaaa you’re all going to laugh so hard when you find out Roseann’s right”  I’m laughing now. 🤣🤣🤣
693,3RIAptushYw,"When people start taking medical advice from celebrities and politicians, that's a huge problem.  Politicians know nothing, and celebrities know even less."
694,3RIAptushYw,Roseanne is correct
695,3RIAptushYw,"Rosanne - ""THE BILLIONAIRES ARE KILLING US!!!""

Then let's tax the rich?

Rosanne - ""NOOOO!!!!!!!!"""
696,3RIAptushYw,"Moans about ’billionaires’, worships someone who pretends to be one…"
697,3RIAptushYw,She's right about this. Friends are dropping like flies 😞
698,3RIAptushYw,"I honestly didn't think my opinion of Bill Maher could sink any lower, but using Bernie Sanders as an insult against this lunatic is honestly shocking."
699,3RIAptushYw,My grandfather died 1 week after getting the shot. That is enough for me. I have not received the shot nor has my wife & child & we are fine.
700,3RIAptushYw,"As a child of 5 or 6, I noticed how angry and stupid many adults were at times. I developed a fear that I could not describe at that age. The fear was that a wave of anger driven stupidity could reach a critical mass."
701,kXANPk6nUGk,"And I thought it's the patient who should share his experience after taking the jab i.e. how he feels,  any reaction etc. But here its opposite the vaccine administrators are sharing their experience that how do they feel after injecting vaccine."
702,kXANPk6nUGk,Doctor are really god ka roop hote h..🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳jai hind jai bharat....
703,kXANPk6nUGk,Thinking you will be safe after taking a Covid 19 vaccine is as equal as thinking that your life will be happy after getting married. So i will advice to continue taking precautions like wearing masks and using sanitizers
704,kXANPk6nUGk,He is the true leader. Our country is in better position just because of him. Thank you 🌹🙏 Prime Minister.
705,kXANPk6nUGk,"Tell that to show the injection needle whether it is pricking in the body or not, remove the hand first."
706,kXANPk6nUGk,KGF 😍🥰👌
707,kXANPk6nUGk,"Great to see the Prime Minister setting an example....
1) He waited till he became eligible as per the protocol
2) He visited a public hospital and did not call a team to his residence
3) He demonstrated his belief in vaccination and in an Indian vaccine
4) He gave a stern message to the political class on the first day not to jump the protocol....in many countries the politicians have cornered the initial vaccine supplies"
708,kXANPk6nUGk,"I checked likes and dislikes on this video.
It assured me that people of India are in right direction."
709,kXANPk6nUGk,So happy that you are safe now🥺
710,kXANPk6nUGk,"Hindustan times- humble request please change background music.
It's quite scary.😁"
711,Ph6wsRHMbQo,"Be honest, if a healthy person takes a foreign injection and then suddenly dies it doesn’t take Sherlock Holmes to know the reason why."
712,Ph6wsRHMbQo,"First they disabled the dislikes to hide the truth... next will be the comment section.

Keep spreading the LIGHT through these manufactured dark times...

I love you all. ☀️❤"
713,Ph6wsRHMbQo,My great grandmother just turned 104 years old this January and she made it very clear when the vaccine was released to not to take the poison. I'll go with her suggestion.
714,Ph6wsRHMbQo,If you know someone who died after being vaccinated that tells you everything you need to know
715,Ph6wsRHMbQo,"My coworker just lost his wife a but over a week after they got a third shot. They were perfectly healthy and only mid-thirties. She'd said she felt short of breath. Her heart stopped while she was asleep. 
Most of my friends and coworkers are un-vaxxed, got covid, and only a few had it rough. All recovered."
716,Ph6wsRHMbQo,Yes. It happened to my friends aunt. I’ve never seen so much gaslighting in my life.
717,Ph6wsRHMbQo,"In my small circle I know of 3 fully vaxxed who now have heart conditions, 1 who has sudden cancer, 1 who is having menstrual issues, 1 who was hospitalized with blood clots in his lungs and two who had weird reactions in their extremities following the injection. Can we at least pause and stop sweeping this under the rug.🙏"
718,Ph6wsRHMbQo,"When it hits your own family, you believe. Until then, no one can tell you. RIP , my brother Mikel."
719,Ph6wsRHMbQo,"We believe you guys, every word. The media has been so transparent and honest throughout this whole thing. Sure thing bud."
720,Ph6wsRHMbQo,"I never got vaccinated, I got Covid 3 times. I had chronic asthma and my Doctor told me if I didn’t get vaccinated I was going to die. I have never felt so great in my 40 years of chronic asthma till now, I have not used my inhaler for the last 11 months. I trust God and I knew that I didn’t need to get vaccinated or probably won’t be here to tell my blessings."
721,LVKSBHhGmDc,"A dummy coworker of mine lined up for her 4th shot, and says once the new shot comes out, she'll get the fifth. She's 50 and can barely walk now. She was fine before the jabs. There's no cure for stupidity."
722,LVKSBHhGmDc,A moment of silence for to those who let the government dictate their lives
723,LVKSBHhGmDc,One of the most profound “I told you so” moments in history
724,LVKSBHhGmDc,I'm unvaxxed and haven't had covid in almost two years. Thanks immune system 😊
725,LVKSBHhGmDc,A moment of silence for all those who played themselves.
726,LVKSBHhGmDc,"Never wore a mask, never stayed home and still unvaccinated. I was 100% guaranteed to die because I didn't play along but 3 years later I'm aok"
727,LVKSBHhGmDc,"I guess the ""conspiracy theorists"" and ""science deniers"" were right huh 😏"
728,LVKSBHhGmDc,NOT getting the CLOT SHOT (even when my employer was threatening to fire me) was one of the smartest things I've ever done (or NOT done!). I am so glad God gave me COMMON SENSE and the ability to think for myself!!!!
729,LVKSBHhGmDc,"Blood clots from the first
Heart attack  on the second
Facial  Paralysis  on the third
Leg amputated  on the forth
 
People are like

Yay can't wait to get my 5th one 
It would have been so much worse if it wasn't  for the jab."
730,LVKSBHhGmDc,"The town I live in is very behind the news and jabs; everybody on my block got their jabs, and sadly, no one but me seems to realize what's going on. Almost every house on my block has had someone pass just days or a couple weeks after getting it. The same with the entire neighborhood. The last person I begged not to get the jab passed within a week. And one day, I visited a family on my block and they were all grey-colored and said they felt sick. I asked them if they had just gotten the jab and they said they did the day before. It was truly a horrifying sight to see. I hope people read this now because it will most likely get deleted. That's the world we live in now and I'm so sad for it. Wake up, everyone😔"
731,pCr_eo3pH7c,A new study shows that 100% of scientists agree with whoever is funding them.
732,pCr_eo3pH7c,When will The Hill apologize to all of us and Kim for not allowing her to interview Fauci with the questions we all wanted to ask yet now they have no issues doing segments like this?
733,pCr_eo3pH7c,Brie just can’t get over how bad she got Covid wrong
734,pCr_eo3pH7c,The social media companies who blocked information that turns out to be valid need to be held accountable.
735,pCr_eo3pH7c,"""Non-birthing persons milk is just as healthy birthing persons milk!"" Trust the science 😂"
736,pCr_eo3pH7c,"Trusting science, and trusting scientists is not the same thing."
737,pCr_eo3pH7c,"We followed the science and it simply wasn't there, we then followed the money and found the science."
738,pCr_eo3pH7c,"Bri, talking about how important it is to encourage scientific literacy after she actively participated in the throes of COVID at castigating and demonizing those who chose not to get vaccinated is rich..."
739,pCr_eo3pH7c,Has Brie apologised yet for being a flag waver for the jab - how many followed her advice😢
740,pCr_eo3pH7c,Reminder. Obama reversed his own ban on gain of function research 10 days before leaving office.
741,p42FmUNULWg,The fact a doctor does not want vaccine speaks volumes. 😮
742,p42FmUNULWg,"“The vaccine should be tested on politicians first.  If they survive, the vaccine is safe.  
If they don’t, then the country is safe.”
—  Monika Wisniewska
………"
743,p42FmUNULWg,This man deserves a nobel prize.
744,p42FmUNULWg,"I’ll still never forgive those who demonized people for not having the ‘Jab.’

— ThomasKing"
745,p42FmUNULWg,The smartest among us refused.
746,p42FmUNULWg,"So many doctors didn’t want this 😢
Our medical system needs to be renamed more accurately to ‘our pharmaceutical system’."
747,p42FmUNULWg,This Dr needs a massive raise.
748,p42FmUNULWg,"Medication so dangerous, doctors sacrifice their entire career to avoid it."
749,p42FmUNULWg,"They should not be able to force anyone to inject anything into their bodies.  If a doctor feels that going to these lengths to keep his job, and doesn't feel the vaccine he is being told he must take is safe why force him?  Why not give him the choice,  and respect his decision, especially when he is a doctor? 
Stripping him of his ability to carry on treating his patients, comes across as more sinister than if he doesnt take it he is a public health risk."
750,p42FmUNULWg,This why I didn’t take it and never will I knew I was right
751,V9Z325DYJJc,To all my unvaxxed brethren out there: HOLD THE LINE!
752,V9Z325DYJJc,Gaslighting at its best
753,V9Z325DYJJc,"I love to hear him give his expert opinion on 84% increase in heart attacks from 0 to 49 year olds in Florida, He sure as hell can't start it off with they were old. LMAO wake up America"
754,V9Z325DYJJc,Every time I see ‘Fact Check’ on one of these news outlets I always think “Damage Control”….
755,V9Z325DYJJc,"What's the most appropriate name for this: scamdemic, feardemic, or plandemic?"
756,V9Z325DYJJc,The real question would be how the chart would look like if you compare the vaxxed to the unvaxxed in the same age group. That would really clear the debate. But there's a reason why they don't show you that. Isn't it so?
757,V9Z325DYJJc,Anytime I see “fact checked” I know it’s a lie coming next.
758,V9Z325DYJJc,"But if the vaccine worked, even the old shouldn't be dying. In fact, the whole point of the vaccination warning was mostly for the vulnerable old people. The old people were ALWAYS the ones who died at the higher rate, even before we had a vaccine, and we see now that that is STILL the case."
759,V9Z325DYJJc,"“We’ll be right back after a word from our sponsors.”

Cuts to a Pfizer commercial.  LoL"
760,V9Z325DYJJc,These people deserve capitol punishment for pushing this on humanity
761,uZPGZ2mf4g4,I ignore everything the CDC says lol
762,uZPGZ2mf4g4,My own 2cents:  Stick with the same Mfr. you had for the initial shot. Mix and Match is really a reckless approach in terms of monitoring the vaccines independently going forward. It was really a mistake for the CDC to message that.
763,uZPGZ2mf4g4,And they are the ones who need it the most
764,uZPGZ2mf4g4,I got Moderna and am not getting a booster shot yet. This is because I tested my antibody levels and still have strong antibody levels 6 months after getting the second Moderna shot.
765,zBObkBFMcyo,"OMG, I can't believe someone is finally saying this on live TV, in public. Finally.  I'm in shock."
766,zBObkBFMcyo,Mandating a vaccine for which the manufacturers take no responsibility is reprehensible IMO.  Where there is risk there must always be choice.
767,zBObkBFMcyo,VERY MISLEADING QUESTION- Vivek is exactly right about the origins of protection for big pharmaceutical companies.
768,zBObkBFMcyo,I have been waiting for years now for normies to wake and realize just what their government has done to them. And to their children. The depth and breadth of criminality here is unprecedented.
769,zBObkBFMcyo,Vivek went into fiery beast mode and left them all speechless. This guy is smarter than all of the combined IQs on that stage.
770,zBObkBFMcyo,The man is very intelligent and articulates extremely well. Pharma companies making billions with no culpability is absolutely insane.    The corruption reeks.
771,zBObkBFMcyo,"The moderators were cutting off Vivek every single time he spoke. You could hear them say okay, it's time, your time is up in his midsentence all the time. At one time, they asked question after question and then followed up with another question to""Irrelevant Christie"" just not ask Vivek a question because he was next in line.If you watched the debate, one could see that like daylight."

797,Mdr2rLWGXiE,Helping our body to naturally cure cancer is a wonderful approach.  I hope this saves many lives
798,Mdr2rLWGXiE,"very encouraging to hear.
I find cancer is a scarry word. I know too many people whose lives are in limbo far too young. My colleague's girlfriend (2 younge kids) is battling breast cancer at 34 for over a year now and she's not out of the woods yet. This isn't a fight she should be fighting; she should be enjoying her two young daughters, and instead, she's worried she won't see another year. This always happens to the best of us humans too.

anyway...I'm hoping this forges new paths that ensures kids and young adults don't leave us before they can enjoy a full life."
799,Mdr2rLWGXiE,This is what humanity should be working on instead of constantly fighting.

803,Mdr2rLWGXiE,I would have loved to have seen a complete cure but I wont live long enough. I am 64 and I highly doubt I will get to see it. I am so grateful they are getting closer. I wonder if they are still using the polio trials. I watched my Mother die when she was 50. I still get sad sometimes. It was the suffering.
804,Mdr2rLWGXiE,Doesn’t cancer have way too many mutations within one tumor to even target properly??

808,2IXQwVB8-ig,Well done to all of us who had the intellect to refuse the poison
809,2IXQwVB8-ig,Well done that man. 👍
810,2IXQwVB8-ig,We don’t need a inquiry we need a trial!
811,2IXQwVB8-ig,Never regreted not getting the vaccine.

818,40eZeXPyJ0g,"The person scrolling down through the comments, have a nice day"

822,40eZeXPyJ0g,"That woman knows how to take anything with anyone who will get her up there. That's why they call her.....""Heels up Harris"" lol"
823,40eZeXPyJ0g,Whenever she speaks one is reminded of why she got zero delegates in the Dem primaries and was one of the first candidates to fail and drop out....Tulsi exposed her horrible record as attorney in SF.

I had a close friend that died recently.  She was a fitness competitor.  In her prime and incredibly healthy.  She had no prior health concerns.  Fast forward to post ""covid prevention method"" She began experiencing extreme leg pain.  Her legs began to rapidly swell up.  She went into the hospital, where the clotting continued to get worse.  The doctors had no answers.  The only option was to amputate her legs from the hip down.  After the procedure, she died of a heart attack soon after.  In no way, shape or form was she sick with covid.  

This isn't the only story."
874,h6potmDg0ek,"Doctors tried to amputate my friend’s leg from the hip due to clotting.. she didn’t allow it, neither from the knee or the ankle or the toes each time those “butchers” tried to convince her it was life and death. Years later she sill has her legs thanks to not complying."

906,0UHCFPDhrEI,Thank God there are still people out there who can  think for themselves and not let mainstream media do it for them.
907,0UHCFPDhrEI,This aged beautifully…
908,0UHCFPDhrEI,"Vaccine or no vaccine, everyone is taking a risk. People should just mind their own business."
909,0UHCFPDhrEI,"The longer I have worked in the health field as an RN the more skeptical I am with ""Experts""."
910,0UHCFPDhrEI,They should do a documentary on severely injured patients from the vaccine and the percentage then
911,0UHCFPDhrEI,I appreciate these women being honest. There’s so much fear about speaking out against mandates. It’s terrible
912,czITyiW9a5I,Tôi 34 tuổi ko tiêm mũi vác xin nào cả. Mắc bệnh 3 lần vẫn ko sao. Ngày đó đang đi làm xin nghỉ làm luôn để ở nhà ko phải tiêm

918,Yd1P-NnvkOA,Just forge one.  Is not worth it getting it
919,Yd1P-NnvkOA,Reporter has an unnecessary loud mouth!
920,RWDXEsgU3pE,Dude read the conspiracy websites and wanted free 5G internet 😂
921,RWDXEsgU3pE,How does the medical profession even allow that to happen.
922,RWDXEsgU3pE,I’ll ask the hard question. Why?
923,RWDXEsgU3pE,"Why is it that nobody realized this? Normally, when you get a shot, it should be registered in a national data bank, or not so?"
924,RWDXEsgU3pE,He should have been arrested and charged for vaccine waste. While lots of people had to wait weeks to get a shot he was getting one every week. Selfishness.
925,RWDXEsgU3pE,"In a way, this seems to strongly support the safety of the vaccines he took."
926,RWDXEsgU3pE,I wonder what 200 shots of Ivermectin or Bleach would do?  Maybe a trump supporter would like to show us.
927,RWDXEsgU3pE,Lol. That dudes never getting covid.
928,RWDXEsgU3pE,The worst that could happen is ingesting too much of the preservative ingredient and trust me you ingest more preservatives from food that comes in the grocery store than he did.
929,RWDXEsgU3pE,I wouldn't believe this if it becomes notarized.
930,Vgu1bkZC49s,"I want to say to everyone who didn't get vaccinated, total respect to you for standing up against the system."
931,Vgu1bkZC49s,"He states that the man will be ""compensated"".  There is no compensation.  This poison should never have been forced on the public in the first place!"
932,Vgu1bkZC49s,Lets not forget Sunak bought shares in Moderna before the Government signed a multi million pound contract with the company.
933,Vgu1bkZC49s,"This was not a scandal, it was done on purpose. They knew what they were doing. You should be waking up."
934,Vgu1bkZC49s,"The journalist who had the hide to call this person an anti-vaxer should be made to show why he should continue to be employed. Further, he should be made to publicly apologise to this man especially as his comments were public as well"
935,Vgu1bkZC49s,How could a vaccine injured person be anti vaxxer?
936,Vgu1bkZC49s,Its not a scandal ITS the biggest crime against humanity
937,Vgu1bkZC49s,"Rishi Sunak, the leader of the Tory Party that expelled Andrew Bridgen MP from the party last year for raising concerns about the vax in parliament. The very parliament that couldn't be bothered to attend two subsequent debates by Mr Bridgen on the safety of this drug."
938,Vgu1bkZC49s,I've been to 7 funerals in 15mths. Every person who died was under 60. Many at these funerals were talking about the elephant in the room and were scared as they had taken the juice. I hadn't but didn't feel superior or more intelligent. I just felt sad and upset that the bastards had reduced us to this. Decent friends and family dying when they were told they were doing the right thing.
939,Vgu1bkZC49s,"It has not saved many lives, it has ruined them"
940,IS3kQYcKSeY,"India has broken record of fastest vaccine production thanks to our pharmacy workers, scientists and QUAD who gave soft loans to Indian companies.❤️"
941,IS3kQYcKSeY,"To maintain international relations , such acts are very much appreciated and have optimal importance.

950,2Ruq3o7iZho,"Incidentally enough, the first two times in YEARS I've ovulated (I have PCOS), were directly after shots one and two. Second time, I got pregnant ;) Currently percolating twins!"
951,2Ruq3o7iZho,"I’ve decided to try for medical school again, after 2 failed attempts and nearly 10 years since my undergraduate studies! You inspired me. Also a momma, hopefully soon to be doctor. ❤️❤️❤️

Edit: Wow I am so touched at this response, thank you for the support. MCAT number 3 scheduled for April 2022, if I get in I will start in the fall of 2023! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼"
952,2Ruq3o7iZho,"LOVE seeing you discuss actual epidemiological data, I'm learning about this in my first semester of veterinary school, I face similar challenges when I discuss vaccine risk with my clients! Thank you for spreading evidence-based medical knowledge with a sympathetic and digestible message!"
953,2Ruq3o7iZho,Never thought I would see a science experience on pregnant women.
954,2Ruq3o7iZho,"When I got my first shot I had a sore arm, of course, and a bit of a headache, and I was EXHAUSTED. The rest of it cleared up, but the exhaustion only lessened a bit. Which is when I realized I was about five weeks pregnant. LOL! Turns out baby was more to blame for the exhaustion than the vaccine was."
955,2Ruq3o7iZho,"Just had the weirdest realization when she was talking about the placenta. My body has the ability to not only create new human life,  but a whole new organ outside the fetus as well. Never thought about it. And I've given birth twice!  🤯"
956,2Ruq3o7iZho,Pfizer jabbed during pregnancy and jabbed while breastfeeding. No side effects for myself or my newborn. We are all healthy.
957,2Ruq3o7iZho,"The vaccines completely messed up my periods. Really badly! I started bleeding randomly during periods, had up to 12 days periods, changing 5 pads in 3 hours and consistently getting my periods way to soon. I thought id never be able to get pregnant anymore with this mess. I went to a doctor to check if I had other pbs that coincided with the vaccines and that was not the case. Anyways, 6 months later.. surprise pregnancy. Totally happy about the baby and more than ready for it, but I was really concerned about the period changes. No booster for me anymore before i have a clear explanation for what happened."
958,2Ruq3o7iZho,"I’m happy to see this I got both of my Covid shots back in I believe March and I recently found out I’m pregnant with my 5th child even though my 4 children are grown up and I’m a grandmother,  this little one came very unexpectedly and honestly if I didn’t watch your shows and decide to take a pregnancy test I probably would’ve been on the show I didn’t know I was pregnant!!  because I’m 26 weeks and I had no clue once I got my Covid shot I never recovered I was constantly throwing up thinking well I ever recover from getting the shot, and I also have crazy periods so i didn’t think absolutely anything of pregnancy ,  the only thing I noticed was I was overly emotional constantly crying to the point my eyes have psoriasis, so I said I should take a test and call the doctors sure enough we have a blessing on the way 🤰🏻 even though I have to learn all over again what to buy what the baby needs because it’s been so long 😊 like I said my kids are all grown up graduated . so my fear was when I received the Covid shot did I harm my baby , I won’t know till next week till I receive my first ultrasound , it’s been a fear of mine i was thinking did I cause harm birth defects and all of this has helped me . so just wanted to say thank you so much for all your videos and knowledge you have made me feel so much better and also helped me not be on the show I didn’t know I was pregnant!!! LOL again thank you"
959,2Ruq3o7iZho,"Thank you so much for not attacking the misinformed. Since I'm not high risk and I had almost no symptoms when I got covid in 2020 I decided to wait until the vaccine was 100% fda approved, although I was still pretty nervous about getting it. Your video has given me more peace about getting vaccinated this Friday and I'm excited to share your information with friends who are concerned about the fertility aspect of things. Thank you so much for not attacking me for having concerns, but for educating me and reassuring me instead!"
960,szyW6XdufBU,"Please consult your doctor if you are experiencing any issue/symptom after getting your Covid-19 vaccine shot.  

What are some common ailments after vaccination? : https://www.mohfw.gov.in/covid_vaccination/vaccination/common-side-effects-aefi.html"
961,szyW6XdufBU,"29, male, didn't want the jab but was coerced by my employer & I had just had covid & got over it naturally. Got part 1 & 2 of the Pfizer shot 10 months ago. I've had this weird lump under my left arm in my armpit that I noticed after getting the jab, I get weird pains in my chest near my heart, weird random pains in my legs & constantly feel tired. I will NEVER forgive & forget the people who pushed this shit on the rest of us."
962,szyW6XdufBU,"These are describing just a few of my long term side effects from the stupid shots over a year ago. But I live in the United States surrounded by Vanderbilt facilities, and the 1st thing they suggest if you think that you have side effects is that you get your vaccine updated and get mental health help because ""we're delusional"".
 There is no way for us to get help in the United States."
963,szyW6XdufBU,"i get alot of these most noticable is the blurry vision, weird chest things, numbing of arms or legs."
964,szyW6XdufBU,"My symptoms after taking 1st dose of covishield/oxford vaccine was:
1) Fatigue for 3-5 days. Body felt warm. Eyes heavy. No strength to walk. Just wanted sleep.
2) some strange feeling in the chest/blood pressure. The feeling I couldn't explain. Like someone was turning my system on and off.

I took my dose on 9th Oct. I still feel weird today. I took paracetamol for the first week every night. I'm a guy who works with power tools whole day. It's what I love to do instead of hitting the bottle. I felt tired but i never took a day off. I don't feel like taking the 2nd shot. People around me have already got their second and now the govt is considering a third or even a forth. I think its all a scam because the vaccine is in an incomplete stage."
965,szyW6XdufBU,The question is what to do if someone has these symptoms
966,szyW6XdufBU,I had a stroke after getting the shot. My life is ruined... What am I suppose to do now? No attorney will take my case...
967,szyW6XdufBU,Mom age is 60 first dose of covisheild  after 10 day still weakness nd  dullness what should I do
968,szyW6XdufBU,My left lung feels heavy and I got vaccine 1 month ago
969,szyW6XdufBU,"I got vaccinated last month (AstraZeneca) but now i am suffering from limb pain and numbness in hands.
P.s : i have thyroid problem and Pcos but never before the vaccination i have felt this kind of pain"

973,qWI0YiSmTKs,I was having a bad day and came back to view the key sticking lady. I’m feeling a lot better now thank you 😊
974,qWI0YiSmTKs,Ahhh I see.. That's why I kept getting drawn back to my fridge. I thought I was just hungry.

978,qWI0YiSmTKs,Sticking stuff to yourself is a gag I've been doing since high school. It isn't magnetism but sweat.

982,TW5BttKUlZo,"I love the part where she does housework in high heels in a brand new, unused house 😂"
983,TW5BttKUlZo,That is so obviously not the same person.
984,TW5BttKUlZo,The fact that her husband changed his marital status to single is enough proof that she is no longer with us
985,TW5BttKUlZo,I didn't know the Covid vaccine can turn you into a different person.
986,TW5BttKUlZo,Finally after two years they found a doppelganger
987,TW5BttKUlZo,"So how did you avoid being candidly photographed for the last 2+ years while being ""alive and well"" and working at CHI, while being world-famous for being missing? Not possible."
988,TW5BttKUlZo,"So we're just supposed to forget the hospital used a mute, masked, obviously not Tiffany Dover nurse to try to convince us she was alive?

Chile, please."
989,TW5BttKUlZo,After seeing this I’m now more inclined to get my 17th booster 😊 thank you nbc

1000,AeXgV7k4AIk,Throwing 100 million doses away? No ones taking the shots? This is great news! Every shot thrown away is a life saved
1001,AeXgV7k4AIk,India is one of the only nations to actually LEARN from watching the data on these vaccines. Very wise people.
1002,AeXgV7k4AIk,Tremendous move 👏.  All other countries should follow their lead. And dump gates with it.
1003,AeXgV7k4AIk,"100 million lives saved India by dumping the clot shots...well played India, well played!"

1007,AeXgV7k4AIk,"THANK YOU INDIA FOR YOUR HELP DURING PANDEMIC, love from Bhutan 😊"
1008,AeXgV7k4AIk,The US won't throw it away they will just add it to the hundreds of ingredients that we already have in our processed foods. Not kidding.
1009,AeXgV7k4AIk,INDIA has got the message!!!!👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼

1019,JhfrBLQIVCs,This is a sad story for sure. They should also air stories like this of people who die from the seasonal flu. Their deaths have all but disappeared in the media.

1022,wosyaWiDR2U,I had a bad reaction to my first Moderna vaccine .   Doctors were not only unhelpful but could care less.  I went through 6 weeks of physical therapy due to intense dizzy spells.  Then said I should go ahead and get the second shot . No thanks.
1023,wosyaWiDR2U,Why am I not surprised that he tried to point the blame in another direction
1024,wosyaWiDR2U,"2 people passed in my family one after 2 dose , 1 after 15 days of first shot, both were healthy prior vaccination"
1025,wosyaWiDR2U,"Of course we can’t blame the “vaccine” but it’s ok to  blame the dead victim.

1032,J03kE18zUhs,Y'all keep trusting these people with your health

1034,J03kE18zUhs,I’d rather get covid than bell palsy or myocarditis… a friend of mine died from AstraZeneca and another hospitalised with myocarditis from Pfizer… I lost my job because I said no to the vax but I have no regrets.

1047,DEx1GuqAwPk,Those who didn't take booster shot you have God's blessing. I took it and I've been having issues with my health since. I made such a mistake
1048,DEx1GuqAwPk,"I am 37 years old, after taking first, second and booster dose of Covishield I am experiencing lots of health issues, energy level lowered down, often suffering by fever, cough, body ache, pain in waist & leg, palpitation etc. Other member of my family also suffering with multiple ailments. I never experienced such illnesses before taking this vaccine."

1057,VHCQ3cM02DQ,She didn't even ensure there was no air or air bubbles in the syringe first. Joe must be immune to air bubbles in the blood.

1067,o2HLkFi4Qtw,I think the most important thing you shouldn't do after getting the vaccine is to expect that you are going to be immune or protected! I think they forgot to mention that one.
1068,o2HLkFi4Qtw,Thanks for the post handy and informative video my family members had 3 doses or vaccinations. We felt normal as usual and everyday routine continuous as always. I workout at the gym as usual 5 times a week no problemo👌 medical student Malaysia 👍

1130,nhb1zIYXUP8,Is she really ok? Why isn't someone so passionate about the vaccine coming back on camera to tell everyone it's safe?
1131,nhb1zIYXUP8,"It was done safely and “CORRECTLY” that’s why she fainted, if it was done incorrectly she would’ve been just fine."
1132,nhb1zIYXUP8,Strange how there is no footage of her 'back on her feet'.. 'moments later'.
1133,nhb1zIYXUP8,"This seems suspicious that they would allow a nurse with ""a history of fainting"" to be the focal point of a vaccine push. They no response to hundreds of Facebook messages on her profile. The bit about privacy seems odd given that she stepped up to be the 'face' of the vaccine promo video. Surely a simple quick interview could confirm she is still alive?"
1134,nhb1zIYXUP8,I call b.s.. If they knew she had fainting problems. They wouldn't have chosen her for a live injection.
1135,nhb1zIYXUP8,"Everyone is missing the point.   She has not been infected with ""UNNAMED INFECTION"" since this shot, so it works, yes?"
1136,nhb1zIYXUP8,It's amazing that they say this is ok. People are literally giving up free real estate in their bodies and experience muscle death and nerve damage and this is somehow ok?
1137,nhb1zIYXUP8,Let’s hear that from her on camera in a safe place
1138,nhb1zIYXUP8,Can you please show the whole clip of this? Where she (the nurse) says she is prone to fainting? And that this is NOT the vaccines fault?

1174,It7VNzhAqOs,"When I had my vac at a pharmacy I asked if they could aspirate and the person said they were not trained to do that, I would have to go to a nurse for vaccination.

1175,It7VNzhAqOs,My mum had a blood clot that travelled through her heart damaging some valves then to her brain almost killing her but instead causing permanent brain damage and a stroke.i was one of the first 500 to survive the original strain of covid and to be absolutely honest I'd have it a thousand times if it meant having the mum I used to know back.i feel for the countless others who haven't been so lucky and say with absolute certainty I'd rather weather the storm and hopefully fight and win over covid than lose myself in a single dose
1176,It7VNzhAqOs,For the first time in history the ineffectiveness of a vaccine being blamed on those who haven't taken it.
1177,It7VNzhAqOs,"We have a moral duty not to comply. No to discriminatory vaccine passports and mandates, it is an utter disgrace. This must not happen England. Say no to this disgraceful dystopian tyranny."
1178,It7VNzhAqOs,"Same message that Dr. John Campbell in England has been sending for months now.  Aspiration should be standard practice for covid vaccinations.  WHO, CDC and others who recommend against aspiration are guilty of medical malpractice."

1180,z5lJeTjvFHU,"At first it felt like a regular shot but later in the day, my arm felt like it was going to fall off 😂

It hurt so badly lol"
1181,z5lJeTjvFHU,"I got my second shot today, it feels like someone punched me in the arm 50 times with a big ass hand! I can barely move my right arm, it really does hurt."
1182,z5lJeTjvFHU,I think “a little sore” is an understatement
1183,z5lJeTjvFHU,yo I thought I was the only one feeling this way lmao I literally can't lift my arm
1184,z5lJeTjvFHU,My shoulder feels like a restraining order was made against moving.

1186,z5lJeTjvFHU,Yeah... got my first dose of Moderna today. The injection site was sore right after which is to be expected from getting a shot but now hours later my whole arm hurts lol. If this is the worst of my symptoms I’ll count myself lucky. I’m more worried about the second shot though.
1187,z5lJeTjvFHU,"I got mine today in the morning, I was fine for about 7-8 hours. I thought my arm wouldn’t hurt but nope. 7-8 hours, it started really hurting. My arm looked a bit swollen too. I had to take Tylenol. Now it’s a bit better but I can still feel it. I hope this goes away by tmw."
1188,z5lJeTjvFHU,I got the Pfizer shot then right after my dumbass went to bench press my arm feels like it's dead 💀
1189,zL8tCKEHJ6o,I can't believe they're still trying to push this 😂
1190,zL8tCKEHJ6o,They don’t seem to talk about how natural immunity has kept people out of the hospitals…
1191,zL8tCKEHJ6o,More propaganda
1192,zL8tCKEHJ6o,Anyone who still falls for this has just self selected. Nothing more can be done for them.

1194,zL8tCKEHJ6o,"The reason why there is such a huge movement toward organic foods and ""going green"" - is because many people, including experts, know that it is really important for us to keep all types of chemicals and toxins and pharmaceuticals out of our foods and out of our bodies and out of our environment.

1195,zL8tCKEHJ6o,She really makes sense when you watch her hands as she talks. I’m sold!
1196,zL8tCKEHJ6o,Crimes against humanity!
1197,zL8tCKEHJ6o,I've been fine without any of your experimental treatments.
1198,zL8tCKEHJ6o,Hello and Good day. Does this mean it will requires 2 doses and 2 booster to be safe and effective like all good mRNA vaccines. And given the 4 year AIDS are parents recommending it for their children ?

1230,YhMlZczq4Ns,"When I got the first 2 doses of the pzifer vaccine, I had minor aches and pains, headache, and chills which went away within a few hours of getting the vaccine. However when I got the pzifer booster and flu shot, I was miserable, all of those side effects were so strong. Aches and pains, and headache was horrible and lasted for a couple of days for me. Never want to go through that again. Was horrible."

Mine started 3 days after and now I have breast cancer as a result 2 years to the month later. It will likely be 50 years or so before the truth comes out but I'm telling you this is going to affect generations to come. One of the worst mass humanitarian crimes ever committed. And if still keeps going. Thank you for standing up for us
1243,RyT3veZRMcg,We tried to tell them and they wouldn't listen
1244,RyT3veZRMcg,NO ONE regrets not getting it.
1245,RyT3veZRMcg,"They knew, many scientists and medical professionals spoke out at public meetings and wrote countless letters to politicians advising against the shots."
1246,RyT3veZRMcg,The local news reporting on c19 v a x injuries?? Noooo way!!!
1247,RyT3veZRMcg,"As a person who is dealing with injuries from it, CICP only covers medical bills, loss of employment, or death. Not a life altering issues resulting from it. I was told the VA will cover it when I retire from the military. My prescription to keep my platelets from bottoming out costs $3-4000 a bottle. If I wasn’t in the military there’s no way I could pay that every month."
1248,RyT3veZRMcg,"And guess who's going to foot the bill..  
Yup, taxpayers!  
But those responsible for the injuries should pay!  
How many 100billions of dollars did big pharma and the governments make off the tax payer funded 💉? 
And they are only Asking $15 million?  
That's pennies ... 

Big pharma needs to pay!"
1249,J9KROxs4uKc,"“If you have to be persuaded, reminded, pressured, lied to, incentivized, coerced, bullied, socially shamed, guilt-tripped, threatened, punished and criminalized .... If all of this is considered necessary to gain your compliance -- you can be absolutely certain that what is being promoted is not in your best interest.” - Ian Watson"
1250,J9KROxs4uKc,"What about private flights?
Are they also mandated to the same testrictions that commercial flights are doing?"
1251,J9KROxs4uKc,"NO problem for me, i don't fly."
1252,J9KROxs4uKc,"Also take into account how much that COVID test will cost you in an international country! I knew someone traveling back from Spain that paid close to $150 for a test. Whether it was available for free or not, I don’t know, but she searched and couldn’t find it for free. Price varies per country."
1253,J9KROxs4uKc,"""Show me your papers"".....just like Hitler."
1254,J9KROxs4uKc,So do we need to take the vaccine to travel or just a negative covid test a day before traveling?
1255,J9KROxs4uKc,"The guy just said the exception for children still requires them to get a covid test 24 hours before flying...that's the same rule for  adults, so I don't understand why he said there was an exception for children?"
1256,J9KROxs4uKc,"700 likes, 60 dislikes, and not a single comment seems to approve of this video. Hmmm... 🤔"
1257,J9KROxs4uKc,They said two weeks ago that starting in the beginning of next year all airports and other countries will have to show your vaccine book in order to travel the world.
1258,J9KROxs4uKc,"But the people at the border aren't being tested and flown into different states through private charter planes. Just obey, don't question."
1259,LXDH-xKIk0A,The only shocking part of this is seeing it on mainstream media.
1260,LXDH-xKIk0A,"If you are an MD or biochemist, and surprised by this, then you have officially prioritized your political leanings over “the science”. Lets see how many MDs in 5 years can say that repeatedly vaccinating and boosting everyone (not just those with major health concerns) was a good idea…..especially 5-11 year olds."
1261,LXDH-xKIk0A,"This occurrence is not only not new, it was predicted as a strong possibility and cautioned about with regards the mRNA transfection inoculations by many prominent virologists and immunologist right from the start. Doctors were shadowbanned if they tried to talk about it. The two hosts do look a little unsettled. I would love to know what was said in Amy Roach's ear piece as they quickly went to commercial. ""That's very important information. We appreciated it. Thank you very much."""
1262,LXDH-xKIk0A,Hold the line Pureblood's 🤝
1263,LXDH-xKIk0A,The truth will always emerge no matter how much the truth was suppressed from day one.
1264,LXDH-xKIk0A,They are telling you they don't know the outcome of the shot .
1265,LXDH-xKIk0A,Why do we expect any dose to be any different it’s the same thing lol.
1266,LXDH-xKIk0A,"""Antibody levels, which are associated with protection against infection and disease, fell within weeks of getting the shots and were much lower than the level of antibodies specific to the original and delta coronavirus variants, the researchers said."" 

But that fourth one. That'll change everything! 🙄"
1267,LXDH-xKIk0A,I can't wait until the 100th dose.
1268,LXDH-xKIk0A,If we comply with this our compliance means we never get out of this mess
1269,d3yk1FKFeqI,The truth is finally starting to surface.
1270,d3yk1FKFeqI,"So, glad I didnt get any of the vackses! And, I wish no one had, as well! Something comes up every year(multiple negative developments) as to why this was such a nightmarishly bad idea! It's just been 2 years and symptoms began to show after the first victims took it! But, these things may be the least of their worries!  I also hope that it was only medicul and not spiritual(Rev 13 and 14)! I surely hope so!"
1271,d3yk1FKFeqI,Does anyone remember when they struck people off the transplant list for not getting the jab?
1272,d3yk1FKFeqI,"we tried to warn you.
you called us ""conspiracy theorist."""
1273,d3yk1FKFeqI,We was trying to tell y’all….
1274,d3yk1FKFeqI,Never got that toxic dangerous shot and I never will!
1275,d3yk1FKFeqI,That means it's doing it's job.
1276,d3yk1FKFeqI,Never got the shot…. This unfortunate for lots of people
1277,d3yk1FKFeqI,"And to think, some patients are denied a transplant unless they take the shot. Make it make sense please!!!!"
1278,d3yk1FKFeqI,I took myself off the organ donor list last year.......I refuse to give anything that would go to a vaxxed
1279,CjzZOM6kGZg,This aged like a choc ice after a thousand years in a blast furnace.
1280,CjzZOM6kGZg,Elton needs to watch UK Column News!
1281,CjzZOM6kGZg,The B.S. never stops.  At least with these ads we know who is who.
1282,CjzZOM6kGZg,What a great doctor!

""That was me, acting."" lol 😆"
1287,CjzZOM6kGZg,This just proves that they used every weapon they could on the public to push this jab.
1288,CjzZOM6kGZg,there might of been a time celebrity had some influence but that world is gone
1289,GtYNX69Abv0,It almost sounds like it's safe enough and tested enough that the manufacturers can start accepting liability for it 😮
1290,GtYNX69Abv0,If the vaccine companies are so confident the vaccines are so safe then lift the waiver forms and have them liable for any major side effects when they occur that impacts the  longer term of quality of life for those who take it!
1291,GtYNX69Abv0,"The safest thing you can do in this pandemic is whatever the mainstream media tells you to do ,  flip it 180° and do that. . ."

1294,GtYNX69Abv0,"Anyone want to explain why corporations have zero liability no matter what with their ""vaccines""?"
1295,GtYNX69Abv0,I personally know a woman who got the vaccine while she was pregnant and the baby developed myocarditis  in the womb.
1296,GtYNX69Abv0,"Well, I've had the call I was expecting,  but hoping wouldn't come.  My friend's 24 year old jabbed daughter has just been for a scan and has been told her 24 week old baby has died. She's now going to have to give birth.  I have given them all the information I could over the last 3 years about the dangers of what Government and NHS has been pushing, but I'm the one brain washed. I even spoke about the spike in still births since March/April 2021. Sooo frustrating."
1297,GtYNX69Abv0,"How to be a good citizen:

2. Comply without thinking.
3. Worship authority.
4. Have blind faith in government.
5. Have absolute trust in mainstream media.
6. Never question official narratives."
1298,GtYNX69Abv0,"Why there are so many cases in australia, us, uk with over 80% of vaccinated???"
1299,iiWCZDEjjKw,"Mom always told me "" Just because everyone else is doing something, doesn't mean you have to""....... words of wisdom."
1300,iiWCZDEjjKw,If you’re young and healthy it just isn’t worth the risk. Period.
1301,iiWCZDEjjKw,I’ve never heard anyone talk so casually about side effects and people still line up to get the jab... unbelievable
1302,iiWCZDEjjKw,"""If you or someone you know has received the Covid 19 vaccine you may be entitled to compensation."""

1305,iiWCZDEjjKw,its crazy how people still listen to the news
1306,iiWCZDEjjKw,"News segment did not mention the health conditions of the 18 affected prior to receiving the vaccine.  Lumped the number 18 together with teens and young adults.  Could be 1 teen and 17 YA or 17 teens and 1 YA.  Did not classify what is considered a young adult.  Did not mention the amount of vaccines administered to this age group.  While my sympathies go to the affected no matter how big or small the number, this segment is too vague for me to form an understanding opinion on the matter."
1307,iiWCZDEjjKw,"I would consider this ""news"" to be a public health announcement and legal disclaimer made on behalf of the pharmaceutical companies: ""hey we told you so, cant say you didnt know"""
1308,iiWCZDEjjKw,The fact that they are being forced to report this shows that its much worse out there than we think

1319,tYJkhp8lGho,looks like they accidentally found a vaccine for Kardashians
1320,tYJkhp8lGho,Wait everyone being critical of cosmetic procedures. A lot of people have heart valve replacement with either a synthetic valve or that of a pig which to the immune system would be considered foreign. Some people have joint replacement which is also synthetic. A very important question is how is this going to affect those millions of Americans?
1321,tYJkhp8lGho,This is actually the best news I've heard all year. I'm tired of most celebrities.

1517,O0-PaP4RhFQ,"In examining data provided by a television broadcast of some time ago conducted by the journalist Formigli, on ""La 7"", I saw something in a graph that contrasts with the official narrative provided by public institutions and the press throughout the world on handling the Covid-19 epidemic.

In the graph, many countries were compared in terms of deaths from Covid for million inhabitants, including two neighboring countries, namely Brazil and Argentina. As you know, Bolsonaro, president of Brazil, was harshly criticized for refusing to subject the population to lockdowns and other restrictive measures to fight the virus, contrary to what did instead Fernandez, President of Argentina, who, in addition to an eight-month lockdown, has imposed restrictions and impositions of all kinds on the population, with serious consequences for the economy of that country. The comparison that emerges from the graph is therefore surprising:

1) Brazil - Covid deaths per million inhabitants = 786
2) Argentina - Covid deaths per million inhabitants = 801

First of all, I note that the data contrasts with what was disseminated by the media around the world, namely the thousands of deaths that were attributed to Bolsonaro for not having adopted the anticovid measures advocated by the more ""advanced"" countries against the virus, which instead in the graph, they appear even lower than those of a neighboring country like Argentina, which had instead adopted all the restrictive anticovid measures. So, according to this graph,  published by a television channel notoriously favorable to anticovid measures, restrictions and lockdowns are not useful tools to prevent the spread of the disease and save people's lives.

Doubt arises that the question concerns exclusively the serious insufficiency of the health systems in dealing with this epidemic, and that all the restrictive measures imposed on populations all over the world have served and will only serve to destroy the social and economic fabric of the various countries."

1538,IGqDGeDssmY,"I just spent 4 hours reading the comment section. It is amazing and inspiring to see so many women share, discuss, correlate & analyse the situation going on with these vaccines at the moment. As a person with Endo, whose painful period symptoms were never taken seriously by doctors, it was incredible to hear so many women speak their truth loud and proud.  We deserve a healthcare system that doesn't exploit us !

Please remember that: 
1. Menstrual/fertility issues are SERIOUS - they could have long term effects, or cause death, not just disrupted periods
2. Most want to dismiss us because they are conditioned to think these side effects are super rare, when they are not
3. If this report by Vice is not taken seriously, if they continue to dismiss all these cases as anecdotal, the only solution would be for all of us to unite together as women of all races and religions and fight Big Pharma to its death. For our men too, they will thank us later.

Stay strong, stay healthy ! Support good, caring local doctors, you know who they are !"

1590,sPOMCrV3dG4,Why would you keep getting shots if they're not working for you? Your risks with all those different shots will probably be worse then the benefit.
1591,sPOMCrV3dG4,Well I hope they use her as a case study for the original failed shots. Praying for her safety and health
1592,sPOMCrV3dG4,"the media is freaking people out. i feel bad for her, she shouldn't have to live  like this"
1593,sPOMCrV3dG4,"No surprise, one person i know managed to get 4."
1594,sPOMCrV3dG4,"Bless her heart, I pray she stays well."
1595,sPOMCrV3dG4,"I wonder if this was recommended by her physician. I worked in the medical field and from what we studied, antibodies may usually take about weeks upto months to develop. And I'm just wondering, what does she mean by ""no immesurable antibodies?"" Is it completely 0 and how long did she have the antibody test after getting the vaccine? This is not meant to judge her but as someone who studied serology/immunology this is rather a ""weird"" case. I get it that she's *immunocompromised* but all the more you cant just introduced antibodies like that esp multiple times in a short period of time. Based also from experience, my aunt didnt know she has breast cancer and started feeling sick after 2 weeks of her 1st shot. From there, her health declined tremendously and died after 1.5months. We consulted the physician regarding this but told us that it was almost impossible to prove that it was caused by the vaccine as no study yet can support our claim. Hoping that this woman would remain safe and healthy as Covid can really be a big blow to unvaxxed seniors, immunocompromised, overweight and those with comorbidites. Keep safe everyone. ❤"
1596,sPOMCrV3dG4,"I cannot imagine what she's going through, no immune response. So scary"
1597,sPOMCrV3dG4,"She's targeting the get 7 shots get free pizza or get 10, get a planner Lol. But i do hope she gets the anti bodies to better defend against covid19"
1598,sPOMCrV3dG4,She is going to be the last boss in Resident Evil 9.
1599,bpzd74_gZJk,"It must be an absolute miracle .. 72 years old, overweight, still here, well and healthy after NOT having the vaccine, NOT having had covid and NOT listening to the propaganda!!"
1600,bpzd74_gZJk,"A lot of people in Canada lost their jobs for refusing covid shots, including nurses, and doctors, never let anyone take your freedom of choice."
1601,bpzd74_gZJk,Now the healthcare employers should remove the mandatory vaccine certificate from the job requirements. Let the sacked employees get a compensation.
1602,bpzd74_gZJk,The discrimination that happened was wrong. They need to pay and be held accountable 🇨🇦
1603,bpzd74_gZJk,"Hi John, it's winter over here and the government has been pushing the dual flu / covid shot.  That said, we believe that the number of people vaccinated is far less than the governments were stating as far too many people we know are quite awake to all the alarm bells (right from day one).  I have a unique story to tell about my Father who passed away last September in a NZ covid ward.  He was diagnosed with crohn's disease before the pandemic, then was pushed out and out for surgery.  It was degrading for him and so incredibly sad to see what was happening.  Then they agreed to do surgery last September due to quality of life issues.   He caught covid whilst in hospital (he was triple vaccinated by the way).  Then isolated from everyone including his wife, his children.  We were not allowed to speak to him, we were not allowed to call him, nor visit him as he was placed in the ""Red Ward"".   He was administered Paxlovid then appeared to get better then rapidly declined.  We were asked to come in and say our good byes.   They dressed us in full PPE and when we saw him, he was hallucinating as all fluids had been stopped.   After 20 mins, I removed all my PPE and stayed that way and with him for 5 nights until he passed away on the 6th day.   I was unvaccinated and never caught covid.  Not one doctor, surgeon or nurse told me to put my mask back on in those 6 days.   That's the NZ we live in where our then PM told everyone to be kind, team of 5 million.  The politicians have blood on their hands as we are awake, we won't forgive, we won't forget."
1604,bpzd74_gZJk,"I m from the USA. COVID is the least of our problems but I have to say shame, shame on all the doctors that are still pushing this poison. One day you will have to answer for this treatment."
1605,bpzd74_gZJk,Biggest crime against humanity in human history we need JUSTICE
1606,bpzd74_gZJk,"whenever you're forced to do something, you should ALWAYS question WHY"
1607,bpzd74_gZJk,"The most unfortunate outcome from the covid vaccine fiasco (to put it nicely) is that now lots of people including myself have no faith in the medical industry, I personally don't know anyone that would get a booster shot or get another vaccine of any kind, and are reluctant to see a doctor for anything at all. Thank you Dr John for all that you do to keep us informed about what is going on."
1608,bpzd74_gZJk,"Do you know what is beautiful? 💮 The fact that this comment section is full of people who understand each other. Who you can tell about your experiences, bad moments, job loss and heath problems. And people will always tell you a good word. We should create mini-organisations and meetings around our towns. Be in touch with people of many proffesions (good doctors, farmers). This is what they will never take away from us. We are here from all the world. 🌍 Greetings fron Poland 😘😘"
1609,8aAk36PovnU,"If she hadn't said that she's not telling people to not get the vaccine, we would have never seen her story on the news."
1610,8aAk36PovnU,"5 people I know from our hometown who are very healthy and strong suddenly passed away after the getting the vaccine,their families are shocked. May they rest in peace."
1611,8aAk36PovnU,kudos to the news Station that had the BALLS TO DO THIS STORY
1612,8aAk36PovnU,discrimination against the unvaccinated must stop!!!
1613,8aAk36PovnU,"Shame on Pfizer for their response. 
Pray for this mother everyone 🙏"
1614,8aAk36PovnU,Pfizer should pay for all her medical and living expense. Also pay for pain and suffering. This is criminal. Even if it is only one person but there are hundreds of thousands of cases but they are covered up. WHY?
1615,8aAk36PovnU,I wouldn’t buy a car from a company that has no liability for manufacturing of it
1616,8aAk36PovnU,"To all God fearing believers out there… let’s all get on our knees and pray for her to be healed and restored completely by Gods Mercy and Grace. It says in the Bible… where there are two or more in agreement,  “there I Am” (Jesus). To all my sisters and brothers out there, let’s all come into agreement for her healing on our knees in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. She will be healed in the name of Jesus. Thank you my heavenly for hearing our prayers and thank you for your Glory that’s about to be revealed in her life and her family’s life also. There is nothing to great for our God! Believe it, claim it with authority and speak out every day until it’s done. God bless you and your family! His Angel’s are with you also every day. Believe and receive and don’t stop believing. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"
1617,8aAk36PovnU,"Lord,I pray she's able to get back to being herself & walking on her on,this broke my heart to hear this about this lady. Lord help us all we need you now. 🙏🏼"
1618,8aAk36PovnU,I love how the media keeps saying this is extremely rare
1619,z8cYMT3ds4o,"Why don't they mandate eating your vegetables, getting 9 hours of sleep, and exercise daily?"
1620,z8cYMT3ds4o,"If anyone ""forces"" anything on me, I will defend myself to my last dying breath."
1621,z8cYMT3ds4o,"""Employer can force an employee to get vaccinated.""  So... what happens if the employee is harmed by the vaccine?  Will the employer pay for the employee's medical bills?  I don't think so..."
1622,z8cYMT3ds4o,"A year later, I still haven't been jabbed. Get over yourself, CNBC."
1623,z8cYMT3ds4o,"When I was a 21 yr old young man, I asked a 101 yr old lady once, ""what's the key to living so long?"". She looked right at me with a serious face and said ""stay away from the Drs"". Lol. So true."
1624,z8cYMT3ds4o,I identify as a fully unvaccinated person. Sobriety is happiness.
1625,z8cYMT3ds4o,"I will never, ever understand why people actually think the government EVER has your best interests at heart."
1626,z8cYMT3ds4o,*I just got my first shot and I'll be getting my 2nd shot as soon as the bartender comes back.*
1627,z8cYMT3ds4o,"“If you have to be persuaded, reminded pressured, lied to, incentivized, coerced, bullied, socially shamed, guilt-tripped, threatened, punished and criminalized ... If all of this is considered necessary to gain your compliance -- you can be absolutely certain that what is being promoted is not in your best interest.” - Ian Watson"
1628,z8cYMT3ds4o,"""Force"" is a strong word. Three words: The Nuremburg Code"
1629,3XTzk9RouSY,It's sad to see that covid became so politicized. It should have been a fight that united people against a common struggle
1630,3XTzk9RouSY,"I just wanna say thank you to most of the comments for being cordial. I wish we could be United more like this. I hate constantly arguing with the other side when I know a lot are good people. So, again, it’s just finally nice to see a lot of compassionate comments."
1631,3XTzk9RouSY,"I was going to post a statement that was just down right mean.
Then I thought off all those that I know personally who've had covid-19, and are still having a hard time recovering from it.
I can't say anything mean after thinking of those people.
This illness should never have become politicized.
Be safe everyone."
1632,3XTzk9RouSY,When politics gets involved in medicine someone will pay the price!
1633,3XTzk9RouSY,"The worst part is that no matter who you are and what you believe, when you die from this, you die alone."
1634,3XTzk9RouSY,Something was done to her.  This is suspicious.
1635,3XTzk9RouSY,Saying she was outspoken about vaccines and saying you don't know if she was vaxxed is kind of ironic
1636,3XTzk9RouSY,My heart goes out to all those who have lost someone to this virus whether they were unvaccinated or vaccinated.
1637,3XTzk9RouSY,So many lost and many more to come.  Everyone do what ever you can in your power to prevent this from happening to your love ones .
1638,3XTzk9RouSY,"You know how people often say, ""If you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all?"""
1639,5yz0GhZ7q4k,This pope is like the booster shot to the world vaccine mandatory. When is he going to retire? can't wait !
1640,5yz0GhZ7q4k,"The Pope, Bill Gates, and the CEO of Disney pushing it. With that crowd I think I’ll pass."
1641,5yz0GhZ7q4k,"It has abominations in it like chimera,  CRISPR, LUCIFERASE,  HEK-293,  & GRAPHITE"
1642,5yz0GhZ7q4k,I can only pray for and love my enemy… it is very hard when my enemy is the Pope himself :(
1643,5yz0GhZ7q4k,Dont take the SnakeBYTE!
1644,5yz0GhZ7q4k,"Hes confused alright. Theres only one mediator between God and man, and it aint him."
1645,5yz0GhZ7q4k,The men of sin!
1646,5yz0GhZ7q4k,He should visit Brussels
1647,5yz0GhZ7q4k,Failed
1648,5yz0GhZ7q4k,Je vous souhaite bonne chance pour une vie heureuse dans votre famille et en toutes choses et ce monde était comme ça
1649,Kmwojz0T8W0,"I literally cant stop working out its a need for me ill go insane if i stop more than 2 days the gym was there for me when i needed it the most, it is my comfort place as you can say"
1650,Kmwojz0T8W0,"This message is very important to me, coz as a sport science student who get used to exercising regularly."
1651,Kmwojz0T8W0,"Short answer yes you can workout, but if you don't feel right just take a break for a day or two and you should be fine to hit new PR's"
1652,Kmwojz0T8W0,I did workout but my entire body started shaking right after . I've never experienced this before. I think it just depends on the person
1653,Kmwojz0T8W0,2 weeks?? Bruh ima wait like a day or two. No way I'm waiting 2 weeks
1654,Kmwojz0T8W0,I worked out a few hours after my second dose of Moderna and I felt okay but my body did feel a little heavier and it was more difficult than usual. The next day I was 100% okay!
1655,Kmwojz0T8W0,"I went to the gym today after my first shot. I was the only one wearing a mask. Which you should do (the video doesn’t say this), until two weeks after your second shot."
1656,Kmwojz0T8W0,"Went to the gym 2hrs after my first dose, didnt really have any effects. Cause i think ill get sick if i stay at home and lay in bed."
1657,Kmwojz0T8W0,"I did a workout right after in the sun ,felt great"
1658,Kmwojz0T8W0,"Is it okay to drink any workout supplements after the shot?

Edit* I just got vaccinated and the doctor said yes, idk for the peds"
1659,PM5cfmcP7Kg,I’d like to meet the person who finally decides to get the vaccine because Family Guy told them to.
1660,PM5cfmcP7Kg,Quagmire is the one I trust about viruses and infections. He's got to be an expert by now.
1661,PM5cfmcP7Kg,"So now thats been 5 months, when do we get the episode where Peter gets blood cloths?"
1662,PM5cfmcP7Kg,Still waiting for Elmo’s and the Cookie Monster’s take on the vaccine before I make my final decision
1663,PM5cfmcP7Kg,Feels like im in kindergarten again watching PSA's on PBSKids
1664,PM5cfmcP7Kg,"Just remember, Stewie impregnated himself with dog DNA, so you can really trust him as a medical expert"
1665,PM5cfmcP7Kg,But what does Mr. Krabs think about the vaccine? He's the only public figure I trust.
1666,PM5cfmcP7Kg,I'll wait to find out what Ren & Stimpy think
1667,PM5cfmcP7Kg,Yeah… let’s revisit this 5 years from now…
1668,PM5cfmcP7Kg,He would choose the two characters who can’t even get the vaccine😂
1669,l6mTAJ08aUI,Biggest crime ever perpetrated against the people.
1670,l6mTAJ08aUI,There's a reason why it normally takes 10 to 15 years - it's called trials. Instead they've decided to early trial it on the entire UK population
1671,l6mTAJ08aUI,It was won due to the amount of people who cannot think for themselves. We are so easily influenced and manipulated.
1672,l6mTAJ08aUI,Why did you guys remove the part where the HIV protein was used in the making of the so called vaccine?
1673,l6mTAJ08aUI,Genocide - Ivermectin has already shown the shot wasn’t required
1674,l6mTAJ08aUI,Why edit out the part where you explain you used HIV as a clamp for the spike protein?
1675,l6mTAJ08aUI,You took out the part where you used H.I.V in the spike protien!!!
1676,l6mTAJ08aUI,the 10 - to 15 years is the testing period to make sure it is safe
1677,l6mTAJ08aUI,At this point if you still have the ability to think for yourself then you're not going crazy.
1678,l6mTAJ08aUI,This is missing the part about HIV.
1679,2XVCPdPAUbA,"""My body, my choice.""  Remember when they used to say that?  They're not using that argument much anymore."
1680,2XVCPdPAUbA,"Big Brother doesn't like it when individuals say ""no""."
1681,2XVCPdPAUbA,"Benjamin Franklin once said: ""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."""
1682,2XVCPdPAUbA,When my school had the D.A.R.E. program I was taught not to experiment with drugs.
1683,2XVCPdPAUbA,“Give up rights for the collective good”. Did you seriously just say that?  No thank you comrade!
1684,2XVCPdPAUbA,Then the employer needs to sign a liability clause if they mandate it. How many employers do you think would mandate it if they were liable for any consequence resulting from the vaccine?
1685,2XVCPdPAUbA,It's only a job. Don't sell your soul for a job. It will be the same for everyone soon
1686,2XVCPdPAUbA,"This mandate is absolutely outrageous!  It is unprecedented.  Where is the outrage and protest—-if you choose to vaccinate—fine, it’s is your choice, if you choose not to vaccinate that choice should be respected as well-without the threat of taking away your livelihood!"
1687,2XVCPdPAUbA,"They can mandate it all day long, but remember the government isn't going to bail you out when you go under."
1688,2XVCPdPAUbA,"""I think a lot of fedral agencies are well intentioned."" ~The part where I stopped watching."
1689,XHfRpNJI0c8,I’m surprised she had friends to begin with
1690,XHfRpNJI0c8,One thing that the last few years of this global madness has told me is that I really dont need celebrities in my life. Doing much better without these over paid goons.
1691,XHfRpNJI0c8,"Imagine a vaccine so safe, that the manufacturers needed to be given total legal immunity."
1692,XHfRpNJI0c8,Why we all unvaccinated people don’t cut ties with her movies and shows and see how far she goes.. 🤭😂😂
1693,XHfRpNJI0c8,"Somehow, I have a feeling that the people who would estrange me for being unvaccinated aren’t the people I’ll really cry about when they leave."
1694,XHfRpNJI0c8,Another way to separate people.
1695,XHfRpNJI0c8,Let’s be real. This is an actor! Who gives a shit what they say. They live in a world where reality does not exist.
1696,XHfRpNJI0c8,I’m really not understanding this. If she can get it from an unvaccinated person and she’s vaccinated then one of her vaccinated friends could get it and give it to her. The only sure solution seems to be total isolation
1697,XHfRpNJI0c8,It’s like when the wife says” It’s me or the dog” and the husband goes to the store for another box of Milkbones
1698,XHfRpNJI0c8,Talk about discrimination against the unvaccinated.
1699,wuqyRBmashA,They are STILL saying you should get this if you will otherwise stay unvaccinated!!! Absolute insanity.
1700,wuqyRBmashA,I can't believe the media is not burying this story.
1701,wuqyRBmashA,If you said this 2 years ago you were labeled a conspiracy theorist.
1702,wuqyRBmashA,"Just go to VAERS and spend a little time looking at the stats for adverse effects. The trials showed that a percentage would suffer from bad reactions but they kept quiet about it of course. The money has been made, the crime has been committed."
1703,wuqyRBmashA,Wow I can’t believe the news actually reported this
1704,wuqyRBmashA,Can't wait for the day the MSM is held accountable for this
1705,wuqyRBmashA,Negative side effects are not rare. Any vaccine developed and deemed safe in such a short period of time is not safe.  They spread so much horrible propaganda people thought they had no choice. Hopefully this lady and everyone else makes a full recovery.
1706,wuqyRBmashA,That shot aged her like 20 years in a span of weeks
1707,wuqyRBmashA,"My son has never had a vaccine ever… I got curious when they wanted to vaccinate him with the hepatitis B shot, I said “he’s a baby” he’s not having sex or sharing needles … NO THX… and my doctor paused and whispered “your doing good, keep up the research” he could only give me his professional opinion but for that slight moment his personal opinion slipped.

The next week that dr quit his job."
1708,wuqyRBmashA,What do you expect from the same company who messed up making baby powder 🤷‍♂️
